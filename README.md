  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language model (LLM)-based reasoning systems have recently achieved gold medal-level performance in the IMO 2025 competition, writing mathematical proofs where, to receive full credit, each step must be not only correct but also sufficiently supported. To train LLM-based reasoners in such challenging, open-ended settings, strong verifiers capable of catching step-level mistakes are necessary prerequisites. We introduce Hard2Verify, a human-annotated, step-level verification benchmark produced with over 500 hours of human labor. Hard2Verify is designed to rigorously assess step-level verifiers at the frontier: Verifiers must provide step-level annotations or identify the first error in responses generated by frontier LLMs for very recent, challenging, and open-ended math questions. We evaluate 29 generative critics and process reward models, demonstrating that, beyond a few standouts, open-source verifiers lag closed source models. We subsequently analyze what drives poor performance in step-level verification, the impacts of scaling verifier compute, as well as fundamental questions such as self-verification and verification-generation dynamics.

- **[From Refusal to Recovery: A Control-Theoretic Approach to Generative AI Guardrails](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13727)**  `arXiv:2510.13727`  
  _Ravi Pandya, Madison Bland, Duy P. Nguyen, Changliu Liu, Jaime Fern√°ndez Fisac, Andrea Bajcsy_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Generative AI systems are increasingly assisting and acting on behalf of end users in practical settings, from digital shopping assistants to next-generation autonomous cars. In this context, safety is no longer about blocking harmful content, but about preempting downstream hazards like financial or physical harm. Yet, most AI guardrails continue to rely on output classification based on labeled datasets and human-specified criteria,making them brittle to new hazardous situations. Even when unsafe conditions are flagged, this detection offers no path to recovery: typically, the AI system simply refuses to act--which is not always a safe choice. In this work, we argue that agentic AI safety is fundamentally a sequential decision problem: harmful outcomes arise from the AI system's continually evolving interactions and their downstream consequences on the world. We formalize this through the lens of safety-critical control theory, but within the AI model's latent representation of the world. This enables us to build predictive guardrails that (i) monitor an AI system's outputs (actions) in real time and (ii) proactively correct risky outputs to safe ones, all in a model-agnostic manner so the same guardrail can be wrapped around any AI model. We also offer a practical training recipe for computing such guardrails at scale via safety-critical reinforcement learning. Our experiments in simulated driving and e-commerce settings demonstrate that control-theoretic guardrails can reliably steer LLM agents clear of catastrophic outcomes (from collisions to bankruptcy) while preserving task performance, offering a principled dynamic alternative to today's flag-and-block guardrails.

  Assistive agents should not only take actions on behalf of a human, but also step out of the way and cede control when there are important decisions to be made. However, current methods for building assistive agents, whether via mimicking expert humans or via RL finetuning on an inferred reward, often encourage agents to complete tasks on their own rather than truly assisting the human attain their objectives. Additionally, these methods often require costly explicit human feedback to provide a training signal. We propose a new approach to tuning assistive language models based on maximizing the human's empowerment, their ability to effect desired changes in the environment. Our empowerment-maximizing method, Empower, only requires offline text data, providing a self-supervised method for fine-tuning language models to better assist humans. To study the efficacy of our approach, we conducted an 18-person user study comparing our empowerment assistant with a strong baseline. Participants preferred our assistant 78% of the time (p=0.015), with a 31% higher acceptance rate and 38% fewer suggestions. Additionally, we introduce a new environment for evaluating multi-turn code assistance using simulated humans. Using this environment, we show that agents trained with Empower increase the success rate of a simulated human programmer on challenging coding questions by an average of 192% over an SFT baseline. With this empowerment objective, we provide a framework for useful aligned AI agents at scale using only offline data without the need for any additional human feedback or verifiable rewards.

  Logic-based models can be used to build verification tools for machine learning classifiers employed in the legal field. ML classifiers predict the outcomes of new cases based on previous ones, thereby performing a form of case-based reasoning (CBR). In this paper, we introduce a modal logic of classifiers designed to formally capture legal CBR. We incorporate principles for resolving conflicts between precedents, by introducing into the logic the temporal dimension of cases and the hierarchy of courts within the legal system.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As language models continue to rapidly improve, we can expect their actions and reasoning to become difficult or impossible for weaker agents and humans to follow, undermining interpretability and oversight. With an eye on long-term futures, we pursue methods that encourage models to produce solutions that remain intelligible to weaker collaborators. We formalize intelligibility as handoff robustness: a strong model's solution is intelligible to a weaker model if randomly handing off control to the weaker model along the solution path does not cause failure. Building on this criterion, we introduce tandem training for language models, a reinforcement learning (RL) paradigm in which rollout tokens are intermittently and randomly sampled from a frozen weak model rather than the strong model being trained. Because rollouts succeed only when the strong model's actions and reasoning process can be continued by the weak model -- when the two can co-construct a successful solution -- optimizing standard RL objectives with tandem training implicitly incentivizes both correctness and intelligibility. In the GSM8K math reasoning task, tandem training reliably teaches models to abandon jargon and adapt their language to weaker partners while keeping task accuracy high. Our results demonstrate a promising route to building AI systems that remain auditable by weaker agents, with implications for human--AI collaboration and multi-agent communication.

  As Generative Artificial Intelligence is adopted across the financial services industry, a significant barrier to adoption and usage is measuring model performance. Historical machine learning metrics can oftentimes fail to generalize to GenAI workloads and are often supplemented using Subject Matter Expert (SME) Evaluation. Even in this combination, many projects fail to account for various unique risks present in choosing specific metrics. Additionally, many widespread benchmarks created by foundational research labs and educational institutions fail to generalize to industrial use. This paper explains these challenges and provides a Risk Assessment Framework to allow for better application of SME and machine learning Metrics

- **[Confidence as a Reward: Transforming LLMs into Reward Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13501)**  `arXiv:2510.13501`  
  _He Du, Bowen Li, Chengxing Xie, Chang Gao, Kai Chen, Dacheng Tao_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reward models can significantly enhance the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), but they typically require extensive curated data and costly training. To mitigate these challenges, training-free approaches such as LLM-as-a-Judge leverage the intrinsic reasoning abilities of LLMs to evaluate responses, achieving promising results. Recent works have also indicated that model confidence can serve effectively as a reward metric, distinguishing between chain-of-thought (CoT) and non-CoT paths. However, the concept of using confidence as a reward has not been comprehensively studied. In this work, we systematically investigate Confidence-as-a-Reward (CRew), a simple yet powerful training-free method that utilizes token-level confidence in the model's final answers as a proxy for reward, especially suitable for close-ended tasks. Through extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning tasks, we demonstrate that CRew outperforms existing training-free reward approaches on the MATH500 and RewardMATH benchmarks, and even surpasses most trained reward models. We further identify a strong correlation between CRew scores and the actual reasoning performance of the model. Additionally, we find that CRew can effectively filter high-quality training data. Building upon these insights, we propose CRew-DPO, a training strategy that constructs preference data from confidence scores combined with correctness signals. Finetuning with CRew-DPO further enhances the model's judging capabilities and consistently outperforms existing self-training methods.

- **[Assessing LLM Reasoning Through Implicit Causal Chain Discovery in Climate Discourse](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13417)**  `arXiv:2510.13417`  
  _Liesbeth Allein, Nataly Pineda-Casta√±eda, Andrea Rocci, Marie-Francine Moens_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  How does a cause lead to an effect, and which intermediate causal steps explain their connection? This work scrutinizes the mechanistic causal reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to answer these questions through the task of implicit causal chain discovery. In a diagnostic evaluation framework, we instruct nine LLMs to generate all possible intermediate causal steps linking given cause-effect pairs in causal chain structures. These pairs are drawn from recent resources in argumentation studies featuring polarized discussion on climate change. Our analysis reveals that LLMs vary in the number and granularity of causal steps they produce. Although they are generally self-consistent and confident about the intermediate causal connections in the generated chains, their judgments are mainly driven by associative pattern matching rather than genuine causal reasoning. Nonetheless, human evaluations confirmed the logical coherence and integrity of the generated chains. Our baseline causal chain discovery approach, insights from our diagnostic evaluation, and benchmark dataset with causal chains lay a solid foundation for advancing future work in implicit, mechanistic causal reasoning in argumentation settings.

- **[Learnable Game-theoretic Policy Optimization for Data-centric Self-explanation Rationalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13393)**  `arXiv:2510.13393`  
  _Yunxiao Zhao, Zhiqiang Wang, Xingtong Yu, Xiaoli Li, Jiye Liang, Ru Li_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Rationalization, a data-centric framework, aims to build self-explanatory models to explain the prediction outcome by generating a subset of human-intelligible pieces of the input data. It involves a cooperative game model where a generator generates the most human-intelligible parts of the input (i.e., rationales), followed by a predictor that makes predictions based on these generated rationales. Conventional rationalization methods typically impose constraints via regularization terms to calibrate or penalize undesired generation. However, these methods are suffering from a problem called mode collapse, in which the predictor produces correct predictions yet the generator consistently outputs rationales with collapsed patterns. Moreover, existing studies are typically designed separately for specific collapsed patterns, lacking a unified consideration. In this paper, we systematically revisit cooperative rationalization from a novel game-theoretic perspective and identify the fundamental cause of this problem: the generator no longer tends to explore new strategies to uncover informative rationales, ultimately leading the system to converge to a suboptimal game equilibrium (correct predictions v.s collapsed rationales). To solve this problem, we then propose a novel approach, Game-theoretic Policy Optimization oriented RATionalization (PORAT), which progressively introduces policy interventions to address the game equilibrium in the cooperative game process, thereby guiding the model toward a more optimal solution state. We theoretically analyse the cause of such a suboptimal equilibrium and prove the feasibility of the proposed method. Furthermore, we validate our method on nine widely used real-world datasets and two synthetic settings, where PORAT achieves up to 8.1% performance improvements over existing state-of-the-art methods.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MADRL) has shown potential for cooperative and competitive tasks such as autonomous driving and strategic gaming. However, models trained by MADRL are vulnerable to adversarial perturbations on states and actions. Therefore, it is essential to investigate the robustness of MADRL models from an attack perspective. Existing studies focus on either state-only attacks or action-only attacks, but do not consider how to effectively joint them. Simply combining state and action perturbations such as randomly perturbing states and actions does not exploit their potential synergistic effects. In this paper, we propose the State-Action Joint Attack (SAJA) framework that has a good synergistic effects. SAJA consists of two important phases: (1) In the state attack phase, a multi-step gradient ascent method utilizes both the actor network and the critic network to compute an adversarial state, and (2) in the action attack phase, based on the perturbed state, a second gradient ascent uses the critic network to craft the final adversarial action. Additionally, a heuristic regularizer measuring the distance between the perturbed actions and the original clean ones is added into the loss function to enhance the effectiveness of the critic's guidance. We evaluate SAJA in the Multi-Agent Particle Environment (MPE), demonstrating that (1) it outperforms and is more stealthy than state-only or action-only attacks, and (2) existing state or action defense methods cannot defend its attacks.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The driving environment perception has a vital role for autonomous driving and nowadays has been actively explored for its realization. The research community and relevant stakeholders necessitate the development of Deep Learning (DL) models and AI-enabled solutions to enhance autonomous vehicles (AVs) for smart mobility. There is a need to develop a model that accurately perceives multiple objects on the road and predicts the driver's perception to control the car's movements. This article proposes a novel utility-based analytical model that enables perception systems of AVs to understand the driving environment. The article consists of modules: acquiring a custom dataset having distinctive objects, i.e., motorcyclists, rickshaws, etc; a DL-based model (YOLOv8s) for object detection; and a module to measure the utility of perception service from the performance values of trained model instances. The perception model is validated based on the object detection task, and its process is benchmarked by state-of-the-art deep learning models' performance metrics from the nuScense dataset. The experimental results show three best-performing YOLOv8s instances based on mAP@0.5 values, i.e., SGD-based (0.832), Adam-based (0.810), and AdamW-based (0.822). However, the AdamW-based model (i.e., car: 0.921, motorcyclist: 0.899, truck: 0.793, etc.) still outperforms the SGD-based model (i.e., car: 0.915, motorcyclist: 0.892, truck: 0.781, etc.) because it has better class-level performance values, confirmed by the proposed perception model. We validate that the proposed function is capable of finding the right perception for AVs. The results above encourage using the proposed perception model to evaluate the utility of learning models and determine the appropriate perception for AVs.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  A fundamental limitation of current AI agents is their inability to learn complex skills on the fly at test time, often behaving like "clever but clueless interns" in novel environments. This severely limits their practical utility. To systematically measure and drive progress on this challenge, we first introduce the Jericho Test-Time Learning (J-TTL) benchmark. J-TTL is a new evaluation setup where an agent must play the same game for several consecutive episodes, attempting to improve its performance from one episode to the next. On J-TTL, we find that existing adaptation methods like reflection, memory, or reinforcement learning struggle. To address the challenges posed by our benchmark, we present EvoTest, an evolutionary test-time learning framework that improves an agent without any fine-tuning or gradients-by evolving the entire agentic system after every episode. EvoTest has two roles: the Actor Agent, which plays the game, and the Evolver Agent, which analyzes the episode transcript to propose a revised configuration for the next run. This configuration rewrites the prompt, updates memory by logging effective state-action choices, tunes hyperparameters, and learns the tool-use routines. On our J-TTL benchmark, EvoTest consistently increases performance, outperforming not only reflection and memory-only baselines but also more complex online fine-tuning methods. Notably, our method is the only one capable of winning two games (Detective and Library), while all baselines fail to win any.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Personalized Learning Path Planning (PLPP) aims to design adaptive learning paths that align with individual goals. While large language models (LLMs) show potential in personalizing learning experiences, existing approaches often lack mechanisms for goal-aligned planning. We introduce Pxplore, a novel framework for PLPP that integrates a reinforcement-based training paradigm and an LLM-driven educational architecture. We design a structured learner state model and an automated reward function that transforms abstract objectives into computable signals. We train the policy combining supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), and deploy it within a real-world learning platform. Extensive experiments validate Pxplore's effectiveness in producing coherent, personalized, and goal-driven learning paths. We release our code and dataset to facilitate future research.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate that chain-of-thought prompting and deep reasoning substantially enhance performance on complex tasks, and multi-agent systems can further improve accuracy by enabling model debates. However, applying deep reasoning to all problems is computationally expensive. To mitigate these costs, we propose a complementary agent system integrating small and large LLMs. The small LLM first generates an initial answer, which is then verified by the large LLM. If correct, the answer is adopted directly; otherwise, the large LLM performs in-depth reasoning. Experimental results show that, for simple problems, our approach reduces the computational cost of the large LLM by more than 50% with negligible accuracy loss, while consistently maintaining robust performance on complex tasks.

- **[Emotional Cognitive Modeling Framework with Desire-Driven Objective Optimization for LLM-empowered Agent in Social Simulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13195)**  `arXiv:2510.13195`  
  _Qun Ma, Xiao Xue, Xuwen Zhang, Zihan Zhao, Yuwei Guo, Ming Zhang_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The advent of large language models (LLMs) has enabled agents to represent virtual humans in societal simulations, facilitating diverse interactions within complex social systems. However, existing LLM-based agents exhibit severe limitations in affective cognition: They fail to simulate the bounded rationality essential for bridging virtual and real-world services; They lack empirically validated integration mechanisms embedding emotions within agent decision architectures. This paper constructs an emotional cognition framework incorporating desire generation and objective management, designed to achieve emotion alignment between LLM-based agents and humans, modeling the complete decision-making process of LLM-based agents, encompassing state evolution, desire generation, objective optimization, decision generation, and action execution. This study implements the proposed framework within our proprietary multi-agent interaction environment. Experimental results demonstrate that agents governed by our framework not only exhibit behaviors congruent with their emotional states but also, in comparative assessments against other agent types, demonstrate superior ecological validity and generate decision outcomes that significantly more closely approximate human behavioral patterns.

- **[Repairing Reward Functions with Human Feedback to Mitigate Reward Hacking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13036)**  `arXiv:2510.13036`  
  _Stephane Hatgis-Kessell, Logan Mondal Bhamidipaty, Emma Brunskill_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Human-designed reward functions for reinforcement learning (RL) agents are frequently misaligned with the humans' true, unobservable objectives, and thus act only as proxies. Optimizing for a misspecified proxy reward function often induces reward hacking, resulting in a policy misaligned with the human's true objectives. An alternative is to perform RL from human feedback, which involves learning a reward function from scratch by collecting human preferences over pairs of trajectories. However, building such datasets is costly. To address the limitations of both approaches, we propose Preference-Based Reward Repair (PBRR): an automated iterative framework that repairs a human-specified proxy reward function by learning an additive, transition-dependent correction term from preferences. A manually specified reward function can yield policies that are highly suboptimal under the ground-truth objective, yet corrections on only a few transitions may suffice to recover optimal performance. To identify and correct for those transitions, PBRR uses a targeted exploration strategy and a new preference-learning objective. We prove in tabular domains PBRR has a cumulative regret that matches, up to constants, that of prior preference-based RL methods. In addition, on a suite of reward-hacking benchmarks, PBRR consistently outperforms baselines that learn a reward function from scratch from preferences or modify the proxy reward function using other approaches, requiring substantially fewer preferences to learn high performing policies.

  _Xinlei Wang, Mingtian Tan, Jing Qiu, Junhua Zhao, Jinjin Gu_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Traditional time series analysis has long relied on pattern recognition, trained on static and well-established benchmarks. However, in real-world settings -- where policies shift, human behavior adapts, and unexpected events unfold -- effective analysis must go beyond surface-level trends to uncover the actual forces driving them. The recent rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) presents new opportunities for rethinking time series analysis by integrating multimodal inputs. However, as the use of LLMs becomes popular, we must remain cautious, asking why we use LLMs and how to exploit them effectively. Most existing LLM-based methods still employ their numerical regression ability and ignore their deeper reasoning potential. This paper argues for rethinking time series with LLMs as a reasoning task that prioritizes causal structure and explainability. This shift brings time series analysis closer to human-aligned understanding, enabling transparent and context-aware insights in complex real-world environments.

- **[From Narratives to Probabilistic Reasoning: Predicting and Interpreting Drivers' Hazardous Actions in Crashes Using Large Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13002)**  `arXiv:2510.13002`  
  _Boyou Chen, Gerui Xu, Zifei Wang, Huizhong Guo, Ananna Ahmed, Zhaonan Sun, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vehicle crashes involve complex interactions between road users, split-second decisions, and challenging environmental conditions. Among these, two-vehicle crashes are the most prevalent, accounting for approximately 70% of roadway crashes and posing a significant challenge to traffic safety. Identifying Driver Hazardous Action (DHA) is essential for understanding crash causation, yet the reliability of DHA data in large-scale databases is limited by inconsistent and labor-intensive manual coding practices. Here, we present an innovative framework that leverages a fine-tuned large language model to automatically infer DHAs from textual crash narratives, thereby improving the validity and interpretability of DHA classifications. Using five years of two-vehicle crash data from MTCF, we fine-tuned the Llama 3.2 1B model on detailed crash narratives and benchmarked its performance against conventional machine learning classifiers, including Random Forest, XGBoost, CatBoost, and a neural network. The fine-tuned LLM achieved an overall accuracy of 80%, surpassing all baseline models and demonstrating pronounced improvements in scenarios with imbalanced data. To increase interpretability, we developed a probabilistic reasoning approach, analyzing model output shifts across original test sets and three targeted counterfactual scenarios: variations in driver distraction and age. Our analysis revealed that introducing distraction for one driver substantially increased the likelihood of "General Unsafe Driving"; distraction for both drivers maximized the probability of "Both Drivers Took Hazardous Actions"; and assigning a teen driver markedly elevated the probability of "Speed and Stopping Violations." Our framework and analytical methods provide a robust and interpretable solution for large-scale automated DHA detection, offering new opportunities for traffic safety analysis and intervention.

- **[SENTINEL: A Multi-Level Formal Framework for Safety Evaluation of LLM-based Embodied Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12985)**  `arXiv:2510.12985`  
  _Simon Sinong Zhan, Yao Liu, Philip Wang, Zinan Wang, Qineng Wang, Zhian Ruan, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present Sentinel, the first framework for formally evaluating the physical safety of Large Language Model(LLM-based) embodied agents across the semantic, plan, and trajectory levels. Unlike prior methods that rely on heuristic rules or subjective LLM judgments, Sentinel grounds practical safety requirements in formal temporal logic (TL) semantics that can precisely specify state invariants, temporal dependencies, and timing constraints. It then employs a multi-level verification pipeline where (i) at the semantic level, intuitive natural language safety requirements are formalized into TL formulas and the LLM agent's understanding of these requirements is probed for alignment with the TL formulas; (ii) at the plan level, high-level action plans and subgoals generated by the LLM agent are verified against the TL formulas to detect unsafe plans before execution; and (iii) at the trajectory level, multiple execution trajectories are merged into a computation tree and efficiently verified against physically-detailed TL specifications for a final safety check. We apply Sentinel in VirtualHome and ALFRED, and formally evaluate multiple LLM-based embodied agents against diverse safety requirements. Our experiments show that by grounding physical safety in temporal logic and applying verification methods across multiple levels, Sentinel provides a rigorous foundation for systematically evaluating LLM-based embodied agents in physical environments, exposing safety violations overlooked by previous methods and offering insights into their failure modes.

- **[DeepPlanner: Scaling Planning Capability for Deep Research Agents via Advantage Shaping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12979)**  `arXiv:2510.12979`  
  _Wei Fan, Wenlin Yao, Zheng Li, Feng Yao, Xin Liu, Liang Qiu, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) augmented with multi-step reasoning and action generation abilities have shown promise in leveraging external tools to tackle complex tasks that require long-horizon planning. However, existing approaches either rely on implicit planning in the reasoning stage or introduce explicit planners without systematically addressing how to optimize the planning stage. As evidence, we observe that under vanilla reinforcement learning (RL), planning tokens exhibit significantly higher entropy than other action tokens, revealing uncertain decision points that remain under-optimized. To address this, we propose DeepPlanner, an end-to-end RL framework that effectively enhances the planning capabilities of deep research agents. Our approach shapes token-level advantage with an entropy-based term to allocate larger updates to high entropy tokens, and selectively upweights sample-level advantages for planning-intensive rollouts. Extensive experiments across seven deep research benchmarks demonstrate that DeepPlanner improves planning quality and achieves state-of-the-art results under a substantially lower training budget.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being deployed as the reasoning engines for agentic AI systems, yet they exhibit a critical flaw: a rigid adherence to explicit rules that leads to decisions misaligned with human common sense and intent. This "rule-rigidity" is a significant barrier to building trustworthy autonomous agents. While prior work has shown that supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with human explanations can mitigate this issue, SFT is computationally expensive and inaccessible to many practitioners. To address this gap, we introduce the Rule-Intent Distinction (RID) Framework, a novel, low-compute meta-prompting technique designed to elicit human-aligned exception handling in LLMs in a zero-shot manner. The RID framework provides the model with a structured cognitive schema for deconstructing tasks, classifying rules, weighing conflicting outcomes, and justifying its final decision. We evaluated the RID framework against baseline and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting on a custom benchmark of 20 scenarios requiring nuanced judgment across diverse domains. Our human-verified results demonstrate that the RID framework significantly improves performance, achieving a 95% Human Alignment Score (HAS), compared to 80% for the baseline and 75% for CoT. Furthermore, it consistently produces higher-quality, intent-driven reasoning. This work presents a practical, accessible, and effective method for steering LLMs from literal instruction-following to liberal, goal-oriented reasoning, paving the way for more reliable and pragmatic AI agents.

  Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated impressive performance on complex tasks, including logical puzzle games that require deriving solutions satisfying all constraints. However, whether they can flexibly apply appropriate rules to varying conditions, particularly when faced with non-canonical game variants, remains an open question. Existing corpora focus on popular puzzles like 9x9 Sudoku, risking overfitting to canonical formats and memorization of solution patterns, which can mask deficiencies in understanding novel rules or adapting strategies to new variants. To address this, we introduce HardcoreLogic, a challenging benchmark of over 5,000 puzzles across 10 games, designed to test the robustness of LRMs on the "long-tail" of logical games. HardcoreLogic systematically transforms canonical puzzles through three dimensions: Increased Complexity (IC), Uncommon Elements (UE), and Unsolvable Puzzles (UP), reducing reliance on shortcut memorization. Evaluations on a diverse set of LRMs reveal significant performance drops, even for models achieving top scores on existing benchmarks, indicating heavy reliance on memorized stereotypes. While increased complexity is the dominant source of difficulty, models also struggle with subtle rule variations that do not necessarily increase puzzle difficulty. Our systematic error analysis on solvable and unsolvable puzzles further highlights gaps in genuine reasoning. Overall, HardcoreLogic exposes the limitations of current LRMs and establishes a benchmark for advancing high-level logical reasoning.

  The meteoric rise of AI, with its rapidly expanding market capitalization, presents both transformative opportunities and critical challenges. Chief among these is the urgent need for a new, unified paradigm for trustworthy evaluation, as current benchmarks increasingly reveal critical vulnerabilities. Issues like data contamination and selective reporting by model developers fuel hype, while inadequate data quality control can lead to biased evaluations that, even if unintentionally, may favor specific approaches. As a flood of participants enters the AI space, this "Wild West" of assessment makes distinguishing genuine progress from exaggerated claims exceptionally difficult. Such ambiguity blurs scientific signals and erodes public confidence, much as unchecked claims would destabilize financial markets reliant on credible oversight from agencies like Moody's. In high-stakes human examinations (e.g., SAT, GRE), substantial effort is devoted to ensuring fairness and credibility; why settle for less in evaluating AI, especially given its profound societal impact? This position paper argues that the current laissez-faire approach is unsustainable. We contend that true, sustainable AI advancement demands a paradigm shift: a unified, live, and quality-controlled benchmarking framework robust by construction, not by mere courtesy and goodwill. To this end, we dissect the systemic flaws undermining today's AI evaluation, distill the essential requirements for a new generation of assessments, and introduce PeerBench (with its prototype implementation atthis https URL), a community-governed, proctored evaluation blueprint that embodies this paradigm through sealed execution, item banking with rolling renewal, and delayed transparency. Our goal is to pave the way for evaluations that can restore integrity and deliver genuinely trustworthy measures of AI progress.

  At the core of Deep Research is knowledge mining, the task of extracting structured information from massive unstructured text in response to user instructions. Large language models (LLMs) excel at interpreting such instructions but are prohibitively expensive to deploy at scale, while traditional pipelines of classifiers and extractors remain efficient yet brittle and unable to generalize to new tasks. We introduce Falconer, a collaborative framework that combines the agentic reasoning of LLMs with lightweight proxy models for scalable knowledge mining. In Falconer, LLMs act as planners, decomposing user instructions into executable pipelines, and as annotators, generating supervision to train small proxies. The framework unifies classification and extraction into two atomic operations, get label and get span, enabling a single instruction-following model to replace multiple task-specific components. To evaluate the consistency between proxy models incubated by Falconer and annotations provided by humans and large models, we construct new benchmarks covering both planning and end-to-end execution. Experiments show that Falconer closely matches state-of-the-art LLMs in instruction-following accuracy while reducing inference cost by up to 90% and accelerating large-scale knowledge mining by more than 20x, offering an efficient and scalable foundation for Deep Research.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In recent years, detecting fake multimodal content on social media has drawn increasing attention. Two major forms of deception dominate: human-crafted misinformation (e.g., rumors and misleading posts) and AI-generated content produced by image synthesis models or vision-language models (VLMs). Although both share deceptive intent, they are typically studied in isolation. NLP research focuses on human-written misinformation, while the CV community targets AI-generated artifacts. As a result, existing models are often specialized for only one type of fake content. In real-world scenarios, however, the type of a multimodal post is usually unknown, limiting the effectiveness of such specialized systems. To bridge this gap, we construct the Omnibus Dataset for Multimodal News Deception (OmniFake), a comprehensive benchmark of 127K samples that integrates human-curated misinformation from existing resources with newly synthesized AI-generated examples. Based on this dataset, we propose Unified Multimodal Fake Content Detection (UMFDet), a framework designed to handle both forms of deception. UMFDet leverages a VLM backbone augmented with a Category-aware Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Adapter to capture category-specific cues, and an attribution chain-of-thought mechanism that provides implicit reasoning guidance for locating salient deceptive signals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UMFDet achieves robust and consistent performance across both misinformation types, outperforming specialized baselines and offering a practical solution for real-world multimodal deception detection.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  GUI agents powered by LLMs show promise in interacting with diverse digital environments. Among these, video games offer a valuable testbed due to their varied interfaces, with adventure games posing additional challenges through complex, narrative-driven interactions. Existing game benchmarks, however, lack diversity and rarely evaluate agents on completing entire storylines. To address this, we introduce FlashAdventure, a benchmark of 34 Flash-based adventure games designed to test full story arc completion and tackle the observation-behavior gap: the challenge of remembering and acting on earlier gameplay information. We also propose CUA-as-a-Judge, an automated gameplay evaluator, and COAST, an agentic framework leveraging long-term clue memory to better plan and solve sequential tasks. Experiments show current GUI agents struggle with full story arcs, while COAST improves milestone completion by bridging the observation-behavior gap. Nonetheless, a marked discrepancy between humans and best-performing agents warrants continued research efforts to narrow this divide.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Process mining has emerged as a powerful analytical technique for understanding complex healthcare workflows. However, its application faces significant barriers, including technical complexity, a lack of standardized approaches, and limited access to practical training resources. We introduce HealthProcessAI, a GenAI framework designed to simplify process mining applications in healthcare and epidemiology by providing a comprehensive wrapper around existing Python (PM4PY) and R (bupaR) libraries. To address unfamiliarity and improve accessibility, the framework integrates multiple Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated process map interpretation and report generation, helping translate technical analyses into outputs that diverse users can readily understand. We validated the framework using sepsis progression data as a proof-of-concept example and compared the outputs of five state-of-the-art LLM models through the OpenRouter platform. To test its functionality, the framework successfully processed sepsis data across four proof-of-concept scenarios, demonstrating robust technical performance and its capability to generate reports through automated LLM analysis. LLM evaluation using five independent LLMs as automated evaluators revealed distinct model strengths: Claude Sonnet-4 and Gemini 2.5-Pro achieved the highest consistency scores (3.79/4.0 and 3.65/4.0) when evaluated by automated LLM assessors. By integrating multiple Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated interpretation and report generation, the framework addresses widespread unfamiliarity with process mining outputs, making them more accessible to clinicians, data scientists, and researchers. This structured analytics and AI-driven interpretation combination represents a novel methodological advance in translating complex process mining results into potentially actionable insights for healthcare applications.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The rapid advancement of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has unlocked new opportunities to tackle complex scientific challenges. Despite this progress, their application in addressing earth science problems, especially at the graduate level, remains underexplored. A significant barrier is the absence of benchmarks that capture the depth and contextual complexity of geoscientific reasoning. Current benchmarks often rely on synthetic datasets or simplistic figure-caption pairs, which do not adequately reflect the intricate reasoning and domain-specific insights required for real-world scientific applications. To address these gaps, we introduce MSEarth, a multimodal scientific benchmark curated from high-quality, open-access scientific publications. MSEarth encompasses the five major spheres of Earth science: atmosphere, cryosphere, hydrosphere, lithosphere, and biosphere, featuring over 289K figures with refined captions. These captions are crafted from the original figure captions and enriched with discussions and reasoning from the papers, ensuring the benchmark captures the nuanced reasoning and knowledge-intensive content essential for advanced scientific tasks. MSEarth supports a variety of tasks, including scientific figure captioning, multiple choice questions, and open-ended reasoning challenges. By bridging the gap in graduate-level benchmarks, MSEarth provides a scalable and high-fidelity resource to enhance the development and evaluation of MLLMs in scientific reasoning. The benchmark is publicly available to foster further research and innovation in this field.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The emergence of large language models (LLMs) enables the development of intelligent agents capable of engaging in complex and multi-turn dialogues. However, multi-agent collaboration faces critical safety challenges, such as hallucination amplification and error injection and propagation. This paper presents GUARDIAN, a unified method for detecting and mitigating multiple safety concerns in GUARDing Intelligent Agent collaboratioNs. By modeling the multi-agent collaboration process as a discrete-time temporal attributed graph, GUARDIAN explicitly captures the propagation dynamics of hallucinations and errors. The unsupervised encoder-decoder architecture incorporating an incremental training paradigm learns to reconstruct node attributes and graph structures from latent embeddings, enabling the identification of anomalous nodes and edges with unparalleled precision. Moreover, we introduce a graph abstraction mechanism based on the Information Bottleneck Theory, which compresses temporal interaction graphs while preserving essential patterns. Extensive experiments demonstrate GUARDIAN's effectiveness in safeguarding LLM multi-agent collaborations against diverse safety vulnerabilities, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy with efficient resource utilization.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Inverse design optimization aims to infer system parameters from observed solutions, posing critical challenges across domains such as semiconductor manufacturing, structural engineering, materials science, and fluid dynamics. The lack of explicit mathematical representations in many systems complicates this process and makes the first order optimization impossible. Mainstream approaches, including generative AI and Bayesian optimization, address these challenges but have limitations. Generative AI is computationally expensive, while Bayesian optimization, relying on surrogate models, suffers from scalability, sensitivity to priors, and noise issues, often leading to suboptimal solutions. This paper introduces Deep Physics Prior (DPP), a novel method enabling first-order gradient-based inverse optimization with surrogate machine learning models. By leveraging pretrained auxiliary Neural Operators, DPP enforces prior distribution constraints to ensure robust and meaningful solutions. This approach is particularly effective when prior data and observation distributions are unknown.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper investigates the strategy game So Long Sucker (SLS) as a novel benchmark for multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). Unlike traditional board or video game testbeds, SLS is distinguished by its coalition formation, strategic deception, and dynamic elimination rules, making it a uniquely challenging environment for autonomous agents. We introduce the first publicly available computational framework for SLS, complete with a graphical user interface and benchmarking support for reinforcement learning algorithms. Using classical deep reinforcement learning methods (e.g., DQN, DDQN, and Dueling DQN), we train self-playing agents to learn the rules and basic strategies of SLS. Experimental results demonstrate that, although these agents achieve roughly half of the maximum attainable reward and consistently outperform random baselines, they require long training horizons (~2000 games) and still commit occasional illegal moves, highlighting both the promise and limitations of classical reinforcement learning. Our findings establish SLS as a negotiation-aware benchmark for MARL, opening avenues for future research that integrates game-theoretic reasoning, coalition-aware strategies, and advanced reinforcement learning architectures to better capture the social and adversarial dynamics of complex multi-agent games.

  In today's world, making decisions as a group is common, whether choosing a restaurant or deciding on a holiday destination. Group decision-making (GDM) systems play a crucial role by facilitating consensus among participants with diverse preferences. Discussions are one of the main tools people use to make decisions. When people discuss alternatives, they use natural language to express their opinions. Traditional GDM systems generally require participants to provide explicit opinion values to the system. However, in real-life scenarios, participants often express their opinions through some text (e.g., in comments, social media, messengers, etc.). This paper introduces a sentiment and emotion-aware multi-criteria fuzzy GDM system designed to enhance consensus-reaching effectiveness in group settings. This system incorporates natural language processing to analyze sentiments and emotions expressed in textual data, enabling an understanding of participant opinions besides the explicit numerical preference inputs. Once all the experts have provided their preferences for the alternatives, the individual preferences are aggregated into a single collective preference matrix. This matrix represents the collective expert opinion regarding the other options. Then, sentiments, emotions, and preference scores are inputted into a fuzzy inference system to get the overall score. The proposed system was used for a small decision-making process - choosing the hotel for a vacation by a group of friends. Our findings demonstrate that integrating sentiment and emotion analysis into GDM systems allows everyone's feelings and opinions to be considered during discussions and significantly improves consensus among participants.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) solely trained on next-token prediction learn to solve a wide range of problems involving mathematical reasoning. But how does this ability evolve during training? We show the first analysis of how mathematical reasoning abilities of several open-weight LLMs develop during pre-training and post-training. To this end, we construct MathCAMPS, a synthetic dataset of novel mathematical reasoning problems grounded in 44 fine-grained skills taken from the Common Core curriculum from K to 8th grades. In one experiment, we show that mathematical skills are learned during pre-training in an order that measurably correlates with the human-designed curriculum, even though training data are randomly ordered. We also show a detailed analysis of which mathematical abilities benefit from instruction tuning, a widely used post-training method and, in contrast, which skills suffer. Our work paves the way for an empirical understanding of LLM training dynamics in relation to reasoning.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Translating clauses into executable code is a vital stage of automated rule checking (ARC) and is essential for effective building design compliance checking, particularly for rules with implicit properties or complex logic requiring domain knowledge. Thus, by systematically analyzing building clauses, 66 atomic functions are defined first to encapsulate common computational logics. Then, LLM-FuncMapper is proposed, a large language model (LLM)-based approach with rule-based adaptive prompts that match clauses to atomic functions. Finally, executable code is generated by composing functions through the LLMs. Experiments show LLM-FuncMapper outperforms fine-tuning methods by 19% in function matching while significantly reducing manual annotation efforts. Case study demonstrates that LLM-FuncMapper can automatically compose multiple atomic functions to generate executable code, boosting rule-checking efficiency. To our knowledge, this research represents the first application of LLMs for interpreting complex design clauses into executable code, which may shed light on further adoption of LLMs in the construction domain.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The goal of a traditional Markov decision process (MDP) is to maximize expected cumulative reward over a defined horizon (possibly infinite). In many applications, however, a decision maker may be interested in optimizing a specific quantile of the cumulative reward instead of its expectation. In this paper we consider the problem of optimizing the quantiles of the cumulative rewards of a Markov decision process (MDP), which we refer to as a quantile Markov decision process (QMDP). We provide analytical results characterizing the optimal QMDP value function and present a dynamic programming-based algorithm to solve for the optimal policy. The algorithm also extends to the MDP problem with a conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) objective. We illustrate the practical relevance of our model by evaluating it on an HIV treatment initiation problem, where patients aim to balance the potential benefits and risks of the treatment.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) tackles complex tasks, increasingly expanded contexts offer richer information, but at the cost of higher latency and increased cognitive load on the model. To mitigate this bottleneck, especially for intricate multi-hop questions, we introduce BRIEF-Pro. It is a universal, lightweight compressor that distills relevant evidence for a given query from retrieved documents into a concise summary for seamless integration into in-context RAG. Using seed data consisting of relatively short contexts (fewer than 1k words), BRIEF-Pro is trained to perform abstractive compression of extended contexts exceeding 10k words across a wide range of scenarios. Furthermore, BRIEF-Pro offers flexible user control over summary length by allowing users to specify the desired number of sentences. Experiments on four open-domain multi-hop question-answering datasets show that BRIEF-Pro generates more concise and relevant summaries, enhancing performance across small, large, and proprietary language models. With the 70B reader model, 32x compression by BRIEF-Pro improves QA performance by 4.67% on average over LongLLMLingua's 9x, while requiring only 23% of its computational overhead.

  The scalability of large language models for long-context reasoning is severely constrained by the linear growth of their Transformer key-value cache, which incurs significant memory and computational costs. We posit that as a model generates reasoning tokens, the informational value of past generated tokens diminishes, creating an opportunity for compression. In this work, we propose to periodically compress the generation KV cache with a learned, special-purpose token and evict compressed entries. We train the model to perform this compression via a modified joint distillation and reinforcement learning (RL) framework. Our training method minimizes overhead over the conventional RL process, as it leverages RL outputs for distillation. Empirically, our method achieves a superior memory-accuracy Pareto frontier compared to both the model without cache compression and training-free compression techniques.

  Symbol grounding (Harnad, 1990) describes how symbols such as words acquire their meanings by connecting to real-world sensorimotor experiences. Recent work has shown preliminary evidence that grounding may emerge in (vision-)language models trained at scale without using explicit grounding objectives. Yet, the specific loci of this emergence and the mechanisms that drive it remain largely unexplored. To address this problem, we introduce a controlled evaluation framework that systematically traces how symbol grounding arises within the internal computations through mechanistic and causal analysis. Our findings show that grounding concentrates in middle-layer computations and is implemented through the aggregate mechanism, where attention heads aggregate the environmental ground to support the prediction of linguistic forms. This phenomenon replicates in multimodal dialogue and across architectures (Transformers and state-space models), but not in unidirectional LSTMs. Our results provide behavioral and mechanistic evidence that symbol grounding can emerge in language models, with practical implications for predicting and potentially controlling the reliability of generation.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We propose a method for confidence estimation in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems that aligns closely with the correctness of large language model (LLM) outputs. Confidence estimation is especially critical in high-stakes domains such as finance and healthcare, where the cost of an incorrect answer outweighs that of not answering the question. Our approach extends prior uncertainty quantification methods by leveraging raw feed-forward network (FFN) activations as auto-regressive signals, avoiding the information loss inherent in token logits and probabilities after projection and softmax normalization. We model confidence prediction as a sequence classification task, and regularize training with a Huber loss term to improve robustness against noisy supervision. Applied in a real-world financial industry customer-support setting with complex knowledge bases, our method outperforms strong baselines and maintains high accuracy under strict latency constraints. Experiments on Llama 3.1 8B model show that using activations from only the 16th layer preserves accuracy while reducing response latency. Our results demonstrate that activation-based confidence modeling offers a scalable, architecture-aware path toward trustworthy RAG deployment.

  Chat assistants increasingly integrate web search functionality, enabling them to retrieve and cite external sources. While this promises more reliable answers, it also raises the risk of amplifying misinformation from low-credibility sources. In this paper, we introduce a novel methodology for evaluating assistants' web search behavior, focusing on source credibility and the groundedness of responses with respect to cited sources. Using 100 claims across five misinformation-prone topics, we assess GPT-4o, GPT-5, Perplexity, and Qwen Chat. Our findings reveal differences between the assistants, with Perplexity achieving the highest source credibility, whereas GPT-4o exhibits elevated citation of non-credibility sources on sensitive topics. This work provides the first systematic comparison of commonly used chat assistants for fact-checking behavior, offering a foundation for evaluating AI systems in high-stakes information environments.

  Current benchmarks for AI clinician systems, often based on multiple-choice exams or manual rubrics, fail to capture the depth, robustness, and safety required for real-world clinical practice. To address this, we introduce the GAPS framework, a multidimensional paradigm for evaluating \textbf{G}rounding (cognitive depth), \textbf{A}dequacy (answer completeness), \textbf{P}erturbation (robustness), and \textbf{S}afety. Critically, we developed a fully automated, guideline-anchored pipeline to construct a GAPS-aligned benchmark end-to-end, overcoming the scalability and subjectivity limitations of prior work. Our pipeline assembles an evidence neighborhood, creates dual graph and tree representations, and automatically generates questions across G-levels. Rubrics are synthesized by a DeepResearch agent that mimics GRADE-consistent, PICO-driven evidence review in a ReAct loop. Scoring is performed by an ensemble of large language model (LLM) judges. Validation confirmed our automated questions are high-quality and align with clinician judgment. Evaluating state-of-the-art models on the benchmark revealed key failure modes: performance degrades sharply with increased reasoning depth (G-axis), models struggle with answer completeness (A-axis), and they are highly vulnerable to adversarial perturbations (P-axis) as well as certain safety issues (S-axis). This automated, clinically-grounded approach provides a reproducible and scalable method for rigorously evaluating AI clinician systems and guiding their development toward safer, more reliable clinical practice.

  As texts generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) are ever more common and often indistinguishable from human-written content, research on automatic text detection has attracted growing attention. Many recent detectors report near-perfect accuracy, often boasting AUROC scores above 99\%. However, these claims typically assume fixed generation settings, leaving open the question of how robust such systems are to changes in decoding strategies. In this work, we systematically examine how sampling-based decoding impacts detectability, with a focus on how subtle variations in a model's (sub)word-level distribution affect detection performance. We find that even minor adjustments to decoding parameters - such as temperature, top-p, or nucleus sampling - can severely impair detector accuracy, with AUROC dropping from near-perfect levels to 1\% in some settings. Our findings expose critical blind spots in current detection methods and emphasize the need for more comprehensive evaluation protocols. To facilitate future research, we release a large-scale dataset encompassing 37 decoding configurations, along with our code and evaluation frameworkthis https URL

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Accurate coding of tumor diagnoses with ICD-10-GM and ICD-O-3 is essential for structured cancer documentation in Germany. Smaller open-weight LLMs are appealing for privacy-preserving automation but often struggle with coding accuracy in German-language contexts. This study investigates whether instruction-based fine-tuning on public datasets improves the coding accuracy of open-weight LLMs for German tumor diagnosis texts. The evaluation uses coded diagnoses from the local tumor documentation system as test data. In a systematic data quality assessment, the upper limit for ICD-10 coding performance was estimated at 60-79% for exact and 81-94% for partial (three-character codes only) derivation. As training data, over 500,000 question-answer pairs were created based on the ICD-10-GM, ICD-O-3, and OPS catalogues. Eight open-weight models from the Qwen, Llama, and Mistral families (7-70 B parameters) were fine-tuned. ICD-10-GM accuracy rose from 1.4-24% to 41-58%, and partial accuracy from 31-74% to 73-83%. The accuracy of ICD-O-3 topography coding also improved but started and remained considerably lower with an exact accuracy of 22-40% and a partial accuracy of 56-67% after fine-tuning. Malformed code outputs dropped to 0% for all models. Tumor-diagnosis recognition reached 99%. Accuracy correlated positively with model size, but gaps between small and large models narrowed after fine-tuning. The reasoning mode in Qwen3 generally yielded a lower performance than fine-tuning and was over 100 times slower. Our findings highlight the potential of leveraging public catalogues to build instruction datasets that improve LLMs in medical documentation tasks. The complete training dataset and the best-performing checkpoints of the fine-tuned models are available fromthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive reasoning abilities, but struggle with temporal understanding, especially when questions involve multiple entities, compound operators, and evolving event sequences. Temporal Knowledge Graphs (TKGs), which capture vast amounts of temporal facts in a structured format, offer a reliable source for temporal reasoning. However, existing TKG-based LLM reasoning methods still struggle with four major challenges: maintaining temporal faithfulness in multi-hop reasoning, achieving multi-entity temporal synchronization, adapting retrieval to diverse temporal operators, and reusing prior reasoning experience for stability and efficiency. To address these issues, we propose MemoTime, a memory-augmented temporal knowledge graph framework that enhances LLM reasoning through structured grounding, recursive reasoning, and continual experience learning. MemoTime decomposes complex temporal questions into a hierarchical Tree of Time, enabling operator-aware reasoning that enforces monotonic timestamps and co-constrains multiple entities under unified temporal bounds. A dynamic evidence retrieval layer adaptively selects operator-specific retrieval strategies, while a self-evolving experience memory stores verified reasoning traces, toolkit decisions, and sub-question embeddings for cross-type reuse. Comprehensive experiments on multiple temporal QA benchmarks show that MemoTime achieves overall state-of-the-art results, outperforming the strong baseline by up to 24.0%. Furthermore, MemoTime enables smaller models (e.g., Qwen3-4B) to achieve reasoning performance comparable to that of GPT-4-Turbo.

  Trainable sparse attention has emerged as a promising solution to address the decoding efficiency bottleneck of LLMs in long-context processing, significantly saving memory accesses while minimally impacting task performance. However, existing sparse attention methods leave a crucial limitation unresolved: the size of the key-value (KV) cache remains unreduced, which constrains on-GPU batch sizes and throttles decoding throughput, especially in large-scale batched inference. In this paper, we show that trainable sparse attention naturally exhibits strong locality in token selection across adjacent decoding steps, thereby enabling KV cache offloading without altering the underlying attention computation. However, the inherent locality remains insufficient to achieve efficient offloading, as the transfer of selected KV pairs between the CPU and GPU continues to dominate the overall decoding cost. Building on this insight, we present NOSA, a trainable sparse attention framework designed to natively support KV cache offloading. NOSA introduces explicit locality constraints by decomposing token selection into query-aware and query-agnostic components, thereby reducing KV transfers while preserving the same attention computation as used during training. We pretrain a 1B-parameter model with NOSA and conduct extensive benchmarks, showing that it preserves near-lossless performance while achieving up to a 2.3x improvement in decoding throughput compared with the vanilla trainable sparse attention baseline (InfLLM-V2).

  Table-to-text generation (insight generation from tables) is a challenging task that requires precision in analyzing the data. In addition, the evaluation of existing benchmarks is affected by contamination of Large Language Model (LLM) training data as well as domain imbalance. We introduce FreshTab, an on-the-fly table-to-text benchmark generation from Wikipedia, to combat the LLM data contamination problem and enable domain-sensitive evaluation. While non-English table-to-text datasets are limited, FreshTab collects datasets in different languages on demand (we experiment with German, Russian and French in addition to English). We find that insights generated by LLMs from recent tables collected by our method appear clearly worse by automatic metrics, but this does not translate into LLM and human evaluations. Domain effects are visible in all evaluations, showing that a~domain-balanced benchmark is more challenging.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models exhibit uneven performance across languages, with substantial gaps between high- and low-resource languages. We present a framework for enhancing monolingual capabilities of LLMs in underrepresented languages while preserving their general-purpose performance through targeted fine-tuning of language-specific subnetworks. Our approach identifies language-specific neurons using Language Activation Probability Entropy and fine-tunes only the weights associated with these neurons, a dedicated subnetwork, on target-language data. Experiments on Llama-3.1-8B and Mistral-Nemo-12B across 12 mid- and low-resource languages demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms full fine-tuning, FFN-only fine-tuning, LoRA adaptation, and random subset fine-tuning baselines while efficiently updating only up to 1% of model parameters. Beyond performance improvements, we observe enhanced favorable training dynamics, cross-lingual representational alignment, and systematic weight update changes. To facilitate future research, we release language-specific neuron identifications for over 100 languages as well as our adaptation pipeline, offering a cost-effective pathway for adapting state-of-the-art models to underrepresented languages.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The reasoning pattern of Large language models (LLMs) remains opaque, and Reinforcement learning (RL) typically applies uniform credit across an entire generation, blurring the distinction between pivotal and routine steps. This work positions attention as a privileged substrate that renders the internal logic of LLMs legible, not merely as a byproduct of computation, but as a mechanistic blueprint of reasoning itself. We first distinguish attention heads between locally and globally focused information processing and reveal that locally focused heads produce a sawtooth pattern near the diagonal indicating phrasal chunks, while globally focused heads expose tokens that exert broad downstream influence over future tokens. We formalize these with two metrics: 1) Windowed Average Attention Distance, which measures the extent of backward attention within a clipped window; 2) Future Attention Influence, which quantifies a token's global importance as the average attention it receives from subsequent tokens. Taken together, these signals reveal a recurring preplan-and-anchor mechanism, where the model first performs a long-range contextual reference to generate an introductory token, which is immediately followed by or coincides with a semantic anchor token that organizes subsequent reasoning. Leveraging these insights, we introduce three novel RL strategies that dynamically perform targeted credit assignment to critical nodes (preplan tokens, anchor tokens, and their temporal coupling) and show consistent performance gains across various reasoning tasks. By aligning optimization with the model's intrinsic reasoning rhythm, we aim to transform opaque optimization into an actionable structure-aware process, hoping to offer a potential step toward more transparent and effective optimization of LLM reasoning.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  LLMs hold great promise for healthcare applications, but the rapid evolution of medical knowledge and errors in training data often cause them to generate outdated or inaccurate information, limiting their applicability in high-stakes clinical practice. Model editing has emerged as a potential remedy without full retraining. While parameter-based editing often compromises locality and is thus ill-suited for the medical domain, retrieval-based editing offers a more viable alternative. However, it still faces two critical challenges: (1) representation overlap within the medical knowledge space often causes inaccurate retrieval and reduces editing accuracy; (2) existing methods are restricted to single-sample edits, while batch-editing remains largely unexplored despite its importance for real-world medical applications. To address these challenges, we first construct MedVersa, \hk{an enhanced benchmark with broader coverage of medical subjects, designed to evaluate both single and batch edits under strict locality constraints}. We then propose MedREK, a retrieval-based editing framework that integrates a shared query-key module for precise matching with an attention-based prompt encoder for informative guidance. Experimental results on various medical benchmarks demonstrate that our MedREK achieves superior performance across different core metrics and provides the first validated solution for batch-editing in medical LLMs. Our code and dataset are available atthis https URL.

  Understanding human intent is a complex, high-level task for large language models (LLMs), requiring analytical reasoning, contextual interpretation, dynamic information aggregation, and decision-making under uncertainty. Real-world public discussions, such as consumer product discussions, are rarely linear or involve a single user. Instead, they are characterized by interwoven and often conflicting perspectives, divergent concerns, goals, emotional tendencies, as well as implicit assumptions and background knowledge about usage scenarios. To accurately understand such explicit public intent, an LLM must go beyond parsing individual sentences; it must integrate multi-source signals, reason over inconsistencies, and adapt to evolving discourse, similar to how experts in fields like politics, economics, or finance approach complex, uncertain environments. Despite the importance of this capability, no large-scale benchmark currently exists for evaluating LLMs on real-world human intent understanding, primarily due to the challenges of collecting real-world public discussion data and constructing a robust evaluation pipeline. To bridge this gap, we introduce \bench, the first dynamic, live evaluation benchmark specifically designed for intent understanding, particularly in the consumer domain. \bench is the largest and most diverse benchmark of its kind, supporting real-time updates while preventing data contamination through an automated curation pipeline.

  Question Answering (QA) on narrative text poses a unique challenge to current systems, requiring a deep understanding of long, complex documents. However, the reliability of NarrativeQA, the most widely used benchmark in this domain, is hindered by noisy documents and flawed QA pairs. In this work, we introduce LiteraryQA, a high-quality subset of NarrativeQA focused on literary works. Using a human- and LLM-validated pipeline, we identify and correct low-quality QA samples while removing extraneous text from source documents. We then carry out a meta-evaluation of automatic metrics to clarify how systems should be evaluated on LiteraryQA. This analysis reveals that all n-gram-based metrics have a low system-level correlation to human judgment, while LLM-as-a-Judge evaluations, even with small open-weight models, can strongly agree with the ranking identified by humans. Finally, we benchmark a set of long-context LLMs on LiteraryQA. We release our code and data atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) is a powerful paradigm for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) to human preferences in Machine Translation (MT), but current methods are hindered by two fundamental challenges: (1) flawed reward signals from Quality Estimation (QE) models that overlook critical errors like translation hallucination, and (2) inefficient data utilization that discards valuable learning signals by selecting only a single win-loss pair. To address these limitations, we introduce M^2PO: Multi-Pair, Multi-Perspective Preference Optimization. Our framework integrates a multi-perspective reward engine that creates a more robust signal by combining two key viewpoints: a new hallucination penalty for factuality, and an innovative dynamic quality score that adaptively fuses external evaluations with the model's own evolving judgment. This is synergistically paired with a multi-pair construction strategy that systematically creates a comprehensive set of preference pairs from the entire pool of translation candidates. This synergistic approach ensures the model learns from a richer spectrum of quality trade-offs, leading to more robust and faithful translations. On challenging WMT21-22 benchmarks, M^2PO substantially outperforms existing preference optimization methods and demonstrates highly competitive performance against leading proprietary LLMs.

  This survey provides the first systematic review of Arabic LLM benchmarks, analyzing 40+ evaluation benchmarks across NLP tasks, knowledge domains, cultural understanding, and specialized capabilities. We propose a taxonomy organizing benchmarks into four categories: Knowledge, NLP Tasks, Culture and Dialects, and Target-Specific evaluations. Our analysis reveals significant progress in benchmark diversity while identifying critical gaps: limited temporal evaluation, insufficient multi-turn dialogue assessment, and cultural misalignment in translated datasets. We examine three primary approaches: native collection, translation, and synthetic generation discussing their trade-offs regarding authenticity, scale, and cost. This work serves as a comprehensive reference for Arabic NLP researchers, providing insights into benchmark methodologies, reproducibility standards, and evaluation metrics while offering recommendations for future development.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  One of the most intriguing features of language is its constant change, with ongoing shifts in how meaning is expressed. Despite decades of research, the factors that determine how and why meanings evolve remain only partly understood. Colexification -- the phenomenon of expressing multiple distinct concepts using the same word form -- serves as a valuable window onto the dynamics of meaning change across languages. Here, we apply phylogenetic comparative models to dictionary data from three language families, Austronesian, Indo-European, and Uralic, in order to shed light on the evolutionary dynamics underlying the colexification of concept pairs. We assess the effects of three predictors: associativity, borrowability, and usage frequency. Our results show that more closely related concept pairs are colexified across a larger portion of the family tree and exhibit slower rates of change. In contrast, concept pairs that are more frequent and more prone to borrowing tend to change more rapidly and are less often colexified. We also find considerable differences between the language families under study, suggesting that areal and cultural factors may play a role.

  Language is fundamental to human cooperation, facilitating not only the exchange of information but also the coordination of actions through shared interpretations of situational contexts. This study explores whether the Generative Agent-Based Model (GABM) Concordia can effectively model Theory of Mind (ToM) within simulated real-world environments. Specifically, we assess whether this framework successfully simulates ToM abilities and whether GPT-4 can perform tasks by making genuine inferences from social context, rather than relying on linguistic memorization. Our findings reveal a critical limitation: GPT-4 frequently fails to select actions based on belief attribution, suggesting that apparent ToM-like abilities observed in previous studies may stem from shallow statistical associations rather than true reasoning. Additionally, the model struggles to generate coherent causal effects from agent actions, exposing difficulties in processing complex social interactions. These results challenge current statements about emergent ToM-like capabilities in LLMs and highlight the need for more rigorous, action-based evaluation frameworks.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit factual inconsistencies and logical decay in extended, multi-turn dialogues, a challenge stemming from their reliance on static, pre-trained knowledge and an inability to reason adaptively over the dialogue history. Prevailing mitigation strategies, such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and agentic working memories, improve information recall but still engage with fundamentally static knowledge sources and follow pre-defined single reasoning path. This hinders their ability to preserve factual and logical consistency of their responses in multi-turn dialogues while the context evolves over time. To address this issue, we propose D-SMART, a model-agnostic framework designed to maintain multi-turn dialogue consistency by enabling LLMs to build and reason over a dynamic, structured representation of the conversational context. This is achieved via two synergistic components: (1) a Dynamic Structured Memory (DSM), which incrementally constructs and maintains an authoritative, OWL-compliant knowledge graph of the conversation; and (2) a Reasoning Tree (RT), which executes inferences as an explicit and traceable multi-step search over the graph. As the popular-used quality score (judged by GPT-4) can overlook logical flaws, we introduce new NLI-based metrics to better measure multi-turn dialogue consistency. Comprehensive experiments on the MT-Bench-101 benchmark show that D-SMART significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, elevating the dialogue consistency score by over 48\% for both proprietary and open-source models, and notably improves the quality score of the latter by up to 10.1\%.

  Federated learning is a common method for privacy-preserving training of machine learning models. In this paper, we analyze the vulnerability of ASR models to attribute inference attacks in the federated setting. We test a non-parametric white-box attack method under a passive threat model on three ASR models: Wav2Vec2, HuBERT, and Whisper. The attack operates solely on weight differentials without access to raw speech from target speakers. We demonstrate attack feasibility on sensitive demographic and clinical attributes: gender, age, accent, emotion, and dysarthria. Our findings indicate that attributes that are underrepresented or absent in the pre-training data are more vulnerable to such inference attacks. In particular, information about accents can be reliably inferred from all models. Our findings expose previously undocumented vulnerabilities in federated ASR models and offer insights towards improved security.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The increasing deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) across enterprise and mission-critical domains has underscored the urgent need for robust guardrailing systems that ensure safety, reliability, and compliance. Existing solutions often struggle with real-time oversight, multi-modal data handling, and explainability -- limitations that hinder their adoption in regulated environments. Existing guardrails largely operate in isolation, focused on text alone making them inadequate for multi-modal, production-scale environments. We introduce Protect, natively multi-modal guardrailing model designed to operate seamlessly across text, image, and audio inputs, designed for enterprise-grade deployment. Protect integrates fine-tuned, category-specific adapters trained via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) on an extensive, multi-modal dataset covering four safety dimensions: toxicity, sexism, data privacy, and prompt injection. Our teacher-assisted annotation pipeline leverages reasoning and explanation traces to generate high-fidelity, context-aware labels across modalities. Experimental results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across all safety dimensions, surpassing existing open and proprietary models such as WildGuard, LlamaGuard-4, and GPT-4.1. Protect establishes a strong foundation for trustworthy, auditable, and production-ready safety systems capable of operating across text, image, and audio modalities.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Proverbs are among the most fascinating linguistic phenomena that transcend cultural and linguistic boundaries. Yet, much of the global landscape of proverbs remains underexplored, as many cultures preserve their traditional wisdom within their own communities due to the oral tradition of the phenomenon. Taking advantage of the current advances in Natural Language Processing (NLP), we focus on Greek proverbs, analyzing their sentiment. Departing from an annotated dataset of Greek proverbs, we expand it to include local dialects, effectively mapping the annotated sentiment. We present (1) a way to exploit LLMs in order to perform sentiment classification of proverbs, (2) a map of Greece that provides an overview of the distribution of sentiment, (3) a combinatory analysis in terms of the geographic position, dialect, and topic of proverbs. Our findings show that LLMs can provide us with an accurate enough picture of the sentiment of proverbs, especially when approached as a non-conventional sentiment polarity task. Moreover, in most areas of Greece negative sentiment is more prevalent.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models have revolutionized natural language processing, yet their deployment remains hampered by the substantial memory and runtime overhead of the transformer's Key-Value cache. To mitigate this, recent methods employ a scoring-aggregation framework to evict unimportant cache entries, based on the stability assumption-that a fixed subset of entries remains consistently important during generation. However, prior work has largely focused on refining importance indicators for scoring, while defaulting to mean aggregation due to a faithful trust in the stability assumption. In this work, we argue that this underlying assumption is inherently fragile, making mean aggregation highly vulnerable in extreme cases. To counter this, we propose a simple yet elegant defensive aggregation strategy: a two-step, linear-time approach that controls worst-case risk, thereby defending against extreme cases with negligible computational overhead. Embodying this strategy, we propose a novel cache eviction method, DefensiveKV and its extension, Layer-DefensiveKV, which incorporates layer-wise budget allocation. Across seven task domains (18 datasets), our methods reduce generation quality loss by 2.3x and 4.3x respectively, versus the strongest baseline under a 20% cache size. These results set new performance benchmarks and pioneer a promising direction for optimizing cache eviction against underlying fragility through worst-case risk management.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems rely on retrieving relevant evidence from a corpus to support downstream generation. The common practice of splitting a long document into multiple shorter passages enables finer-grained and targeted information retrieval. However, it also introduces challenges when a correct retrieval would require inference across passages, such as resolving coreference, disambiguating entities, and aggregating evidence scattered across multiple sources. Many state-of-the-art (SOTA) reranking methods, despite utilizing powerful large pretrained language models with potentially high inference costs, still neglect the aforementioned challenges. Therefore, we propose Embedding-Based Context-Aware Reranker (EBCAR), a lightweight reranking framework operating directly on embeddings of retrieved passages with enhanced cross-passage understandings through the structural information of the passages and a hybrid attention mechanism, which captures both high-level interactions across documents and low-level relationships within each document. We evaluate EBCAR against SOTA rerankers on the ConTEB benchmark, demonstrating its effectiveness for information retrieval requiring cross-passage inference and its advantages in both accuracy and efficiency.

  Computational stylometry analyzes writing style through quantitative patterns in text, supporting applications from forensic tasks such as identity linking and plagiarism detection to literary attribution in the humanities. Supervised and contrastive approaches rely on data with spurious correlations and often confuse style with topic. Despite their natural use in AI-generated text detection, the CLM pre-training of modern LLMs has been scarcely leveraged for general authorship problems. We propose a novel unsupervised approach based on this extensive pre-training and the in-context learning capabilities of LLMs, employing the log-probabilities of an LLM to measure style transferability from one text to another. Our method significantly outperforms LLM prompting approaches of comparable scale and achieves higher accuracy than contrastively trained baselines when controlling for topical correlations. Moreover, performance scales fairly consistently with the size of the base model and, in the case of authorship verification, with an additional mechanism that increases test-time computation; enabling flexible trade-offs between computational cost and accuracy.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  While Text-to-Speech (TTS) systems can achieve fine-grained control over emotional expression via natural language prompts, a significant challenge emerges when the desired emotion (style prompt) conflicts with the semantic content of the text. This mismatch often results in unnatural-sounding speech, undermining the goal of achieving fine-grained emotional control. Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) is a key technique for enhancing prompt alignment; however, its application to auto-regressive (AR) TTS models remains underexplored, which can lead to degraded audio quality. This paper directly addresses the challenge of style-content mismatch in AR TTS models by proposing an adaptive CFG scheme that adjusts to different levels of the detected mismatch, as measured using large language models or natural language inference models. This solution is based on a comprehensive analysis of CFG's impact on emotional expressiveness in state-of-the-art AR TTS models. Our results demonstrate that the proposed adaptive CFG scheme improves the emotional expressiveness of the AR TTS model while maintaining audio quality and intelligibility.

  Enhancing customer experience is essential for business success, particularly as service demands grow in scale and complexity. Generative artificial intelligence and Large Language Models (LLMs) have empowered intelligent interaction systems to deliver efficient, personalized, and 24/7 support. In practice, intelligent interaction systems encounter several challenges: (1) Constructing high-quality data for cold-start training is difficult, hindering self-evolution and raising labor costs. (2) Multi-turn dialogue performance remains suboptimal due to inadequate intent understanding, rule compliance, and solution extraction. (3) Frequent evolution of business rules affects system operability and transferability, constraining low-cost expansion and adaptability. (4) Reliance on a single LLM is insufficient in complex scenarios, where the absence of multi-agent frameworks and effective collaboration undermines process completeness and service quality. (5) The open-domain nature of multi-turn dialogues, lacking unified golden answers, hampers quantitative evaluation and continuous optimization. To address these challenges, we introduce WOWService, an intelligent interaction system tailored for industrial applications. With the integration of LLMs and multi-agent architectures, WOWService enables autonomous task management and collaborative problem-solving. Specifically, WOWService focuses on core modules including data construction, general capability enhancement, business scenario adaptation, multi-agent coordination, and automated evaluation. Currently, WOWService is deployed on the Meituan App, achieving significant gains in key metrics, e.g., User Satisfaction Metric 1 (USM 1) -27.53% and User Satisfaction Metric 2 (USM 2) +25.51%, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing user needs and advancing personalized service.

  Activation steering methods control large language model (LLM) behavior by modifying internal activations at inference time. However, most existing activation steering methods rely on a fixed steering strength, leading to either insufficient control or unadapted intervention that degrades text plausibility and coherence. We introduce In-Distribution Steering (IDS), a novel method that adapts steering strength based on the input data distribution in representation space. IDS dynamically adjusts interventions according to how far a given input lies within the distribution, enabling adaptive intervention and generation stability during text generation. Experiments demonstrate that IDS achieves strong accuracy on classification tasks while producing coherent text without collapse, making IDS particularly well suited for real-world applications.

  Inspired by the success of reinforcement learning (RL) in Large Language Model (LLM) training for domains like math and code, recent works have begun exploring how to train LLMs to use search engines more effectively as tools for retrieval-augmented generation. Although these methods achieve performance improvement across QA benchmarks, many prioritize final answer correctness while overlooking the quality of intermediate reasoning steps, which may lead to chain-of-thought unfaithfulness. In this paper, we first introduce a comprehensive evaluation framework for evaluating RL-based search agents, covering three distinct faithfulness metrics: information-think faithfulness, think-answer faithfulness, and think-search faithfulness. Our evaluations reveal that a prototypical RL-based search agent, Search-R1, has significant room for improvement in this regard. To foster faithful reasoning, we introduce VERITAS (Verifying Entailed Reasoning through Intermediate Traceability in Agentic Search), a novel framework that integrates fine-grained faithfulness rewards into the reinforcement learning process. Our experiments show that models trained with VERITAS not only significantly improve reasoning faithfulness, but also achieve comparable task performance across seven QA benchmarks.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) have achieved striking successes on many benchmarks, yet recent studies continue to expose fundamental weaknesses. In particular, tasks that require abstract reasoning remain challenging, often because they use representations such as grids, symbols, or visual patterns that differ from the natural language data LLMs are trained on. In this paper, we introduce Concept, a simple word-guessing board game, as a benchmark for probing abductive reasoning in a representation that is much closer to LLM pre-training data: natural language. Our results show that this game, easily solved by humans (with a success rate of over 90\%), is still very challenging for state-of-the-art LLMs (no model exceeds 40\% success rate). Specifically, we observe that LLMs struggle with interpreting other players' strategic intents, and with correcting initial hypotheses given sequential information updates. In addition, we extend the evaluation across multiple languages, and find that the LLM performance drops further in lower-resource languages (Dutch, French, and Spanish) compared to English.

  Linguistic diversity across the world creates a disparity with the availability of good quality digital language resources thereby restricting the technological benefits to majority of human population. The lack or absence of data resources makes it difficult to perform NLP tasks for low-resource languages. This paper presents a novel scalable and fully automated methodology to extract bilingual parallel corpora from newspaper articles using image and text analytics. We validate our approach by building parallel data corpus for two different language combinations and demonstrate the value of this dataset through a downstream task of machine translation and improve over the current baseline by close to 3 BLEU points.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Bias in AI systems, especially those relying on natural language data, raises ethical and practical concerns. Underrepresentation of certain groups often leads to uneven performance across demographics. Traditional fairness methods, such as pre-processing, in-processing, and post-processing, depend on protected-attribute labels, involve accuracy-fairness trade-offs, and may not generalize across datasets. To address these challenges, we propose LLM-Guided Synthetic Augmentation (LGSA), which uses large language models to generate counterfactual examples for underrepresented groups while preserving label integrity. We evaluated LGSA on a controlled dataset of short English sentences with gendered pronouns, professions, and binary classification labels. Structured prompts were used to produce gender-swapped paraphrases, followed by quality control including semantic similarity checks, attribute verification, toxicity screening, and human spot checks. The augmented dataset expanded training coverage and was used to train a classifier under consistent conditions. Results show that LGSA reduces performance disparities without compromising accuracy. The baseline model achieved 96.7 percent accuracy with a 7.2 percent gender bias gap. Simple swap augmentation reduced the gap to 0.7 percent but lowered accuracy to 95.6 percent. LGSA achieved 99.1 percent accuracy with a 1.9 percent bias gap, improving performance on female-labeled examples. These findings demonstrate that LGSA is an effective strategy for bias mitigation, enhancing subgroup balance while maintaining high task accuracy and label fidelity.

  Two-step approaches combining pre-trained large language model embeddings and anomaly detectors demonstrate strong performance in text anomaly detection by leveraging rich semantic representations. However, high-dimensional dense embeddings extracted by large language models pose challenges due to substantial memory requirements and high computation time. To address this challenge, we introduce the Simplified Isolation Kernel (SIK), which maps high-dimensional dense embeddings to lower-dimensional sparse representations while preserving crucial anomaly characteristics. SIK has linear time complexity and significantly reduces space complexity through its innovative boundary-focused feature mapping. Experiments across 7 datasets demonstrate that SIK achieves better detection performance than 11 state-of-the-art (SOTA) anomaly detection algorithms while maintaining computational efficiency and low memory cost.

  We propose a stress-aware speech-to-speech translation (S2ST) system that preserves word-level emphasis by leveraging LLMs for cross-lingual emphasis conversion. Our method translates source-language stress into target-language tags that guide a controllable TTS model. To overcome data scarcity, we developed a pipeline to automatically generate aligned training data and introduce the "LLM-as-Judge" for evaluation. Experiments show our approach substantially outperforms baselines in preserving emphasis while maintaining comparable translation quality, speaker intent, and naturalness. Our work highlights the importance of prosody in translation and provides an effective, data-efficient solution for preserving paralinguistic cues in S2ST.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become an essential approach for extending the reasoning and knowledge capacity of large language models (LLMs). While prior research has primarily focused on retrieval quality and prompting strategies, the influence of how the retrieved documents are framed, i.e., context format, remains underexplored. We show that seemingly superficial choices, such as delimiters or structural markers in key-value extraction, can induce substantial shifts in accuracy and stability, even when semantic content is identical. To systematically investigate this effect, we design controlled experiments that vary context density, delimiter styles, and positional placement, revealing the underlying factors that govern performance differences. Building on these insights, we introduce Contextual Normalization, a lightweight strategy that adaptively standardizes context representations before generation. Extensive experiments on both controlled and real-world RAG benchmarks across diverse settings demonstrate that the proposed strategy consistently improves robustness to order variation and strengthens long-context utilization. These findings underscore that reliable RAG depends not only on retrieving the right content, but also on how that content is presented, offering both new empirical evidence and a practical technique for better long-context reasoning.

  Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) unlock powerful multimodal reasoning but also expand the attack surface, particularly through adversarial inputs that conceal harmful goals in benign prompts. We propose SHIELD, a lightweight, model-agnostic preprocessing framework that couples fine-grained safety classification with category-specific guidance and explicit actions (Block, Reframe, Forward). Unlike binary moderators, SHIELD composes tailored safety prompts that enforce nuanced refusals or safe redirection without retraining. Across five benchmarks and five representative LVLMs, SHIELD consistently lowers jailbreak and non-following rates while preserving utility. Our method is plug-and-play, incurs negligible overhead, and is easily extendable to new attack types -- serving as a practical safety patch for both weakly and strongly aligned LVLMs.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Detoxification in large language models (LLMs) remains a significant research challenge. Existing decoding detoxification methods are all based on external constraints, which require additional resource overhead and lose generation fluency. This work proposes Detoxification with Self-Constrained Decoding (DSCD), a novel method for LLM detoxification without parameter fine-tuning. DSCD strengthens the inner next-token distribution of the safety layer while weakening that of hallucination and toxic layers during output generation. This effectively diminishes toxicity and enhances output safety. DSCD offers lightweight, high compatibility, and plug-and-play capabilities, readily integrating with existing detoxification methods for further performance improvement. Extensive experiments on representative open-source LLMs and public datasets validate DSCD's effectiveness, demonstrating state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in both detoxification and generation fluency, with superior efficiency compared to existing methods. These results highlight DSCD's potential as a practical and scalable solution for safer LLM deployments.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Chain of thought (CoT) fine-tuning aims to endow large language models (LLMs) with reasoning capabilities by training them on curated reasoning traces. It leverages both supervised and reinforced fine-tuning to cultivate human-like reasoning skills in LLMs, including detailed planning, divergent thinking, intuitive judgment, timely reflection, internal thinking, and fact perception, etc. As CoT fine-tuning has advanced, LLMs have demonstrated substantial improvements in tasks such as mathematical reasoning and code generation. However, existing surveys about CoT fine-tuning primarily focus on technical aspects and overlook a systematic analysis from the perspective of human reasoning mechanisms. Given that the ultimate goal of CoT fine-tuning is to enable LLMs to reason like humans, it is crucial to investigate this technique through the lens of human cognition. To fill this gap, we present the first comprehensive survey of CoT fine-tuning grounded in human reasoning theory. Specifically, inspired by the well-known Six Thinking Hats framework, which systematically characterizes common human thinking modes using six metaphorical hats, we classify and examine CoT fine-tuning methods through this lens. Furthermore, building upon this theory, we outline potential directions for future research in CoT fine-tuning. In addition, we compile a comprehensive overview of existing datasets and model performances, and a real-time GitHub repository \footnote{this https URL} that continuously tracks recent advances in this area is maintained. We hope this survey will serve as a valuable resource to inspire innovation and foster progress in this rapidly evolving field.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  While chain-of-thought (CoT) distillation from advanced large language models (LLMs) has proven effective in general reasoning tasks, it struggles in scientific domains where even advanced models often produce incorrect or superficial reasoning due to high complexity and specialized knowledge requirements. Directly distilling from such flawed outputs results in low-quality training data and limits the performance of smaller student models. To overcome this, we propose CoT-Evo, an evolutionary CoT distillation framework. It begins by constructing a diverse pool of reasoning trajectories from multiple LLM thinkers, enriches them with automatically retrieved domain knowledge, and iteratively refines the trajectories using novelty-driven selection, reflective recombination and mutation. The refinement is guided by a fitness function that evaluates answer correctness, coherence, and effective knowledge utilization. This results in a high-quality CoT dataset tailored for scientific reasoning. We employ this evolved dataset to fine-tune a compact model, which achieves state-of-the-art performance on scientific reasoning benchmarks. Our work establishes a scalable approach to synthesizing high-fidelity scientific reasoning data from diverse and fallible LLMs.

  Most large language models (LLMs) today excel at generating raw, sequential code with minimal abstractions and custom structures. However, there has been little work on graph-based abstract code generation, where significant logic is encapsulated in predefined nodes and execution flow is determined by edges. This is relevant for visual programming languages, and in cases where raw source code is inaccessible to users and LLM training sets. In this work, we propose and evaluate JSON representations for graphs to enable high accuracy graph-based abstract code generation. We evaluate these representations on ScratchTest, a mini-benchmark based on our custom Python re-implementation of Scratch, which tests the LLM in code graph space. Our findings demonstrate that LLMs can indeed perform the aforementioned generation task in a single pass without relying on specialized or complex pipelines, given the correct graph representations. We also show that different representations induce significantly different accuracies, highlighting the instrumental role of representations in this generation task. All in all, this work establishes the first steps towards representation learning for graph-based abstract code generation.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Speculative decoding accelerates LLM inference by using a draft model to look ahead, but gains are capped by the cost of autoregressive draft generation: increasing draft size elevates acceptance rates but introduces additional latency overhead exacerbating the speed-accuracy tradeoff. Prior methods (Medusa, Hydra, EAGLE) partially reduce draft cost but either degrade acceptance or introduce overheads that limit scaling. We present Mirror Speculative Decoding (Mirror-SD), an inference algorithm that breaks the latency-acceptance tradeoff. Mirror-SD launches branch-complete rollouts from early-exit signals in parallel with the target model's suffix and explicitly maps computation across heterogeneous accelerators (GPU and NPU) to exploit cross-device parallelism. The draft speculates forward continuations for the target to verify, while the target simultaneously speculates correction paths for the draft, converting speculation into two complementary execution pipelines. To further cut draft latency without weakening acceptance semantics, we add speculative streaming so the draft emits multiple tokens per step. This dual strategy of parallel heterogeneous execution plus multi-token speculative streaming pushes speculative decoding toward its ideal regime of high acceptance with low overhead. On SpecBench with server-scale models from 14B to 66B parameters, Mirror-SD delivers consistent end-to-end gains, achieving 2.8x-5.8x wall-time speedups across diverse tasks and a 30% average relative improvement over the strongest baseline, EAGLE3.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce MENAValues, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the cultural alignment and multilingual biases of large language models (LLMs) with respect to the beliefs and values of the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, an underrepresented area in current AI evaluation efforts. Drawing from large-scale, authoritative human surveys, we curate a structured dataset that captures the sociocultural landscape of MENA with population-level response distributions from 16 countries. To probe LLM behavior, we evaluate diverse models across multiple conditions formed by crossing three perspective framings (neutral, personalized, and third-person/cultural observer) with two language modes (English and localized native languages: Arabic, Persian, Turkish). Our analysis reveals three critical phenomena: "Cross-Lingual Value Shifts" where identical questions yield drastically different responses based on language, "Reasoning-Induced Degradation" where prompting models to explain their reasoning worsens cultural alignment, and "Logit Leakage" where models refuse sensitive questions while internal probabilities reveal strong hidden preferences. We further demonstrate that models collapse into simplistic linguistic categories when operating in native languages, treating diverse nations as monolithic entities. MENAValues offers a scalable framework for diagnosing cultural misalignment, providing both empirical insights and methodological tools for developing more culturally inclusive AI.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable results in wide range of domains. However, the accuracy and robustness of one-shot LLM predictions remain highly sensitive to the examples and the diversity among ensemble members. This study systematically investigates the effects of example representativeness (one-shot strategy) and output diversity (sampling temperature) on LLM ensemble performance. Two one-shot strategies are compared: centroid-based representative examples (proposed) and randomly sampled examples (baseline) and sampling temperature also is varied. The proposed approach with higher temperature setting significantly outperforms random selection by +7.6% (macro-F1) and -10.5% (RMSE). Furthermore, the proposed model exceeds 5-shot prompting by +21.1% (macro-F1) and -24.0% (RMSE). Our findings demonstrate that combining representative example selection with increased temperature provides the appropriate level of diversity to the ensemble. This work highlights the practical importance of both example selection and controlled diversity in designing effective one-shot LLM ensembles.

  Clinical trials are central to medical progress because they help improve understanding of human health and the healthcare system. They play a key role in discovering new ways to detect, prevent, or treat diseases, and it is essential that clinical trials include participants with appropriate and diverse medical backgrounds. In this paper, we propose a system that leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate multi-label clinical text eligibility classification and summarization. The system combines feature extraction methods such as word embeddings (Word2Vec) and named entity recognition to identify relevant medical concepts, along with traditional vectorization techniques such as count vectorization and TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency). We further explore weighted TF-IDF word embeddings that integrate both count-based and embedding-based strengths to capture term importance effectively. Multi-label classification using Random Forest and SVM models is applied to categorize documents based on eligibility criteria. Summarization techniques including TextRank, Luhn, and GPT-3 are evaluated to concisely summarize eligibility requirements. Evaluation with ROUGE scores demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed methods. This system shows potential for automating clinical trial eligibility assessment using data-driven approaches, thereby improving research efficiency.

  Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) is a promising approach to improve model reliability, yet quantifying the uncertainty of Large Language Models (LLMs) is non-trivial. In this work, we establish a connection between the uncertainty of LLMs and their invariance under semantic-preserving intervention from a causal perspective. Building on this foundation, we propose a novel grey-box uncertainty quantification method that measures the variation in model outputs before and after the semantic-preserving intervention. Through theoretical justification, we show that our method provides an effective estimate of epistemic uncertainty. Our extensive experiments, conducted across various LLMs and a variety of question-answering (QA) datasets, demonstrate that our method excels not only in terms of effectiveness but also in computational efficiency.

  Modern large language models leverage Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures for efficient scaling, but face a critical challenge: functionally similar experts are often selected simultaneously, creating redundant computation and limiting effective model capacity. Existing auxiliary balance loss methods improve token distribution but fail to address the underlying expert diversity problem. We introduce GatePro, a novel parameter-free method that directly promotes expert selection diversity. GatePro identifies the most similar expert pairs and introduces localized competition mechanisms, preventing redundant expert co-activation while maintaining natural expert specialization. Our comprehensive evaluation demonstrates GatePro's effectiveness across model scales and benchmarks. Analysis demonstrates GatePro's ability to achieve enhanced expert diversity, where experts develop more distinct and complementary capabilities, avoiding functional redundancy. This approach can be deployed hot-swappable during any training phase without additional learnable parameters, offering a practical solution for improving MoE effectiveness.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as an important approach for learning from human preferences in aligning large language models (LLMs). However, collecting human preference data is costly and inefficient, motivating methods to reduce the required annotations. In this work, we investigate the impact of \emph{preference variance} (PVar), which measures the variance in model preferences when comparing pairs of responses, on the effectiveness of DPO training. We provide a theoretical insight by establishing an upper bound on the DPO gradient norm for any given prompt, showing it is controlled by the PVar of that prompt. This implies that prompts with low PVar can only produce small gradient updates, making them less valuable for learning. We validate this finding by fine-tuning LLMs with preferences generated by a reward model, evaluating on two benchmarks (AlpacaEval 2.0 and Arena-Hard). Experimental results demonstrate that prompts with higher PVar outperform randomly selected prompts or those with lower PVar. We also show that our PVar-based selection method is robust, when using smaller reward models (1B, 3B) for selection. Notably, in a separate experiment using the original human annotations from the UltraFeedback dataset, we found that training on only the top 10\% of prompts with the highest PVar yields better evaluation performance than training on the full dataset, highlighting the importance of preference variance in identifying informative examples for efficient LLM alignment.

  We introduce a comprehensive continual learning dataset and benchmark (CurlL) grounded in human developmental trajectories from ages 5-10, enabling systematic and fine-grained assessment of models' ability to progressively acquire new skills. CurlL spans five developmental stages (0-4) covering ages 5-10, supported by a skill graph that breaks down broad skills into smaller abilities, concrete goals, and measurable indicators, while also capturing which abilities build on others. We generate a 23.4B-token synthetic dataset with controlled skill progression, vocabulary complexity, and format diversity, comprising paragraphs, comprehension-based QA (CQA), skill-testing QA (CSQA), and instruction-response (IR) pairs. Stage-wise token counts range from 2.12B to 6.78B tokens, supporting precise analysis of forgetting, forward transfer, and backward transfer. Using a 135M-parameter transformer trained under independent, joint, and sequential (continual) setups, we show trade-offs in skill retention and transfer efficiency. By mirroring human learning patterns and providing fine-grained control over skill dependencies, this work advances continual learning evaluations for language models.

  _Yifeng Xiong, Xiaohui Xie_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) enables efficient fine-tuning of large language models but suffers from catastrophic forgetting when learned updates interfere with the dominant singular directions that encode essential pre-trained knowledge. We propose Orthogonal Projection LoRA (OPLoRA), a theoretically grounded approach that prevents this interference through double-sided orthogonal projections. By decomposing frozen weights via SVD, OPLoRA constrains LoRA updates to lie entirely within the orthogonal complement of the top-$k$ singular subspace using projections $P_L = I - U_k U_k^\top$ and $P_R = I - V_k V_k^\top$. We prove that this construction exactly preserves the top-$k$ singular triples, providing mathematical guarantees for knowledge retention. To quantify subspace interference, we introduce $\rho_k$, a metric measuring update alignment with dominant directions. Extensive experiments across commonsense reasoning, mathematics, and code generation demonstrate that OPLoRA significantly reduces forgetting while maintaining competitive task-specific performance on LLaMA-2 7B and Qwen2.5 7B, establishing orthogonal projection as an effective mechanism for knowledge preservation in parameter-efficient fine-tuning.

  The human-like proficiency of Large Language Models (LLMs) has brought concerns about their potential misuse for generating persuasive and personalised disinformation at scale. While prior work has demonstrated that LLMs can generate disinformation, specific questions around persuasiveness and personalisation (generation of disinformation tailored to specific demographic attributes) remain largely unstudied. This paper presents the first large-scale, multilingual empirical study on persona-targeted disinformation generation by LLMs. Employing a red teaming methodology, we systematically evaluate the robustness of LLM safety mechanisms to persona-targeted prompts. A key novel result is AI-TRAITS (AI-generaTed peRsonAlIsed disinformaTion dataSet), a new dataset of around 1.6 million texts generated by eight state-of-the-art LLMs. AI-TRAITS is seeded by prompts that combine 324 disinformation narratives and 150 distinct persona profiles, covering four major languages (English, Russian, Portuguese, Hindi) and key demographic dimensions (country, generation, political orientation). The resulting personalised narratives are then assessed quantitatively and compared along the dimensions of models, languages, jailbreaking rate, and personalisation attributes. Our findings demonstrate that the use of even simple personalisation strategies in the prompts significantly increases the likelihood of jailbreaks for all studied LLMs. Furthermore, personalised prompts result in altered linguistic and rhetorical patterns and amplify the persuasiveness of the LLM-generated false narratives. These insights expose critical vulnerabilities in current state-of-the-art LLMs and offer a foundation for improving safety alignment and detection strategies in multilingual and cross-demographic contexts.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Speculative Decoding (SD) accelerates inference in large language models by using a smaller draft model to propose tokens, which are then verified by a larger target model. However, the throughput gains of SD are fundamentally limited by a trade-off between draft model size and token acceptance: smaller draft models generate tokens more quickly but exhibit greater divergence from the target model, resulting in lower acceptance rates and reduced speedups. We introduce Pyramid Speculative Decoding (PyramidSD), an extension of SD that inserts an intermediate qualifier model between the draft and target to bridge the distributional gap in output predictions, allowing smaller model to be used for drafting. This hierarchical decoding strategy improves alignment across models, enabling higher acceptance rates and allowing the use of significantly smaller draft models without sacrificing overall performance. PyramidSD builds on fuzzy acceptance criteria to support relaxed divergence thresholds at each stage, improving throughput. In experiments, PyramidSD achieves up to 1.91x generation speed over standard SD, reaching 124 tokens per second on a consumer GPU (RTX 4090). In small-memory settings with a 1B-parameter draft model and an 8B target model, PyramidSD minimally trades target model quality for improved throughput. Overall, PyramidSD offers a practical approach to enhancing speculative decoding efficiency and can be readily applied to existing inference pipelines.

  _Angana Borah, Rada Mihalcea_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have expanded their role in human interaction, yet curiosity -- a central driver of inquiry -- remains underexplored in these systems, particularly across cultural contexts. In this work, we investigate cultural variation in curiosity using Yahoo! Answers, a real-world multi-country dataset spanning diverse topics. We introduce CUEST (CUriosity Evaluation across SocieTies), an evaluation framework that measures human-model alignment in curiosity through linguistic (style), topic preference (content) analysis and grounding insights in social science constructs. Across open- and closed-source models, we find that LLMs flatten cross-cultural diversity, aligning more closely with how curiosity is expressed in Western countries. We then explore fine-tuning strategies to induce curiosity in LLMs, narrowing the human-model alignment gap by up to 50\%. Finally, we demonstrate the practical value of curiosity for LLM adaptability across cultures, showing its importance for future NLP research.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) should answer factual questions truthfully, grounded in objective knowledge, regardless of user context such as self-disclosed personal information, or system personalization. In this paper, we present the first systematic evaluation of LLM robustness to inquiry personas, i.e. user profiles that convey attributes like identity, expertise, or belief. While prior work has primarily focused on adversarial inputs or distractors for robustness testing, we evaluate plausible, human-centered inquiry persona cues that users disclose in real-world interactions. We find that such cues can meaningfully alter QA accuracy and trigger failure modes such as refusals, hallucinated limitations, and role confusion. These effects highlight how model sensitivity to user framing can compromise factual reliability, and position inquiry persona testing as an effective tool for robustness evaluation.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recently, several multi-turn dialogue benchmarks have been proposed to evaluate the conversational abilities of large language models (LLMs). As LLMs are increasingly recognized as a key technology for advancing intelligent education, owing to their ability to deeply understand instructional contexts and provide personalized guidance, the construction of dedicated teacher-student dialogue benchmarks has become particularly important. To this end, we present EduDial, a comprehensive multi-turn teacher-student dialogue dataset. EduDial covers 345 core knowledge points and consists of 34,250 dialogue sessions generated through interactions between teacher and student agents. Its design is guided by Bloom's taxonomy of educational objectives and incorporates ten questioning strategies, including situational questioning, zone of proximal development (ZPD) questioning, and metacognitive questioning-thus better capturing authentic classroom interactions. Furthermore, we design differentiated teaching strategies for students at different cognitive levels, thereby providing more targeted teaching guidance. Building on EduDial, we further develop EduDial-LLM 32B via training and propose an 11-dimensional evaluation framework that systematically measures the teaching abilities of LLMs, encompassing both overall teaching quality and content quality. Experiments on 17 mainstream LLMs reveal that most models struggle in student-centered teaching scenarios, whereas our EduDial-LLM achieves significant gains, consistently outperforming all baselines across all metrics.

  _Jan Miller_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The Efficient Adaptive Transformer (EAT) framework unifies three adaptive efficiency techniques - progressive token pruning, sparse attention, and dynamic early exiting - into a single, reproducible architecture for input-adaptive inference. EAT provides an open-source benchmarking pipeline that automates data processing, timing, and ablation across GLUE tasks (SST-2, QQP, MNLI). Although this empirical study finds that combining these mechanisms can increase latency in shallow six-layer models, it demonstrates that EAT achieves slightly higher accuracy than the optimized DistilBERT baseline on SST-2, illustrating the potential of dynamic computation for latency-sensitive NLP. The main contribution is the open, end-to-end reproducible framework - complete with scripts, CSV logging, and analysis utilities - intended to serve as a community tool for further research on adaptive transformers.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision Language Models (VLMs) are pivotal for advancing perception in intelligent agents. Yet, evaluation of VLMs remains limited to predominantly English-centric benchmarks in which the image-text pairs comprise short texts. To evaluate VLM fine-grained abilities, in four languages under long-text settings, we introduce a novel multilingual benchmark VLURes featuring eight vision-and-language tasks, and a pioneering unrelatedness task, to probe the fine-grained Visual and Linguistic Understanding capabilities of VLMs across English, Japanese, and low-resource languages, Swahili, and Urdu. Our datasets, curated from web resources in the target language, encompass ten diverse image categories and rich textual context, introducing valuable vision-language resources for Swahili and Urdu. By prompting VLMs to generate responses and rationales, evaluated automatically and by native speakers, we uncover performance disparities across languages and tasks critical to intelligent agents, such as object recognition, scene understanding, and relationship understanding. We conducted evaluations of ten VLMs with VLURes. The best performing model, GPT-4o, achieves an overall accuracy of 90.8% and lags human performance by 6.7%, though the gap is larger for open-source models. The gap highlights VLURes' critical role in developing intelligent agents to tackle multi-modal visual reasoning.

  _Qianben Chen, Jingyi Cao, Jiayu Zhang, Tianrui Qin, Xiaowan Li, King Zhu, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models split into two families: reasoning-centric LLMs, which strengthen internal chain-of-thought reasoning but cannot invoke external tools, and agentic LLMs, which learn to interact with environments and leverage tools but often lag in deep reasoning. This divide arises from fundamentally different training objectives, leading to mismatched strengths and inefficiency on simple queries, where both families tend to overthink or over-call tools. In this work, we present Adaptive Agent Foundation Model (A\textsuperscript{2}FM), a unified framework that follows a route-then-align principle: the model first learns task-aware routing and then aligns mode-specific trajectories under a shared backbone. To address the inefficiency gap, we introduce a third mode-instant-that handles simple queries directly, preventing unnecessary reasoning or tool calls while complementing the agentic and reasoning modes. To jointly enhance accuracy and efficiency, we propose Adaptive Policy Optimization (APO), which enforces adaptive sampling across modes and applies a cost-regularized reward. On the 32B scale, A\textsuperscript{2}FM achieves 13.4\% on BrowseComp, 70.4\% on AIME25, and 16.7\% on HLE, setting new SOTA among comparable models and performing competitively with frontier LLMs across agentic, reasoning, and general benchmarks. Notably, the adaptive execution achieves a cost of pass of only \$0.00487 per correct answer-cutting cost by 45.2\% relative to reasoning and 33.5\% relative to agentic, thus delivering substantially higher cost efficiency while maintaining comparable accuracy.

  This study investigates how existing annotation guidelines can be repurposed to instruct large language model (LLM) annotators for text annotation tasks. Traditional guidelines are written for human annotators who internalize training, while LLMs require explicit, structured instructions. We propose a moderation-oriented guideline repurposing method that transforms guidelines into clear directives for LLMs through an LLM moderation process. Using the NCBI Disease Corpus as a case study, our experiments show that repurposed guidelines can effectively guide LLM annotators, while revealing several practical challenges. The results highlight the potential of this workflow to support scalable and cost-effective refinement of annotation guidelines and automated annotation.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As large language model (LLM) agents are deployed autonomously in diverse contexts, evaluating their capacity for strategic deception becomes crucial. While recent research has examined how AI systems scheme against human developers, LLM-to-LLM scheming remains underexplored. We investigate the scheming ability and propensity of frontier LLM agents through two game-theoretic frameworks: a Cheap Talk signaling game and a Peer Evaluation adversarial game. Testing four models (GPT-4o, Gemini-2.5-pro, Claude-3.7-Sonnet, and Llama-3.3-70b), we measure scheming performance with and without explicit prompting while analyzing scheming tactics through chain-of-thought reasoning. When prompted, most models, especially Gemini-2.5-pro and Claude-3.7-Sonnet, achieved near-perfect performance. Critically, models exhibited significant scheming propensity without prompting: all models chose deception over confession in Peer Evaluation (100% rate), while models choosing to scheme in Cheap Talk succeeded at 95-100% rates. These findings highlight the need for robust evaluations using high-stakes game-theoretic scenarios in multi-agent settings.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Electronic health records contain inconsistently structured or free-text data, requiring efficient preprocessing to enable predictive health care models. Although artificial intelligence-driven natural language processing tools show promise for automating diagnosis classification, their comparative performance and clinical reliability require systematic evaluation. The aim of this study is to evaluate the performance of 4 large language models (GPT-3.5, GPT-4o, Llama 3.2, and Gemini 1.5) and BioBERT in classifying cancer diagnoses from structured and unstructured electronic health records data. We analyzed 762 unique diagnoses (326 International Classification of Diseases (ICD) code descriptions, 436free-text entries) from 3456 records of patients with cancer. Models were tested on their ability to categorize diagnoses into 14predefined categories. Two oncology experts validated classifications. BioBERT achieved the highest weighted macro F1-score for ICD codes (84.2) and matched GPT-4o in ICD code accuracy (90.8). For free-text diagnoses, GPT-4o outperformed BioBERT in weighted macro F1-score (71.8 vs 61.5) and achieved slightly higher accuracy (81.9 vs 81.6). GPT-3.5, Gemini, and Llama showed lower overall performance on both formats. Common misclassification patterns included confusion between metastasis and central nervous system tumors, as well as errors involving ambiguous or overlapping clinical terminology. Although current performance levels appear sufficient for administrative and research use, reliable clinical applications will require standardized documentation practices alongside robust human oversight for high-stakes decision-making.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across numerous languages; however, their effectiveness in low-resource languages like Persian requires thorough investigation. This paper presents a comprehensive benchmark of several open-source LLMs for Persian Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, utilizing both zero-shot and few-shot learning paradigms. We evaluate models across a range of tasks including sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, reading comprehension, and question answering, using established Persian datasets such as ParsiNLU and ArmanEmo. Our methodology encompasses rigorous experimental setups for both zero-shot and few-shot scenarios, employing metrics such as Accuracy, F1-score, BLEU, and ROUGE for performance evaluation. The results reveal that Gemma 2 consistently outperforms other models across nearly all tasks in both learning paradigms, with particularly strong performance in complex reasoning tasks. However, most models struggle with token-level understanding tasks like Named Entity Recognition, highlighting specific challenges in Persian language processing. This study contributes to the growing body of research on multilingual LLMs, providing valuable insights into their performance in Persian and offering a benchmark for future model development.

  We present ACADATA, a high-quality parallel dataset for academic translation, that consists of two subsets: ACAD-TRAIN, which contains approximately 1.5 million author-generated paragraph pairs across 96 language directions and ACAD-BENCH, a curated evaluation set of almost 6,000 translations covering 12 directions. To validate its utility, we fine-tune two Large Language Models (LLMs) on ACAD-TRAIN and benchmark them on ACAD-BENCH against specialized machine-translation systems, general-purpose, open-weight LLMs, and several large-scale proprietary models. Experimental results demonstrate that fine-tuning on ACAD-TRAIN leads to improvements in academic translation quality by +6.1 and +12.4 d-BLEU points on average for 7B and 2B models respectively, while also improving long-context translation in a general domain by up to 24.9% when translating out of English. The fine-tuned top-performing model surpasses the best propietary and open-weight models on academic translation domain. By releasing ACAD-TRAIN, ACAD-BENCH and the fine-tuned models, we provide the community with a valuable resource to advance research in academic domain and long-context translation.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in text-to-image (T2I) generation have achieved impressive results, yet existing models often struggle with simple or underspecified prompts, leading to suboptimal image-text alignment, aesthetics, and quality. We propose a prompt rewriting framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to refine user inputs before feeding them into T2I backbones. Our approach introduces a carefully designed reward system and an iterative direct preference optimization (DPO) training pipeline, enabling the rewriter to enhance prompts without requiring supervised fine-tuning data. We evaluate our method across diverse T2I models and benchmarks. Results show that our prompt rewriter consistently improves image-text alignment, visual quality, and aesthetics, outperforming strong baselines. Furthermore, we demonstrate strong transferability by showing that a prompt rewriter trained on one T2I backbone generalizes effectively to others without needing to be retrained. We also systematically study scalability, evaluating how performance gains scale with the capacity of the large LLM used as the rewriter. These findings highlight that prompt rewriting is an effective, scalable, and practical model-agnostic strategy for improving T2I systems. We plan to release the code and trained prompt rewriters soon.

  _Qinglin Zhu, Yizhen Yao, Runcong Zhao, Yanzheng Xiang, Amrutha Saseendran, Chen Jin, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Autoregressive (AR) models remain the standard for natural language generation but still suffer from high latency due to strictly sequential decoding. Recent diffusion-inspired approaches, such as LlaDA and Dream, mitigate this by generating in parallel, yet they suffer from two core limitations: information loss, as predictive distributions for non-finalized tokens are discarded at each step, and premature commitment, where local decisions are made without sufficient global coordination. We introduce Latent Refinement Decoding (LRD), a two-stage framework with Latent Refinement and a Predictive Feedback Loop. The first stage maintains masked positions as distributional mixtures of predicted tokens and the mask embedding, allowing the model to establish more globally consistent beliefs. The second stage progressively finalizes confident tokens while retaining uncertain ones for iterative feedback. KL-divergence dynamics provide a principled and reliable criterion for convergence and early stopping. Experiments across coding (HumanEval +6.3, MBPP +2.6) and reasoning (GSM8K +2.9, MATH500 +3.8) show that LRD improves accuracy while delivering speedups of up to 10.6x, making it a strong and versatile alternative for parallel sequence generation.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems enhance large language models (LLMs) with external knowledge but are vulnerable to corpus poisoning and contamination attacks, which can compromise output integrity. Existing defenses often apply aggressive filtering, leading to unnecessary loss of valuable information and reduced reliability in generation. To address this problem, we propose a two-stage semantic filtering and conflict-free framework for trustworthy RAG. In the first stage, we perform a joint filter with semantic and cluster-based filtering which is guided by the Entity-intent-relation extractor (EIRE). EIRE extracts entities, latent objectives, and entity relations from both the user query and filtered documents, scores their semantic relevance, and selectively adds valuable documents into the clean retrieval database. In the second stage, we proposed an EIRE-guided conflict-aware filtering module, which analyzes semantic consistency between the query, candidate answers, and retrieved knowledge before final answer generation, filtering out internal and external contradictions that could mislead the model. Through this two-stage process, SeCon-RAG effectively preserves useful knowledge while mitigating conflict contamination, achieving significant improvements in both generation robustness and output trustworthiness. Extensive experiments across various LLMs and datasets demonstrate that the proposed SeCon-RAG markedly outperforms state-of-the-art defense methods.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As the volume of peer-reviewed research surges, scholars increasingly rely on social platforms for discovery, while authors invest considerable effort in promoting their work to ensure visibility and citations. To streamline this process and reduce the reliance on human effort, we introduce Automatic Promotion (AutoPR), a novel task that transforms research papers into accurate, engaging, and timely public content. To enable rigorous evaluation, we release PRBench, a multimodal benchmark that links 512 peer-reviewed articles to high-quality promotional posts, assessing systems along three axes: Fidelity (accuracy and tone), Engagement (audience targeting and appeal), and Alignment (timing and channel optimization). We also introduce PRAgent, a multi-agent framework that automates AutoPR in three stages: content extraction with multimodal preparation, collaborative synthesis for polished outputs, and platform-specific adaptation to optimize norms, tone, and tagging for maximum reach. When compared to direct LLM pipelines on PRBench, PRAgent demonstrates substantial improvements, including a 604% increase in total watch time, a 438% rise in likes, and at least a 2.9x boost in overall engagement. Ablation studies show that platform modeling and targeted promotion contribute the most to these gains. Our results position AutoPR as a tractable, measurable research problem and provide a roadmap for scalable, impactful automated scholarly communication.

  _Kaiqi Yang, Hang Li, Yucheng Chu, Zitao Liu, Mi Tian, Hui Liu_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Mathematical reasoning serves as a crucial testbed for evaluating the intelligence of large language models (LLMs), and math word problems (MWPs) represent one of the most widely used formats. Most existing MWP datasets contain only the necessary information, while problems with distracting or excessive conditions are often overlooked. Prior studies have shown that popular LLMs experience a dramatic performance drop when such distracting conditions are introduced. However, available datasets of MWPs with distracting conditions remain limited, and most exhibit low difficulty and out-of-context expressions. These shortcomings make the distracting conditions easy to detect and disregard, thereby reducing the credibility of benchmarking on these datasets. Moreover, when distracting conditions are added, the reasoning process and answers may change, requiring intensive manual effort to check and rewrite solutions.To address these issues, we design an iterative framework that leverages LLMs to generate distracting conditions automatically. We develop a set of prompts to revise MWPs from multiple perspectives and cognitive levels, encouraging the creation of meaningful distracting conditions as well as suggestions for further refinement. A key advantage of our framework is the preservation of shared solutions between the original and revised problems: the LLMs are explicitly guided to generate distractions that do not alter the original solution, thus eliminating the need to produce new answers. This framework is efficient and easy to deploy, substantially reducing the effort required to generate MWPs with distracting conditions while maintaining high data quality.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) often suffer from the ``over-thinking'' problem, generating unnecessarily long reasoning on simple tasks. Some strategies have been proposed to mitigate this issue, such as length penalties or routing mechanisms, but they are typically heuristic and task-specific, lacking a general framework for adaptive reasoning. In this paper, we present ARM2, a unified model that adaptively balances reasoning performance and efficiency across multiple formats through a reinforcement learning framework augmented with length-aware optimization. Beyond conventional natural language inference, ARM2 integrates vision understanding, extending its applicability to multimodal. Moreover, ARM2 integrates executable code into reasoning, enabling substantial reductions in token cost while preserving task performance compared to long CoT. Experiments demonstrate that ARM2 achieves performance on par with traditional reasoning models trained with GRPO, while reducing token usage by over 70% on average. We further conduct extensive analyses to validate the effectiveness of ARM2 and the soundness of its design.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reasoning distillation has emerged as an efficient and powerful paradigm for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models. However, reasoning distillation may inadvertently cause benchmark contamination, where evaluation data included in distillation datasets can inflate performance metrics of distilled models. In this work, we formally define the task of distillation data detection, which is uniquely challenging due to the partial availability of distillation data. Then, we propose a novel and effective method Token Probability Deviation (TBD), which leverages the probability patterns of the generated output tokens. Our method is motivated by the analysis that distilled models tend to generate near-deterministic tokens for seen questions, while producing more low-probability tokens for unseen questions. Our key idea behind TBD is to quantify how far the generated tokens' probabilities deviate from a high reference probability. In effect, our method achieves competitive detection performance by producing lower scores for seen questions than for unseen questions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, achieving an AUC of 0.918 and a TPR@1% FPR of 0.470 on the S1 dataset.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used for temporal prediction, but their reliance on pretraining data raises contamination concerns, as accurate predictions on pre-cutoff test data may reflect memorization rather than reasoning, leading to an overestimation of their generalization capability. With the recent emergence of prompting-based unlearning techniques, a natural question arises: Can LLMs be prompted to simulate an earlier knowledge cutoff? In this work, we investigate the capability of prompting to simulate earlier knowledge cutoff in LLMs. We construct three evaluation datasets to assess the extent to which LLMs can forget (1) direct factual knowledge, (2) semantic shifts, and (3) causally related knowledge. Results demonstrate that while prompt-based simulated knowledge cutoffs show effectiveness when directly queried with the information after that date, they struggle to induce forgetting when the forgotten content is not directly asked but causally related to the query. These findings highlight the need for more rigorous evaluation settings when applying LLMs for temporal prediction tasks. The full dataset and evaluation code are available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Sentiment Analysis (SA) models harbor inherent social biases that can be harmful in real-world applications. These biases are identified by examining the output of SA models for sentences that only vary in the identity groups of the subjects. Constructing natural, linguistically rich, relevant, and diverse sets of sentences that provide sufficient coverage over the domain is expensive, especially when addressing a wide range of biases: it requires domain experts and/or crowd-sourcing. In this paper, we present a novel bias testing framework, BTC-SAM, which generates high-quality test cases for bias testing in SA models with minimal specification using Large Language Models (LLMs) for the controllable generation of test sentences. Our experiments show that relying on LLMs can provide high linguistic variation and diversity in the test sentences, thereby offering better test coverage compared to base prompting methods even for previously unseen biases.

  We introduce a variational reasoning framework for language models that treats thinking traces as latent variables and optimizes them through variational inference. Starting from the evidence lower bound (ELBO), we extend it to a multi-trace objective for tighter bounds and propose a forward-KL formulation that stabilizes the training of the variational posterior. We further show that rejection sampling finetuning and binary-reward RL, including GRPO, can be interpreted as local forward-KL objectives, where an implicit weighting by model accuracy naturally arises from the derivation and reveals a previously unnoticed bias toward easier questions. We empirically validate our method on the Qwen 2.5 and Qwen 3 model families across a wide range of reasoning tasks. Overall, our work provides a principled probabilistic perspective that unifies variational inference with RL-style methods and yields stable objectives for improving the reasoning ability of language models.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Extracting individual sentences from a document as evidence or reasoning steps is commonly done in many NLP tasks. However, extracted sentences often lack context necessary to make them understood, e.g., coreference and background information. To this end, we propose a content selection and planning framework for zero-shot decontextualisation, which determines what content should be mentioned and in what order for a sentence to be understood out of context. Specifically, given a potentially ambiguous sentence and its context, we first segment it into basic semantically-independent units. We then identify potentially ambiguous units from the given sentence, and extract relevant units from the context based on their discourse relations. Finally, we generate a content plan to rewrite the sentence by enriching each ambiguous unit with its relevant units. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach is competitive for sentence decontextualisation, producing sentences that exhibit better semantic integrity and discourse coherence, outperforming existing methods.

  Individual Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant capabilities across various domains, such as healthcare and law. Recent studies also show that coordinated multi-agent systems exhibit enhanced decision-making and reasoning abilities through collaboration. However, due to the vulnerabilities of individual LLMs and the difficulty of accessing all agents in a multi-agent system, a key question arises: If attackers only know one agent, could they still generate adversarial samples capable of misleading the collective decision? To explore this question, we formulate it as a game with incomplete information, where attackers know only one target agent and lack knowledge of the other agents in the system. With this formulation, we propose M-Spoiler, a framework that simulates agent interactions within a multi-agent system to generate adversarial samples. These samples are then used to manipulate the target agent in the target system, misleading the system's collaborative decision-making process. More specifically, M-Spoiler introduces a stubborn agent that actively aids in optimizing adversarial samples by simulating potential stubborn responses from agents in the target system. This enhances the effectiveness of the generated adversarial samples in misleading the system. Through extensive experiments across various tasks, our findings confirm the risks posed by the knowledge of an individual agent in multi-agent systems and demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework. We also explore several defense mechanisms, showing that our proposed attack framework remains more potent than baselines, underscoring the need for further research into defensive strategies.

  Large Language Model (LLM)-based web agents demonstrate strong performance on knowledge-intensive tasks but are hindered by context window limitations in paradigms like ReAct. Complex queries involving multiple entities, intertwined relationships, and high uncertainty demand extensive search cycles that rapidly exhaust context budgets before reaching solutions. To overcome this challenge, we introduce ReSum, a novel paradigm that enables indefinite exploration through periodic context summarization. ReSum converts growing interaction histories into compact reasoning states, maintaining awareness of prior discoveries while bypassing context constraints. For paradigm adaptation, we propose ReSum-GRPO, integrating GRPO with segmented trajectory training and advantage broadcasting to familiarize agents with summary-conditioned reasoning. Extensive experiments on web agents across three benchmarks demonstrate that ReSum delivers an average absolute improvement of 4.5% over ReAct, with further gains of 8.2% following ReSum-GRPO training. Notably, with only 1K training samples, our WebResummer-30B (a ReSum-GRPO-trained version of WebSailor-30B) achieves 33.3% Pass@1 on BrowseComp-zh and 18.3% on BrowseComp-en, surpassing most open-source web agents.

  Complex games have long been an important benchmark for testing the progress of artificial intelligence algorithms. AlphaGo, AlphaZero, and MuZero have defeated top human players in Go and Chess, garnering widespread societal attention towards artificial intelligence. Concurrently, large language models (LLMs) have exhibited remarkable capabilities across various tasks, raising the question of whether LLMs can achieve similar success in complex games. In this paper, we explore the potential of LLMs in mastering complex card games. We systematically assess the learning capabilities of LLMs across eight diverse card games, evaluating the impact of fine-tuning on high-quality gameplay data, and examining the models' ability to retain general capabilities while mastering these games. Our findings indicate that: (1) LLMs can approach the performance of strong game AIs through supervised fine-tuning on high-quality data, (2) LLMs can achieve a certain level of proficiency in multiple complex card games simultaneously, with performance augmentation for games with similar rules and conflicts for dissimilar ones, and (3) LLMs experience a decline in general capabilities when mastering complex games, but this decline can be mitigated by integrating a certain amount of general instruction data. The evaluation results demonstrate strong learning ability and versatility of LLMs. The code is available atthis https URL

  Satire, irony, and sarcasm are techniques typically used to express humor and critique, rather than deceive; however, they can occasionally be mistaken for factual reporting, akin to fake news. These techniques can be applied at a more granular level, allowing satirical information to be incorporated into news articles. In this paper, we introduce the first sentence-level dataset for Romanian satire detection for news articles, called SeLeRoSa. The dataset comprises 13,873 manually annotated sentences spanning various domains, including social issues, IT, science, and movies. With the rise and recent progress of large language models (LLMs) in the natural language processing literature, LLMs have demonstrated enhanced capabilities to tackle various tasks in zero-shot settings. We evaluate multiple baseline models based on LLMs in both zero-shot and fine-tuning settings, as well as baseline transformer-based models. Our findings reveal the current limitations of these models in the sentence-level satire detection task, paving the way for new research directions.

  Evaluating instruction-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) in Hindi is challenging due to a lack of high-quality benchmarks, as direct translation of English datasets fails to capture crucial linguistic and cultural nuances. To address this, we introduce a suite of five Hindi LLM evaluation datasets: IFEval-Hi, MT-Bench-Hi, GSM8K-Hi, ChatRAG-Hi, and BFCL-Hi. These were created using a methodology that combines from-scratch human annotation with a translate-and-verify process. We leverage this suite to conduct an extensive benchmarking of open-source LLMs supporting Hindi, providing a detailed comparative analysis of their current capabilities. Our curation process also serves as a replicable methodology for developing benchmarks in other low-resource languages.

  Recent advances in diffusion large language models (dLLMs) have introduced a promising alternative to autoregressive (AR) LLMs for natural language generation tasks, leveraging full attention and denoising-based decoding strategies. However, the deployment of these models on edge devices remains challenging due to their massive parameter scale and high resource demands. While post-training quantization (PTQ) has emerged as a widely adopted technique for compressing AR LLMs, its applicability to dLLMs remains largely unexplored. In this work, we present the first systematic study on quantizing diffusion-based language models. We begin by identifying the presence of activation outliers, characterized by abnormally large activation values that dominate the dynamic range. These outliers pose a key challenge to low-bit quantization, as they make it difficult to preserve precision for the majority of values. More importantly, we implement state-of-the-art PTQ methods and conduct a comprehensive evaluation across multiple task types and model variants. Our analysis is structured along four key dimensions: bit-width, quantization method, task category, and model type. Through this multi-perspective evaluation, we offer practical insights into the quantization behavior of dLLMs under different configurations. We hope our findings provide a foundation for future research in efficient dLLM deployment. Our code is publicly available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  With the surge of large language models (LLMs) and their ability to produce customized output, style-personalized text generation--"write like me"--has become a rapidly growing area of interest. However, style personalization is highly specific, relative to every user, and depends strongly on the pragmatic context, which makes it uniquely challenging. Although prior research has introduced benchmarks and metrics for this area, they tend to be non-standardized and have known limitations (e.g., poor correlation with human subjects). LLMs have been found to not capture author-specific style well, it follows that the metrics themselves must be scrutinized carefully. In this work we critically examine the effectiveness of the most common metrics used in the field, such as BLEU, embeddings, and LLMs-as-judges. We evaluate these metrics using our proposed style discrimination benchmark, which spans eight diverse writing tasks across three evaluation settings: domain discrimination, authorship attribution, and LLM-generated personalized vs non-personalized discrimination. We find strong evidence that employing ensembles of diverse evaluation metrics consistently outperforms single-evaluator methods, and conclude by providing guidance on how to reliably assess style-personalized text generation.

  The growing scale of evaluation tasks has led to the widespread adoption of automated evaluation using LLMs, a paradigm known as "LLM-as-a-judge". However, improving its alignment with human preferences without complex prompts or fine-tuning remains challenging. Previous studies mainly optimize based on shallow outputs, overlooking rich cross-layer representations. In this work, motivated by preliminary findings that middle-to-upper layers encode semantically and task-relevant representations that are often more aligned with human judgments than the final layer, we propose LAGER, a post-hoc, plug-and-play framework for improving the alignment of LLM-as-a-Judge point-wise evaluations with human scores by leveraging internal representations. LAGER produces fine-grained judgment scores by aggregating cross-layer score-token logits and computing the expected score from a softmax-based distribution, while keeping the LLM backbone frozen and ensuring no impact on the inference process. LAGER fully leverages the complementary information across different layers, overcoming the limitations of relying solely on the final layer. We evaluate our method on the standard alignment benchmarks Flask, HelpSteer, and BIGGen using Spearman correlation, and find that LAGER achieves improvements of up to 7.5% over the best baseline across these benchmarks. Without reasoning steps, LAGER matches or outperforms reasoning-based methods. Experiments on downstream applications, such as data selection and emotional understanding, further show the generalization of LAGER.

  Large language models demonstrate proficiency on phonetic tasks, such as rhyming, without explicit phonetic or auditory grounding. In this work, we investigate how \verb|Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct| represents token-level phonetic information. Our results suggest that Llama uses a rich internal model of phonemes to complete phonetic tasks. We provide evidence for high-level organization of phoneme representations in its latent space. In doing so, we also identify a ``phoneme mover head" which promotes phonetic information during rhyming tasks. We visualize the output space of this head and find that, while notable differences exist, Llama learns a model of vowels similar to the standard IPA vowel chart for humans, despite receiving no direct supervision to do so.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multilingual large language models (LLMs) often demonstrate a performance gap between English and non-English languages, particularly in low-resource settings. Aligning these models to low-resource languages is essential yet challenging due to limited high-quality data. While English alignment datasets are readily available, curating equivalent data in other languages is expensive and time-consuming. A common workaround is to translate existing English alignment data; however, standard translation techniques often fail to preserve critical elements such as code, mathematical expressions, and structured formats like JSON. In this work, we investigate LLM-based selective translation, a technique that selectively translates only the translatable parts of a text while preserving non-translatable content and sentence structure. We conduct a systematic study to explore key questions around this approach, including its effectiveness compared to vanilla translation, the importance of filtering noisy outputs, and the benefits of mixing translated samples with original English data during alignment. Our experiments focus on the low-resource Indic language Hindi and compare translations generated by Google Cloud Translation (GCP) and Llama-3.1-405B. The results highlight the promise of selective translation as a practical and effective method for improving multilingual alignment in LLMs.

  _A. Bochkov_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Understanding the locus of semantic representation in large language models (LLMs) is crucial for interpretability and architectural innovation. The dominant paradigm posits that trainable input embeddings serve as foundational "meaning vectors." This paper challenges that view. We construct Transformer models where the embedding layer is entirely frozen, with vectors derived not from data, but from the visual structure of Unicode glyphs. These non-semantic, precomputed visual embeddings are fixed throughout training. Our method is compatible with any tokenizer, including a novel Unicode-centric tokenizer we introduce to ensure universal text coverage. Despite the absence of trainable, semantically initialized embeddings, our models converge, generate coherent text, and, critically, outperform architecturally identical models with trainable embeddings on the MMLU reasoning benchmark. We attribute this to "representational interference" in conventional models, where the embedding layer is burdened with learning both structural and semantic features. Our results indicate that high-level semantics are not inherent to input embeddings but are an emergent property of the Transformer's compositional architecture and data scale. This reframes the role of embeddings from meaning containers to structural primitives. We release all code and models to foster further research.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in Natural Language Processing (NLP) have underscored the crucial role of high-quality datasets in building large language models (LLMs). However, while extensive resources and analyses exist for English, the landscape for East Asian languages - particularly Chinese, Japanese, and Korean (CJK) - remains fragmented and underexplored, despite these languages together serving over 1.6 billion speakers. To address this gap, we investigate the HuggingFace ecosystem from a cross-linguistic perspective, focusing on how cultural norms, research environments, and institutional practices shape dataset availability and quality. Drawing on more than 3,300 datasets, we employ quantitative and qualitative methods to examine how these factors drive distinct creation and curation patterns across Chinese, Japanese, and Korean NLP communities. Our findings highlight the large-scale and often institution-driven nature of Chinese datasets, grassroots community-led development in Korean NLP, and an entertainment- and subculture-focused emphasis on Japanese collections. By uncovering these patterns, we reveal practical strategies for enhancing dataset documentation, licensing clarity, and cross-lingual resource sharing - ultimately guiding more effective and culturally attuned LLM development in East Asia. We conclude by discussing best practices for future dataset curation and collaboration, aiming to strengthen resource development across all three languages.

  _Chenghao Yang, Ari Holtzman_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Despite their impressive capabilities, aligned large language models (LLMs) often generate outputs that lack diversity. What drives this consistency in the generation? We investigate this phenomenon through the lens of probability concentration in the model's output distribution. To quantify this concentration, we introduce the *Branching Factor* (BF)--a token-invariant measure of the effective number of plausible next steps during generation. Our empirical analysis reveals two key findings: (1) BF often decreases as generation progresses, suggesting that LLMs become more predictable as they generate. (2) alignment tuning substantially sharpens the model's output distribution from the outset, reducing BF by nearly an order of magnitude (e.g., from 12 to 1.2) relative to base models. This stark reduction helps explain why aligned models often appear less sensitive to decoding strategies. Building on this insight, we find this consistency has surprising implications for complex reasoning. Aligned Chain-of-Thought (CoT) models (e.g., DeepSeek-distilled models), for instance, leverage this effect; by generating longer reasoning chains, they push generation into later, more deterministic (lower BF) stages, resulting in more stable outputs. We hypothesize that alignment tuning does not fundamentally change a model's behavior, but instead steers it toward stylistic tokens (e.g., ``Sure'') that unlock low-entropy trajectories already present in the base model. This view is supported by nudging experiments, which show prompting base models with such tokens can similarly reduce BF. Together, our findings establish BF as a powerful diagnostic for understanding and controlling LLM outputs - clarifying how alignment reduces variability, how CoT promotes stable generations, and how base models can be steered away from diversity.

  Across languages, numeral systems vary widely in how they construct and combine numbers. While humans consistently learn to navigate this diversity, large language models (LLMs) struggle with linguistic-mathematical puzzles involving cross-linguistic numeral systems, which humans can learn to solve successfully. We investigate why this task is difficult for LLMs through a series of experiments that untangle the linguistic and mathematical aspects of numbers in language. Our experiments establish that models cannot consistently solve such problems unless the mathematical operations in the problems are explicitly marked using known symbols ($+$, $\times$, etc., as in "twenty + three"). In further ablation studies, we probe how individual parameters of numeral construction and combination affect performance. While humans use their linguistic understanding of numbers to make inferences about the implicit compositional structure of numerals, LLMs seem to lack this notion of implicit numeral structure. We conclude that the ability to flexibly infer compositional rules from implicit patterns in human-scale data remains an open challenge for current reasoning models.

  The rapid evolution of communication technologies has led to an explosion of standards, rendering traditional expert-dependent consultation methods inefficient and slow. To address this challenge, we propose \textbf{KG2QA}, a question answering (QA) framework for communication standards that integrates fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) with a domain-specific knowledge graph (KG) via a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline. We construct a high-quality dataset of 6,587 QA pairs from ITU-T recommendations and fine-tune Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, achieving significant performance gains: BLEU-4 increases from 18.86 to 66.90, outperforming both the base model and Llama-3-8B-Instruct. A structured KG containing 13,906 entities and 13,524 relations is built using LLM-assisted triple extraction based on a custom ontology. In our KG-RAG pipeline, the fine-tuned LLMs first retrieves relevant knowledge from KG, enabling more accurate and factually grounded responses. Evaluated by DeepSeek-V3 as a judge, the KG-enhanced system improves performance across five dimensions, with an average score increase of 2.26\%, demonstrating superior factual accuracy and relevance. Integrated with Web platform and API, KG2QA delivers an efficient and interactive user experience. Our code and data have been open-sourcedthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision-language models (VLMs) excel in semantic tasks but falter at a core human capability: detecting hidden content in optical illusions or AI-generated images through perceptual adjustments like zooming. We introduce HC-Bench, a benchmark of 112 images with hidden text, objects, and illusions, revealing that leading VLMs achieve near-zero accuracy (0-5.36%)-even with explicit prompting. Humans resolve such ambiguities instinctively, yet VLMs fail due to an overreliance on high-level semantics. Strikingly, we propose SemVink (Semantic Visual Thinking) by simply scaling images to low resolutions (32-128 pixels), which unlocks >99% accuracy by eliminating redundant visual noise. This exposes a critical architectural flaw: VLMs prioritize abstract reasoning over low-level visual operations crucial for real-world robustness. Our work urges a shift toward hybrid models integrating multi-scale processing, bridging the gap between computational vision and human cognition for applications in medical imaging, security, and beyond.

  The emergence of ChatGPT marked a transformative milestone for Artificial Intelligence (AI), showcasing the remarkable potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate human-like text. This wave of innovation has revolutionized how we interact with technology, seamlessly integrating LLMs into everyday tasks such as vacation planning, email drafting, and content creation. While English-speaking users have significantly benefited from these advancements, the Arabic world faces distinct challenges in developing Arabic-specific LLMs. Arabic, one of the languages spoken most widely around the world, serves more than 422 million native speakers in 27 countries and is deeply rooted in a rich linguistic and cultural heritage. Developing Arabic LLMs (ALLMs) presents an unparalleled opportunity to bridge technological gaps and empower communities. The journey of ALLMs has been both fascinating and complex, evolving from rudimentary text processing systems to sophisticated AI-driven models. This article explores the trajectory of ALLMs, from their inception to the present day, highlighting the efforts to evaluate these models through benchmarks and public leaderboards. We also discuss the challenges and opportunities that ALLMs present for the Arab world.

  _Charlotte Pouw, Afra Alishahi, Willem Zuidema_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We analyze the syntactic sensitivity of Text-to-Speech (TTS) systems using methods inspired by psycholinguistic research. Specifically, we focus on the generation of intonational phrase boundaries, which can often be predicted by identifying syntactic boundaries within a sentence. We find that TTS systems struggle to accurately generate intonational phrase boundaries in sentences where syntactic boundaries are ambiguous (e.g., garden path sentences or sentences with attachment ambiguity). In these cases, systems need superficial cues such as commas to place boundaries at the correct positions. In contrast, for sentences with simpler syntactic structures, we find that systems do incorporate syntactic cues beyond surface markers. Finally, we finetune models on sentences without commas at the syntactic boundary positions, encouraging them to focus on more subtle linguistic cues. Our findings indicate that this leads to more distinct intonation patterns that better reflect the underlying structure.

  Computer-use agents (CUAs) promise to automate complex tasks across operating systems (OS) and the web, but remain vulnerable to indirect prompt injection. Current evaluations of this threat either lack support realistic but controlled environments or ignore hybrid web-OS attack scenarios involving both interfaces. To address this, we propose RedTeamCUA, an adversarial testing framework featuring a novel hybrid sandbox that integrates a VM-based OS environment with Docker-based web platforms. Our sandbox supports key features tailored for red teaming, such as flexible adversarial scenario configuration, and a setting that decouples adversarial evaluation from navigational limitations of CUAs by initializing tests directly at the point of an adversarial injection. Using RedTeamCUA, we develop RTC-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark with 864 examples that investigate realistic, hybrid web-OS attack scenarios and fundamental security vulnerabilities. Benchmarking current frontier CUAs identifies significant vulnerabilities: Claude 3.7 Sonnet | CUA demonstrates an ASR of 42.9%, while Operator, the most secure CUA evaluated, still exhibits an ASR of 7.6%. Notably, CUAs often attempt to execute adversarial tasks with an Attempt Rate as high as 92.5%, although failing to complete them due to capability limitations. Nevertheless, we observe concerning high ASRs in realistic end-to-end settings, with the strongest-to-date Claude 4.5 Sonnet | CUA exhibiting the highest ASR of 60%, indicating that CUA threats can already result in tangible risks to users and computer systems. Overall, RedTeamCUA provides an essential framework for advancing realistic, controlled, and systematic analysis of CUA vulnerabilities, highlighting the urgent need for robust defenses to indirect prompt injection prior to real-world deployment.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  While black-box large language models are widely deployed, they produce generic outputs that overlook individual user preferences. Current personalization methods are fundamentally limited to response-level personalization; they only match final outputs, failing to model the underlying reasoning that connects user behavior to responses. To address this, this work introduces reasoning-level personalization as a new paradigm and proposes RPM, the first systematic framework designed to guide the model's reasoning process using structured rationales constructed from patterns in a user's behavior. RPM constructs a structured model of user behavior-built from response-influential features and statistical factors-to create personalized reasoning paths and retrieve beneficial examples for guiding inference through a feature-based retrieval mechanism. Extensive experiments across four diverse tasks demonstrate that RPM consistently outperforms existing response-level methods while simultaneously enhancing both personalization performance and interpretability, providing a promising direction for black-box LLM personalization.

  _Yukin Zhang, Qi Dong_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable emergent abilities but remain poorly understood at a mechanistic level. This paper introduces the Multi-Scale Probabilistic Generation Theory (MSPGT), a theoretical framework that models LLMs as Hierarchical Variational Information Bottleneck (H-VIB) systems. MSPGT posits that standard language modeling objectives implicitly optimize multi-scale information compression, leading to the spontaneous formation of three internal processing scales-Global, Intermediate, and Local. We formalize this principle, derive falsifiable predictions about boundary positions and architectural dependencies, and validate them through cross-model experiments combining multi-signal fusion and causal interventions. Results across Llama and Qwen families reveal consistent multi-scale organization but strong architecture-specific variations, partially supporting and refining the theory. MSPGT thus advances interpretability from descriptive observation toward predictive, information-theoretic understanding of how hierarchical structure emerges within large neural language models.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) leverage transparent reasoning traces, known as Chain-of-Thoughts (CoTs), to break down complex problems into intermediate steps and derive final answers. However, these reasoning traces introduce unique safety challenges: harmful content can be embedded in intermediate steps even when final answers appear benign. Existing moderation tools, designed to handle generated answers, struggle to effectively detect hidden risks within CoTs. To address these challenges, we introduce ReasoningShield, a lightweight yet robust framework for moderating CoTs in LRMs. Our key contributions include: (1) formalizing the task of CoT moderation with a multi-level taxonomy of 10 risk categories across 3 safety levels, (2) creating the first CoT moderation benchmark which contains 9.2K pairs of queries and reasoning traces, including a 7K-sample training set annotated via a human-AI framework and a rigorously curated 2.2K human-annotated test set, and (3) developing a two-stage training strategy that combines stepwise risk analysis and contrastive learning to enhance robustness. Experiments show that ReasoningShield achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming task-specific tools like LlamaGuard-4 by 35.6% and general-purpose commercial models like GPT-4o by 15.8% on benchmarks, while also generalizing effectively across diverse reasoning paradigms, tasks, and unseen scenarios.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this paper, we introduce S-MedQA, an English medical question-answering (QA) dataset for benchmarking large language models (LLMs) in fine-grained clinical specialties. S-MedQA has over 20k examples, covers 15 medical specialties, and QA pairs can have multiple specialty annotations (e.g., when a question is cross-disciplinary), constructed with both machine and expert verification to maximize data availability. We use S-MedQA to investigate the role of clinical specialty data in the knowledge-intensive scenario of medical QA. Our results show that 1) training on data from a clinical specialty does not necessarily lead to best performance on that specialty, and 2) regardless of the specialty the LLM was fine-tuned on, token probabilities of clinically relevant terms increase consistently across all specialties. Thus, we hypothesize improvement gains are derived mostly from domain shifting (e.g., general to medical) rather than specialty-specific knowledge injection, and suggest rethinking the role of fine-tuning data in the medical domain.

  Language model developers typically filter out high-risk content -- such as toxic or copyrighted text -- from their pre-training data to prevent models from generating similar outputs. However, removing such data altogether limits models' ability to recognize and appropriately respond to harmful or sensitive content. In this paper, we introduce Selective Loss to Understand but Not Generate (SLUNG), a pre-training paradigm through which models learn to understand high-risk data without learning to generate it. Instead of uniformly applying the next-token prediction loss, SLUNG selectively avoids incentivizing the generation of high-risk tokens while ensuring they remain within the model's context window. As the model learns to predict low-risk tokens that follow high-risk ones, it is forced to understand the high-risk content. Through our experiments, we show that SLUNG consistently improves models' understanding of high-risk data (e.g., ability to recognize toxic content) without increasing its generation (e.g., toxicity of model responses). Overall, our SLUNG paradigm enables models to benefit from high-risk text that would otherwise be filtered out.

  Training large language models (LLMs) from scratch requires significant computational resources, driving interest in developing smaller, domain-specific LLMs that maintain both efficiency and strong task performance. Medium-sized models such as LLaMA, llama} have served as starting points for domain-specific adaptation, but they often suffer from accuracy degradation when tested on specialized datasets. We introduce FineScope, a framework for deriving compact, domain-optimized LLMs from larger pretrained models. FineScope leverages the Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) framework, inspired by its ability to produce interpretable feature representations, to extract domain-specific subsets from large datasets. We apply structured pruning with domain-specific constraints, ensuring that the resulting pruned models retain essential knowledge for the target domain. To further enhance performance, these pruned models undergo self-data distillation, leveraging SAE-curated datasets to restore key domain-specific information lost during pruning. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate that FineScope achieves highly competitive performance, outperforming several large-scale state-of-the-art LLMs in domain-specific tasks. Additionally, our results show that FineScope enables pruned models to regain a substantial portion of their original performance when fine-tuned with SAE-curated datasets. Furthermore, applying these datasets to fine-tune pretrained LLMs without pruning also improves their domain-specific accuracy, highlighting the robustness of our approach.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Prompt tuning has emerged as a lightweight strategy for adapting foundation models to downstream tasks, particularly for resource-constrained systems. As pre-trained prompts become valuable assets, combining multiple source prompts offers a promising approach to enhance generalization for new tasks by leveraging complementary knowledge. However, naive aggregation often overlooks different source prompts have different contribution potential to the target task. To address this, we propose HGPrompt, a dynamic framework that learns optimal ensemble weights. These weights are optimized by jointly maximizing an information-theoretic metric for transferability and minimizing gradient conflicts via a novel regularization strategy. Specifically, we propose a differentiable prompt transferability metric to captures the discriminability of prompt-induced features on the target task. Meanwhile, HGPrompt match the gradient variances with respect to different source prompts based on Hessian and Fisher Information, ensuring stable and coherent knowledge transfer while suppressing gradient conflicts among them. Extensive experiments on the large-scale VTAB benchmark demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of HGPrompt, validating its effectiveness in learning an optimal ensemble for effective multi-source prompt transfer.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with large language models (LLMs) has demonstrated strong performance in multilingual question-answering (QA) tasks by leveraging relevant passages retrieved from corpora. In multilingual RAG (mRAG), the retrieved passages can be written in languages other than that of the query entered by the user, making it challenging for LLMs to effectively utilize the provided information. Recent research suggests that retrieving passages from multilingual corpora can improve RAG performance, particularly for low-resource languages. However, the extent to which LLMs can leverage different kinds of multilingual contexts to generate accurate answers, *independently from retrieval quality*, remains understudied. In this paper, we conduct an extensive assessment of LLMs' ability to (i) make consistent use of a relevant passage regardless of its language, (ii) respond in the expected language, and (iii) focus on the relevant passage even when multiple `distracting' passages in different languages are provided in the context. Our experiments with four LLMs across three QA datasets covering a total of 48 languages reveal a surprising ability of LLMs to extract the relevant information from passages in a different language than the query, but a much weaker ability to formulate a full answer in the correct language. Our analysis, based on both accuracy and feature attribution techniques, further shows that distracting passages negatively impact answer quality regardless of their language. However, distractors in the query language exert a slightly stronger influence. Taken together, our findings deepen the understanding of how LLMs utilize context in mRAG systems, providing directions for future improvements.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Test-time scaling enhances large language model performance by allocating additional compute resources during inference. Best-of-N (BoN) sampling serves as a common sampling-based scaling technique, broadening the search space in parallel to find better solutions from the model distribution. However, its cost-performance trade-off is still underexplored. Two main challenges limit the efficiency of BoN sampling: (1) Generating N full samples consumes substantial GPU memory, reducing inference capacity under limited resources. (2) Reward models add extra memory and latency overhead, and training strong reward models introduces potential training data costs. Although some studies have explored efficiency improvements, none have addressed both challenges at once. To address this gap, we propose Self-Truncation Best-of-N (ST-BoN), a decoding method that avoids fully generating all N samples and eliminates the need for reward models. It leverages early sampling consistency in the model's internal states to identify the most promising path and truncate suboptimal ones. In terms of cost, ST-BoN reduces dynamic GPU memory usage by over 80% and inference latency by 50%. In terms of cost-performance trade-off, ST-BoN achieves the same performance as Full-BoN while saving computational cost by 70%-80%, and under the same cost, it can improve accuracy by 3-4 points.

  Retrieval-Augmented Large Language Models (LLMs), which integrate external knowledge, have shown remarkable performance in medical domains, including clinical diagnosis. However, existing RAG methods often struggle to tailor retrieval strategies to diagnostic difficulty and input sample informativeness. This limitation leads to excessive and often unnecessary retrieval, impairing computational efficiency and increasing the risk of introducing noise that can degrade diagnostic accuracy. To address this, we propose ICA-RAG (\textbf{I}nformation \textbf{C}ompleteness Guided \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{R}etrieval-\textbf{A}ugmented \textbf{G}eneration), a novel framework for enhancing RAG reliability in disease diagnosis. ICA-RAG utilizes an adaptive control module to assess the necessity of retrieval based on the input's information completeness. By optimizing retrieval and incorporating knowledge filtering, ICA-RAG better aligns retrieval operations with clinical requirements. Experiments on three Chinese electronic medical record datasets demonstrate that ICA-RAG significantly outperforms baseline methods, highlighting its effectiveness in clinical diagnosis.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced natural language processing, demonstrating strong capabilities in tasks such as text generation, summarization, and reasoning. Recently, their potential for automating precise text editing tasks across specialized domains, such as programming code, LaTeX, and structured database languages, has gained attention. However, current state-of-the-art LLMs still struggle with executing precise, instruction-driven edits, particularly when structural accuracy and strict adherence to domain conventions are required. To address these challenges, we introduce InstrEditBench, an automated benchmark dataset comprising over 30,000 structured editing tasks spanning diverse domains, including Wikipedia articles, LaTeX documents, source code, and database languages. Using this benchmark, we develop FineEdit, a specialized editing model explicitly trained for accurate, context-aware text modifications. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that FineEdit outperforms state-of-the-art models, achieving improvements of approximately 10\% over Gemini models on single-turn edits, up to 30\% over Llama-3.2-3B, and exceeding Mistral-7B-OpenOrca performance by over 40\% on direct editing tasks. FineEdit also effectively generalizes to realistic multi-turn editing scenarios, highlighting its practical applicability. To facilitate further research and reproducibility, we release FineEdit atthis https URL} andthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit impressive reasoning abilities, yet their reliance on structured step-by-step processing reveals a critical limitation. In contrast, human cognition fluidly adapts between intuitive, heuristic (System 1) and analytical, deliberative (System 2) reasoning depending on the context. This difference between human cognitive flexibility and LLMs' reliance on a single reasoning style raises a critical question: while human fast heuristic reasoning evolved for its efficiency and adaptability, is a uniform reasoning approach truly optimal for LLMs, or does its inflexibility make them brittle and unreliable when faced with tasks demanding more agile, intuitive responses? To answer these questions, we explicitly align LLMs to these reasoning styles by curating a dataset with valid System 1 and System 2 answers, and evaluate their performance across reasoning benchmarks. Our results reveal an accuracy-efficiency trade-off: System 2-aligned models excel in arithmetic and symbolic reasoning, while System 1-aligned models perform better in commonsense reasoning tasks. To analyze the reasoning spectrum, we interpolated between the two extremes by varying the proportion of alignment data, which resulted in a monotonic change in accuracy. A mechanistic analysis of model responses shows that System 1 models employ more definitive outputs, whereas System 2 models demonstrate greater uncertainty. Building on these findings, we further combine System 1- and System 2-aligned models based on the entropy of their generations, without additional training, and obtain a dynamic model that outperforms across nearly all benchmarks. This work challenges the assumption that step-by-step reasoning is always optimal and highlights the need for adapting reasoning strategies based on task demands.

  Large language models have been widely applied, but can inadvertently encode sensitive or harmful information, raising significant safety concerns. Machine unlearning has emerged to alleviate this concern; however, existing training-time unlearning approaches, relying on coarse-grained loss combinations, have limitations in precisely separating knowledge and balancing removal effectiveness with model utility. In contrast, we propose Fine-grained Activation manipuLation by Contrastive Orthogonal uNalignment (FALCON), a novel representation-guided unlearning approach that leverages information-theoretic guidance for efficient parameter selection, employs contrastive mechanisms to enhance representation separation, and projects conflict gradients onto orthogonal subspaces to resolve conflicts between forgetting and retention objectives. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FALCON achieves superior unlearning effectiveness while maintaining model utility, exhibiting robust resistance against knowledge recovery attempts.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Current social bias benchmarks for Large Language Models (LLMs) primarily rely on predefined question formats like multiple-choice, limiting their ability to reflect the complexity and open-ended nature of real-world interactions. To close this gap, we extend an existing dataset BBQ (Parrish et al., 2022) to Open-BBQ, a comprehensive framework to evaluate the social bias of LLMs in open-ended settings by incorporating two additional question categories: fill-in-the-blank and short-answer. Since our new Open-BBQ dataset contains a lot of open-ended responses like sentences and paragraphs, we developed an evaluation process to detect biases from open-ended content by labeling sentences and paragraphs. In addition to this, we also found that existing debiasing methods, such as self-debiasing (Gallegos et al., 2024), have over-correction issues, which make the original correct answers incorrect. In order to solve this issue, we propose Composite Prompting, an In-context Learning (ICL) method combining structured examples with explicit chain-of-thought reasoning to form a unified instruction template for LLMs to explicitly identify content that needs debiasing. Experimental results show that the proposed method significantly reduces the bias for both GPT-3.5 and GPT-4o while maintaining high accuracy.

  When exposed to human-generated data, language models are known to learn and amplify societal biases. While previous works introduced benchmarks that can be used to assess the bias in these models, they rely on assumptions that may not be universally true. For instance, a gender bias dimension commonly used by these metrics is that of family--career, but this may not be the only common bias in certain regions of the world. In this paper, we identify topical differences in gender bias across different regions and propose a region-aware bottom-up approach for bias assessment. Our proposed approach uses gender-aligned topics for a given region and identifies gender bias dimensions in the form of topic pairs that are likely to capture gender societal biases. Several of our proposed bias topic pairs are on par with human perception of gender biases in these regions in comparison to the existing ones, and we also identify new pairs that are more aligned than the existing ones. In addition, we use our region-aware bias topic pairs in a Word Embedding Association Test (WEAT)-based evaluation metric to test for gender biases across different regions in different data domains. We also find that LLMs have a higher alignment to bias pairs for highly-represented regions showing the importance of region-aware bias evaluation metric.

  The rapid development of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) raises the question of how they compare to human performance. While existing datasets often feature synthetic or overly simplistic tasks, some models have already surpassed human expert baselines. In this paper, we present MULTI, a Chinese multimodal dataset derived from authentic examination questions. Comprising over 18,000 carefully selected and refined questions, MULTI evaluates models using real-world examination standards, encompassing image-text comprehension, complex reasoning, and knowledge recall. Additionally, We also introduce MULTI-Elite, a 500-question selected hard subset, and MULTI-Extend with more than 4,500 external knowledge context pieces for testing in-context learning capabilities. Our evaluation highlights substantial room for MLLM advancement, with Qwen2-VL-72B achieving a 76.9% accuracy on MULTI and 53.1% on MULTI-Elite leading 25 evaluated models, compared to human expert baselines of 86.1% and 73.1%. MULTI serves not only as a robust evaluation platform but also paves the way for the development of expert-level AI.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Video generation models nowadays are capable of generating visually realistic videos, but often fail to adhere to physical laws, limiting their ability to generate physically plausible videos and serve as ''world models''. To address this issue, we propose PhysMaster, which captures physical knowledge as a representation for guiding video generation models to enhance their physics-awareness. Specifically, PhysMaster is based on the image-to-video task where the model is expected to predict physically plausible dynamics from the input image. Since the input image provides physical priors like relative positions and potential interactions of objects in the scenario, we devise PhysEncoder to encode physical information from it as an extra condition to inject physical knowledge into the video generation process. The lack of proper supervision on the model's physical performance beyond mere appearance motivates PhysEncoder to apply reinforcement learning with human feedback to physical representation learning, which leverages feedback from generation models to optimize physical representations with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) in an end-to-end manner. PhysMaster provides a feasible solution for improving physics-awareness of PhysEncoder and thus of video generation, proving its ability on a simple proxy task and generalizability to wide-ranging physical scenarios. This implies that our PhysMaster, which unifies solutions for various physical processes via representation learning in the reinforcement learning paradigm, can act as a generic and plug-in solution for physics-aware video generation and broader applications.

  Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at general visual reasoning tasks but exhibit sharp performance degradation when applied to novel domains with substantial distribution shifts from pretraining data. Existing domain adaptation approaches finetune different VLM components, but this often results in limited domain-specific feature learning or catastrophic forgetting of prior capabilities. To address these issues, we introduce Vision Contextualized Probing (VisCoP), which augments the VLM's vision encoder with a compact set of learnable visual probes. These probes enable efficient domain-specific adaptation with minimal modification to pretrained parameters. We evaluate VisCoP across three challenging domain adaptation settings-cross-view (exocentric to egocentric), cross-modal (RGB to depth), and cross-task (human understanding to robot control). Experiments show that VisCoP consistently outperforms existing adaptation strategies, achieving superior performance on target domains while effectively retaining source-domain knowledge.

  We introduce Generative Universal Verifier, a novel concept and plugin designed for next-generation multimodal reasoning in vision-language models and unified multimodal models, providing the fundamental capability of reflection and refinement on visual outcomes during the reasoning and generation process. This work makes three main contributions: (1) We build ViVerBench, a comprehensive benchmark spanning 16 categories of critical tasks for evaluating visual outcomes in multimodal reasoning. Results show that existing VLMs consistently underperform across these tasks, underscoring a substantial gap from human-level capability in reliable visual verification. (2) We design two automated pipelines to construct large-scale visual verification data and train OmniVerifier-7B, the first omni-capable generative verifier trained for universal visual verification and achieves notable gains on ViVerBench(+8.3). Through training, we identify three atomic capabilities in visual verification and demonstrate how they generalize and interact synergistically. (3) We propose OmniVerifier-TTS, a sequential test-time scaling paradigm that leverages the universal verifier to bridge image generation and editing within unified models, enhancing the upper bound of generative ability through iterative fine-grained optimization. Beyond generation, we extend universal verifier to broader world-modeling interleaved reasoning scenarios. Empirically, OmniVerifier-TTS achieves improvements on T2I-ReasonBench(+3.7), and GenEval++(+4.3), outperforming existing parallel test-time scaling methods, such as Best-of-N. By endowing multimodal reasoning with reliable visual verification, OmniVerifier advances both reliable reflection during generation and scalable test-time refinement, marking a step toward more trustworthy and controllable next-generation reasoning systems.

  Effective spatio-temporal representation is fundamental to modeling, understanding, and predicting dynamics in videos. The atomic unit of a video, the pixel, traces a continuous 3D trajectory over time, serving as the primitive element of dynamics. Based on this principle, we propose representing any video as a Trajectory Field: a dense mapping that assigns a continuous 3D trajectory function of time to each pixel in every frame. With this representation, we introduce Trace Anything, a neural network that predicts the entire trajectory field in a single feed-forward pass. Specifically, for each pixel in each frame, our model predicts a set of control points that parameterizes a trajectory (i.e., a B-spline), yielding its 3D position at arbitrary query time instants. We trained the Trace Anything model on large-scale 4D data, including data from our new platform, and our experiments demonstrate that: (i) Trace Anything achieves state-of-the-art performance on our new benchmark for trajectory field estimation and performs competitively on established point-tracking benchmarks; (ii) it offers significant efficiency gains thanks to its one-pass paradigm, without requiring iterative optimization or auxiliary estimators; and (iii) it exhibits emergent abilities, including goal-conditioned manipulation, motion forecasting, and spatio-temporal fusion.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this paper, we claim that 3D visual grounding is the cornerstone of spatial reasoning and introduce the Grounded-Spatial Reasoner (GS-Reasoner) to explore the effective spatial representations that bridge the gap between them. Existing 3D LLMs suffer from the absence of a unified 3D representation capable of jointly capturing semantic and geometric information. This deficiency is manifested either in poor performance on grounding or in an excessive reliance on external modules, ultimately hindering the seamless integration of grounding and spatial reasoning. To address this, we propose a simple yet effective dual-path pooling mechanism that tightly aligns geometric features with both semantic and positional cues, constructing a unified image patch-based 3D representation that encapsulates all essential information without increasing the number of input tokens. Leveraging this holistic representation, GS-Reasoner is the first 3D LLM that achieves autoregressive grounding entirely without external modules while delivering performance comparable to state-of-the-art models, establishing a unified and self-contained framework for 3D spatial reasoning. To further bridge grounding and spatial reasoning, we introduce the Grounded Chain-of-Thought (GCoT) dataset. This dataset is meticulously curated to include both 3D bounding box annotations for objects referenced in reasoning questions and step-by-step reasoning paths that integrate grounding as a core component of the problem-solving process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GS-Reasoner achieves impressive results on 3D visual grounding, which in turn significantly enhances its spatial reasoning capabilities, leading to state-of-the-art performance.

  Fully open multimodal large language models (MLLMs) currently lag behind proprietary counterparts, primarily due to a significant gap in data quality for supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Existing open-source datasets are often plagued by widespread noise and a critical deficit in complex reasoning data, such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT), which hinders the development of advanced model capabilities. Addressing these challenges, our work makes three primary contributions. First, we introduce Honey-Data-15M, a new SFT dataset comprising approximately 15 million QA pairs, processed through multiple cleaning techniques and enhanced with a novel dual-level (short and long) CoT enrichment strategy. Second, we introduce HoneyPipe, the data curation pipeline, and its underlying framework DataStudio, providing the community with a transparent and adaptable methodology for data curation that moves beyond static dataset releases. Finally, to validate our dataset and pipeline, we train Bee-8B, an 8B model on Honey-Data-15M. Experiments show that Bee-8B establishes a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) for fully open MLLMs, achieving performance that is competitive with, and in some cases surpasses, recent semi-open models such as InternVL3.5-8B. Our work delivers to the community a suite of foundational resources, including: the Honey-Data-15M corpus; the full-stack suite comprising HoneyPipe and DataStudio; training recipes; an evaluation harness; and the model weights. This effort demonstrates that a principled focus on data quality is a key pathway to developing fully open MLLMs that are highly competitive with their semi-open counterparts.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Story continuation focuses on generating the next image in a narrative sequence so that it remains coherent with both the ongoing text description and the previously observed images. A central challenge in this setting lies in utilizing prior visual context effectively, while ensuring semantic alignment with the current textual input. In this work, we introduce AVC (Adaptive Visual Conditioning), a framework for diffusion-based story continuation. AVC employs the CLIP model to retrieve the most semantically aligned image from previous frames. Crucially, when no sufficiently relevant image is found, AVC adaptively restricts the influence of prior visuals to only the early stages of the diffusion process. This enables the model to exploit visual context when beneficial, while avoiding the injection of misleading or irrelevant information. Furthermore, we improve data quality by re-captioning a noisy dataset using large language models, thereby strengthening textual supervision and semantic alignment. Quantitative results and human evaluations demonstrate that AVC achieves superior coherence, semantic consistency, and visual fidelity compared to strong baselines, particularly in challenging cases where prior visuals conflict with the current input.

  Unified multimodal models aim to jointly enable visual understanding and generation, yet current benchmarks rarely examine their true integration. Existing evaluations either treat the two abilities in isolation or overlook tasks that inherently couple them. To address this gap, we present Uni-MMMU, a comprehensive and discipline-aware benchmark that systematically unfolds the bidirectional synergy between generation and understanding across eight reasoning-centric domains, including science, coding, mathematics, and puzzles. Each task is bidirectionally coupled, demanding models to (i) leverage conceptual understanding to guide precise visual synthesis, or (ii) utilize generation as a cognitive scaffold for analytical reasoning. Uni-MMMU incorporates verifiable intermediate reasoning steps, unique ground truths, and a reproducible scoring protocol for both textual and visual outputs. Through extensive evaluation of state-of-the-art unified, generation-only, and understanding-only models, we reveal substantial performance disparities and cross-modal dependencies, offering new insights into when and how these abilities reinforce one another, and establishing a reliable foundation for advancing unified models.

  Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) struggle with precise reasoning for structured visuals like charts and diagrams, as pixel-based perception lacks a mechanism for verification. To address this, we propose to leverage derendering -- the process of reverse-engineering visuals into executable code -- as a new modality for verifiable visual reasoning. Specifically, we propose RECODE, an agentic framework that first generates multiple candidate programs to reproduce the input image. It then uses a critic to select the most faithful reconstruction and iteratively refines the code. This process not only transforms an ambiguous perceptual task into a verifiable, symbolic problem, but also enables precise calculations and logical inferences later on. On various visual reasoning benchmarks such as CharXiv, ChartQA, and Geometry3K, RECODE significantly outperforms methods that do not leverage code or only use code for drawing auxiliary lines or cropping. Our work demonstrates that grounding visual perception in executable code provides a new path toward more accurate and verifiable multimodal reasoning.

We design a multi-stage training strategy to ensure robust cross-modal capabilities, including pre-training for omni-modal understanding, followed by post-training with speech conversation and audio-visual interaction. To enable human-like long-term conversational ability, we meticulously curate a multi-turn training dataset that enhances the model's ability to handle complex and multi-turn interactions. To effectively evaluate the multi-turn memory and speech interaction capabilities, we construct the multi-modal multi-turn memory benchmark and the multi-turn speech interaction benchmark. Experiments demonstrate that InteractiveOmni significantly outperforms leading open-source models and provides a more intelligent multi-turn audio-visual experience, particularly in its long-term memory capabilities. Notably, InteractiveOmni-4B is comparable to the much larger model like Qwen2.5-Omni-7B on general benchmarks, and it can retain 97% of the performance of the InteractiveOmni-8B while utilizing only 50% of the model size. Achieving state-of-the-art results against similarly sized models across image, audio, video understanding, and speech generation tasks, InteractiveOmni is an accessible, open-source foundation for next-generation intelligent interactive systems.

  Computational replication of Chinese calligraphy remains challenging. Existing methods falter, either creating high-quality isolated characters while ignoring page-level aesthetics like ligatures and spacing, or attempting page synthesis at the expense of calligraphic correctness. We introduce \textbf{UniCalli}, a unified diffusion framework for column-level recognition and generation. Training both tasks jointly is deliberate: recognition constrains the generator to preserve character structure, while generation provides style and layout priors. This synergy fosters concept-level abstractions that improve both tasks, especially in limited-data regimes. We curated a dataset of over 8,000 digitized pieces, with ~4,000 densely annotated. UniCalli employs asymmetric noising and a rasterized box map for spatial priors, trained on a mix of synthetic, labeled, and unlabeled data. The model achieves state-of-the-art generative quality with superior ligature continuity and layout fidelity, alongside stronger recognition. The framework successfully extends to other ancient scripts, including Oracle bone inscriptions and Egyptian hieroglyphs. Code and data can be viewed in \href{this https URL}{this URL}.

  Vision graph neural networks (ViG) have demonstrated promise in vision tasks as a competitive alternative to conventional convolutional neural nets (CNN) and transformers (ViTs); however, common graph construction methods, such as k-nearest neighbor (KNN), can be expensive on larger images. While methods such as Sparse Vision Graph Attention (SVGA) have shown promise, SVGA's fixed step scale can lead to over-squashing and missing multiple connections to gain the same information that could be gained from a long-range link. Through this observation, we propose a new graph construction method, Logarithmic Scalable Graph Construction (LSGC) to enhance performance by limiting the number of long-range links. To this end, we propose LogViG, a novel hybrid CNN-GNN model that utilizes LSGC. Furthermore, inspired by the successes of multi-scale and high-resolution architectures, we introduce and apply a high-resolution branch and fuse features between our high-resolution and low-resolution branches for a multi-scale high-resolution Vision GNN network. Extensive experiments show that LogViG beats existing ViG, CNN, and ViT architectures in terms of accuracy, GMACs, and parameters on image classification and semantic segmentation tasks. Our smallest model, Ti-LogViG, achieves an average top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K of 79.9% with a standard deviation of 0.2%, 1.7% higher average accuracy than Vision GNN with a 24.3% reduction in parameters and 35.3% reduction in GMACs. Our work shows that leveraging long-range links in graph construction for ViGs through our proposed LSGC can exceed the performance of current state-of-the-art ViGs.

  Synthesizing high-quality images from low-field MRI holds significant potential. Low-field MRI is cheaper, more accessible, and safer, but suffers from low resolution and poor signal-to-noise ratio. This synthesis process can reduce reliance on costly acquisitions and expand data availability. However, synthesizing high-field MRI still suffers from a clinical fidelity gap. There is a need to preserve anatomical fidelity, enhance fine-grained structural details, and bridge domain gaps in image contrast. To address these issues, we propose a \emph{cyclic self-supervised diffusion (CSS-Diff)} framework for high-field MRI synthesis from real low-field MRI data. Our core idea is to reformulate diffusion-based synthesis under a cycle-consistent constraint. It enforces anatomical preservation throughout the generative process rather than just relying on paired pixel-level supervision. The CSS-Diff framework further incorporates two novel processes. The slice-wise gap perception network aligns inter-slice inconsistencies via contrastive learning. The local structure correction network enhances local feature restoration through self-reconstruction of masked and perturbed patches. Extensive experiments on cross-field synthesis tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, achieving state-of-the-art performance (e.g., 31.80 $\pm$ 2.70 dB in PSNR, 0.943 $\pm$ 0.102 in SSIM, and 0.0864 $\pm$ 0.0689 in LPIPS). Beyond pixel-wise fidelity, our method also preserves fine-grained anatomical structures compared with the original low-field MRI (e.g., left cerebral white matter error drops from 12.1$\%$ to 2.1$\%$, cortex from 4.2$\%$ to 3.7$\%$). To conclude, our CSS-Diff can synthesize images that are both quantitatively reliable and anatomically consistent.

  We present LiFMCR, a novel dataset for the registration of multiple micro lens array (MLA)-based light field cameras. While existing light field datasets are limited to single-camera setups and typically lack external ground truth, LiFMCR provides synchronized image sequences from two high-resolution Raytrix R32 plenoptic cameras, together with high-precision 6-degrees of freedom (DoF) poses recorded by a Vicon motion capture system. This unique combination enables rigorous evaluation of multi-camera light field registration methods.As a baseline, we provide two complementary registration approaches: a robust 3D transformation estimation via a RANSAC-based method using cross-view point clouds, and a plenoptic PnP algorithm estimating extrinsic 6-DoF poses from single light field images. Both explicitly integrate the plenoptic camera model, enabling accurate and scalable multi-camera registration. Experiments show strong alignment with the ground truth, supporting reliable multi-view light field processing.Project page:this https URL

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The Circle of Willis (CoW) is a critical network of arteries in the brain, often implicated in cerebrovascular pathologies. Voxel-level segmentation is an important first step toward an automated CoW assessment, but a full quantitative analysis requires centerline representations. However, conventional skeletonization techniques often struggle to extract reliable centerlines due to the CoW's complex geometry, and publicly available centerline datasets remain scarce. To address these challenges, we used a thinning-based skeletonization algorithm to extract and curate centerline graphs and morphometric features from the TopCoW dataset, which includes 200 stroke patients, each imaged with MRA and CTA. The curated graphs were used to develop a baseline algorithm for centerline and feature extraction, combining U-Net-based skeletonization with A* graph connection. Performance was evaluated on a held-out test set, focusing on anatomical accuracy and feature robustness. Further, we used the extracted features to predict the frequency of fetal PCA variants, confirm theoretical bifurcation optimality relations, and detect subtle modality differences. The baseline algorithm consistently reconstructed graph topology with high accuracy (F1 = 1), and the average Euclidean node distance between reference and predicted graphs was below one voxel. Features such as segment radius, length, and bifurcation ratios showed strong robustness, with median relative errors below 5% and Pearson correlations above 0.95. Our results demonstrate the utility of learning-based skeletonization combined with graph connection for anatomically plausible centerline extraction. We emphasize the importance of going beyond simple voxel-based measures by evaluating anatomical accuracy and feature robustness. The dataset and baseline algorithm have been released to support further method development and clinical research.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multi-view generation with camera pose control and prompt-based customization are both essential elements for achieving controllable generative models. However, existing multi-view generation models do not support customization with geometric consistency, whereas customization models lack explicit viewpoint control, making them challenging to unify. Motivated by these gaps, we introduce a novel task, multi-view customization, which aims to jointly achieve multi-view camera pose control and customization. Due to the scarcity of training data in customization, existing multi-view generation models, which inherently rely on large-scale datasets, struggle to generalize to diverse prompts. To address this, we propose MVCustom, a novel diffusion-based framework explicitly designed to achieve both multi-view consistency and customization fidelity. In the training stage, MVCustom learns the subject's identity and geometry using a feature-field representation, incorporating the text-to-video diffusion backbone enhanced with dense spatio-temporal attention, which leverages temporal coherence for multi-view consistency. In the inference stage, we introduce two novel techniques: depth-aware feature rendering explicitly enforces geometric consistency, and consistent-aware latent completion ensures accurate perspective alignment of the customized subject and surrounding backgrounds. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MVCustom is the only framework that simultaneously achieves faithful multi-view generation and customization.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  One of the key challenges of modern AI models is ensuring that they provide helpful responses to benign queries while refusing malicious ones. But often, the models are vulnerable to multimodal queries with harmful intent embedded in images. One approach for safety alignment is training with extensive safety datasets at the significant costs in both dataset curation and training. Inference-time alignment mitigates these costs, but introduces two drawbacks: excessive refusals from misclassified benign queries and slower inference speed due to iterative output adjustments. To overcome these limitations, we propose to reformulate queries to strengthen cross-modal attention to safety-critical image regions, enabling accurate risk assessment at the query level. Using the assessed risk, it adaptively steers activations to generate responses that are safe and helpful without overhead from iterative output adjustments. We call this Risk-adaptive Activation Steering (RAS). Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks on multimodal safety and utility demonstrate that the RAS significantly reduces attack success rates, preserves general task performance, and improves inference speed over prior inference-time defenses.

  _Ana Lawry Aguila, Peirong Liu, Marina Crespo Aguirre, Juan Eugenio Iglesias_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Generating healthy counterfactuals from pathological images holds significant promise in medical imaging, e.g., in anomaly detection or for application of analysis tools that are designed for healthy scans. These counterfactuals should represent what a patient's scan would plausibly look like in the absence of pathology, preserving individual anatomical characteristics while modifying only the pathological regions. Denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) have become popular methods for generating healthy counterfactuals of pathology data. Typically, this involves training on solely healthy data with the assumption that a partial denoising process will be unable to model disease regions and will instead reconstruct a closely matched healthy counterpart. More recent methods have incorporated synthetic pathological images to better guide the diffusion process. However, it remains challenging to guide the generative process in a way that effectively balances the removal of anomalies with the retention of subject-specific features. To solve this problem, we propose a novel application of denoising diffusion bridge models (DDBMs) - which, unlike DDPMs, condition the diffusion process not only on the initial point (i.e., the healthy image), but also on the final point (i.e., a corresponding synthetically generated pathological image). Treating the pathological image as a structurally informative prior enables us to generate counterfactuals that closely match the patient's anatomy while selectively removing pathology. The results show that our DDBM outperforms previously proposed diffusion models and fully supervised approaches at segmentation and anomaly detection tasks.

  _Xinyang Li, Tengfei Wang, Zixiao Gu, Shengchuan Zhang, Chunchao Guo, Liujuan Cao_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We propose FlashWorld, a generative model that produces 3D scenes from a single image or text prompt in seconds, 10~100$\times$ faster than previous works while possessing superior rendering quality. Our approach shifts from the conventional multi-view-oriented (MV-oriented) paradigm, which generates multi-view images for subsequent 3D reconstruction, to a 3D-oriented approach where the model directly produces 3D Gaussian representations during multi-view generation. While ensuring 3D consistency, 3D-oriented method typically suffers poor visual quality. FlashWorld includes a dual-mode pre-training phase followed by a cross-mode post-training phase, effectively integrating the strengths of both paradigms. Specifically, leveraging the prior from a video diffusion model, we first pre-train a dual-mode multi-view diffusion model, which jointly supports MV-oriented and 3D-oriented generation modes. To bridge the quality gap in 3D-oriented generation, we further propose a cross-mode post-training distillation by matching distribution from consistent 3D-oriented mode to high-quality MV-oriented mode. This not only enhances visual quality while maintaining 3D consistency, but also reduces the required denoising steps for inference. Also, we propose a strategy to leverage massive single-view images and text prompts during this process to enhance the model's generalization to out-of-distribution inputs. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority and efficiency of our method.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Open-domain visual entity recognition aims to identify and link entities depicted in images to a vast and evolving set of real-world concepts, such as those found in Wikidata. Unlike conventional classification tasks with fixed label sets, it operates under open-set conditions, where most target entities are unseen during training and exhibit long-tail distributions. This makes the task inherently challenging due to limited supervision, high visual ambiguity, and the need for semantic disambiguation. In this work, we propose a Knowledge-guided Contrastive Learning (KnowCoL) framework that combines both images and text descriptions into a shared semantic space grounded by structured information from Wikidata. By abstracting visual and textual inputs to a conceptual level, the model leverages entity descriptions, type hierarchies, and relational context to support zero-shot entity recognition. We evaluate our approach on the OVEN benchmark, a large-scale open-domain visual recognition dataset with Wikidata IDs as the label space. Our experiments show that using visual, textual, and structured knowledge greatly improves accuracy, especially for rare and unseen entities. Our smallest model improves the accuracy on unseen entities by 10.5% compared to the state-of-the-art, despite being 35 times smaller.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Masked autoregressive models (MAR) have recently emerged as a powerful paradigm for image and video generation, combining the flexibility of masked modeling with the potential of continuous tokenizer. However, video MAR models suffer from two major limitations: the slow-start problem, caused by the lack of a structured global prior at early sampling stages, and error accumulation across the autoregression in both spatial and temporal dimensions. In this work, we propose CanvasMAR, a novel video MAR model that mitigates these issues by introducing a canvas mechanism--a blurred, global prediction of the next frame, used as the starting point for masked generation. The canvas provides global structure early in sampling, enabling faster and more coherent frame synthesis. Furthermore, we introduce compositional classifier-free guidance that jointly enlarges spatial (canvas) and temporal conditioning, and employ noise-based canvas augmentation to enhance robustness. Experiments on the BAIR and Kinetics-600 benchmarks demonstrate that CanvasMAR produces high-quality videos with fewer autoregressive steps. Our approach achieves remarkable performance among autoregressive models on Kinetics-600 dataset and rivals diffusion-based methods.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Current 3D gaze estimation methods struggle to generalize across diverse data domains, primarily due to i) the scarcity of annotated datasets, and ii) the insufficient diversity of labeled data. In this work, we present OmniGaze, a semi-supervised framework for 3D gaze estimation, which utilizes large-scale unlabeled data collected from diverse and unconstrained real-world environments to mitigate domain bias and generalize gaze estimation in the wild. First, we build a diverse collection of unlabeled facial images, varying in facial appearances, background environments, illumination conditions, head poses, and eye occlusions. In order to leverage unlabeled data spanning a broader distribution, OmniGaze adopts a standard pseudo-labeling strategy and devises a reward model to assess the reliability of pseudo labels. Beyond pseudo labels as 3D direction vectors, the reward model also incorporates visual embeddings extracted by an off-the-shelf visual encoder and semantic cues from gaze perspective generated by prompting a Multimodal Large Language Model to compute confidence scores. Then, these scores are utilized to select high-quality pseudo labels and weight them for loss computation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OmniGaze achieves state-of-the-art performance on five datasets under both in-domain and cross-domain settings. Furthermore, we also evaluate the efficacy of OmniGaze as a scalable data engine for gaze estimation, which exhibits robust zero-shot generalization on four unseen datasets.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in foundation models have driven remarkable progress in image editing, yet their extension to 3D editing remains underexplored. A natural approach is to replace the image editing modules in existing workflows with foundation models. However, their heavy computational demands and the restrictions and costs of closed-source APIs make plugging these models into existing iterative editing strategies impractical. To address this limitation, we propose EditCast3D, a pipeline that employs video generation foundation models to propagate edits from a single first frame across the entire dataset prior to reconstruction. While editing propagation enables dataset-level editing via video models, its consistency remains suboptimal for 3D reconstruction, where multi-view alignment is essential. To overcome this, EditCast3D introduces a view selection strategy that explicitly identifies consistent and reconstruction-friendly views and adopts feedforward reconstruction without requiring costly refinement. In combination, the pipeline both minimizes reliance on expensive image editing and mitigates prompt ambiguities that arise when applying foundation models independently across images. We evaluate EditCast3D on commonly used 3D editing datasets and compare it against state-of-the-art 3D editing baselines, demonstrating superior editing quality and high efficiency. These results establish EditCast3D as a scalable and general paradigm for integrating foundation models into 3D editing pipelines. The code is available atthis https URL

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Diffusion models have recently achieved significant success in various image manipulation tasks, including image super-resolution and perceptual quality enhancement. Pretrained text-to-image models, such as Stable Diffusion, have exhibited strong capabilities in synthesizing realistic image content, which makes them particularly attractive for addressing super-resolution tasks. While some existing approaches leverage these models to achieve state-of-the-art results, they often struggle when applied to diverse and highly degraded images, leading to noise amplification or incorrect content generation. To address these limitations, we propose a contextually precise image super-resolution framework that effectively maintains both local and global pixel relationships through Local-Global Context-Aware Attention, enabling the generation of high-quality images. Furthermore, we propose a distribution- and perceptual-aligned conditioning mechanism in the pixel space to enhance perceptual fidelity. This mechanism captures fine-grained pixel-level representations while progressively preserving and refining structural information, transitioning from local content details to the global structural composition. During inference, our method generates high-quality images that are structurally consistent with the original content, mitigating artifacts and ensuring realistic detail restoration. Extensive experiments on multiple super-resolution benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in producing high-fidelity, perceptually accurate reconstructions.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Foundation models such as DINOv2 have shown strong performance in few-shot anomaly detection, yet two key questions remain unexamined: (i) how susceptible are these detectors to adversarial perturbations; and (ii) how well do their anomaly scores reflect calibrated uncertainty? Building on AnomalyDINO, a training-free deep nearest-neighbor detector over DINOv2 features, we present one of the first systematic studies of adversarial attacks and uncertainty estimation in this setting. To enable white-box gradient attacks while preserving test-time behavior, we attach a lightweight linear head to frozen DINOv2 features only for crafting perturbations. Using this heuristic, we evaluate the impact of FGSM across the MVTec-AD and VisA datasets and observe consistent drops in F1, AUROC, AP, and G-mean, indicating that imperceptible perturbations can flip nearest-neighbor relations in feature space to induce confident misclassification. Complementing robustness, we probe reliability and find that raw anomaly scores are poorly calibrated, revealing a gap between confidence and correctness that limits safety-critical use. As a simple, strong baseline toward trustworthiness, we apply post-hoc Platt scaling to the anomaly scores for uncertainty estimation. The resulting calibrated posteriors yield significantly higher predictive entropy on adversarially perturbed inputs than on clean ones, enabling a practical flagging mechanism for attack detection while reducing calibration error (ECE). Our findings surface concrete vulnerabilities in DINOv2-based few-shot anomaly detectors and establish an evaluation protocol and baseline for robust, uncertainty-aware anomaly detection. We argue that adversarial robustness and principled uncertainty quantification are not optional add-ons but essential capabilities if anomaly detection systems are to be trustworthy and ready for real-world deployment.

  Medical image enhancement is crucial for improving the quality and interpretability of diagnostic images, ultimately supporting early detection, accurate diagnosis, and effective treatment planning. Despite advancements in imaging technologies such as X-ray, CT, MRI, and ultrasound, medical images often suffer from challenges like noise, artifacts, and low contrast, which limit their diagnostic potential. Addressing these challenges requires robust preprocessing, denoising algorithms, and advanced enhancement methods, with deep learning techniques playing an increasingly significant role. This systematic literature review, following the PRISMA approach, investigates the key challenges, recent advancements, and evaluation metrics in medical image enhancement. By analyzing findings from 39 peer-reviewed studies, this review provides insights into the effectiveness of various enhancement methods across different imaging modalities and the importance of evaluation metrics in assessing their impact. Key issues like low contrast and noise are identified as the most frequent, with MRI and multi-modal imaging receiving the most attention, while specialized modalities such as histopathology, endoscopy, and bone scintigraphy remain underexplored. Out of the 39 studies, 29 utilize conventional mathematical methods, 9 focus on deep learning techniques, and 1 explores a hybrid approach. In terms of image quality assessment, 18 studies employ both reference-based and non-reference-based metrics, 9 rely solely on reference-based metrics, and 12 use only non-reference-based metrics, with a total of 65 IQA metrics introduced, predominantly non-reference-based. This review highlights current limitations, research gaps, and potential future directions for advancing medical image enhancement.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Anomaly recognition plays a vital role in surveillance, transportation, healthcare, and public safety. However, most existing approaches rely solely on visual data, making them unreliable under challenging conditions such as occlusion, low illumination, and adverse weather. Moreover, the absence of large-scale synchronized audio-visual datasets has hindered progress in multimodal anomaly recognition. To address these limitations, this study presents AVAR-Net, a lightweight and efficient audio-visual anomaly recognition framework designed for real-world environments. AVAR-Net consists of four main modules: an audio feature extractor, a video feature extractor, fusion strategy, and a sequential pattern learning network that models cross-modal relationships for anomaly recognition. Specifically, the Wav2Vec2 model extracts robust temporal features from raw audio, while MobileViT captures both local and global visual representations from video frames. An early fusion mechanism combines these modalities, and a Multi-Stage Temporal Convolutional Network (MTCN) model that learns long-range temporal dependencies within the fused representation, enabling robust spatiotemporal reasoning. A novel Visual-Audio Anomaly Recognition (VAAR) dataset, is also introduced, serving as a medium-scale benchmark containing 3,000 real-world videos with synchronized audio across ten diverse anomaly classes. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that AVAR-Net achieves 89.29% accuracy on VAAR and 88.56% Average Precision on the XD-Violence dataset, improving Average Precision by 2.8% over existing state-of-the-art methods. These results highlight the effectiveness, efficiency, and generalization capability of the proposed framework, as well as the utility of VAAR as a benchmark for advancing multimodal anomaly recognition research.

  Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)-based object detection with visible (RGB) and infrared (IR) images facilitates robust around-the-clock detection, driven by advancements in deep learning techniques and the availability of high-quality dataset. However, the existing dataset struggles to fully capture real-world complexity for limited imaging conditions. To this end, we introduce a high-diversity dataset ATR-UMOD covering varying scenarios, spanning altitudes from 80m to 300m, angles from 0¬∞ to 75¬∞, and all-day, all-year time variations in rich weather and illumination conditions. Moreover, each RGB-IR image pair is annotated with 6 condition attributes, offering valuable high-level contextual information. To meet the challenge raised by such diverse conditions, we propose a novel prompt-guided condition-aware dynamic fusion (PCDF) to adaptively reassign multimodal contributions by leveraging annotated condition cues. By encoding imaging conditions as text prompts, PCDF effectively models the relationship between conditions and multimodal contributions through a task-specific soft-gating transformation. A prompt-guided condition-decoupling module further ensures the availability in practice without condition annotations. Experiments on ATR-UMOD dataset reveal the effectiveness of PCDF.

  Depth estimation remains central to autonomous driving, and radar-camera fusion offers robustness in adverse conditions by providing complementary geometric cues. In this paper, we present XD-RCDepth, a lightweight architecture that reduces the parameters by 29.7% relative to the state-of-the-art lightweight baseline while maintaining comparable accuracy. To preserve performance under compression and enhance interpretability, we introduce two knowledge-distillation strategies: an explainability-aligned distillation that transfers the teacher's saliency structure to the student, and a depth-distribution distillation that recasts depth regression as soft classification over discretized bins. Together, these components reduce the MAE compared with direct training with 7.97% and deliver competitive accuracy with real-time efficiency on nuScenes and ZJU-4DRadarCam datasets.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Facial expression recognition (FER) must remain robust under both cultural variation and perceptually degraded visual conditions, yet most existing evaluations assume homogeneous data and high-quality imagery. We introduce an agent-based, streaming benchmark that reveals how cross-cultural composition and progressive blurring interact to shape face recognition robustness. Each agent operates in a frozen CLIP feature space with a lightweight residual adapter trained online at sigma=0 and fixed during testing. Agents move and interact on a 5x5 lattice, while the environment provides inputs with sigma-scheduled Gaussian blur. We examine monocultural populations (Western-only, Asian-only) and mixed environments with balanced (5/5) and imbalanced (8/2, 2/8) compositions, as well as different spatial contact structures. Results show clear asymmetric degradation curves between cultural groups: JAFFE (Asian) populations maintain higher performance at low blur but exhibit sharper drops at intermediate stages, whereas KDEF (Western) populations degrade more uniformly. Mixed populations exhibit intermediate patterns, with balanced mixtures mitigating early degradation, but imbalanced settings amplify majority-group weaknesses under high blur. These findings quantify how cultural composition and interaction structure influence the robustness of FER as perceptual conditions deteriorate.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present a neural parametric 3D breast shape model and, based on this model, introduce a low-cost and accessible 3D surface reconstruction pipeline capable of recovering accurate breast geometry from a monocular RGB video. In contrast to widely used, commercially available yet prohibitively expensive 3D breast scanning solutions and existing low-cost alternatives, our method requires neither specialized hardware nor proprietary software and can be used with any device that is able to record RGB videos. The key building blocks of our pipeline are a state-of-the-art, off-the-shelf Structure-from-motion pipeline, paired with a parametric breast model for robust and metrically correct surface reconstruction. Our model, similarly to the recently proposed implicit Regensburg Breast Shape Model (iRBSM), leverages implicit neural representations to model breast shapes. However, unlike the iRBSM, which employs a single global neural signed distance function (SDF), our approach -- inspired by recent state-of-the-art face models -- decomposes the implicit breast domain into multiple smaller regions, each represented by a local neural SDF anchored at anatomical landmark positions. When incorporated into our surface reconstruction pipeline, the proposed model, dubbed liRBSM (short for localized iRBSM), significantly outperforms the iRBSM in terms of reconstruction quality, yielding more detailed surface reconstruction than its global counterpart. Overall, we find that the introduced pipeline is able to recover high-quality 3D breast geometry within an error margin of less than 2 mm. Our method is fast (requires less than six minutes), fully transparent and open-source, and -- together with the model -- publicly available atthis https URL.

  _Thibault Geoffroy, gauthier Gerspacher, Lionel Prevost_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Incremental learning is a complex process due to potential catastrophic forgetting of old tasks when learning new ones. This is mainly due to transient features that do not fit from task to task. In this paper, we focus on complex emotion recognition. First, we learn basic emotions and then, incrementally, like humans, complex emotions. We show that Action Units, describing facial muscle movements, are non-transient, highly semantical features that outperform those extracted by both shallow and deep convolutional neural networks. Thanks to this ability, our approach achieves interesting results when learning incrementally complex, compound emotions with an accuracy of 0.75 on the CFEE dataset and can be favorably compared to state-of-the-art results. Moreover, it results in a lightweight model with a small memory footprint.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Universal multimodal embedding models are foundational to various tasks. Existing approaches typically employ in-batch negative mining by measuring the similarity of query-candidate pairs. However, these methods often struggle to capture subtle semantic differences among candidates and lack diversity in negative samples. Moreover, the embeddings exhibit limited discriminative ability in distinguishing false and hard negatives. In this paper, we leverage the advanced understanding capabilities of MLLMs to enhance representation learning and present a novel Universal Multimodal Embedding (UniME-V2) model. Our approach first constructs a potential hard negative set through global retrieval. We then introduce the MLLM-as-a-Judge mechanism, which utilizes MLLMs to assess the semantic alignment of query-candidate pairs and generate soft semantic matching scores. These scores serve as a foundation for hard negative mining, mitigating the impact of false negatives and enabling the identification of diverse, high-quality hard negatives. Furthermore, the semantic matching scores are used as soft labels to mitigate the rigid one-to-one mapping constraint. By aligning the similarity matrix with the soft semantic matching score matrix, the model learns semantic distinctions among candidates, significantly enhancing its discriminative capacity. To further improve performance, we propose UniME-V2-Reranker, a reranking model trained on our mined hard negatives through a joint pairwise and listwise optimization approach. We conduct comprehensive experiments on the MMEB benchmark and multiple retrieval tasks, demonstrating that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on average across all tasks.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In many domains, including online education, healthcare, security, and human-computer interaction, facial emotion recognition (FER) is essential. Real-world FER is still difficult despite its significance because of some factors such as variable head positions, occlusions, illumination shifts, and demographic diversity. Engagement detection, which is essential for applications like virtual learning and customer services, is frequently challenging due to FER limitations by many current models. In this article, we propose ExpressNet-MoE, a novel hybrid deep learning model that blends both Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs) and Mixture of Experts (MoE) framework, to overcome the difficulties. Our model dynamically chooses the most pertinent expert networks, thus it aids in the generalization and providing flexibility to model across a wide variety of datasets. Our model improves on the accuracy of emotion recognition by utilizing multi-scale feature extraction to collect both global and local facial features. ExpressNet-MoE includes numerous CNN-based feature extractors, a MoE module for adaptive feature selection, and finally a residual network backbone for deep feature learning. To demonstrate efficacy of our proposed model we evaluated on several datasets, and compared with current state-of-the-art methods. Our model achieves accuracies of 74.77% on AffectNet (v7), 72.55% on AffectNet (v8), 84.29% on RAF-DB, and 64.66% on FER-2013. The results show how adaptive our model is and how it may be used to develop end-to-end emotion recognition systems in practical settings. Reproducible codes and results are made publicly accessible atthis https URL.

  _Emily Miller, Michael Milford, Muhammad Burhan Hafez, SD Ramchurn, Shoaib Ehsan_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Visual Place Recognition (VPR) enables robots and autonomous vehicles to identify previously visited locations by matching current observations against a database of known places. However, VPR systems face significant challenges when deployed across varying visual environments, lighting conditions, seasonal changes, and viewpoints changes. Failure-critical VPR applications, such as loop closure detection in simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) pipelines, require robust estimation of place matching uncertainty. We propose three training-free uncertainty metrics that estimate prediction confidence by analyzing inherent statistical patterns in similarity scores from any existing VPR method. Similarity Distribution (SD) quantifies match distinctiveness by measuring score separation between candidates; Ratio Spread (RS) evaluates competitive ambiguity among top-scoring locations; and Statistical Uncertainty (SU) is a combination of SD and RS that provides a unified metric that generalizes across datasets and VPR methods without requiring validation data to select the optimal metric. All three metrics operate without additional model training, architectural modifications, or computationally expensive geometric verification. Comprehensive evaluation across nine state-of-the-art VPR methods and six benchmark datasets confirms that our metrics excel at discriminating between correct and incorrect VPR matches, and consistently outperform existing approaches while maintaining negligible computational overhead, making it deployable for real-time robotic applications across varied environmental conditions with improved precision-recall performance.

  _Hyojun Go, Dominik Narnhofer, Goutam Bhat, Prune Truong, Federico Tombari, Konrad Schindler_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The rapid progress of large, pretrained models for both visual content generation and 3D reconstruction opens up new possibilities for text-to-3D generation. Intuitively, one could obtain a formidable 3D scene generator if one were able to combine the power of a modern latent text-to-video model as "generator" with the geometric abilities of a recent (feedforward) 3D reconstruction system as "decoder". We introduce VIST3A, a general framework that does just that, addressing two main challenges. First, the two components must be joined in a way that preserves the rich knowledge encoded in their weights. We revisit model stitching, i.e., we identify the layer in the 3D decoder that best matches the latent representation produced by the text-to-video generator and stitch the two parts together. That operation requires only a small dataset and no labels. Second, the text-to-video generator must be aligned with the stitched 3D decoder, to ensure that the generated latents are decodable into consistent, perceptually convincing 3D scene geometry. To that end, we adapt direct reward finetuning, a popular technique for human preference alignment. We evaluate the proposed VIST3A approach with different video generators and 3D reconstruction models. All tested pairings markedly improve over prior text-to-3D models that output Gaussian splats. Moreover, by choosing a suitable 3D base model, VIST3A also enables high-quality text-to-pointmap generation.

  _Ole-Christian Galbo Engstr√∏m_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This thesis investigates the application of near-infrared hyperspectral imaging (NIR-HSI) for food quality analysis. The investigation is conducted through four studies operating with five research hypotheses. For several analyses, the studies compare models based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and partial least squares (PLS). Generally, joint spatio-spectral analysis with CNNs outperforms spatial analysis with CNNs and spectral analysis with PLS when modeling parameters where chemical and physical visual information are relevant. When modeling chemical parameters with a 2-dimensional (2D) CNN, augmenting the CNN with an initial layer dedicated to performing spectral convolution enhances its predictive performance by learning a spectral preprocessing similar to that applied by domain experts. Still, PLS-based spectral modeling performs equally well for analysis of the mean content of chemical parameters in samples and is the recommended approach. Modeling the spatial distribution of chemical parameters with NIR-HSI is limited by the ability to obtain spatially resolved reference values. Therefore, a study used bulk mean references for chemical map generation of fat content in pork bellies. A PLS-based approach gave non-smooth chemical maps and pixel-wise predictions outside the range of 0-100\%. Conversely, a 2D CNN augmented with a spectral convolution layer mitigated all issues arising with PLS. The final study attempted to model barley's germinative capacity by analyzing NIR spectra, RGB images, and NIR-HSI images. However, the results were inconclusive due to the dataset's low degree of germination. Additionally, this thesis has led to the development of two open-sourced Python packages. The first facilitates fast PLS-based modeling, while the second facilitates very fast cross-validation of PLS and other classical machine learning models with a new algorithm.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Visual perception relies on inference of 3D scene properties such as shape, pose, and lighting. To understand how visual sensory neurons enable robust perception, it is crucial to characterize their selectivity to such physically interpretable factors. However, current approaches mainly operate on 2D pixels, making it difficult to isolate selectivity for physical scene properties. To address this limitation, we introduce a differentiable rendering pipeline that optimizes deformable meshes to obtain MEIs directly in 3D. The method parameterizes mesh deformations with radial basis functions and learns offsets and scales that maximize neuronal responses while enforcing geometric regularity. Applied to models of monkey area V4, our approach enables probing neuronal selectivity to interpretable 3D factors such as pose and lighting. This approach bridges inverse graphics with systems neuroscience, offering a way to probe neural selectivity with physically grounded, 3D stimuli beyond conventional pixel-based methods.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Collaborative perception has been proven to improve individual perception in autonomous driving through multi-agent interaction. Nevertheless, most methods often assume identical encoders for all agents, which does not hold true when these models are deployed in real-world applications. To realize collaborative perception in actual heterogeneous scenarios, existing methods usually align neighbor features to those of the ego vehicle, which is vulnerable to noise from domain gaps and thus fails to address feature discrepancies effectively. Moreover, they adopt transformer-based modules for domain adaptation, which causes the model inference inefficiency on mobile devices. To tackle these issues, we propose CoDS, a Collaborative perception method that leverages Domain Separation to address feature discrepancies in heterogeneous scenarios. The CoDS employs two feature alignment modules, i.e., Lightweight Spatial-Channel Resizer (LSCR) and Distribution Alignment via Domain Separation (DADS). Besides, it utilizes the Domain Alignment Mutual Information (DAMI) loss to ensure effective feature alignment. Specifically, the LSCR aligns the neighbor feature across spatial and channel dimensions using a lightweight convolutional layer. Subsequently, the DADS mitigates feature distribution discrepancy with encoder-specific and encoder-agnostic domain separation modules. The former removes domain-dependent information and the latter captures task-related information. During training, the DAMI loss maximizes the mutual information between aligned heterogeneous features to enhance the domain separation process. The CoDS employs a fully convolutional architecture, which ensures high inference efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the CoDS effectively mitigates feature discrepancies in heterogeneous scenarios and achieves a trade-off between detection accuracy and inference efficiency.

  _Jianhui Zhang, Sheng Cheng, Qirui Sun, Jia Liu, Wang Luyang, Chaoyu Feng, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this work, we present Patch-Adapter, an effective framework for high-resolution text-guided image inpainting. Unlike existing methods limited to lower resolutions, our approach achieves 4K+ resolution while maintaining precise content consistency and prompt alignment, two critical challenges in image inpainting that intensify with increasing resolution and texture complexity. Patch-Adapter leverages a two-stage adapter architecture to scale the diffusion model's resolution from 1K to 4K+ without requiring structural overhauls: (1) Dual Context Adapter learns coherence between masked and unmasked regions at reduced resolutions to establish global structural consistency; and (2) Reference Patch Adapter implements a patch-level attention mechanism for full-resolution inpainting, preserving local detail fidelity through adaptive feature fusion. This dual-stage architecture uniquely addresses the scalability gap in high-resolution inpainting by decoupling global semantics from localized refinement. Experiments demonstrate that Patch-Adapter not only resolves artifacts common in large-scale inpainting but also achieves state-of-the-art performance on the OpenImages and Photo-Concept-Bucket datasets, outperforming existing methods in both perceptual quality and text-prompt adherence.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reinforcement learning (RL) has garnered increasing attention in text-to-image (T2I) generation. However, most existing RL approaches are tailored to either diffusion models or autoregressive models, overlooking an important alternative: masked generative models. In this work, we propose Mask-GRPO, the first method to incorporate Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)-based RL into this overlooked paradigm. Our core insight is to redefine the transition probability, which is different from current approaches, and formulate the unmasking process as a multi-step decision-making problem. To further enhance our method, we explore several useful strategies, including removing the KL constraint, applying the reduction strategy, and filtering out low-quality samples. Using Mask-GRPO, we improve a base model, Show-o, with substantial improvements on standard T2I benchmarks and preference alignment, outperforming existing state-of-the-art approaches.

  Spatial reasoning ability is crucial for Vision Language Models (VLMs) to support real-world applications in diverse domains including robotics, augmented reality, and autonomous navigation. Unfortunately, existing benchmarks are inadequate in assessing spatial reasoning ability, especially the \emph{intrinsic-dynamic} spatial reasoning which is a fundamental aspect of human spatial cognition. In this paper, we propose a unified benchmark, \textbf{Spatial-DISE}, based on a cognitively grounded taxonomy that categorizes tasks into four fundamental quadrants: \textbf{I}ntrinsic-\textbf{S}tatic, Intrinsic-\textbf{D}ynamic, \textbf{E}xtrinsic-Static, and Extrinsic-Dynamic spatial reasoning. Moreover, to address the issue of data scarcity, we develop a scalable and automated pipeline to generate diverse and verifiable spatial reasoning questions, resulting in a new \textbf{Spatial-DISE} dataset that includes Spatial-DISE Bench (559 evaluation VQA pairs) and Spatial-DISE-12K (12K+ training VQA pairs). Our comprehensive evaluation across 28 state-of-the-art VLMs reveals that, current VLMs have a large and consistent gap to human competence, especially on multi-step multi-view spatial reasoning. Spatial-DISE offers a robust framework, valuable dataset, and clear direction for future research toward human-like spatial intelligence. Benchmark, dataset, and code will be publicly released.

  _Feng-Qi Cui, Yu-Tong Guo, Tianyue Zheng, Jinyang Huang_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  WiFi-based gesture recognition has emerged as a promising RF sensing paradigm for enabling non-contact and privacy-preserving human-computer interaction in AIoT environments. However, existing methods often suffer from limited generalization and semantic expressiveness due to the domain-sensitive nature of Channel State Information and the lack of high-level gesture abstraction. To address these challenges, we propose a novel generalization framework, termed Large-Model-Aware Semantic Distillation and Alignment (GLSDA), which leverages the semantic prior of pre-trained large foundation models to enhance gesture representation learning in both in-domain and cross-domain scenarios. Specifically, we first design a dual-path CSI encoding pipeline that captures geometric and dynamic gesture patterns via CSI-Ratio phase sequences and Doppler spectrograms. These representations are then fed into a Multiscale Semantic Encoder, which learns robust temporal embeddings and aligns them with gesture semantics through cross-modal attention mechanisms. To further enhance category discrimination, we introduce a Semantic-Aware Soft Supervision scheme that encodes inter-class correlations and reduces label ambiguity, especially for semantically similar gestures. Finally, we develop a Robust Dual-Distillation strategy to compress the aligned model into a lightweight student network, jointly distilling intermediate features and semantic-informed soft labels from the teacher model. Extensive experiments on the Widar3.0 benchmark show that GLSDA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both in-domain and cross-domain gesture recognition tasks, while significantly reducing model size and inference latency. Our method offers a scalable and deployable solution for generalized RF-based gesture interfaces in real-world AIoT applications.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have recently shown impressive generalization and language-guided manipulation capabilities. However, their performance degrades on tasks requiring precise spatial reasoning due to limited spatial reasoning inherited from Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Existing VLAs rely on extensive action-data pretraining to ground VLMs in 3D space, which reduces training efficiency and is still insufficient for accurate spatial understanding. In this work, we present DepthVLA, a simple yet effective VLA architecture that explicitly incorporates spatial awareness through a pretrained depth prediction module. DepthVLA adopts a mixture-of-transformers design that unifies a VLM, a depth transformer, and an action expert with fully shared attentions, forming an end-to-end model with enhanced spatial reasoning. Extensive evaluations in both real-world and simulated environments show that DepthVLA outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, achieving 78.5% vs. 65.0% progress in real-world tasks, 94.9% vs. 93.6% in the LIBERO simulator, and 74.8% vs. 58.8% in the Simpler simulator.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent Vision-Language Models (VLMs) enable zero-shot classification by aligning images and text in a shared space, a promising approach for data-scarce conditions. However, the influence of prompt design on recognizing visually similar categories, such as human postures, is not well understood. This study investigates how prompt specificity affects the zero-shot classification of sitting, standing, and walking/running on a small, 285-image COCO-derived dataset. A suite of modern VLMs, including OpenCLIP, MetaCLIP 2, and SigLip, were evaluated using a three-tiered prompt design that systematically increases linguistic detail. Our findings reveal a compelling, counter-intuitive trend: for the highest-performing models (MetaCLIP 2 and OpenCLIP), the simplest, most basic prompts consistently achieve the best results. Adding descriptive detail significantly degrades performance for instance, MetaCLIP 2's multi-class accuracy drops from 68.8\% to 55.1\% a phenomenon we term "prompt overfitting". Conversely, the lower-performing SigLip model shows improved classification on ambiguous classes when given more descriptive, body-cue-based prompts.

  Quality assessment of videos is crucial for many computer graphics applications, including video games, virtual reality, and augmented reality, where visual performance has a significant impact on user experience. When test videos cannot be perfectly aligned with references or when references are unavailable, the significance of no-reference video quality assessment (NR-VQA) methods is undeniable. However, existing NR-VQA datasets and metrics are primarily focused on camera-captured videos; applying them directly to rendered videos would result in biased predictions, as rendered videos are more prone to temporal artifacts. To address this, we present a large rendering-oriented video dataset with subjective quality annotations, as well as a designed NR-VQA metric specific to rendered videos. The proposed dataset includes a wide range of 3D scenes and rendering settings, with quality scores annotated for various display types to better reflect real-world application scenarios. Building on this dataset, we calibrate our NR-VQA metric to assess rendered video quality by looking at both image quality and temporal stability. We compare our metric to existing NR-VQA metrics, demonstrating its superior performance on rendered videos. Finally, we demonstrate that our metric can be used to benchmark supersampling methods and assess frame generation strategies in real-time rendering.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoders (VQ-VAEs) leverage self-supervised learning through reconstruction tasks to represent continuous vectors using the closest vectors in a codebook. However, issues such as codebook collapse persist in the VQ model. To address these issues, existing approaches employ implicit static codebooks or jointly optimize the entire codebook, but these methods constrain the codebook's learning capability, leading to reduced reconstruction quality. In this paper, we propose Group-VQ, which performs group-wise optimization on the codebook. Each group is optimized independently, with joint optimization performed within groups. This approach improves the trade-off between codebook utilization and reconstruction performance. Additionally, we introduce a training-free codebook resampling method, allowing post-training adjustment of the codebook size. In image reconstruction experiments under various settings, Group-VQ demonstrates improved performance on reconstruction metrics. And the post-training codebook sampling method achieves the desired flexibility in adjusting the codebook size.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Concealed weapon detection aims at detecting weapons hidden beneath a person's clothing or luggage. Various imaging modalities like Millimeter Wave, Microwave, Terahertz, Infrared, etc., are exploited for the concealed weapon detection task. These imaging modalities have their own limitations, such as poor resolution in microwave imaging, privacy concerns in millimeter wave imaging, etc. To provide a real-time, 24 x 7 surveillance, low-cost, and privacy-preserved solution, we opted for thermal imaging in spite of the lack of availability of a benchmark dataset. We propose a novel approach and a dataset for concealed weapon detection in thermal imagery. Our YOLO-based architecture, DEF-YOLO, is built with key enhancements in YOLOv8 tailored to the unique challenges of concealed weapon detection in thermal vision. We adopt deformable convolutions at the SPPF layer to exploit multi-scale features; backbone and neck layers to extract low, mid, and high-level features, enabling DEF-YOLO to adaptively focus on localization around the objects in thermal homogeneous regions, without sacrificing much of the speed and throughput. In addition to these simple yet effective key architectural changes, we introduce a new, large-scale Thermal Imaging Concealed Weapon dataset, TICW, featuring a diverse set of concealed weapons and capturing a wide range of scenarios. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first large-scale contributed dataset for this task. We also incorporate focal loss to address the significant class imbalance inherent in the concealed weapon detection task. The efficacy of the proposed work establishes a new benchmark through extensive experimentation for concealed weapon detection in thermal imagery.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Cost volumes are used in every modern optical flow estimator, but due to their computational and space complexity, they are often a limiting factor regarding both processing speed and the resolution of input frames. Motivated by our empirical observation that cost volumes lose their importance once all other network parts of, e.g., a RAFT-based pipeline have been sufficiently trained, we introduce a training strategy that allows removing the cost volume from optical flow estimators throughout training. This leads to significantly improved inference speed and reduced memory requirements. Using our training strategy, we create three different models covering different compute budgets. Our most accurate model reaches state-of-the-art accuracy while being $1.2\times$ faster and having a $6\times$ lower memory footprint than comparable models; our fastest model is capable of processing Full HD frames at $20\,\mathrm{FPS}$ using only $500\,\mathrm{MB}$ of GPU memory.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Our daily life is highly influenced by what we consume and see. Attracting and holding one's attention -- the definition of (visual) interestingness -- is essential. The rise of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) trained on large-scale visual and textual data has demonstrated impressive capabilities. We explore these models' potential to understand to what extent the concepts of visual interestingness are captured and examine the alignment between human assessments and GPT-4o's, a leading LMM, predictions through comparative analysis. Our studies reveal partial alignment between humans and GPT-4o. It already captures the concept as best compared to state-of-the-art methods. Hence, this allows for the effective labeling of image pairs according to their (commonly) interestingness, which are used as training data to distill the knowledge into a learning-to-rank model. The insights pave the way for a deeper understanding of human interest.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable multimodal capabilities, but they inherit the tendency to hallucinate from their underlying language models. While visual contrastive decoding has been proposed to mitigate this issue, existing methods often apply generic visual augmentations that disregard the specific context provided by the text query, limiting their effectiveness. This study introduces a novel training-free decoding strategy that addresses these limitations, featuring two key contributions. First, a self-augmentation prompting strategy that leverages the intrinsic knowledge of the model to dynamically align semantics between the query and the visual augmentation. Second, an adaptive thresholding algorithm that adaptively adjusts next token candidate size based on the output sparsity, utilizing full information from the logit distribution. Extensive experiments across four LVLMs and seven benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed decoding significantly enhances factual consistency compared to state-of-the-art decoding methods. This work highlights the importance of integrating query-dependent augmentation and entropy-aware decoding for improving effective generation of LVLMs.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Structure-from-Motion (SfM), a method that recovers camera poses and scene geometry from uncalibrated images, is a central component in robotic reconstruction and simulation. Despite the state-of-the-art performance of traditional SfM methods such as COLMAP and its follow-up work, GLOMAP, naive CPU-specialized implementations of bundle adjustment (BA) or global positioning (GP) introduce significant computational overhead when handling large-scale scenarios, leading to a trade-off between accuracy and speed in SfM. Moreover, the blessing of efficient C++-based implementations in COLMAP and GLOMAP comes with the curse of limited flexibility, as they lack support for various external optimization options. On the other hand, while deep learning based SfM pipelines like VGGSfM and VGGT enable feed-forward 3D reconstruction, they are unable to scale to thousands of input views at once as GPU memory consumption increases sharply as the number of input views grows. In this paper, we unleash the full potential of GPU parallel computation to accelerate each critical stage of the standard SfM pipeline. Building upon recent advances in sparse-aware bundle adjustment optimization, our design extends these techniques to accelerate both BA and GP within a unified global SfM framework. Through extensive experiments on datasets of varying scales (e.g. 5000 images where VGGSfM and VGGT run out of memory), our method demonstrates up to about 40 times speedup over COLMAP while achieving consistently comparable or even improved reconstruction accuracy.

  _Yang Li, Aming Wu, Zihao Zhang, Yahong Han_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this paper, we focus on Novel Class Discovery for Point Cloud Segmentation (3D-NCD), aiming to learn a model that can segment unlabeled (novel) 3D classes using only the supervision from labeled (base) 3D classes. The key to this task is to setup the exact correlations between the point representations and their base class labels, as well as the representation correlations between the points from base and novel classes. A coarse or statistical correlation learning may lead to the confusion in novel class inference. lf we impose a causal relationship as a strong correlated constraint upon the learning process, the essential point cloud representations that accurately correspond to the classes should be uncovered. To this end, we introduce a structural causal model (SCM) to re-formalize the 3D-NCD problem and propose a new method, i.e., Joint Learning of Causal Representation and Reasoning. Specifically, we first analyze hidden confounders in the base class representations and the causal relationships between the base and novel classes through SCM. We devise a causal representation prototype that eliminates confounders to capture the causal representations of base classes. A graph structure is then used to model the causal relationships between the base classes' causal representation prototypes and the novel class prototypes, enabling causal reasoning from base to novel classes. Extensive experiments and visualization results on 3D and 2D NCD semantic segmentation demonstrate the superiorities of our method.

  _JiaKui Hu, Zhengjian Yao, Lujia Jin, Yinghao Chen, Yanye Lu_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This study introduces a Masked Degradation Classification Pre-Training method (MaskDCPT), designed to facilitate the classification of degradation types in input images, leading to comprehensive image restoration pre-training. Unlike conventional pre-training methods, MaskDCPT uses the degradation type of the image as an extremely weak supervision, while simultaneously leveraging the image reconstruction to enhance performance and robustness. MaskDCPT includes an encoder and two decoders: the encoder extracts features from the masked low-quality input image. The classification decoder uses these features to identify the degradation type, whereas the reconstruction decoder aims to reconstruct a corresponding high-quality image. This design allows the pre-training to benefit from both masked image modeling and contrastive learning, resulting in a generalized representation suited for restoration tasks. Benefit from the straightforward yet potent MaskDCPT, the pre-trained encoder can be used to address universal image restoration and achieve outstanding performance. Implementing MaskDCPT significantly improves performance for both convolution neural networks (CNNs) and Transformers, with a minimum increase in PSNR of 3.77 dB in the 5D all-in-one restoration task and a 34.8% reduction in PIQE compared to baseline in real-world degradation scenarios. It also emergences strong generalization to previously unseen degradation types and levels. In addition, we curate and release the UIR-2.5M dataset, which includes 2.5 million paired restoration samples across 19 degradation types and over 200 degradation levels, incorporating both synthetic and real-world data. The dataset, source code, and models are available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The rapid advancement of large vision language models (LVLMs) has led to a significant expansion of their context windows. However, an extended context window does not guarantee the effective utilization of the context, posing a critical challenge for real-world applications. Current evaluations of such long-context faithfulness are predominantly focused on the text-only domain, while multimodal assessments remain limited to short contexts. To bridge this gap, we introduce MMLongCite, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the fidelity of LVLMs in long-context scenarios. MMLongCite comprises 8 distinct tasks spanning 6 context length intervals and incorporates diverse modalities, including text, images, and videos. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art LVLMs reveals their limited faithfulness in handling long multimodal contexts. Furthermore, we provide an in-depth analysis of how context length and the position of crucial content affect the faithfulness of these models.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Current end-to-end multi-modal models utilize different encoders and decoders to process input and output information. This separation hinders the joint representation learning of various modalities. To unify multi-modal processing, we propose a novel architecture called MDM (Multi-modal Diffusion Mamba). MDM utilizes a Mamba-based multi-step selection diffusion model to progressively generate and refine modality-specific information through a unified variational autoencoder for both encoding and decoding. This innovative approach allows MDM to achieve superior performance when processing high-dimensional data, particularly in generating high-resolution images and extended text sequences simultaneously. Our evaluations in areas such as image generation, image captioning, visual question answering, text comprehension, and reasoning tasks demonstrate that MDM significantly outperforms existing end-to-end models (MonoFormer, LlamaGen, and Chameleon etc.) and competes effectively with SOTA models like GPT-4V, Gemini Pro, and Mistral. Our results validate MDM's effectiveness in unifying multi-modal processes while maintaining computational efficiency, establishing a new direction for end-to-end multi-modal architectures.

  Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) extend the capabilities of vision-language models to spatiotemporal inputs, enabling tasks such as video question answering (VideoQA). Despite recent advances in VideoLLMs, their internal mechanisms on where and how they extract and propagate video and textual information remain less explored. In this study, we investigate the internal information flow of VideoLLMs using mechanistic interpretability techniques. Our analysis reveals consistent patterns across diverse VideoQA tasks: (1) temporal reasoning in VideoLLMs initiates with active cross-frame interactions in early-to-middle layers, (2) followed by progressive video-language integration in middle layers. This is facilitated by alignment between video representations and linguistic embeddings containing temporal concepts. (3) Upon completion of this integration, the model is ready to generate correct answers in middle-to-late layers. (4) Based on our analysis, we show that VideoLLMs can retain their VideoQA performance by selecting these effective information pathways while suppressing a substantial amount of attention edges, e.g., 58% in LLaVA-NeXT-7B-Video-FT. These findings provide a blueprint on how VideoLLMs perform temporal reasoning and offer practical insights for improving model interpretability and downstream generalization.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Crowd counting is a task of estimating the number of the crowd through images, which is extremely valuable in the fields of intelligent security, urban planning, public safety management, and so on. However, the existing counting methods have some problems in practical application on embedded systems for these fields, such as excessive model parameters, abundant complex calculations, etc. The practical application of embedded systems requires the model to be real-time, which means that the model is fast enough. Considering the aforementioned problems, we design a super real-time model with a stem-encoder-decoder structure for crowd counting tasks, which achieves the fastest inference compared with state-of-the-arts. Firstly, large convolution kernels in the stem network are used to enlarge the receptive field, which effectively extracts detailed head information. Then, in the encoder part, we use conditional channel weighting and multi-branch local fusion block to merge multi-scale features with low computational consumption. This part is crucial to the super real-time performance of the model. Finally, the feature pyramid networks are added to the top of the encoder to alleviate its incomplete fusion problems. Experiments on three benchmarks show that our network is suitable for super real-time crowd counting on embedded systems, ensuring competitive accuracy. At the same time, the proposed network reasoning speed is the fastest. Specifically, the proposed network achieves 381.7 FPS on NVIDIA GTX 1080Ti and 71.9 FPS on NVIDIA Jetson TX1.

  Outdoor 3D semantic scene generation produces realistic and semantically rich environments for applications such as urban simulation and autonomous driving. However, advances in this direction are constrained by the absence of publicly available, well-annotated datasets. We introduce SketchSem3D, the first large-scale benchmark for generating 3D outdoor semantic scenes from abstract freehand sketches and pseudo-labeled annotations of satellite images. SketchSem3D includes two subsets, Sketch-based SemanticKITTI and Sketch-based KITTI-360 (containing LiDAR voxels along with their corresponding sketches and annotated satellite images), to enable standardized, rigorous, and diverse evaluations. We also propose Cylinder Mamba Diffusion (CymbaDiff) that significantly enhances spatial coherence in outdoor 3D scene generation. CymbaDiff imposes structured spatial ordering, explicitly captures cylindrical continuity and vertical hierarchy, and preserves both physical neighborhood relationships and global context within the generated scenes. Extensive experiments on SketchSem3D demonstrate that CymbaDiff achieves superior semantic consistency, spatial realism, and cross-dataset generalization.

  The development of computer vision algorithms for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) applications in urban environments heavily relies on the availability of large-scale datasets with accurate annotations. However, collecting and annotating real-world UAV data is extremely challenging and costly. To address this limitation, we present FlyAwareV2, a novel multimodal dataset encompassing both real and synthetic UAV imagery tailored for urban scene understanding tasks. Building upon the recently introduced SynDrone and FlyAware datasets, FlyAwareV2 introduces several new key contributions: 1) Multimodal data (RGB, depth, semantic labels) across diverse environmental conditions including varying weather and daytime; 2) Depth maps for real samples computed via state-of-the-art monocular depth estimation; 3) Benchmarks for RGB and multimodal semantic segmentation on standard architectures; 4) Studies on synthetic-to-real domain adaptation to assess the generalization capabilities of models trained on the synthetic data. With its rich set of annotations and environmental diversity, FlyAwareV2 provides a valuable resource for research on UAV-based 3D urban scene understanding.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have achieved revolutionary progress in robot learning, enabling robots to execute complex physical robot tasks from natural language instructions. Despite this progress, their adversarial robustness remains underexplored. In this work, we propose both adversarial patch attack and corresponding defense strategies for VLA models. We first introduce the Embedding Disruption Patch Attack (EDPA), a model-agnostic adversarial attack that generates patches directly placeable within the camera's view. In comparison to prior methods, EDPA can be readily applied to different VLA models without requiring prior knowledge of the model architecture, or the controlled robotic manipulator. EDPA constructs these patches by (i) disrupting the semantic alignment between visual and textual latent representations, and (ii) maximizing the discrepancy of latent representations between adversarial and corresponding clean visual inputs. Through the optimization of these objectives, EDPA distorts the VLA's interpretation of visual information, causing the model to repeatedly generate incorrect actions and ultimately result in failure to complete the given robotic task. To counter this, we propose an adversarial fine-tuning scheme for the visual encoder, in which the encoder is optimized to produce similar latent representations for both clean and adversarially perturbed visual inputs. Extensive evaluations on the widely recognized LIBERO robotic simulation benchmark demonstrate that EDPA substantially increases the task failure rate of cutting-edge VLA models, while our proposed defense effectively mitigates this degradation.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multimodal semantic cues, such as textual descriptions, have shown strong potential in enhancing target perception for tracking. However, existing methods rely on static textual descriptions from large language models, which lack adaptability to real-time target state changes and prone to hallucinations. To address these challenges, we propose a unified multimodal vision-language tracking framework, named EPIPTrack, which leverages explicit and implicit prompts for dynamic target modeling and semantic alignment. Specifically, explicit prompts transform spatial motion information into natural language descriptions to provide spatiotemporal guidance. Implicit prompts combine pseudo-words with learnable descriptors to construct individualized knowledge representations capturing appearance attributes. Both prompts undergo dynamic adjustment via the CLIP text encoder to respond to changes in target state. Furthermore, we design a Discriminative Feature Augmentor to enhance visual and cross-modal representations. Extensive experiments on MOT17, MOT20, and DanceTrack demonstrate that EPIPTrack outperforms existing trackers in diverse scenarios, exhibiting robust adaptability and superior performance.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vector extraction retrieves structured vector geometry from raster images, offering high-fidelity representation and broad applicability. Existing methods, however, are usually tailored to a single vector type (e.g., polygons, polylines, line segments), requiring separate models for different structures. This stems from treating instance attributes (category, structure) and geometric attributes (point coordinates, connections) independently, limiting the ability to capture complex structures. Inspired by the human brain's simultaneous use of semantic and spatial interactions in visual perception, we propose UniVector, a unified VE framework that leverages instance-geometry interaction to extract multiple vector types within a single model. UniVector encodes vectors as structured queries containing both instance- and geometry-level information, and iteratively updates them through an interaction module for cross-level context exchange. A dynamic shape constraint further refines global structures and key points. To benchmark multi-structure scenarios, we introduce the Multi-Vector dataset with diverse polygons, polylines, and line segments. Experiments show UniVector sets a new state of the art on both single- and multi-structure VE tasks. Code and dataset will be released atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  State-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) suffer from a critical failure in understanding negation, often referred to as affirmative bias. This limitation is particularly severe in described object detection (DOD) tasks. To address this, we propose two primary contributions: (1) a new dataset pipeline and (2) a novel, lightweight adaptation recipe. First, we introduce CoVAND, a dataset constructed with a systematic chain-of-thought (CoT) and VQA-based pipeline to generate high-quality, instance-grounded negation data. Second, we propose NegToMe, a novel text token merging module that directly tackles the architectural cause of affirmative bias. NegToMe fundamentally addresses the structural loss of negation cues in tokenization, grouping them with attributes into coherent semantic phrases. It maintains correct polarity at the input level, enabling robust negation understanding even with limited data. For instance, to prevent a model from treating the fragmented tokens "not" and "girl" as simply "girl", NegToMe binds them into a single token whose meaning is correctly distinguished from that of "girl" alone. This module is integrated with a parameter-efficient and strategic LoRA fine-tuning approach. Our method significantly improves performance on challenging negation benchmarks with a lowered false positive rate, boosting NMS-AP by up to +10.8 points on OVDEval and demonstrating generalization to SoTA VLMs. This work marks a crucial step forward in addressing negation understanding for real-world detection applications.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Industrial surface defect inspection for sample-wise quality control (QC) must simultaneously decide whether a given sample contains defects and localize those defects spatially. In real production lines, extreme foreground-background imbalance, defect sparsity with a long-tailed scale distribution, and low contrast are common. As a result, pixel-centric training and evaluation are easily dominated by large homogeneous regions, making it difficult to drive models to attend to small or low-contrast defects-one of the main bottlenecks for deployment. Empirically, existing models achieve strong pixel-overlap metrics (e.g., mIoU) but exhibit insufficient stability at the sample level, especially for sparse or slender defects. The root cause is a mismatch between the optimization objective and the granularity of QC decisions. To address this, we propose a sample-centric multi-task learning framework and evaluation suite. Built on a shared-encoder architecture, the method jointly learns sample-level defect classification and pixel-level mask localization. Sample-level supervision modulates the feature distribution and, at the gradient level, continually boosts recall for small and low-contrast defects, while the segmentation branch preserves boundary and shape details to enhance per-sample decision stability and reduce misses. For evaluation, we propose decision-linked metrics, Seg_mIoU and Seg_Recall, which remove the bias of classical mIoU caused by empty or true-negative samples and tightly couple localization quality with sample-level decisions. Experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach substantially improves the reliability of sample-level decisions and the completeness of defect localization.

  In computer vision, Visual Prompting (VP) and Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT) have recently emerged as lightweight and effective alternatives to full fine-tuning for adapting large-scale vision models within the ``pretrain-then-finetune'' paradigm. However, despite rapid progress, their conceptual boundaries remain blurred, as VP and VPT are frequently used interchangeably in current research, reflecting a lack of systematic distinction between these techniques and their respective applications. In this survey, we revisit the designs of VP and VPT from first principles, and conceptualize them within a unified framework termed Prompt-based Adaptation (PA). We provide a taxonomy that categorizes existing methods into learnable, generative, and non-learnable prompts, and further organizes them by injection granularity -- pixel-level and token-level. Beyond the core methodologies, we examine PA's integrations across diverse domains, including medical imaging, 3D point clouds, and vision-language tasks, as well as its role in test-time adaptation and trustworthy AI. We also summarize current benchmarks and identify key challenges and future directions. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first comprehensive survey dedicated to PA's methodologies and applications in light of their distinct characteristics. Our survey aims to provide a clear roadmap for researchers and practitioners in all area to understand and explore the evolving landscape of PA-related research.

  Generating stylized 3D human motion from speech signals presents substantial challenges, primarily due to the intricate and fine-grained relationships among speech signals, individual styles, and the corresponding body movements. Current style encoding approaches either oversimplify stylistic diversity or ignore regional motion style differences (e.g., upper vs. lower body), limiting motion realism. Additionally, motion style should dynamically adapt to changes in speech rhythm and emotion, but existing methods often overlook this. To address these issues, we propose MimicParts, a novel framework designed to enhance stylized motion generation based on part-aware style injection and part-aware denoising network. It divides the body into different regions to encode localized motion styles, enabling the model to capture fine-grained regional differences. Furthermore, our part-aware attention block allows rhythm and emotion cues to guide each body region precisely, ensuring that the generated motion aligns with variations in speech rhythm and emotional state. Experimental results show that our method outperforming existing methods showcasing naturalness and expressive 3D human motion sequences.

  Camera-based occupancy prediction is a mainstream approach for 3D perception in autonomous driving, aiming to infer complete 3D scene geometry and semantics from 2D images. Almost existing methods focus on improving performance through structural modifications, such as lightweight backbones and complex cascaded frameworks, with good yet limited performance. Few studies explore from the perspective of representation fusion, leaving the rich diversity of features in 2D images underutilized. Motivated by this, we propose \textbf{CIGOcc, a two-stage occupancy prediction framework based on multi-level representation fusion. \textbf{CIGOcc extracts segmentation, graphics, and depth features from an input image and introduces a deformable multi-level fusion mechanism to fuse these three multi-level features. Additionally, CIGOcc incorporates knowledge distilled from SAM to further enhance prediction accuracy. Without increasing training costs, CIGOcc achieves state-of-the-art performance on the SemanticKITTI benchmark. The code is provided in the supplementary material and will be releasedthis https URL

  Edge Gaussian splatting (EGS), which aggregates data from distributed clients and trains a global GS model at the edge server, is an emerging paradigm for scene reconstruction. Unlike traditional edge resource management methods that emphasize communication throughput or general-purpose learning performance, EGS explicitly aims to maximize the GS qualities, rendering existing approaches inapplicable. To address this problem, this paper formulates a novel GS-oriented objective function that distinguishes the heterogeneous view contributions of different clients. However, evaluating this function in turn requires clients' images, leading to a causality dilemma. To this end, this paper further proposes a sample-then-transmit EGS (or STT-GS for short) strategy, which first samples a subset of images as pilot data from each client for loss prediction. Based on the first-stage evaluation, communication resources are then prioritized towards more valuable clients. To achieve efficient sampling, a feature-domain clustering (FDC) scheme is proposed to select the most representative data and pilot transmission time minimization (PTTM) is adopted to reduce the pilotthis http URL, we develop a joint client selection and power control (JCSPC) framework to maximize the GS-oriented function under communication resource constraints. Despite the nonconvexity of the problem, we propose a low-complexity efficient solution based on the penalty alternating majorization minimization (PAMM) algorithm. Experiments unveil that the proposed scheme significantly outperforms existing benchmarks on real-world datasets. It is found that the GS-oriented objective can be accurately predicted with low sampling ratios (e.g.,10%), and our method achieves an excellent tradeoff between view contributions and communication costs.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Transient Electromagnetic (TEM) method is widely used in various geophysical applications, providing valuable insights into subsurface properties. However, time-domain TEM signals are often submerged in various types of noise. While recent deep learning-based denoising models have shown strong performance, these models are mostly trained on simulated or single real-world scenario data, overlooking the significant differences in noise characteristics from different geographical regions. Intuitively, models trained in one environment often struggle to perform well in new settings due to differences in geological conditions, equipment, and external interference, leading to reduced denoising performance. To this end, we propose the Dictionary-driven Prior Regularization Test-time Adaptation (DP-TTA). Our key insight is that TEM signals possess intrinsic physical characteristics, such as exponential decay and smoothness, which remain consistent across different regions regardless of external conditions. These intrinsic characteristics serve as ideal prior knowledge for guiding the TTA strategy, which helps the pre-trained model dynamically adjust parameters by utilizing self-supervised losses, improving denoising performance in new scenarios. To implement this, we customized a network, named DTEMDNet. Specifically, we first use dictionary learning to encode these intrinsic characteristics as a dictionary-driven prior, which is integrated into the model during training. At the testing stage, this prior guides the model to adapt dynamically to new environments by minimizing self-supervised losses derived from the dictionary-driven consistency and the signal one-order variation. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves much better performance than existing TEM denoising methods and TTA methods.

  Benchmarking autonomous driving planners to align with human judgment remains a critical challenge, as state-of-the-art metrics like the Extended Predictive Driver Model Score (EPDMS) lack context awareness in nuanced scenarios. To address this, we introduce DriveCritic, a novel framework featuring two key contributions: the DriveCritic dataset, a curated collection of challenging scenarios where context is critical for correct judgment and annotated with pairwise human preferences, and the DriveCritic model, a Vision-Language Model (VLM) based evaluator. Fine-tuned using a two-stage supervised and reinforcement learning pipeline, the DriveCritic model learns to adjudicate between trajectory pairs by integrating visual and symbolic context. Experiments show DriveCritic significantly outperforms existing metrics and baselines in matching human preferences and demonstrates strong context awareness. Overall, our work provides a more reliable, human-aligned foundation to evaluating autonomous driving systems.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As AR/VR technologies become integral to daily life, there's a growing need for AI that understands human social dynamics from an egocentric perspective. However, current LLMs often lack the social awareness to discern when to intervene as AI assistant. This leads to constant, socially unaware responses that may disrupt natural conversation and negatively impact user focus. To address these limitations, we introduce EgoSocial, a large-scale egocentric dataset with 13,500 social video-question pairs, specifically designed to benchmark intervention in social interaction perception. We also present an in-depth analysis of current omnimodal LLMs (OLLMs) to assess their effectiveness in detecting diverse social contextual cues. Experiments show that OLLMs still struggle to detect the intervention timing (14.4% for Gemini 2.5 Pro). We also propose EgoSoD (EgoSocial Detection), an end-to-end method for robustly discerning social dynamics. Informed by our OLLM analysis, EgoSoD integrates multimodal contextual cues (e.g., audio and visual cues) into a social thinking graph, dynamically modeling participants and interactions. Our method proactively detects intervention timing and social interactions, precisely determining when to intervene. Our EgoSoD improves Phi-4 by 45.6% and Gemini 2.5 Pro by 9.9% on Intervention Timing performance, and improves Phi-4 by 20.4% and Gemini 2.5 Pro by 6.9% on overall Social Interaction performance. We will release the dataset and code soon.

  Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have recently demonstrated significant progress in video editing.However, existing video editing methods are severely limited by their high computational overhead and memory consumption.Furthermore, these approaches often sacrifice visual fidelity, leading to undesirable temporal inconsistencies and artifacts such as blurring and pronounced mosaic-like patterns.We propose Edit-Your-Interest, a lightweight, text-driven, zero-shot video editing method.Edit-Your-Interest introduces a spatio-temporal feature memory to cache features from previous frames, significantly reducing computational overhead compared to full-sequence spatio-temporal modeling approaches.Specifically, we first introduce a Spatio-Temporal Feature Memory bank (SFM), which is designed to efficiently cache and retain the crucial image tokens processed by spatial attention.Second, we propose the Feature Most-Similar Propagation (FMP) method. FMP propagates the most relevant tokens from previous frames to subsequent ones, preserving temporal consistency.Finally, we introduce an SFM update algorithm that continuously refreshes the cached features, ensuring their long-term relevance and effectiveness throughout the video sequence.Furthermore, we leverage cross-attention maps to automatically extract masks for the instances of interest.These masks are seamlessly integrated into the diffusion denoising process, enabling fine-grained control over target objects and allowing Edit-Your-Interest to perform highly accurate edits while robustly preserving the background integrity.Extensive experiments decisively demonstrate that the proposed Edit-Your-Interest outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both efficiency and visual fidelity, validating its superior effectiveness and practicality.

  Diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs) have demonstrated remarkable progress in generative tasks, such as image and video synthesis. However, they still often produce hallucinated samples (hallucinations) that conflict with real-world knowledge, such as generating an implausible duplicate cup floating beside another cup. Despite their prevalence, the lack of feasible methodologies for systematically quantifying such hallucinations hinders progress in addressing this challenge and obscures potential pathways for designing next-generation generative models under factual constraints. In this work, we bridge this gap by focusing on a specific form of hallucination, which we term counting hallucination, referring to the generation of an incorrect number of instances or structured objects, such as a hand image with six fingers, despite such patterns being absent from the training data. To this end, we construct a dataset suite CountHalluSet, with well-defined counting criteria, comprising ToyShape, SimObject, and RealHand. Using these datasets, we develop a standardized evaluation protocol for quantifying counting hallucinations, and systematically examine how different sampling conditions in DPMs, including solver type, ODE solver order, sampling steps, and initial noise, affect counting hallucination levels. Furthermore, we analyze their correlation with common evaluation metrics such as FID, revealing that this widely used image quality metric fails to capture counting hallucinations consistently. This work aims to take the first step toward systematically quantifying hallucinations in diffusion models and offer new insights into the investigation of hallucination phenomena in image generation.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Deep learning models for medical image segmentation often struggle when deployed across different datasets due to domain shifts - variations in both image appearance, known as style, and population-dependent anatomical characteristics, referred to as content. This paper presents a novel unsupervised domain adaptation framework that directly addresses domain shifts encountered in cross-domain hippocampus segmentation from MRI, with specific emphasis on content variations. Our approach combines efficient style harmonisation through z-normalisation with a bidirectional deformable image registration (DIR) strategy. The DIR network is jointly trained with segmentation and discriminator networks to guide the registration with respect to a region of interest and generate anatomically plausible transformations that align source images to the target domain. We validate our approach through comprehensive evaluations on both a synthetic dataset using Morpho-MNIST (for controlled validation of core principles) and three MRI hippocampus datasets representing populations with varying degrees of atrophy. Across all experiments, our method outperforms existing baselines. For hippocampus segmentation, when transferring from young, healthy populations to clinical dementia patients, our framework achieves up to 15% relative improvement in Dice score compared to standard augmentation methods, with the largest gains observed in scenarios with substantial content shift. These results highlight the efficacy of our approach for accurate hippocampus segmentation across diverse populations.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Infrared and visible image fusion aims to integrate complementary information from co-registered source images to produce a single, informative result. Most learning-based approaches train with a combination of structural similarity loss, intensity reconstruction loss, and a gradient-magnitude term. However, collapsing gradients to their magnitude removes directional information, yielding ambiguous supervision and suboptimal edge fidelity. We introduce a direction-aware, multi-scale gradient loss that supervises horizontal and vertical components separately and preserves their sign across scales. This axis-wise, sign-preserving objective provides clear directional guidance at both fine and coarse resolutions, promoting sharper, better-aligned edges and richer texture preservation without changing model architectures or training protocols. Experiments on open-source model and multiple public benchmarks demonstrate effectiveness of our approach.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this paper, we identify that the key criterion for determining whether a model is truly capable of novel view synthesis (NVS) is transferability: Whether any pose representation extracted from one video sequence can be used to re-render the same camera trajectory in another. We analyze prior work on self-supervised NVS and find that their predicted poses do not transfer: The same set of poses lead to different camera trajectories in different 3D scenes. Here, we present XFactor, the first geometry-free self-supervised model capable of true NVS. XFactor combines pair-wise pose estimation with a simple augmentation scheme of the inputs and outputs that jointly enables disentangling camera pose from scene content and facilitates geometric reasoning. Remarkably, we show that XFactor achieves transferability with unconstrained latent pose variables, without any 3D inductive biases or concepts from multi-view geometry -- such as an explicit parameterization of poses as elements of SE(3). We introduce a new metric to quantify transferability, and through large-scale experiments, we demonstrate that XFactor significantly outperforms prior pose-free NVS transformers, and show that latent poses are highly correlated with real-world poses through probing experiments.

  Accurate detection of cardiac abnormalities from electrocardiogram recordings is regarded as essential for clinical diagnostics and decision support. Traditional deep learning models such as residual networks and transformer architectures have been applied successfully to this task, but their performance has been limited when long sequential signals are processed. Recently, state space models have been introduced as an efficient alternative. In this study, a hybrid framework named One Dimensional Convolutional Neural Network Electrocardiogram Mamba is introduced, in which convolutional feature extraction is combined with Mamba, a selective state space model designed for effective sequence modeling. The model is built upon Vision Mamba, a bidirectional variant through which the representation of temporal dependencies in electrocardiogram data is enhanced. Comprehensive experiments on the PhysioNet Computing in Cardiology Challenges of 2020 and 2021 were conducted, and superior performance compared with existing methods was achieved. Specifically, the proposed model achieved substantially higher AUPRC and AUROC scores than those reported by the best previously published algorithms on twelve lead electrocardiograms. These results demonstrate the potential of Mamba-based architectures to advance reliable ECG classification. This capability supports early diagnosis and personalized treatment, while enhancing accessibility in telemedicine and resource-constrained healthcare systems.

  Human motion is inherently diverse and semantically rich, while also shaped by the surrounding scene. However, existing motion generation approaches address either motion semantics or scene-awareness in isolation, since constructing large-scale datasets with both rich text--motion coverage and precise scene interactions is extremely challenging. In this work, we introduce SceneAdapt, a framework that injects scene awareness into text-conditioned motion models by leveraging disjoint scene--motion and text--motion datasets through two adaptation stages: inbetweening and scene-aware inbetweening. The key idea is to use motion inbetweening, learnable without text, as a proxy task to bridge two distinct datasets and thereby inject scene-awareness to text-to-motion models. In the first stage, we introduce keyframing layers that modulate motion latents for inbetweening while preserving the latent manifold. In the second stage, we add a scene-conditioning layer that injects scene geometry by adaptively querying local context through cross-attention. Experimental results show that SceneAdapt effectively injects scene awareness into text-to-motion models, and we further analyze the mechanisms through which this awareness emerges. Code and models will be released.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Text-to-video (T2V) generation models have made significant progress in creating visually appealing videos. However, they struggle with generating coherent sequential narratives that require logical progression through multiple events. Existing T2V benchmarks primarily focus on visual quality metrics but fail to evaluate narrative coherence over extended sequences. To bridge this gap, we present SeqBench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating sequential narrative coherence in T2V generation. SeqBench includes a carefully designed dataset of 320 prompts spanning various narrative complexities, with 2,560 human-annotated videos generated from 8 state-of-the-art T2V models. Additionally, we design a Dynamic Temporal Graphs (DTG)-based automatic evaluation metric, which can efficiently capture long-range dependencies and temporal ordering while maintaining computational efficiency. Our DTG-based metric demonstrates a strong correlation with human annotations. Through systematic evaluation using SeqBench, we reveal critical limitations in current T2V models: failure to maintain consistent object states across multi-action sequences, physically implausible results in multi-object scenarios, and difficulties in preserving realistic timing and ordering relationships between sequential actions. SeqBench provides the first systematic framework for evaluating narrative coherence in T2V generation and offers concrete insights for improving sequential reasoning capabilities in future models.

  Understanding fine-grained actions and accurately localizing their corresponding actors in space and time are fundamental capabilities for advancing next-generation AI systems, including embodied agents, autonomous platforms, and human-AI interaction frameworks. Despite recent progress in video understanding, existing methods predominantly address either coarse-grained action recognition or generic object tracking, thereby overlooking the challenge of jointly detecting and tracking multiple objects according to their actions while grounding them temporally. To address this gap, we introduce Spatio-temporal Video Action Grounding (SVAG), a novel task that requires models to simultaneously detect, track, and temporally localize all referent objects in videos based on natural language descriptions of their actions. To support this task, we construct SVAG-Bench, a large-scale benchmark comprising 688 videos, 19,590 annotated records, and 903 unique verbs, covering a diverse range of objects, actions, and real-world scenes. We further propose SVAGFormer, a baseline framework that adapts state of the art vision language models for joint spatial and temporal grounding, and introduce SVAGEval, a standardized evaluation toolkit for fair and reproducible benchmarking. Empirical results show that existing models perform poorly on SVAG, particularly in dense or complex scenes, underscoring the need for more advanced reasoning over fine-grained object-action interactions in long videos.

  Vision-language models (VLMs) benefit from multiple vision encoders, but naively stacking them yields diminishing returns while multiplying inference costs. We propose SCOPE, a Mixture-of-Encoders (MoEnc) framework that dynamically selects one specialized encoder per image-text pair via instance-level routing, unlike token-level routing in traditional MoE. SCOPE maintains a shared encoder and a pool of routed encoders. A lightweight router uses cross-attention between text prompts and shared visual features to select the optimal encoder from the routed encoders. To train this router, we introduce dual entropy regularization with auxiliary losses to balance dataset-level load distribution with instance-level routing confidence. Remarkably, SCOPE with one shared plus one routed encoder outperforms models using all four extra encoders simultaneously, while reducing compute by 24-49\%. This demonstrates that intelligent encoder selection beats brute-force aggregation, challenging the prevailing paradigm in multi-encoder VLMs.

  _Denis Rychkovskiy, GPT-5_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce CADE 2.5 (Comfy Adaptive Detail Enhancer), a sampler-level guidance stack for SD/SDXL latent diffusion models. The central module, ZeResFDG, unifies (i) frequency-decoupled guidance that reweights low- and high-frequency components of the guidance signal, (ii) energy rescaling that matches the per-sample magnitude of the guided prediction to the positive branch, and (iii) zero-projection that removes the component parallel to the unconditional direction. A lightweight spectral EMA with hysteresis switches between a conservative and a detail-seeking mode as structure crystallizes during sampling. Across SD/SDXL samplers, ZeResFDG improves sharpness, prompt adherence, and artifact control at moderate guidance scales without any retraining. In addition, we employ a training-free inference-time stabilizer, QSilk Micrograin Stabilizer (quantile clamp + depth/edge-gated micro-detail injection), which improves robustness and yields natural high-frequency micro-texture at high resolutions with negligible overhead. For completeness we note that the same rule is compatible with alternative parameterizations (e.g., velocity), which we briefly discuss in the Appendix; however, this paper focuses on SD/SDXL latent diffusion models.

  Vision-language models (VLMs) achieve remarkable performance through large-scale image-text pretraining. However, their reliance on labeled image datasets limits scalability and leaves vast amounts of unlabeled image data underutilized. To address this, we propose Unified Vision-Language Alignment for Zero-Label Enhancement (ViZer), an enhancement training framework that enables zero-label learning in image captioning, providing a practical starting point for broader zero-label adaptation in vision-language tasks. Unlike prior approaches that rely on human or synthetically annotated datasets, ViZer actively aligns vision and language representation features during training, enabling existing VLMs to generate improved captions without requiring text labels or full retraining. We demonstrate ViZer's advantage in qualitative evaluation, as automated caption metrics such as CIDEr and BERTScore often penalize details that are absent in reference captions. Applying ViZer on SmolVLM-Base and Qwen2-VL, we observe consistent qualitative improvements, producing captions that are more grounded and descriptive than their baseline.

  Various deep learning-based systems have been proposed for accurate and convenient plant disease diagnosis, achieving impressive performance. However, recent studies show that these systems often fail to maintain diagnostic accuracy on images captured under different conditions from the training environment -- an essential criterion for model robustness. Many deep learning methods have shown high accuracy in plant disease diagnosis. However, they often struggle to generalize to images taken in conditions that differ from the training setting. This drop in performance stems from the subtle variability of disease symptoms and domain gaps -- differences in image context and environment. The root cause is the limited diversity of training data relative to task complexity, making even advanced models vulnerable in unseen domains. To tackle this challenge, we propose a simple yet highly adaptable learning framework called Target-Aware Metric Learning with Prioritized Sampling (TMPS), grounded in metric learning. TMPS operates under the assumption of access to a limited number of labeled samples from the target (deployment) domain and leverages these samples effectively to improve diagnostic robustness. We assess TMPS on a large-scale automated plant disease diagnostic task using a dataset comprising 223,073 leaf images sourced from 23 agricultural fields, spanning 21 diseases and healthy instances across three crop species. By incorporating just 10 target domain samples per disease into training, TMPS surpasses models trained using the same combined source and target samples, and those fine-tuned with these target samples after pre-training on source data. It achieves average macro F1 score improvements of 7.3 and 3.6 points, respectively, and a remarkable 18.7 and 17.1 point improvement over the baseline and conventional metric learning.

  Surgical future prediction, driven by real-time AI analysis of surgical video, is critical for operating room safety and efficiency. It provides actionable insights into upcoming events, their timing, and risks-enabling better resource allocation, timely instrument readiness, and early warnings for complications (e.g., bleeding, bile duct injury). Despite this need, current surgical AI research focuses on understanding what is happening rather than predicting future events. Existing methods target specific tasks in isolation, lacking unified approaches that span both short-term (action triplets, events) and long-term horizons (remaining surgery duration, phase transitions). These methods rely on coarse-grained supervision while fine-grained surgical action triplets and steps remain underexplored. Furthermore, methods based only on future feature prediction struggle to generalize across different surgical contexts and procedures. We address these limits by reframing surgical future prediction as state-change learning. Rather than forecasting raw observations, our approach classifies state transitions between current and future timesteps. We introduce SurgFUTR, implementing this through a teacher-student architecture. Video clips are compressed into state representations via Sinkhorn-Knopp clustering; the teacher network learns from both current and future clips, while the student network predicts future states from current videos alone, guided by our Action Dynamics (ActDyn) module. We establish SFPBench with five prediction tasks spanning short-term (triplets, events) and long-term (remaining surgery duration, phase and step transitions) horizons. Experiments across four datasets and three procedures show consistent improvements. Cross-procedure transfer validates generalizability.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Open-Set Domain Generalization (OSDG) aims to enable deep learning models to recognize unseen categories in new domains, which is crucial for real-world applications. Label noise hinders open-set domain generalization by corrupting source-domain knowledge, making it harder to recognize known classes and reject unseen ones. While existing methods address OSDG under Noisy Labels (OSDG-NL) using hyperbolic prototype-guided meta-learning, they struggle to bridge domain gaps, especially with limited clean labeled data. In this paper, we propose Evidential Reliability-Aware Residual Flow Meta-Learning (EReLiFM). We first introduce an unsupervised two-stage evidential loss clustering method to promote label reliability awareness. Then, we propose a residual flow matching mechanism that models structured domain- and category-conditioned residuals, enabling diverse and uncertainty-aware transfer paths beyond interpolation-based augmentation. During this meta-learning process, the model is optimized such that the update direction on the clean set maximizes the loss decrease on the noisy set, using pseudo labels derived from the most confident predicted class for supervision. Experimental results show that EReLiFM outperforms existing methods on OSDG-NL, achieving state-of-the-art performance. The source code is available atthis https URL.

  Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) swarm systems necessitate efficient collaborative perception mechanisms for diverse operational scenarios. Current Bird's Eye View (BEV)-based approaches exhibit two main limitations: bounding-box representations fail to capture complete semantic and geometric information of the scene, and their performance significantly degrades when encountering undefined or occluded objects. To address these limitations, we propose a novel multi-UAV collaborative occupancy prediction framework. Our framework effectively preserves 3D spatial structures and semantics through integrating a Spatial-Aware Feature Encoder and Cross-Agent Feature Integration. To enhance efficiency, we further introduce Altitude-Aware Feature Reduction to compactly represent scene information, along with a Dual-Mask Perceptual Guidance mechanism to adaptively select features and reduce communication overhead. Due to the absence of suitable benchmark datasets, we extend three datasets for evaluation: two virtual datasets (Air-to-Pred-Occ and UAV3D-Occ) and one real-world dataset (GauUScene-Occ). Experiments results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, significantly outperforming existing collaborative methods while reducing communication overhead to only a fraction of previous approaches.

  Generalist visual captioning goes beyond a simple appearance description task, but requires integrating a series of visual cues into a caption and handling various visual domains. In this task, current open-source models present a large performance gap with commercial ones, which limits various applications such as data synthesis. To bridge the gap, this paper proposes CapFlow, a novel multi-agent collaboration workflow. CapFlow demonstrates for the first time that, by capitalizing on open-source models, it is possible to achieve caption quality on par with GPT-4.1 in various domains with an 89.5% reduction in costs. By leveraging CapFlow as the data synthesizer, we produce high-quality visual captions from image and video domains at scale, and obtain a generalist visual captioner via fine-tuning, namely MetaCaptioner. Through extensive experiments, we show that MetaCaptioner not only achieves comparable captioning capabilities with commercial models but also reaches top-tier multimodal performance in the open-source community. We hope CapFlow and MetaCaptioner can benefit future multimodal research by providing a strong and cost-effective visual captioning solution.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent approaches for vision-language models (VLMs) have shown remarkable success in achieving fast downstream adaptation. When applied to real-world downstream tasks, VLMs inevitably encounter both the in-distribution (ID) data and out-of-distribution (OOD) data. The OOD datasets often include both covariate shifts (e.g., known classes with changes in image styles) and semantic shifts (e.g., test-time unseen classes). This highlights the importance of improving VLMs' generalization ability to covariate-shifted OOD data, while effectively detecting open-set semantic-shifted OOD classes. In this paper, inspired by the substantial energy change observed in closed-set data when re-aligning vision-language modalities (specifically by directly reducing the maximum cosine similarity to a low value), we introduce a novel OOD score, named {\Delta}Energy. {\Delta}Energy significantly outperforms the vanilla energy-based OOD score and provides a more reliable approach for OOD detection. Furthermore, {\Delta}Energy can simultaneously improve OOD generalization under covariate shifts, which is achieved by lower-bound maximization for {\Delta}Energy (termed EBM). EBM is theoretically proven to not only enhance OOD detection but also yields a domain-consistent Hessian, which serves as a strong indicator for OOD generalization. Based on this finding, we developed a unified fine-tuning framework that allows for improving VLMs' robustness in both OOD generalization and OOD detection. Extensive experiments on challenging OOD detection and generalization benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our method, outperforming recent approaches by 10% to 25% in AUROC.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advancements in multimodal reward models (RMs) have substantially improved post-training for visual generative models. However, current RMs face inherent limitations: (1) visual inputs consume large context budgets, forcing fewer frames and causing loss of fine-grained details; and (2) all visual information is packed into the initial prompt, exacerbating hallucination and forgetting during chain-of-thought reasoning. To overcome these issues, we introduce VideoReward Thinker (VR-Thinker), a thinking-with-image framework that equips the RM with visual reasoning operations (e.g., select frame) and a configurable visual memory window. This allows the RM to actively acquire and update visual evidence within context limits, improving reasoning fidelity and reliability. We activate visual reasoning via a reinforcement fine-tuning pipeline: (i) Cold Start with curated visual chain-of-thought data to distill basic reasoning skills and operation formatting; (ii) select samples whose per-dimension and overall judgments are all correct, then conduct Rejection sampling Fine-Tuning on these high-quality traces to further enhance reasoning; and (iii) apply Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to strengthen reasoning. Our approach delivers state-of-the-art accuracy among open-source models on video preference benchmarks, especially for longer videos: a 7B VR-Thinker achieves 80.5% on VideoGen Reward, 82.3% on GenAI-Bench, and 75.6% on MJ-Bench-Video. These results validate the effectiveness and promise of thinking-with-image multimodal reward modeling.

  This paper presents a comprehensive overview of the Ultralytics YOLO(You Only Look Once) family of object detectors, focusing the architectural evolution, benchmarking, deployment perspectives, and future challenges. The review begins with the most recent release, YOLO26 (or YOLOv26), which introduces key innovations including Distribution Focal Loss (DFL) removal, native NMS-free inference, Progressive Loss Balancing (ProgLoss), Small-Target-Aware Label Assignment (STAL), and the MuSGD optimizer for stable training. The progression is then traced through YOLO11, with its hybrid task assignment and efficiency-focused modules; YOLOv8, which advanced with a decoupled detection head and anchor-free predictions; and YOLOv5, which established the modular PyTorch foundation that enabled modern YOLO development. Benchmarking on the MS COCO dataset provides a detailed quantitative comparison of YOLOv5, YOLOv8, YOLO11, and YOLO26 (YOLOv26), alongside cross-comparisons with YOLOv12, YOLOv13, RT-DETR, and DEIM(DETR with Improved Matching). Metrics including precision, recall, F1 score, mean Average Precision, and inference speed are analyzed to highlight trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency. Deployment and application perspectives are further discussed, covering export formats, quantization strategies, and real-world use in robotics, agriculture, surveillance, and manufacturing. Finally, the paper identifies challenges and future directions, including dense-scene limitations, hybrid CNN-Transformer integration, open-vocabulary detection, and edge-aware training approaches.

  AI-based colorization has shown remarkable capability in generating realistic color images from grayscale inputs. However, it poses risks of copyright infringement -- for example, the unauthorized colorization and resale of monochrome manga and films. Despite these concerns, no effective method currently exists to prevent such misuse. To address this, we introduce the first defensive paradigm, Uncolorable Examples, which embed imperceptible perturbations into grayscale images to invalidate unauthorized colorization. To ensure real-world applicability, we establish four criteria: effectiveness, imperceptibility, transferability, and robustness. Our method, Perception-Aware Chroma-Restrictive Perturbation (PAChroma), generates Uncolorable Examples that meet these four criteria by optimizing imperceptible perturbations with a Laplacian filter to preserve perceptual quality, and applying diverse input transformations during optimization to enhance transferability across models and robustness against common post-processing (e.g., compression). Experiments on ImageNet and Danbooru datasets demonstrate that PAChroma effectively degrades colorization quality while maintaining the visual appearance. This work marks the first step toward protecting visual content from illegitimate AI colorization, paving the way for copyright-aware defenses in generative media.

  Vision language models (VLMs) are increasingly deployed as controllers with access to external tools for complex reasoning and decision-making, yet their effectiveness remains limited by the scarcity of high-quality multimodal trajectories and the cost of manual annotation. We address this challenge with a vision-centric agent tuning framework that automatically synthesizes multimodal trajectories, generates step-wise preference pairs, and trains a VLM controller for robust tool-use reasoning. Our pipeline first constructs M-TRACE, a large-scale dataset of 28.5K multimodal tasks with 177K verified trajectories, enabling imitation-based trajectory tuning. Building on this, we develop MATRIX Agent, a controller finetuned on M-TRACE for step-wise tool reasoning. To achieve finer alignment, we further introduce Pref-X, a set of 11K automatically generated preference pairs, and optimize MATRIX on it via step-wise preference learning. Across three benchmarks, Agent-X, GTA, and GAIA, MATRIX consistently surpasses both open- and closed-source VLMs, demonstrating scalable and effective multimodal tool use.

  Facial micro-expressions, characterized by their subtle and brief nature, are valuable indicators of genuine emotions. Despite their significance in psychology, security, and behavioral analysis, micro-expression recognition remains challenging due to the difficulty of capturing subtle facial movements. Optical flow has been widely employed as an input modality for this task due to its effectiveness. However, most existing methods compute optical flow only between the onset and apex frames, thereby overlooking essential motion information in the apex-to-offset phase. To address this limitation, we first introduce a comprehensive motion representation, termed Magnitude-Modulated Combined Optical Flow (MM-COF), which integrates motion dynamics from both micro-expression phases into a unified descriptor suitable for direct use in recognition networks. Building upon this principle, we then propose FMANet, a novel end-to-end neural network architecture that internalizes the dual-phase analysis and magnitude modulation into learnable modules. This allows the network to adaptively fuse motion cues and focus on salient facial regions for classification. Experimental evaluations on the MMEW, SMIC, CASME-II, and SAMM datasets, widely recognized as standard benchmarks, demonstrate that our proposed MM-COF representation and FMANet outperforms existing methods, underscoring the potential of a learnable, dual-phase framework in advancing micro-expression recognition.

  Recent advances in image generation and editing technologies have enabled state-of-the-art models to achieve impressive results in general domains. However, when applied to e-commerce scenarios, these general models often encounter consistency limitations. To address this challenge, we introduce TBStar-Edit, an new image editing model tailored for the e-commerce domain. Through rigorous data engineering, model architecture design and training strategy, TBStar-Edit achieves precise and high-fidelity image editing while maintaining the integrity of product appearance and layout. Specifically, for data engineering, we establish a comprehensive data construction pipeline, encompassing data collection, construction, filtering, and augmentation, to acquire high-quality, instruction-following, and strongly consistent editing data to support model training. For model architecture design, we design a hierarchical model framework consisting of a base model, pattern shifting modules, and consistency enhancement modules. For model training, we adopt a two-stage training strategy to enhance the consistency preservation: first stage for editing pattern shifting, and second stage for consistency enhancement. Each stage involves training different modules with separate datasets. Finally, we conduct extensive evaluations of TBStar-Edit on a self-proposed e-commerce benchmark, and the results demonstrate that TBStar-Edit outperforms existing general-domain editing models in both objective metrics (VIE Score) and subjective user preference.

  _Ruitao Wu, Yifan Zhao, Guangyao Chen, Jia Li_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL) challenges models to sequentially learn new classes from minimal examples without forgetting prior knowledge, a task complicated by the stability-plasticity dilemma and data scarcity. Current FSCIL methods often struggle with generalization due to their reliance on limited datasets. While diffusion models offer a path for data augmentation, their direct application can lead to semantic misalignment or ineffective guidance. This paper introduces Diffusion-Classifier Synergy (DCS), a novel framework that establishes a mutual boosting loop between diffusion model and FSCIL classifier. DCS utilizes a reward-aligned learning strategy, where a dynamic, multi-faceted reward function derived from the classifier's state directs the diffusion model. This reward system operates at two levels: the feature level ensures semantic coherence and diversity using prototype-anchored maximum mean discrepancy and dimension-wise variance matching, while the logits level promotes exploratory image generation and enhances inter-class discriminability through confidence recalibration and cross-session confusion-aware mechanisms. This co-evolutionary process, where generated images refine the classifier and an improved classifier state yields better reward signals, demonstrably achieves state-of-the-art performance on FSCIL benchmarks, significantly enhancing both knowledge retention and new class learning.

  In Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, robustness to real-world perturbations is critical for deployment. Existing methods target simple visual disturbances, overlooking the broader multi-modal perturbations that arise in actions, instructions, environments, and observations. Here, we first evaluate the robustness of mainstream VLAs under 17 perturbations across four modalities. We find (1) actions as the most fragile modality, (2) Existing visual-robust VLA do not gain robustness in other modality, and (3) pi0 demonstrates superior robustness with a diffusion-based action head. To build multi-modal robust VLAs, we propose RobustVLA against perturbations in VLA inputs and outputs. For output robustness, we perform offline robust optimization against worst-case action noise that maximizes mismatch in flow matching objective. This can be seen as adversarial training, label smoothing, and outlier penalization. For input robustness, we enforce consistent actions across input variations that preserve task semantics. To account for multiple perturbations, we formulate robustness as a multi-armed bandit problem and apply an upper confidence bound algorithm to automatically identify the most harmful noise. Experiments on LIBERO demonstrate our RobustVLA delivers absolute gains over baselines of 12.6% on the pi0 backbone and 10.4% on the OpenVLA backbone across all 17 perturbations, achieving 50.6x faster inference than existing visual-robust VLAs, and a 10.4% gain under mixed perturbations. Our RobustVLA is particularly effective on real-world FR5 robot with limited demonstrations, showing absolute gains by 65.6% under perturbations of four modalities.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant advances in visual understanding tasks. However, their capacity to comprehend human-centric scenes has rarely been explored, primarily due to the absence of comprehensive evaluation benchmarks that take into account both the human-oriented granular level and higher-dimensional causal reasoning ability. Such high-quality evaluation benchmarks face tough obstacles, given the physical complexity of the human body and the difficulty of annotating granular structures. In this paper, we propose Human-MME, a curated benchmark designed to provide a more holistic evaluation of MLLMs in human-centric scene understanding. Compared with other existing benchmarks, our work provides three key features: 1. Diversity in human scene, spanning 4 primary visual domains with 15 secondary domains and 43 sub-fields to ensure broad scenario coverage. 2. Progressive and diverse evaluation dimensions, evaluating the human-based activities progressively from the human-oriented granular perception to the higher-dimensional reasoning, consisting of eight dimensions with 19,945 real-world image question pairs and an evaluation suite. 3. High-quality annotations with rich data paradigms, constructing the automated annotation pipeline and human-annotation platform, supporting rigorous manual labeling to facilitate precise and reliable model assessment. Our benchmark extends the single-target understanding to the multi-person and multi-image mutual understanding by constructing the choice, short-answer, grounding, ranking and judgment question components, and complex questions of their combination. The extensive experiments on 17 state-of-the-art MLLMs effectively expose the limitations and guide future MLLMs research toward better human-centric image understanding.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Referring expression understanding in remote sensing poses unique challenges, as it requires reasoning over complex object-context relationships. While supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on multimodal large language models achieves strong performance with massive labeled datasets, they struggle in data-scarce scenarios, leading to poor generalization. To address this limitation, we propose Geo-R1, a reasoning-centric reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) paradigm for few-shot geospatial referring. Geo-R1 enforces the model to first generate explicit, interpretable reasoning chains that decompose referring expressions, and then leverage these rationales to localize target objects. This "reason first, then act" process enables the model to make more effective use of limited annotations, enhances generalization, and provides interpretability. We validate Geo-R1 on three carefully designed few-shot geospatial referring benchmarks, where our model consistently and substantially outperforms SFT baselines. It also demonstrates strong cross-dataset generalization, highlighting its robustness. Code and data will be released at:this https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Model pruning has gained traction as a promising defense strategy against backdoor attacks in deep learning. However, existing pruning-based approaches often fall short in accurately identifying and removing the specific parameters responsible for inducing backdoor behaviors. Despite the dominance of fine-tuning-based defenses in recent literature, largely due to their superior performance, pruning remains a compelling alternative, offering greater interpretability and improved robustness in low-data regimes. In this paper, we propose a novel pruning approach featuring a learned \emph{selection} mechanism to identify parameters critical to both main and backdoor tasks, along with an \emph{invertible} pruning mask designed to simultaneously achieve two complementary goals: eliminating the backdoor task while preserving it through the inverse mask. We formulate this as a bi-level optimization problem that jointly learns selection variables, a sparse invertible mask, and sample-specific backdoor perturbations derived from clean data. The inner problem synthesizes candidate triggers using the inverse mask, while the outer problem refines the mask to suppress backdoor behavior without impairing clean-task accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing pruning-based backdoor mitigation approaches, maintains strong performance under limited data conditions, and achieves competitive results compared to state-of-the-art fine-tuning approaches. Notably, the proposed approach is particularly effective in restoring correct predictions for compromised samples after successful backdoor mitigation.

  We present CAGE (Continuity-Aware edGE) network, a robust framework for reconstructing vector floorplans directly from point-cloud density maps. Traditional corner-based polygon representations are highly sensitive to noise and incomplete observations, often resulting in fragmented or implausiblethis http URLline grouping methods leverage structural cues to improve robustness but still struggle to recover fine geometric details. To address these limitations,we propose a native edge-centric formulation, modeling each wall segment as a directed, geometrically continuous edge. This representation enables inference of coherent floorplan structures, ensuring watertight, topologically valid room boundaries while improving robustness and reducing artifacts. Towards this design, we develop a dual-query transformer decoder that integrates perturbed and latent queries within a denoising framework, which not only stabilizes optimization but also accelerates convergence. Extensive experiments on Structured3D and SceneCAD show that CAGE achieves state-of-the-art performance, with F1 scores of 99.1% (rooms), 91.7% (corners), and 89.3% (angles). The method also demonstrates strong cross-dataset generalization, underscoring the efficacy of our architectural innovations.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  While specialized detectors for AI-generated images excel on curated benchmarks, they fail catastrophically in real-world scenarios, as evidenced by their critically high false-negative rates on `in-the-wild' benchmarks. Instead of crafting another specialized `knife' for this problem, we bring a `gun' to the fight: a simple linear classifier on a modern Vision Foundation Model (VFM). Trained on identical data, this baseline decisively `outguns' bespoke detectors, boosting in-the-wild accuracy by a striking margin of over 20\%.Our analysis pinpoints the source of the VFM's `firepower': First, by probing text-image similarities, we find that recent VLMs (e.g., Perception Encoder, Meta CLIP2) have learned to align synthetic images with forgery-related concepts (e.g., `AI-generated'), unlike previous versions. Second, we speculate that this is due to data exposure, as both this alignment and overall accuracy plummet on a novel dataset scraped after the VFM's pre-training cut-off date, ensuring it was unseen during pre-training. Our findings yield two critical conclusions: 1) For the real-world `gunfight' of AI-generated image detection, the raw `firepower' of an updated VFM is far more effective than the `craftsmanship' of a static detector. 2) True generalization evaluation requires test data to be independent of the model's entire training history, including pre-training.

  Medical vision-language models (Med-VLMs) have shown impressive results in tasks such as report generation and visual question answering, but they still face several limitations. Most notably, they underutilize patient metadata and lack integration of clinical diagnostic knowledge. Moreover, most existing models are typically trained from scratch or fine-tuned on large-scale 2D image-text pairs, requiring extensive computational resources, and their effectiveness on 3D medical imaging is often limited due to the absence of structural information. To address these gaps, we propose a data-efficient fine-tuning pipeline to adapt 3D CT-based Med-VLMs for 3D MRI and demonstrate its application in Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis. Our system introduces two key innovations. First, we convert structured metadata into synthetic reports, enriching textual input for improved image-text alignment. Second, we add an auxiliary token trained to predict the mini-mental state examination (MMSE) score, a widely used clinical measure of cognitive function that correlates with AD severity. This provides additional supervision for fine-tuning. Applying lightweight prompt tuning to both image and text modalities, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on ADNI with only 1,504 training MRIs, outperforming methods trained on 27,161 MRIs, and shows strong zero-shot generalization on OASIS-2 and AIBL.

  Writing is a universal cultural technology that reuses vision for symbolic communication. Humans display striking resilience: we readily recognize words even when characters are fragmented, fused, or partially occluded. This paper investigates whether advanced vision language models (VLMs) share this resilience. We construct two psychophysics inspired benchmarks across distinct writing systems, Chinese logographs and English alphabetic words, by splicing, recombining, and overlaying glyphs to yield ''visible but unreadable'' stimuli for models while remaining legible to humans. Despite strong performance on clean text, contemporary VLMs show a severe drop under these perturbations, frequently producing unrelated or incoherent outputs. The pattern suggests a structural limitation: models heavily leverage generic visual invariances but under rely on compositional priors needed for robust literacy. We release stimuli generation code, prompts, and evaluation protocols to facilitate transparent replication and follow up work. Our findings motivate architectures and training strategies that encode symbol segmentation, composition, and binding across scripts, and they delineate concrete challenges for deploying multimodal systems in education, accessibility, cultural heritage, and security.

  Accurate segmentation of organs and tumors in CT and MRI scans is essential for diagnosis, treatment planning, and disease monitoring. While deep learning has advanced automated segmentation, most models remain task-specific, lacking generalizability across modalities and institutions. Vision foundation models (FMs) pretrained on billion-scale natural images offer powerful and transferable representations. However, adapting them to medical imaging faces two key challenges: (1) the ViT backbone of most foundation models still underperform specialized CNNs on medical image segmentation, and (2) the large domain gap between natural and medical images limits transferability. We introduce MedDINOv3, a simple and effective framework for adapting DINOv3 to medical segmentation. We first revisit plain ViTs and design a simple and effective architecture with multi-scale token aggregation. Then, we perform domain-adaptive pretraining on CT-3M, a curated collection of 3.87M axial CT slices, using a multi-stage DINOv3 recipe to learn robust dense features. MedDINOv3 matches or exceeds state-of-the-art performance across four segmentation benchmarks, demonstrating the potential of vision foundation models as unified backbones for medical image segmentation.

  Methane is a potent greenhouse gas and a major driver of climate change, making its timely detection critical for effective mitigation. Machine learning (ML) deployed onboard satellites can enable rapid detection while reducing downlink costs, supporting faster response systems. Conventional methane detection methods often rely on image processing techniques, such as orthorectification to correct geometric distortions and matched filters to enhance plume signals. We introduce a novel approach that bypasses these preprocessing steps by using \textit{unorthorectified} data (UnorthoDOS). We find that ML models trained on this dataset achieve performance comparable to those trained on orthorectified data. Moreover, we also train models on an orthorectified dataset, showing that they can outperform the matched filter baseline (mag1c). We release model checkpoints and two ML-ready datasets comprising orthorectified and unorthorectified hyperspectral images from the Earth Surface Mineral Dust Source Investigation (EMIT) sensor atthis https URL, along with code atthis https URL.

  Object hallucination in large vision-language models presents a significant challenge to their safe deployment in real-world applications. Recent works have proposed object-level hallucination scores to estimate the likelihood of object hallucination; however, these methods typically adopt either a global or local perspective in isolation, which may limit detection reliability. In this paper, we introduce GLSim, a novel training-free object hallucination detection framework that leverages complementary global and local embedding similarity signals between image and text modalities, enabling more accurate and reliable hallucination detection in diverse scenarios. We comprehensively benchmark existing object hallucination detection methods and demonstrate that GLSim achieves superior detection performance, outperforming competitive baselines by a significant margin.

  Test-time adaptation (TTA) enhances the zero-shot robustness under distribution shifts by leveraging unlabeled test data during inference. Despite notable advances, several challenges still limit its broader applicability. First, most methods rely on backpropagation or iterative optimization, which limits scalability and hinders real-time deployment. Second, they lack explicit modeling of class-conditional feature distributions. This modeling is crucial for producing reliable decision boundaries and calibrated predictions, but it remains underexplored due to the lack of both source data and supervision at test time. In this paper, we propose ADAPT, an Advanced Distribution-Aware and backPropagation-free Test-time adaptation method. We reframe TTA as a Gaussian probabilistic inference task by modeling class-conditional likelihoods using gradually updated class means and a shared covariance matrix. This enables closed-form, training-free inference. To correct potential likelihood bias, we introduce lightweight regularization guided by CLIP priors and a historical knowledge bank. ADAPT requires no source data, no gradient updates, and no full access to target data, supporting both online and transductive settings. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance under a wide range of distribution shifts with superior scalability and robustness.

  Despite deep learning's broad success, its abstract-reasoning bottleneck persists. We tackle Raven's Progressive Matrices (RPM), the benchmark for pattern, reasoning and problem-solving intelligence. We model the full causal chain image $\rightarrow$ attributes $\rightarrow$ progressive patterns $\rightarrow$ consistency $\rightarrow$ answer and build the baseline DIO. Yet DIO's mutual-information lower-bound objective does not embed human logic: the bound is loose and statistic-based, ignoring causal subject-object links. We therefore present three refinements. 1) Brando introduces trainable negative options to tighten the variational bound. 2) WORLD replaces generation with a Gaussian-mixture feature model that supplies infinite, weighted negatives, further tightening the bound. 3) DIEGO adds metadata supervision to rectify the "attributes $\rightarrow$ patterns" semantic gap, aligning representations with human rules. These upgrades substantially boost discriminative RPM accuracy and, for the first time, let DIO generate valid answers in open-ended RPM. The work provides causal-driven design guidelines, objective-refinement strategies and cross-modal insights for abstract-reasoning research.

  Symmetry is a fundamental concept that has been extensively studied, yet detecting it in complex scenes remains a significant challenge in computer vision. Recent heatmap-based approaches can localize potential regions of symmetry axes but often lack precision in identifying individual axes. In this work, we propose a novel framework for axis-level detection of the two most common symmetry types-reflection and rotation-by representing them as explicit geometric primitives, i.e. lines and points. Our method employs a dual-branch architecture that is equivariant to the dihedral group, with each branch specialized to exploit the structure of dihedral group-equivariant features for its respective symmetry type. For reflection symmetry, we introduce orientational anchors, aligned with group components, to enable orientation-specific detection, and a reflectional matching that measures similarity between patterns and their mirrored counterparts across candidate axes. For rotational symmetry, we propose a rotational matching that compares patterns at fixed angular intervals to identify rotational centers. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing approaches.

  The increasing number of Health Care facilities in Nepal has added up the challenges on managing health care waste (HCW). Improper segregation and disposal of HCW leads to contamination, spreading of infectious diseases and risk for waste handlers. This study benchmarks the state of the art waste classification models: ResNeXt-50, EfficientNet-B0, MobileNetV3-S, YOLOv8-n and YOLOv5-s using stratified 5-fold cross-validation technique on combined HCW data. YOLOv5-s achieved the highest accuracy (95.06%) but fell short with the YOLOv8-n model in inference speed with few milliseconds. The EfficientNet-B0 showed promising results of 93.22% accuracy but took the highest inference time. Following a repetitive ANOVA test to confirm the statistical significance, the best performing model (YOLOv5-s) was deployed to the web with bin color mapped using Nepal's HCW management standards. Further work is suggested to address data limitation and ensure localized context.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent flow matching models for text-to-image generation have achieved remarkable quality, yet their integration with reinforcement learning for human preference alignment remains suboptimal, hindering fine-grained reward-based optimization. We observe that the key impediment to effective GRPO training of flow models is the temporal uniformity assumption in existing approaches: sparse terminal rewards with uniform credit assignment fail to capture the varying criticality of decisions across generation timesteps, resulting in inefficient exploration and suboptimal convergence. To remedy this shortcoming, we introduce \textbf{TempFlow-GRPO} (Temporal Flow GRPO), a principled GRPO framework that captures and exploits the temporal structure inherent in flow-based generation. TempFlow-GRPO introduces three key innovations: (i) a trajectory branching mechanism that provides process rewards by concentrating stochasticity at designated branching points, enabling precise credit assignment without requiring specialized intermediate reward models; (ii) a noise-aware weighting scheme that modulates policy optimization according to the intrinsic exploration potential of each timestep, prioritizing learning during high-impact early stages while ensuring stable refinement in later phases; and (iii) a seed group strategy that controls for initialization effects to isolate exploration contributions. These innovations endow the model with temporally-aware optimization that respects the underlying generative dynamics, leading to state-of-the-art performance in human preference alignment and text-to-image benchmarks.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce a modular framework for predicting cancer-specific survival from whole slide pathology images (WSIs) that significantly improves upon the state-of-the-art accuracy. Our method integrating four key components. Firstly, to tackle large size of WSIs, we use dynamic patch selection via quantile-based thresholding for isolating prognostically informative tissue regions. Secondly, we use graph-guided k-means clustering to capture phenotype-level heterogeneity through spatial and morphological coherence. Thirdly, we use attention mechanisms that model both intra- and inter-cluster relationships to contextualize local features within global spatial relations between various types of tissue compartments. Finally, we use an expert-guided mixture density modeling for estimating complex survival distributions using Gaussian mixture models. The proposed model achieves a concordance index of $0.712 \pm 0.028$ and Brier score of $0.254 \pm 0.018$ on TCGA-KIRC (renal cancer), and a concordance index of $0.645 \pm 0.017$ and Brier score of $0.281 \pm 0.031$ on TCGA-LUAD (lung adenocarcinoma). These results are significantly better than the state-of-art and demonstrate predictive potential of the proposed method across diverse cancer types.

  _Tom Kouwenhoven, Kiana Shahrasbi, Tessa Verhoef_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in multimodal models have raised questions about whether vision-and-language models (VLMs) integrate cross-modal information in ways that reflect human cognition. One well-studied test case in this domain is the bouba-kiki effect, where humans reliably associate pseudowords like `bouba' with round shapes and `kiki' with jagged ones. Given the mixed evidence found in prior studies for this effect in VLMs, we present a comprehensive re-evaluation focused on two variants of CLIP, ResNet and Vision Transformer (ViT), given their centrality in many state-of-the-art VLMs. We apply two complementary methods closely modelled after human experiments: a prompt-based evaluation that uses probabilities as a measure of model preference, and we use Grad-CAM as a novel approach to interpret visual attention in shape-word matching tasks. Our findings show that these model variants do not consistently exhibit the bouba-kiki effect. While ResNet shows a preference for round shapes, overall performance across both model variants lacks the expected associations. Moreover, direct comparison with prior human data on the same task shows that the models' responses fall markedly short of the robust, modality-integrated behaviour characteristic of human cognition. These results contribute to the ongoing debate about the extent to which VLMs truly understand cross-modal concepts, highlighting limitations in their internal representations and alignment with human intuitions.

  Enabling photorealistic avatar animations in virtual and augmented reality (VR/AR) has been challenging because of the difficulty of obtaining ground truth state of faces. It is physically impossible to obtain synchronized images from head-mounted cameras (HMC) sensing input, which has partial observations in infrared (IR), and an array of outside-in dome cameras, which have full observations that match avatars' appearance. Prior works relying on analysis-by-synthesis methods could generate accurate ground truth, but suffer from imperfect disentanglement between expression and style in their personalized training. The reliance of extensive paired captures (HMC and dome) for the same subject makes it operationally expensive to collect large-scale datasets, which cannot be reused for different HMC viewpoints and lighting. In this work, we propose a novel generative approach, Generative HMC (GenHMC), that leverages large unpaired HMC captures, which are much easier to collect, to directly generate high-quality synthetic HMC images given any conditioning avatar state from dome captures. We show that our method is able to properly disentangle the input conditioning signal that specifies facial expression and viewpoint, from facial appearance, leading to more accurate ground truth. Furthermore, our method can generalize to unseen identities, removing the reliance on the paired captures. We demonstrate these breakthroughs by both evaluating synthetic HMC images and universal face encoders trained from these new HMC-avatar correspondences, which achieve better data efficiency and state-of-the-art accuracy.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Despite significant recent progress of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), current MLLMs are challenged by "spatio-temporal" prompts, i.e., prompts that refer to 1) the entirety of an environment encoded in a point cloud that the MLLM should consider; and simultaneously also refer to 2) actions that happened in part of the environment and are encoded in a short ego-centric video clip. However, such a holistic spatio-temporal understanding is important for agents operating in the real world. To address this challenge, we first develop a framework to collect a large-scale dataset. Using the collected "Reasoning about Environments and Actions" (REA) dataset, we show that recent MLLMs indeed struggle to correctly answer "spatio-temporal" prompts. Building on this dataset, we study two spatio-temporal LLM (STLLM) baselines: 1) STLLM-3D, which directly fuses point cloud, video, and text representations as inputs to the LLM; and 2) STLLM-Aligner, which aligns spatial context with video and text before LLM decoding. Both baselines aim to enhance spatial understanding of environments and temporal grounding of egocentric observations. On REA, the STLLM baselines outperform existing models, demonstrating the effectiveness of our designs. Code and data are available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Accurate road topology reasoning is critical for autonomous driving, enabling effective navigation and adherence to traffic regulations. Central to this task are lane perception and topology reasoning. However, existing methods typically focus on either lane detection or Lane-to-Lane (L2L) topology reasoning, often \textit{neglecting} Lane-to-Traffic-element (L2T) relationships or \textit{failing} to optimize these tasks jointly. Furthermore, most approaches either overlook relational modeling or apply it in a limited scope, despite the inherent spatial relationships among road elements. We argue that relational modeling is beneficial for both perception and reasoning, as humans naturally leverage contextual relationships for road element recognition and their connectivity inference. To this end, we introduce relational modeling into both perception and reasoning, \textit{jointly} enhancing structural understanding. Specifically, we propose: 1) a relation-aware lane detector, where our geometry-biased self-attention and \curve\ cross-attention refine lane representations by capturing relational dependencies; 2) relation-enhanced topology heads, including a geometry-enhanced L2L head and a cross-view L2T head, boosting reasoning with relational cues; and 3) a contrastive learning strategy with InfoNCE loss to regularize relationship embeddings. Extensive experiments on OpenLane-V2 demonstrate that our approach significantly improves both detection and topology reasoning metrics, achieving +3.1 in DET$_l$, +5.3 in TOP$_{ll}$, +4.9 in TOP$_{lt}$, and an overall +4.4 in OLS, setting a new state-of-the-art. Code will be released.

  In recent years, the wide availability of high-resolution radar satellite images has enabled the remote monitoring of wetland surface areas. Machine learning models have achieved state-of-the-art results in segmenting wetlands from satellite images. However, these models require large amounts of manually annotated satellite images, which are slow and expensive to produce. The need for annotated training data makes it difficult to adapt these models to changes such as different climates or sensors. To address this issue, we employed self-supervised training methods to develop a model, AquaCluster, which segments radar satellite images into water and land areas without manual annotations. Our final model outperformed other radar-based water detection techniques that do not require annotated data in our test dataset, having achieved a 0.08 improvement in the Intersection over Union metric. Our results demonstrate that it is possible to train machine learning models to detect vegetated water from radar images without the use of annotated data, which can make the retraining of these models to account for changes much easier.

  With the increasing awareness of health and the growing desire for aesthetic physique, fitness has become a prevailing trend. However, the potential risks associated with fitness training, especially with weight-loaded fitness actions, cannot be overlooked. Action Quality Assessment (AQA), a technology that quantifies the quality of human action and provides feedback, holds the potential to assist fitness enthusiasts of varying skill levels in achieving better training outcomes. Nevertheless, current AQA methodologies and datasets are limited to single-view competitive sports scenarios and RGB modality and lack professional assessment and guidance of fitness actions. To address this gap, we propose the FLEX dataset, the first multi-modal, multi-action, large-scale dataset that incorporates surface electromyography (sEMG) signals into AQA. FLEX utilizes high-precision MoCap to collect 20 different weight-loaded actions performed by 38 subjects across 3 different skill levels for 10 repetitions each, containing 5 different views of the RGB video, 3D pose, sEMG, and physiological information. Additionally, FLEX incorporates knowledge graphs into AQA, constructing annotation rules in the form of penalty functions that map weight-loaded actions, action keysteps, error types, and feedback. We conducted various baseline methodologies on FLEX, demonstrating that multimodal data, multiview data, and fine-grained annotations significantly enhance model performance. FLEX not only advances AQA methodologies and datasets towards multi-modal and multi-action scenarios but also fosters the integration of artificial intelligence within the fitness domain.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Generative diffusion models learn probability densities over diverse image datasets by estimating the score with a neural network trained to remove noise. Despite their remarkable success in generating high-quality images, the internal mechanisms of the underlying score networks are not well understood. Here, we examine the image representation that arises from score estimation in a {fully-convolutional unconditional UNet}. We show that the middle block of the UNet decomposes individual images into sparse subsets of active channels, and that the vector of spatial averages of these channels can provide a nonlinear representation of the underlying clean images. Euclidean distances in this representation space are semantically meaningful, even though no conditioning information is provided during training. We develop a novel algorithm for stochastic reconstruction of images conditioned on this representation: The synthesis using the unconditional model is "self-guided" by the representation extracted from that very same model. For a given representation, the common patterns in the set of reconstructed samples reveal the features captured in the middle block of the UNet. Together, these results show, for the first time, that a measure of semantic similarity emerges, unsupervised, solely from the denoising objective.

  MLLMs have demonstrated significant visual understanding capabilities, yet their fine-grained visual perception in complex real-world scenarios, such as densely crowded public areas, remains limited. Inspired by the recent success of RL in both LLMs and MLLMs, in this paper, we explore how RL can enhance visual perception ability of MLLMs. Then we develop a novel RL-based framework, Deep Inspection and Perception with RL (DIP-R1) designed to enhance the visual perception capabilities of MLLMs, by comprehending complex scenes and looking through visual instances closely. DIP-R1 guides MLLMs through detailed inspection of visual scene via three simply designed rule-based reward modeling. First, we adopt a standard reasoning reward encouraging the model to include three-step reasoning process: 1) comprehending entire visual scene, 2) observing for looking through interested but ambiguous regions, and 3) decision-making for predicting answer. Second, a variance-guided looking reward is designed to encourage MLLM to examine uncertain regions during the observing process, guiding it to inspect ambiguous areas and mitigate perceptual uncertainty. This reward promotes variance-driven visual exploration, enabling MLLM to reason about region-level uncertainty and explicitly indicate interpretable uncertain regions. Third, we model a weighted precision-recall accuracy reward enhancing accurate decision-making. We verify its effectiveness across diverse fine-grained object detection data consisting of challenging real-world scenes, such as densely crowded scenes. Built upon existing MLLMs, DIP-R1 achieves consistent and significant improvement across various in-domain and out-of-domain scenarios, outperforming various existing baselines and SFT method. Our findings highlight the substantial potential of integrating RL into MLLMs for enhancing capabilities in complex real-world perception tasks.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Driving simulation plays a crucial role in developing reliable driving agents by providing controlled, evaluative environments. To enable meaningful assessments, a high-quality driving simulator must satisfy several key requirements: multi-modal sensing capabilities (e.g., camera and LiDAR) with realistic scene rendering to minimize observational discrepancies; closed-loop evaluation to support free-form trajectory behaviors; highly diverse traffic scenarios for thorough evaluation; multi-agent cooperation to capture interaction dynamics; and high computational efficiency to ensure affordability and scalability. However, existing simulators and benchmarks fail to comprehensively meet these fundamental criteria. To bridge this gap, this paper introduces RealEngine, a novel driving simulation framework that holistically integrates 3D scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis techniques to achieve realistic and flexible closed-loop simulation in the driving context. By leveraging real-world multi-modal sensor data, RealEngine reconstructs background scenes and foreground traffic participants separately, allowing for highly diverse and realistic traffic scenarios through flexible scene composition. This synergistic fusion of scene reconstruction and view synthesis enables photorealistic rendering across multiple sensor modalities, ensuring both perceptual fidelity and geometric accuracy. Building upon this environment, RealEngine supports three essential driving simulation categories: non-reactive simulation, safety testing, and multi-agent interaction, collectively forming a reliable and comprehensive benchmark for evaluating the real-world performance of driving agents.

  The rapid spread of multimodal misinformation on social media has raised growing concerns, while research on video misinformation detection remains limited due to the lack of large-scale, diverse datasets. Existing methods often overfit to rigid templates and lack deep reasoning over deceptive content. To address these challenges, we introduce FakeVV, a large-scale benchmark comprising over 100,000 video-text pairs with fine-grained, interpretable annotations. In addition, we further propose Fact-R1, a novel framework that integrates deep reasoning with collaborative rule-based reinforcement learning. Fact-R1 is trained through a three-stage process: (1) misinformation long-Chain-of-Thought (CoT) instruction tuning, (2) preference alignment via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), and (3) Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) using a novel verifiable reward function. This enables Fact-R1 to exhibit emergent reasoning behaviors comparable to those observed in advanced text-based reinforcement learning systems, but in the more complex multimodal misinformation setting. Our work establishes a new paradigm for misinformation detection, bridging large-scale video understanding, reasoning-guided alignment, and interpretable verification.

  Video quality assessment (VQA) seeks to predict the perceptual quality of a video in alignment with human visual perception, serving as a fundamental tool for quantifying quality degradation across video processing workflows. The dominant VQA paradigm relies on supervised training with human-labeled datasets, which, despite substantial progress, still suffers from poor generalization to unseen video content. Moreover, its reliance on human annotations -- which are labor-intensive and costly -- makes it difficult to scale datasets for improving model generalization. In this work, we explore weak-to-strong (W2S) learning as a new paradigm for advancing VQA without reliance on large-scale human-labeled datasets. We first provide empirical evidence that a straightforward W2S strategy allows a strong student model to not only match its weak teacher on in-domain benchmarks but also surpass it on out-of-distribution (OOD) benchmarks, revealing a distinct weak-to-strong effect in VQA. Building on this insight, we propose a novel framework that enhances W2S learning from two aspects: (1) integrating homogeneous and heterogeneous supervision signals from diverse VQA teachers -- including off-the-shelf VQA models and synthetic distortion simulators -- via a learn-to-rank formulation, and (2) iterative W2S training, where each strong student is recycled as the teacher in subsequent cycles, progressively focusing on challenging cases. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art results across both in-domain and OOD benchmarks, with especially strong gains in OOD scenarios. Our findings highlight W2S learning as a principled route to break annotation barriers and achieve scalable generalization in VQA, with implications extending to broader alignment and evaluation tasks.

  With the exacerbation of the biodiversity and climate crises, macroecological pursuits such as global biodiversity mapping become more urgent. Remote sensing offers a wealth of Earth observation data for ecological studies, but the scarcity of labeled datasets remains a major challenge. Recently, self-supervised learning has enabled learning representations from unlabeled data, triggering the development of pretrained geospatial models with generalizable features. However, these models are often trained on datasets biased toward areas of high human activity, leaving entire ecological regions underrepresented. Additionally, while some datasets attempt to address seasonality through multi-date imagery, they typically follow calendar seasons rather than local phenological cycles. To better capture vegetation seasonality at a global scale, we propose a simple phenology-informed sampling strategy and introduce corresponding SSL4Eco, a multi-date Sentinel-2 dataset, on which we train an existing model with a season-contrastive objective. We compare representations learned from SSL4Eco against other datasets on diverse ecological downstream tasks and demonstrate that our straightforward sampling method consistently improves representation quality, highlighting the importance of dataset construction. The model pretrained on SSL4Eco reaches state of the art performance on 7 out of 8 downstream tasks spanning (multi-label) classification and regression. We release our code, data, and model weights to support macroecological and computer vision research atthis https URL.

  Recent studies have explored the use of large language models (LLMs) in psychotherapy; however, text-based cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) models often struggle with client resistance, which can weaken therapeutic alliance. To address this, we propose a multimodal approach that incorporates nonverbal cues, which allows the AI therapist to better align its responses with the client's negative emotional state. Specifically, we introduce a new synthetic dataset, Mirror (Multimodal Interactive Rolling with Resistance), which is a novel synthetic dataset that pairs each client's statements with corresponding facial images. Using this dataset, we train baseline vision language models (VLMs) so that they can analyze facial cues, infer emotions, and generate empathetic responses to effectively manage client resistance. These models are then evaluated in terms of both their counseling skills as a therapist, and the strength of therapeutic alliance in the presence of client resistance. Our results demonstrate that Mirror significantly enhances the AI therapist's ability to handle resistance, which outperforms existing text-based CBT approaches. Human expert evaluations further confirm the effectiveness of our approach in managing client resistance and fostering therapeutic alliance.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present a neural network structure, FramePack, to train next-frame (or next-frame-section) prediction models for video generation. FramePack compresses input frame contexts with frame-wise importance so that more frames can be encoded within a fixed context length, with more important frames having longer contexts. The frame importance can be measured using time proximity, feature similarity, or hybrid metrics. The packing method allows for inference with thousands of frames and training with relatively large batch sizes. We also present drift prevention methods to address observation bias (error accumulation), including early-established endpoints, adjusted sampling orders, and discrete history representation. Ablation studies validate the effectiveness of the anti-drifting methods in both single-directional video streaming and bi-directional video generation. Finally, we show that existing video diffusion models can be finetuned with FramePack, and analyze the differences between different packing schedules.

  Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) is crucial for document digitization, but handwritten data can contain user-identifiable features, like unique writing styles, posing privacy risks. Regulations such as the ``right to be forgotten'' require models to remove these sensitive traces without full retraining. We introduce a practical encoder-only transformer baseline as a robust reference for future HTR research. Building on this, we propose a two-stage unlearning framework for multihead transformer HTR models. Our method combines neural pruning with machine unlearning applied to a writer classification head, ensuring sensitive information is removed while preserving the recognition head. We also present Writer-ID Confusion (WIC), a method that forces the forget set to follow a uniform distribution over writer identities, unlearning user-specific cues while maintaining text recognition performance. We compare WIC to Random Labeling, Fisher Forgetting, Amnesiac Unlearning, and DELETE within our prune-unlearn pipeline and consistently achieve better privacy and accuracy trade-offs. This is the first systematic study of machine unlearning for HTR. Using metrics such as Accuracy, Character Error Rate (CER), Word Error Rate (WER), and Membership Inference Attacks (MIA) on the IAM and CVL datasets, we demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art or superior performance for effective unlearning. These experiments show that our approach effectively safeguards privacy without compromising accuracy, opening new directions for document analysis research.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in Vision Transformers (ViTs) have significantly advanced semantic segmentation performance. However, their adaptation to new target domains remains challenged by distribution shifts, which often disrupt global attention mechanisms. While existing global and patch-level adaptation methods offer some improvements, they overlook the spatially varying transferability inherent in different image regions. To address this, we propose the Transferable Mask Transformer (TMT), a region-adaptive framework designed to enhance cross-domain representation learning through transferability guidance. First, we dynamically partition the image into coherent regions, grouped by structural and semantic similarity, and estimates their domain transferability at a localized level. Then, we incorporate region-level transferability maps directly into the self-attention mechanism of ViTs, allowing the model to adaptively focus attention on areas with lower transferability and higher semantic uncertainty. Extensive experiments across 20 diverse cross-domain settings demonstrate that TMT not only mitigates the performance degradation typically associated with domain shift but also consistently outperforms existing approaches.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Unsupervised anomaly detection and segmentation methods train a model to learn the training distribution as `normal'. In the testing phase, they identify patterns that deviate from this normal distribution as `anomalies'. To learn the `normal' distribution, prevailing methodscorrupt the images and train a model to reconstruct them. During testing, the model attempts to reconstruct corrupted inputs based on the learned `normal' distribution. Deviations from this distribution lead to high reconstruction errors, which indicate potential anomalies. However, corrupting an input image inevitably causes information loss even in normal regions, leading to suboptimal reconstruction and an increased risk of false positives. To alleviate this, we propose $\rm{IterMask3D}$, an iterative spatial mask-refining strategy designed for 3D brain MRI. We iteratively spatially mask areas of the image as corruption and reconstruct them, then shrink the mask based on reconstruction error. This process iteratively unmasks `normal' areas to the model, whose information further guides reconstruction of `normal' patterns under the mask to be reconstructed accurately, reducing false positives. In addition, to achieve better reconstruction performance, we also propose using high-frequency image content as additional structural information to guide the reconstruction of the masked area. Extensive experiments on the detection of both synthetic and real-world imaging artifacts, as well as segmentation of various pathological lesions across multiple MRI sequences, consistently demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.

  The effectiveness of autonomous vehicles relies on reliable perception capabilities. Despite significant advancements in artificial intelligence and sensor fusion technologies, current single-vehicle perception systems continue to encounter limitations, notably visual occlusions and limited long-range detection capabilities. Collaborative Perception (CP), enabled by Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) and Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) communication, has emerged as a promising solution to mitigate these issues and enhance the reliability of autonomous systems. Beyond advancements in communication, the computer vision community is increasingly focusing on improving vehicular perception through collaborative approaches. However, a systematic literature review that thoroughly examines existing work and reduces subjective bias is still lacking. Such a systematic approach helps identify research gaps, recognize common trends across studies, and inform future research directions. In response, this study follows the PRISMA 2020 guidelines and includes 106 peer-reviewed articles. These publications are analyzed based on modalities, collaboration schemes, and key perception tasks. Through a comparative analysis, this review illustrates how different methods address practical issues such as pose errors, temporal latency, communication constraints, domain shifts, heterogeneity, and adversarial attacks. Furthermore, it critically examines evaluation methodologies, highlighting a misalignment between current metrics and CP's fundamental objectives. By delving into all relevant topics in-depth, this review offers valuable insights into challenges, opportunities, and risks, serving as a reference for advancing research in vehicular collaborative perception.

  _Chau Pham, Juan C. Caicedo, Bryan A. Plummer_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Prior work using Masked Autoencoders (MAEs) typically relies on random patch masking based on the assumption that images have significant redundancies across different channels, allowing for the reconstruction of masked content using cross-channel correlations. However, this assumption does not hold in Multi-Channel Imaging (MCI), where channels may provide complementary information with minimal feature overlap. Thus, these MAEs primarily learn local structures within individual channels from patch reconstruction, failing to fully leverage cross-channel interactions and limiting their MCI effectiveness. In this paper, we present ChA-MAEViT, an MAE-based method that enhances feature learning across MCI channels via four key strategies: (1) dynamic channel-patch masking, which compels the model to reconstruct missing channels in addition to masked patches, thereby enhancing cross-channel dependencies and improving robustness to varying channel configurations; (2) memory tokens, which serve as long-term memory aids to promote information sharing across channels, addressing the challenges of reconstructing structurally diverse channels; (3) hybrid token fusion module, which merges fine-grained patch tokens with a global class token to capture richer representations; and (4) Channel-Aware Decoder, a lightweight decoder utilizes channel tokens to effectively reconstruct image patches. Experiments on satellite and microscopy datasets, CHAMMI, JUMP-CP, and So2Sat, show that ChA-MAEViT significantly outperforms state-of-the-art MCI-ViTs by 3.0-21.5%, highlighting the importance of cross-channel interactions in MCI.

  Visual instruction tuning adapts pre-trained Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to follow human instructions for real-world applications. However, the rapid growth of these datasets introduces significant redundancy, leading to increased computational costs. Existing methods for selecting instruction data aim to prune this redundancy, but predominantly rely on computationally demanding techniques such as proxy-based inference or training-based metrics. Consequently, the substantial computational costs incurred by these selection processes often exacerbate the very efficiency bottlenecks they are intended to resolve, posing a significant challenge to the scalable and effective tuning of MLLMs. To address this challenge, we first identify a critical, yet previously overlooked, factor: the anisotropy inherent in visual feature distributions. We find that this anisotropy induces a \textit{Global Semantic Drift}, and overlooking this phenomenon is a key factor limiting the efficiency of current data selection methods. Motivated by this insight, we devise \textbf{PRISM}, the first training-free framework for efficient visual instruction selection. PRISM surgically removes the corrupting influence of global background features by modeling the intrinsic visual semantics via implicit re-centering. Empirically, PRISM reduces the end-to-end time for data selection and model tuning to just 30\% of conventional pipelines. More remarkably, it achieves this efficiency while simultaneously enhancing performance, surpassing models fine-tuned on the full dataset across eight multimodal and three language understanding benchmarks, culminating in a 101.7\% relative improvement over the baseline.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Knowledge distillation (KD) involves transferring knowledge from a pre-trained heavy teacher model to a lighter student model, thereby reducing the inference cost while maintaining comparable effectiveness. Prior KD techniques typically assume homogeneity between the teacher and student models. However, as technology advances, a wide variety of architectures have emerged, ranging from initial Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to Vision Transformers (ViTs), and Multi-Level Perceptrons (MLPs). Consequently, developing a universal KD framework compatible with any architecture has become an important research topic. In this paper, we introduce a perspective-aware teaching (PAT) KD framework to enable feature distillation across diverse architectures. Our framework comprises two key components. First, we design prompt tuning blocks that incorporate student feedback, allowing teacher features to adapt to the student model's learning process. Second, we propose region-aware attention to mitigate the view mismatch problem between heterogeneous architectures. By leveraging these two modules, effective distillation of intermediate features can be achieved across heterogeneous architectures. Extensive experiments on CIFAR, ImageNet, and COCO demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method. Our code is available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In recent years, significant progress has been made in collecting large-scale datasets to improve segmentation and autonomous driving models. These large-scale datasets are often dominated by common environmental conditions such as "Clear and Day" weather, leading to decreased performance in under-represented conditions like "Rainy and Night". To address this issue, we introduce SynDiff-AD, a novel data augmentation pipeline that leverages diffusion models (DMs) to generate realistic images for such subgroups. SynDiff-AD uses ControlNet-a DM that guides data generation conditioned on semantic maps-along with a novel prompting scheme that generates subgroup-specific, semantically dense prompts. By augmenting datasets with SynDiff-AD, we improve the performance of segmentation models like Mask2Former and SegFormer by up to 1.2% and 2.3% on the Waymo dataset, and up to 1.4% and 0.7% on the DeepDrive dataset, respectively. Additionally, we demonstrate that our SynDiff-AD pipeline enhances the driving performance of end-to-end autonomous driving models, like AIM-2D and AIM-BEV, by up to 20% across diverse environmental conditions in the CARLA autonomous driving simulator, providing a more robust model. We release our code and pipeline atthis https URL.

  Unsupervised domain adaptation remains a critical challenge in enabling the knowledge transfer of models across unseen domains. Existing methods struggle to balance the need for domain-invariant representations with preserving domain-specific features, which is often due to alignment approaches that impose the projection of samples with similar semantics close in the latent space despite their drastic domain differences. We introduce a novel approach that shifts the focus from aligning representations in absolute coordinates to aligning the relative positioning of equivalent concepts in latent spaces. Our method defines a domain-agnostic structure upon the semantic/geometric relationships between class labels in language space and guides adaptation, ensuring that the organization of samples in visual space reflects reference inter-class relationships while preserving domain-specific characteristics. We empirically demonstrate our method's superiority in domain adaptation tasks across four diverse image and video datasets. Remarkably, we surpass previous works in 18 different adaptation scenarios across four diverse image and video datasets with average accuracy improvements of +3.32% on DomainNet, +5.75% in GeoPlaces, +4.77% on GeoImnet, and +1.94% mean class accuracy improvement on EgoExo4D.

  In light of the dynamic nature of autonomous driving environments and stringent safety requirements, general MLLMs combined with CLIP alone often struggle to accurately represent driving-specific scenarios, particularly in complex interactions and long-tail cases. To address this, we propose the Hints of Prompt (HoP) framework, which introduces three key enhancements: Affinity hint to emphasize instance-level structure by strengthening token-wise connections, Semantic hint to incorporate high-level information relevant to driving-specific cases, such as complex interactions among vehicles and traffic signs, and Question hint to align visual features with the query context, focusing on question-relevant regions. These hints are fused through a Hint Fusion module, enriching visual representations by capturing driving-related representations with limited domain data, ensuring faster adaptation to driving scenarios. Extensive experiments confirm the effectiveness of the HoP framework, showing that it significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in all key metrics.

  Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have witnessed significant progress on visual understanding tasks. However, they often prioritize language knowledge over image information on visual reasoning tasks, incurring performance degradation. To tackle this issue, we first identify the drawbacks of existing solutions (i.e., limited multi-modal reasoning capacities, and insufficient and irrelevant visual descriptions). We then decompose visual reasoning process into two stages: proactive visual perception (i.e., eyesight) and textual reasoning (i.e., wisdom), and introduce a novel visual reasoning framework named ProReason. This framework features decoupled vision-reasoning capabilities and multi-run proactive perception. Briefly, given a multi-modal question, ProReason iterates proactive information collection and reasoning until the answer can be concluded with necessary and sufficient visual descriptions. Notably, the disassociation of capabilities allows seamless integration of existing large language models (LLMs) to compensate for the reasoning deficits of LVLMs. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that ProReason outperforms existing multi-step reasoning frameworks on various benchmarks for both open-source and closed-source models, with the average performance gain reaching 13.2%. Besides, the integration of LLMs allows ProReason to produce high-quality visual reasoning data, which empowers ProReason-distilled models (i.e., ProReason-VL and ProReason-Q3) to achieve superior performance in downstream tasks. Our insights into existing solutions and the decoupled perspective for feasible integration of LLMs illuminate future research on visual reasoning techniques, especially LLM-assisted ones.

  The automatic assembly problem has attracted increasing interest due to its complex challenges that involve 3D representation. This paper introduces Jigsaw++, a novel generative method designed to tackle the multifaceted challenges of reconstructing complete shape for the reassembly problem. Existing approach focusing primarily on piecewise information for both part and fracture assembly, often overlooking the integration of complete object prior. Jigsaw++ distinguishes itself by learning a shape prior of complete objects. It employs the proposed "retargeting" strategy that effectively leverages the output of any existing assembly method to generate complete shape reconstructions. This capability allows it to function orthogonally to the current methods. Through extensive evaluations on Breaking Bad dataset and PartNet, Jigsaw++ has demonstrated its effectiveness, reducing reconstruction errors and enhancing the precision of shape reconstruction, which sets a new direction for future reassembly model developments.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Zero-shot classification capabilities naturally arise in models trained within a vision-language contrastive framework. Despite their classification prowess, these models struggle in dense tasks like zero-shot open-vocabulary segmentation. This deficiency is often attributed to the absence of localization cues in captions and the intertwined nature of the learning process, which encompasses both image representation learning and cross-modality alignment. To tackle these issues, we propose SimZSS, a Simple framework for open-vocabulary Zero-Shot Segmentation. The method is founded on two key principles: i) leveraging frozen vision-only models that exhibit spatial awareness while exclusively aligning the text encoder and ii) exploiting the discrete nature of text and linguistic knowledge to pinpoint local concepts within captions. By capitalizing on the quality of the visual representations, our method requires only image-caption pairs datasets and adapts to both small curated and large-scale noisy datasets. When trained on COCO Captions across 8 GPUs, SimZSS achieves state-of-the-art results on 7 out of 8 benchmark datasets in less than 15 minutes.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The Privacy-sensitive Object Identification (POI) task allocates bounding boxes for privacy-sensitive objects in a scene. The key to POI is settling an object's privacy class (privacy-sensitive or non-privacy-sensitive). In contrast to conventional object classes which are determined by the visual appearance of an object, one object's privacy class is derived from the scene contexts and is subject to various implicit factors beyond its visual appearance. That is, visually similar objects may be totally opposite in their privacy classes. To explicitly derive the objects' privacy class from the scene contexts, in this paper, we interpret the POI task as a visual reasoning task aimed at the privacy of each object in the scene. Following this interpretation, we propose the PrivacyGuard framework for POI. PrivacyGuard contains three stages. i) Structuring: an unstructured image is first converted into a structured, heterogeneous scene graph that embeds rich scene contexts. ii) Data Augmentation: a contextual perturbation oversampling strategy is proposed to create slightly perturbed privacy-sensitive objects in a scene graph, thereby balancing the skewed distribution of privacy classes. iii) Hybrid Graph Generation & Reasoning: the balanced, heterogeneous scene graph is then transformed into a hybrid graph by endowing it with extra "node-node" and "edge-edge" homogeneous paths. These homogeneous paths allow direct message passing between nodes or edges, thereby accelerating reasoning and facilitating the capturing of subtle context changes. Based on this hybrid graph... **For the full abstract, see the original paper.**

  With the rise of social platforms, protecting privacy has become an important issue. Privacy object detection aims to accurately locate private objects in images. It is the foundation of safeguarding individuals' privacy rights and ensuring responsible data handling practices in the digital age. Since privacy of object is not shift-invariant, the essence of the privacy object detection task is inferring object privacy based on scene information. However, privacy object detection has long been studied as a subproblem of common object detection tasks. Therefore, existing methods suffer from serious deficiencies in accuracy, generalization, and interpretability. Moreover, creating large-scale privacy datasets is difficult due to legal constraints and existing privacy datasets lack label granularity. The granularity of existing privacy detection methods remains limited to the image level. To address the above two issues, we introduce two benchmark datasets for object-level privacy detection and propose SHAN, Scene Heterogeneous graph Attention Network, a model constructs a scene heterogeneous graph from an image and utilizes self-attention mechanisms for scene inference to obtain object privacy. Through experiments, we demonstrated that SHAN performs excellently in privacy object detection tasks, with all metrics surpassing those of the baseline model.

  _Xuanyu Yi, Kaihua Tang, Xian-Sheng Hua, Joo-Hwee Lim, Hanwang Zhang_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Conventional de-noising methods rely on the assumption that all samples are independent and identically distributed, so the resultant classifier, though disturbed by noise, can still easily identify the noises as the outliers of training distribution. However, the assumption is unrealistic in large-scale data that is inevitably long-tailed. Such imbalanced training data makes a classifier less discriminative for the tail classes, whose previously "easy" noises are now turned into "hard" ones -- they are almost as outliers as the clean tail samples. We introduce this new challenge as Noisy Long-Tailed Classification (NLT). Not surprisingly, we find that most de-noising methods fail to identify the hard noises, resulting in significant performance drop on the three proposed NLT benchmarks: ImageNet-NLT, Animal10-NLT, and Food101-NLT. To this end, we design an iterative noisy learning framework called Hard-to-Easy (H2E). Our bootstrapping philosophy is to first learn a classifier as noise identifier invariant to the class and context distributional changes, reducing "hard" noises to "easy" ones, whose removal further improves the invariance. Experimental results show that our H2E outperforms state-of-the-art de-noising methods and their ablations on long-tailed settings while maintaining a stable performance on the conventional balanced settings.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reinforcement learning (RL) for the Markov Decision Process (MDP) has emerged in many security-related applications, such as autonomous driving, financial decisions, and drone/robot algorithms. In order to improve the robustness/defense of RL systems against adversaries, studying various adversarial attacks on RL systems is very important. Most previous work considered deterministic adversarial attack strategies in MDP, which the recipient (victim) agent can defeat by reversing the deterministic attacks. In this paper, we propose a provably ``invincible'' or ``uncounterable'' type of adversarial attack on RL. The attackers apply a rate-distortion information-theoretic approach to randomly change agents' observations of the transition kernel (or other properties) so that the agent gains zero or very limited information about the ground-truth kernel (or other properties) during the training. We derive an information-theoretic lower bound on the recipient agent's reward regret and show the impact of rate-distortion attacks on state-of-the-art model-based and model-free algorithms. We also extend this notion of an information-theoretic approach to other types of adversarial attack, such as state observation attacks.

  Reinforcement learning (RL) has become central to training large language models (LLMs), yet the field lacks predictive scaling methodologies comparable to those established for pre-training. Despite rapidly rising compute budgets, there is no principled understanding of how to evaluate algorithmic improvements for scaling RL compute. We present the first large-scale systematic study, amounting to more than 400,000 GPU-hours, that defines a principled framework for analyzing and predicting RL scaling in LLMs. We fit sigmoidal compute-performance curves for RL training and ablate a wide range of common design choices to analyze their effects on asymptotic performance and compute efficiency. We observe: (1) Not all recipes yield similar asymptotic performance, (2) Details such as loss aggregation, normalization, curriculum, and off-policy algorithm primarily modulate compute efficiency without materially shifting the asymptote, and (3) Stable, scalable recipes follow predictable scaling trajectories, enabling extrapolation from smaller-scale runs. Combining these insights, we propose a best-practice recipe, ScaleRL, and demonstrate its effectiveness by successfully scaling and predicting validation performance on a single RL run scaled up to 100,000 GPU-hours. Our work provides both a scientific framework for analyzing scaling in RL and a practical recipe that brings RL training closer to the predictability long achieved in pre-training.

  Forecasting urban phenomena such as housing prices and public health indicators requires the effective integration of various geospatial data. Current methods primarily utilize task-specific models, while recent foundation models for spatial representations often support only limited modalities and lack multimodal fusion capabilities. To overcome these challenges, we present UrbanFusion, a Geo-Foundation Model (GeoFM) that features Stochastic Multimodal Fusion (SMF). The framework employs modality-specific encoders to process different types of inputs, including street view imagery, remote sensing data, cartographic maps, and points of interest (POIs) data. These multimodal inputs are integrated via a Transformer-based fusion module that learns unified representations. An extensive evaluation across 41 tasks in 56 cities worldwide demonstrates UrbanFusion's strong generalization and predictive performance compared to state-of-the-art GeoAI models. Specifically, it 1) outperforms prior foundation models on location-encoding, 2) allows multimodal input during inference, and 3) generalizes well to regions unseen during training. UrbanFusion can flexibly utilize any subset of available modalities for a given location during both pretraining and inference, enabling broad applicability across diverse data availability scenarios.

  Machine learning solvers for partial differential equations (PDEs) have attracted growing interest. However, most existing approaches, such as neural network solvers, rely on stochastic training, which is inefficient and typically requires a great many training epochs. Gaussian process (GP)/kernel-based solvers, while mathematical principled, suffer from scalability issues when handling large numbers of collocation points often needed for challenging or higher-dimensional PDEs.To overcome these limitations, we propose TGPS, a tensor-GP-based solver that models factor functions along each input dimension using one-dimensional GPs and combines them via tensor decomposition to approximate the full solution. This design reduces the task to learning a collection of one-dimensional GPs, substantially lowering computational complexity, and enabling scalability to massive collocation sets.For efficient nonlinear PDE solving, we use a partial freezing strategy and Newton's method to linerize the nonlinear terms. We then develop an alternating least squares (ALS) approach that admits closed-form updates, thereby substantially enhancing the training efficiency. We establish theoretical guarantees on the expressivity of our model, together with convergence proof and error analysis under standard regularity assumptions. Experiments on several benchmark PDEs demonstrate that our method achieves superior accuracy and efficiency compared to existing approaches.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Highly accurate datasets from numerical or physical experiments are often expensive and time-consuming to acquire, posing a significant challenge for applications that require precise evaluations, potentially across multiple scenarios and in real-time. Even building sufficiently accurate surrogate models can be extremely challenging with limited high-fidelity data. Conversely, less expensive, low-fidelity data can be computed more easily and encompass a broader range of scenarios. By leveraging multi-fidelity information, prediction capabilities of surrogates can be improved. However, in practical situations, data may be different in types, come from sources of different modalities, and not be concurrently available, further complicating the modeling process. To address these challenges, we introduce a progressive multi-fidelity surrogate model. This model can sequentially incorporate diverse data types using tailored encoders. Multi-fidelity regression from the encoded inputs to the target quantities of interest is then performed using neural networks. Input information progressively flows from lower to higher fidelity levels through two sets of connections: concatenations among all the encoded inputs, and additive connections among the final outputs. This dual connection system enables the model to exploit correlations among different datasets while ensuring that each level makes an additive correction to the previous level without altering it. This approach prevents performance degradation as new input data are integrated into the model and automatically adapts predictions based on the available inputs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach on numerical benchmarks and a real-world case study, showing that it reliably integrates multi-modal data and provides accurate predictions, maintaining performance when generalizing across time and parameter variations.

  Kilometer-scale weather data is crucial for real-world applications but remains computationally intensive to produce using traditional weather simulations. An emerging solution is to use deep learning models, which offer a faster alternative for climate downscaling. However, their reliability is still in question, as they are often evaluated using standard machine learning metrics rather than insights from atmospheric and weather physics. This paper benchmarks recent state-of-the-art deep learning models and introduces physics-inspired diagnostics to evaluate their performance and reliability, with a particular focus on geographic generalization and physical consistency. Our experiments show that, despite the seemingly strong performance of models such as CorrDiff, when trained on a limited set of European geographies (e.g., central Europe), they struggle to generalize to other regions such as Iberia, Morocco in the south, or Scandinavia in the north. They also fail to accurately capture second-order variables such as divergence and vorticity derived from predicted velocity fields. These deficiencies appear even in in-distribution geographies, indicating challenges in producing physically consistent predictions. We propose a simple initial solution: introducing a power spectral density loss function that empirically improves geographic generalization by encouraging the reconstruction of small-scale physical structures.

  Recent works have proposed accelerating the wall-clock training time of actor-critic methods via the use of large-scale environment parallelization; unfortunately, these can sometimes still require large number of environment interactions to achieve a desired level of performance. Noting that well-structured representations can improve the generalization and sample efficiency of deep reinforcement learning (RL) agents, we propose the use of simplicial embeddings: lightweight representation layers that constrain embeddings to simplicial structures. This geometric inductive bias results in sparse and discrete features that stabilize critic bootstrapping and strengthen policy gradients. When applied to FastTD3, FastSAC, and PPO, simplicial embeddings consistently improve sample efficiency and final performance across a variety of continuous- and discrete-control environments, without any loss in runtime speed.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Despite the success of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) in aligning language models with human values, reward hacking-or reward over-optimization-remains a major challenge. We identify two key obstacles to its mitigation: (1) reward misgeneralization in reward modeling, where reward models overfit to spurious, preference-irrelevant features; and (2) the lack of suitable regularization during RL optimization, as existing token-level constraints often over-restrict the policy space. To address these issues, we propose InfoRM, an information-theoretic reward modeling framework based on the Information Bottleneck (IB) principle, which filters out preference-irrelevant information to alleviate reward misgeneralization. We further observe that reward-hacked responses manifest as pronounced outliers in InfoRM's IB latent space, measured by Mahalanobis distance from the SFT-induced distribution. Motivated by this, we introduce IBL, a distribution-level regularization that penalizes such deviations, effectively expanding the optimization landscape while maintaining alignment. We prove that IBL is theoretically equivalent to the pessimistic RL objective within the IB latent space. Finally, we present Mahalanobis Outlier Probability (MOP), a statistical metric for quantifying reward hacking severity, enabling principled hyperparameter tuning and online mitigation such as early stopping. Extensive experiments across diverse LLMs and datasets confirm the generality of our findings, the effectiveness of InfoRM and IBL, and the reliability of MOP as a diagnostic tool-collectively advancing the state of RLHF.

  Diagonal preconditioners are computationally feasible approximate to second-order optimizers, which have shown significant promise in accelerating training of deep learning models. Two predominant approaches are based on Adam and Gauss-Newton (GN) methods: the former leverages statistics of current gradients and is the de-factor optimizers for neural networks, and the latter uses the diagonal elements of the Gauss-Newton matrix and underpins some of the recent diagonal optimizers such as Sophia.In this work, we compare these two diagonal preconditioning methods through the lens of two key factors: the choice of basis in the preconditioner, and the impact of gradient noise from mini-batching. To gain insights, we analyze these optimizers on quadratic objectives and logistic regression under all four quadrants. We show that regardless of the basis, there exist instances where Adam outperforms both GN$^{-1}$ and GN$^{-1/2}$ in full-batch settings. Conversely, in the stochastic regime, Adam behaves similarly to GN$^{-1/2}$ for linear regression under a Gaussian data assumption. These theoretical results are supported by empirical studies on both convex and non-convex objectives.

  The advent of foundation models in AI has significantly advanced general-purpose learning, enabling remarkable capabilities in zero-shot inference and in-context learning. However, training such models on physics data, including solutions to partial differential equations (PDEs), poses a unique challenge due to varying dimensionalities across different systems. Traditional approaches either fix a maximum dimension or employ separate encoders for different dimensionalities, resulting in inefficiencies. To address this, we propose a dimension-agnostic neural network architecture, the Axial Neural Network (XNN), inspired by parameter-sharing structures such as Deep Sets and Graph Neural Networks. XNN generalizes across varying tensor dimensions while maintaining computational efficiency. We convert existing PDE foundation models into axial neural networks and evaluate their performance across three training scenarios: training from scratch, pretraining on multiple PDEs, and fine-tuning on a single PDE. Our experiments show that XNNs perform competitively with original models and exhibit superior generalization to unseen dimensions, highlighting the importance of multidimensional pretraining for foundation models.

  _Priyobrata Mondal, Faizanuddin Ansari, Swagatam Das_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The class imbalance problem refers to the insufficiency of data in certain classes, which causes a classifier to be biased toward the majority class. Distribution calibration is a technique that seeks to estimate a more accurate class distribution based on an observed or estimated one. To address this issue, we propose a distribution calibration-based method-Rebalancing with Calibrated Sub-classes (RCS): An Enhanced Approach for Robust Imbalanced Classification, which estimates the distribution parameters of the minority classes using weighted parameters derived from a mixture of Gaussian components from both the majority and intermediate classes. An encoder-decoder network is trained to preserve the structure of the imbalanced data and prevent disentanglement. After training, feature vectors extracted from the encoder are used to generate synthetic samples through our distribution calibration strategy. This approach effectively mitigates the overgeneralization problem that arises when only the distribution of the majority class is used to approximate the minority class statistics. Instead, our method calibrates the parameters by leveraging the distribution of data points in neighboring regions. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior classification performance compared to several baseline and state-of-the-art techniques across a diverse range of image, text, and tabular datasets.

  Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) represent a new paradigm for time series forecasting, offering zero-shot forecasting capabilities without the need for domain-specific pre-training or fine-tuning. However, as with Large Language Models (LLMs), evaluating TSFMs is tricky, as with ever more extensive training sets, it becomes more and more challenging to ensure the integrity of benchmarking data. Our investigation of existing TSFM evaluation highlights multiple challenges, ranging from the representativeness of the benchmark datasets, over the lack of spatiotemporal evaluation, to risks of information leakage due to overlapping and obscure datasets, and the memorization of global patterns caused by external shocks like economic crises or pandemics. Our findings reveal widespread confusion regarding data partitions, risking inflated performance estimates and incorrect transfer of global knowledge to local time series. We argue for the development of robust evaluation methodologies to prevent pitfalls already observed in LLM and classical time series benchmarking, and call upon the research community to design new, principled approaches, such as evaluations on truly out-of-sample future data, to safeguard the integrity of TSFM assessment.

  _Riddhish Thakare, Kingdom Mutala Akugri_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Classical nonlinear dimensionality reduction (NLDR) techniques like t-SNE, Isomap, and LLE excel at creating low-dimensional embeddings for data visualization but fundamentally lack the ability to map these embeddings back to the original high-dimensional space. This one-way transformation limits their use in generative applications. This paper addresses this critical gap by introducing a system- atic framework for constructing neural decoder architectures for prominent NLDR methods, enabling bidirectional mapping for the first time. We extend this framework by implementing a diffusion-based generative process that operates directly within these learned manifold spaces. Through experiments on the CelebA dataset, we evaluate the reconstruction and generative performance of our approach against autoencoder and standard diffusion model baselines. Our findings reveal a fundamental trade- off: while the decoders successfully reconstruct data, their quality is surpassed by end-to-end optimized autoencoders. Moreover, manifold-constrained diffusion yields poor-quality samples, suggesting that the discrete and sparse nature of classical NLDR embeddings is ill-suited for the continuous inter- polation required by generative models. This work highlights the inherent challenges in retrofitting generative capabilities onto NLDR methods designed primarily for visualization and analysis.

  Nowdays, there are an abundance of portable devices capable of collecting large amounts of data and with decent computational power. This opened the possibility to train AI models in a distributed manner, preserving the participating clients' privacy. However, because of privacy regulations and safety requirements, elimination upon necessity of a client contribution to the model has become mandatory. The cleansing process must satisfy specific efficacy and time requirements. In recent years, research efforts have produced several knowledge removal methods, but these require multiple communication rounds between the data holders and the process coordinator. This can cause the unavailability of an effective model up to the end of the removal process, which can result in a disservice to the system users. In this paper, we introduce an innovative solution based on Task Arithmetic and the Neural Tangent Kernel, to rapidly remove a client's influence from a model.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in sensing and imaging technologies have enabled the collection of high-dimensional spatiotemporal data across complex geometric domains. However, effective modeling of such data remains challenging due to irregular spatial structures, rapid temporal dynamics, and the need to jointly predict multiple interrelated physical variables. This paper presents a physics-augmented multi-task Gaussian Process (P-M-GP) framework tailored for spatiotemporal dynamic systems. Specifically, we develop a geometry-aware, multi-task Gaussian Process (M-GP) model to effectively capture intrinsic spatiotemporal structure and inter-task dependencies. To further enhance the model fidelity and robustness, we incorporate governing physical laws through a physics-based regularization scheme, thereby constraining predictions to be consistent with governing dynamical principles. We validate the proposed P-M-GP framework on a 3D cardiac electrodynamics modeling task. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our method significantly improves prediction accuracy over existing methods by effectively incorporating domain-specific physical constraints and geometric prior.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Analyzing stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG) signals is critical for brain-computer interface (BCI) applications and neuroscience research, yet poses significant challenges due to the large number of input channels and their heterogeneous relevance. Traditional channel selection methods struggle to scale or provide meaningful interpretability for SEEG data. In this work, we propose EEGChaT, a novel Transformer-based channel selection module designed to automatically identify the most task-relevant channels in SEEG recordings. EEGChaT introduces Channel Aggregation Tokens (CATs) to aggregate information across channels, and leverages an improved Attention Rollout technique to compute interpretable, quantitative channel importance scores. We evaluate EEGChaT on the DuIN dataset, demonstrating that integrating EEGChaT with existing classification models consistently improves decoding accuracy, achieving up to 17\% absolute gains. Furthermore, the channel weights produced by EEGChaT show substantial overlap with manually selected channels, supporting the interpretability of the approach. Our results suggest that EEGChaT is an effective and generalizable solution for channel selection in high-dimensional SEEG analysis, offering both enhanced performance and insights into neural signal relevance.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Benchmarking outcomes increasingly govern trust, selection, and deployment of LLMs, yet these evaluations remain vulnerable to semantically equivalent adversarial perturbations. Prior work on adversarial robustness in NLP has emphasized text attacks that affect many models equally, leaving open the question of whether it is possible to selectively degrade or enhance performance while minimally affecting other models. We formalize this problem and study selective adversarial attacks on MMLU - a widely used benchmark designed to measure a language model's broad general knowledge and reasoning ability across different subjects. Using canonical attacks integrated into TextAttack framework, we introduce a protocol for selectivity assessment, develop a custom constraint to increase selectivity of attacks and propose a surrogate-LLM pipeline that generates selective perturbations. Empirically, we find that selective adversarial attacks exist and can materially alter relative rankings, challenging the fairness, reproducibility, and transparency of leaderboard-driven evaluation. Our results motivate perturbation-aware reporting and robustness diagnostics for LLM evaluation and demonstrate that even subtle edits can shift comparative judgments.

  Federated continual learning (FCL) enables models to learn new tasks across multiple distributed clients, protecting privacy and without forgetting previously acquired knowledge. However, current methods face challenges balancing performance, privacy preservation, and communication efficiency. We introduce a Distributed Online LoRA for Federated INcremental learning method DOLFIN, a novel approach combining Vision Transformers with low-rank adapters designed to efficiently and stably learn new tasks in federated environments. Our method leverages LoRA for minimal communication overhead and incorporates DualGradient Projection Memory (DualGPM) to prevent forgetting. Evaluated on CIFAR-100, ImageNet-R, ImageNet-A, and CUB-200 under two Dirichlet heterogeneity settings, DOLFIN consistently surpasses six strong baselines in final average accuracy while matching their memory footprint. Orthogonal low-rank adapters offer an effective and scalable solution for privacy-preserving continual learning in federated settings.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In online convex optimization (OCO), a single loss function sequence is revealed over a time horizon of $T$, and an online algorithm has to choose its action at time $t$, before the loss function at time $t$ is revealed. The goal of the online algorithm is to incur minimal penalty (called $\textit{regret}$ compared to a static optimal action made by an optimal offline algorithm knowing all functions of the sequence in advance.In this paper, we broaden the horizon of OCO, and consider multi-objective OCO, where there are $K$ distinct loss function sequences, and an algorithm has to choose its action at time $t$, before the $K$ loss functions at time $t$ are revealed. To capture the tradeoff between tracking the $K$ different sequences, we consider the $\textit{min-max}$ regret, where the benchmark (optimal offline algorithm) takes a static action across all time slots that minimizes the maximum of the total loss (summed across time slots) incurred by each of the $K$ sequences. An online algorithm is allowed to change its action across time slots, and its {\it min-max} regret is defined as the difference between its $\textit{min-max}$ cost and that of the benchmark. The $\textit{min-max}$ regret is a stringent performance measure and an algorithm with small regret needs to `track' all loss function sequences closely at all times.We consider this $\textit{min-max}$ regret in the i.i.d. input setting where all loss functions are i.i.d. generated from an unknown distribution. For the i.i.d. model we propose a simple algorithm that combines the well-known $\textit{Hedge}$ and online gradient descent (OGD) and show via a remarkably simple proof that its expected $\textit{min-max}$ regret is $O(\sqrt{T \log K})$.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Topic modeling is a useful tool for analyzing large corpora of written documents, particularly academic papers. Despite a wide variety of proposed topic modeling techniques, these techniques do not perform well when applied to medical texts. This can be due to the low number of documents available for some topics in the healthcare domain. In this paper, we propose ProtoTopic, a prototypical network-based topic model used for topic generation for a set of medical paper abstracts. Prototypical networks are efficient, explainable models that make predictions by computing distances between input datapoints and a set of prototype representations, making them particularly effective in low-data or few-shot learning scenarios. With ProtoTopic, we demonstrate improved topic coherence and diversity compared to two topic modeling baselines used in the literature, demonstrating the ability of our model to generate medically relevant topics even with limited data.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  On-device deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) frequently leverages Low-Rank Adapters (LoRAs) to support diverse downstream tasks under tight resource constraints. To address the limited storage capacity of mobile devices, recent works have explored model merging techniques to fuse multiple LoRAs into a single one. In practice, however, LoRAs are often delivered incrementally, as users request support for new tasks (e.g., novel problem types or languages). This scenario introduces a new challenge: on-device online continual merging, where the objective is to incorporate new LoRAs while preserving the performance on previously supported tasks. In this paper, we propose a data-free and computationally efficient strategy for selecting and merging LoRAs when a new one becomes available, assuming the device can store only a limited number of adapters. Extensive experiments across real-world tasks demonstrate the superiority of our approach compared to alternative strategies while adhering to the storage budget and compute limitations of on-device settings.

  In this paper, we study the offline and online settings of reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) with KL-regularization -- a widely used objective function in large language model alignment -- under the $\epsilon$ local differential privacy ($\epsilon$-LDP) model on the label of the human preference. In the offline setting, we design an algorithm based on the principle of pessimism and derive a new suboptimality gap of $\tilde{O}(1/[(e^\epsilon-1)^2 n])$ on the KL-regularized objective under single-policy concentrability. We also prove its optimality by providing a matching lower bound where $n$ is the sample size.In the online setting, we are the first one to theoretically investigate the problem of KL-regularized RLHF with LDP. We design an optimism-based algorithm and derive a logarithmic regret bound of $O(d_{\mathcal{F}}\log (N_{\mathcal{F}}\cdot T) /(e^\epsilon-1)^2 )$, where $T$ is the total time step, $N_{\mathcal{F}}$ is cardinality of the reward function space $\mathcal{F}$ and $d_{\mathcal{F}}$ is a variant of eluder dimension for RLHF. As a by-product of our analysis, our results also imply the first analysis for online KL-regularized RLHF without privacy. We implement our algorithm in the offline setting to verify our theoretical results and release our open source code at:this https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Epilepsy is a prevalent neurological disorder marked by sudden, brief episodes of excessive neuronal activity caused by abnormal electrical discharges, which may lead to some mental disorders. Most existing deep learning methods for epilepsy detection rely solely on unimodal EEG signals, neglecting the potential benefits of multimodal information. To address this, we propose a novel multimodal model, DistilCLIP-EEG, based on the CLIP framework, which integrates both EEG signals and text descriptions to capture comprehensive features of epileptic seizures. The model involves an EEG encoder based on the Conformer architecture as a text encoder, the proposed Learnable BERT (BERT-LP) as prompt learning within the encoders. Both operate in a shared latent space for effective cross-modal representation learning. To enhance efficiency and adaptability, we introduce a knowledge distillation method where the trained DistilCLIP-EEG serves as a teacher to guide a more compact student model to reduce training complexity and time. On the TUSZ, AUBMC, and CHB-MIT datasets, both the teacher and student models achieved accuracy rates exceeding 97%. Across all datasets, the F1-scores were consistently above 0.94, demonstrating the robustness and reliability of the proposed framework. Moreover, the student model's parameter count and model size are approximately 58.1% of those of the teacher model, significantly reducing model complexity and storage requirements while maintaining high performance. These results highlight the potential of our proposed model for EEG-based epilepsy detection and establish a solid foundation for deploying lightweight models in resource-constrained settings.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Although average gain optimality is a commonly adopted performance measure in Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), it is often too asymptotic. Further incorporating measures of immediate losses leads to the hierarchy of bias optimalities, all the way up to Blackwell optimality. In this paper, we investigate the problem of identifying policies of such optimality orders. To that end, for each order, we construct a learning algorithm with vanishing probability of error. Furthermore, we characterize the class of MDPs for which identification algorithms can stop in finite time. That class corresponds to the MDPs with a unique Bellman optimal policy, and does not depend on the optimality order considered. Lastly, we provide a tractable stopping rule that when coupled to our learning algorithm triggers in finite time whenever it is possible to do so.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Certifying nonnegativity of polynomials is a well-known NP-hard problem with direct applications spanning non-convex optimization, control, robotics, and beyond. A sufficient condition for nonnegativity is the Sum of Squares (SOS) property, i.e., it can be written as a sum of squares of other polynomials. In practice, however, certifying the SOS criterion remains computationally expensive and often involves solving a Semidefinite Program (SDP), whose dimensionality grows quadratically in the size of the monomial basis of the SOS expression; hence, various methods to reduce the size of the monomial basis have been proposed. In this work, we introduce the first learning-augmented algorithm to certify the SOS criterion. To this end, we train a Transformer model that predicts an almost-minimal monomial basis for a given polynomial, thereby drastically reducing the size of the corresponding SDP. Our overall methodology comprises three key components: efficient training dataset generation of over 100 million SOS polynomials, design and training of the corresponding Transformer architecture, and a systematic fallback mechanism to ensure correct termination, which we analyze theoretically. We validate our approach on over 200 benchmark datasets, achieving speedups of over $100\times$ compared to state-of-the-art solvers and enabling the solution of instances where competing approaches fail. Our findings provide novel insights towards transforming the practical scalability of SOS programming.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Parking spots are essential components, providing vital mobile resources for residents in a city. Accurate Global Positioning System (GPS) points of parking spots are the core data for subsequent applications,e.g., parking management, parking policy, and urban development. However, high-rise buildings tend to cause GPS points to drift from the actual locations of parking spots; besides, the standard lower-cost GPS equipment itself has a certain location error. Therefore, it is a non-trivial task to correct a few wrong GPS points from a large number of parking spots in an unsupervised approach. In this paper, motivated by the physical constraints of parking spots (i.e., parking spots are parallel to the sides of roads), we propose an unsupervised low-rank method to effectively rectify errors in GPS points and further align them to the parking spots in a unified framework. The proposed unconventional rectification and alignment method is simple and yet effective for any type of GPS point errors. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method to solve a practical problem. The data set and the code are publicly accessible at:this https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Regression analysis is employed to examine and quantify the relationships between input variables and a dependent and continuous output variable. It is widely used for predictive modelling in fields such as finance, healthcare, and engineering. However, traditional methods often struggle with real-world data complexities, including uncertainty and ambiguity. While deep learning approaches excel at capturing complex non-linear relationships, they lack interpretability and risk over-fitting on small datasets. Fuzzy systems provide an alternative framework for handling uncertainty and imprecision, with Mamdani and Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (TSK) systems offering complementary strengths: interpretability versus accuracy. This paper presents a novel fuzzy regression method that combines the interpretability of Mamdani systems with the precision of TSK models. The proposed approach introduces a hybrid rule structure with fuzzy and crisp components and dual dominance types, enhancing both accuracy and explainability. Evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in several cases, with rules maintaining a component similar to traditional Mamdani systems while improving precision through improved rule outputs. This hybrid methodology offers a balanced and versatile tool for predictive modelling, addressing the trade-off between interpretability and accuracy inherent in fuzzy systems. In the 6 datasets tested, the proposed approach gave the best fuzzy methodology score in 4 datasets, out-performed the opaque models in 2 datasets and produced the best overall score in 1 dataset with the improvements in RMSE ranging from 0.4% to 19%.

  Embedding models trained separately on similar data often produce representations that encode stable information but are not directly interchangeable. This lack of interoperability raises challenges in several practical applications, such as model retraining, partial model upgrades, and multimodal search. Driven by these challenges, we study when two sets of embeddings can be aligned by an orthogonal transformation. We show that if pairwise dot products are approximately preserved, then there exists an isometry that closely aligns the two sets, and we provide a tight bound on the alignment error. This insight yields a simple alignment recipe, Procrustes post-processing, that makes two embedding models interoperable while preserving the geometry of each embedding space. Empirically, we demonstrate its effectiveness in three applications: maintaining compatibility across retrainings, combining different models for text retrieval, and improving mixed-modality search, where it achieves state-of-the-art performance.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Enhancing scene understanding in adverse visibility conditions remains a critical challenge for surveillance and autonomous navigation systems. Conventional imaging modalities, such as RGB and thermal infrared (MWIR / LWIR), when fused, often struggle to deliver comprehensive scene information, particularly under conditions of atmospheric interference or inadequate illumination. To address these limitations, Short-Wave Infrared (SWIR) imaging has emerged as a promising modality due to its ability to penetrate atmospheric disturbances and differentiate materials with improved clarity. However, the advancement and widespread implementation of SWIR-based systems face significant hurdles, primarily due to the scarcity of publicly accessible SWIR datasets. In response to this challenge, our research introduces an approach to synthetically generate SWIR-like structural/contrast cues (without claiming spectral reproduction) images from existing LWIR data using advanced contrast enhancement techniques. We then propose a multimodal fusion framework integrating synthetic SWIR, LWIR, and RGB modalities, employing an optimized encoder-decoder neural network architecture with modality-specific encoders and a softmax-gated fusion head. Comprehensive experiments on public {RGB-LWIR benchmarks (M3FD, TNO, CAMEL, MSRS, RoadScene) and an additional private real RGB-MWIR-SWIR dataset} demonstrate that our synthetic-SWIR-enhanced fusion framework improves fused-image quality (contrast, edge definition, structural fidelity) while maintaining real-time performance. We also add fair trimodal baselines (LP, LatLRR, GFF) and cascaded trimodal variants of U2Fusion/SwinFusion under a unified protocol. The outcomes highlight substantial potential for real-world applications in surveillance and autonomous systems.

  Although both data availability and the demand for accurate forecasts are increasing, collaboration between stakeholders is often constrained by data ownership and competitive interests. In contrast to recent proposals within cooperative game-theoretical frameworks, we place ourselves in a more general framework, based on prediction markets. There, independent agents trade forecasts of uncertain future events in exchange for rewards. We introduce and analyse a prediction market that (i) accounts for the historical performance of the agents, (ii) adapts to time-varying conditions, while (iii) permitting agents to enter and exit the market at will. The proposed design employs robust regression models to learn the optimal forecasts' combination whilst handling missing submissions. Moreover, we introduce a pay-off allocation mechanism that considers both in-sample and out-of-sample performance while satisfying several desirable economic properties. Case-studies using simulated and real-world data allow demonstrating the effectiveness and adaptability of the proposed market design.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper addresses the challenges of complex dependencies and diverse anomaly patterns in cloud service environments by proposing a dependency modeling and anomaly detection method that integrates contrastive learning. The method abstracts service interactions into a dependency graph, extracts temporal and structural features through embedding functions, and employs a graph convolution mechanism to aggregate neighborhood information for context-aware service representations. A contrastive learning framework is then introduced, constructing positive and negative sample pairs to enhance the separability of normal and abnormal patterns in the representation space. Furthermore, a temporal consistency constraint is designed to maintain representation stability across time steps and reduce the impact of short-term fluctuations and noise. The overall optimization combines contrastive loss and temporal consistency loss to ensure stable and reliable detection across multi-dimensional features. Experiments on public datasets systematically evaluate the method from hyperparameter, environmental, and data sensitivity perspectives. Results show that the proposed approach significantly outperforms existing methods on key metrics such as Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and AUC, while maintaining robustness under conditions of sparse labeling, monitoring noise, and traffic fluctuations. This study verifies the effectiveness of integrating dependency modeling with contrastive learning, provides a complete technical solution for cloud service anomaly detection, and demonstrates strong adaptability and stability in complex environments.

  Despite their effectiveness and popularity in offline or model-based reinforcement learning (RL), transformers remain underexplored in online model-free RL due to their sensitivity to training setups and model design decisions such as how to structure the policy and value networks, share components, or handle temporal information. In this paper, we show that transformers can be strong baselines for continuous control in online model-free RL. We investigate key design questions: how to condition inputs, share components between actor and critic, and slice sequential data for training. Our experiments reveal stable architectural and training strategies enabling competitive performance across fully and partially observable tasks, and in both vector- and image-based settings. These findings offer practical guidance for applying transformers in online RL.

  Measuring similarity between incomplete data is a fundamental challenge in web mining, recommendation systems, and user behavior analysis. Traditional approaches either discard incomplete data or perform imputation as a preprocessing step, leading to information loss and biased similarity estimates. This paper presents the proximity kernel, a new similarity measure that directly computes similarity between incomplete data in kernel feature space without explicit imputation in the original space. The proposed method introduces data-dependent binning combined with proximity assignment to project data into a high-dimensional sparse representation that adapts to local density variations. For missing value handling, we propose a cascading fallback strategy to estimate missing feature distributions. We conduct clustering tasks on the proposed kernel representation across 12 real world incomplete datasets, demonstrating superior performance compared to existing methods while maintaining linear time complexity.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Bayesian optimization in large unstructured discrete spaces is often hindered by the computational cost of maximizing acquisition functions due to the absence of gradients. We propose a scalable alternative based on Thompson sampling that eliminates the need for acquisition function maximization by directly parameterizing the probability that a candidate yields the maximum reward. Our approach, Thompson Sampling via Fine-Tuning (ToSFiT) leverages the prior knowledge embedded in prompt-conditioned large language models, and incrementally adapts them toward the posterior. Theoretically, we derive a novel regret bound for a variational formulation of Thompson Sampling that matches the strong guarantees of its standard counterpart. Our analysis reveals the critical role of careful adaptation to the posterior probability of maximality--a principle that underpins our ToSFiT algorithm. Empirically, we validate our method on three diverse tasks: FAQ response refinement, thermally stable protein search, and quantum circuit design. We demonstrate that online fine-tuning significantly improves sample efficiency, with negligible impact on computational efficiency.

  _Lina Alkarmi, Ziyuan Huang, Mingyan Liu_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Algorithmic decision making is increasingly prevalent, but often vulnerable to strategic manipulation by agents seeking a favorable outcome. Prior research has shown that classifier abstention (allowing a classifier to decline making a decision due to insufficient confidence) can significantly increase classifier accuracy. This paper studies abstention within a strategic classification context, exploring how its introduction impacts strategic agents' responses and how principals should optimally leverage it. We model this interaction as a Stackelberg game where a principal, acting as the classifier, first announces its decision policy, and then strategic agents, acting as followers, manipulate their features to receive a desired outcome. Here, we focus on binary classifiers where agents manipulate observable features rather than their true features, and show that optimal abstention ensures that the principal's utility (or loss) is no worse than in a non-abstention setting, even in the presence of strategic agents. We also show that beyond improving accuracy, abstention can also serve as a deterrent to manipulation, making it costlier for agents, especially those less qualified, to manipulate to achieve a positive outcome when manipulation costs are significant enough to affect agent behavior. These results highlight abstention as a valuable tool for reducing the negative effects of strategic behavior in algorithmic decision making systems.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As Machine Learning (ML) becomes integral to Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), there is growing interest in shifting training from traditional cloud-based to on-device processing (TinyML), for example, due to privacy and latency concerns. However, CPS often comprise ultra-low-power microcontrollers, whose limited compute resources make training challenging. This paper presents RockNet, a new TinyML method tailored for ultra-low-power hardware that achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in timeseries classification, such as fault or malware detection, without requiring offline pretraining. By leveraging that CPS consist of multiple devices, we design a distributed learning method that integrates ML and wireless communication. RockNet leverages all devices for distributed training of specialized compute efficient classifiers that need minimal communication overhead for parallelization. Combined with tailored and efficient wireless multi-hop communication protocols, our approach overcomes the communication bottleneck that often occurs in distributed learning. Hardware experiments on a testbed with 20 ultra-low-power devices demonstrate RockNet's effectiveness. It successfully learns timeseries classification tasks from scratch, surpassing the accuracy of the latest approach for neural network microcontroller training by up to 2x. RockNet's distributed ML architecture reduces memory, latency and energy consumption per device by up to 90 % when scaling from one central device to 20 devices. Our results show that a tight integration of distributed ML, distributed computing, and communication enables, for the first time, training on ultra-low-power hardware with state-of-the-art accuracy.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Anomaly detection is a critical task in data mining and management with applications spanning fraud detection, network security, and log monitoring. Despite extensive research, existing unsupervised anomaly detection methods still face fundamental challenges including conflicting distributional assumptions, computational inefficiency, and difficulty handling different anomaly types. To address these problems, we propose ISER (Isolation-based Spherical Ensemble Representations) that extends existing isolation-based methods by using hypersphere radii as proxies for local density characteristics while maintaining linear time and constant space complexity. ISER constructs ensemble representations where hypersphere radii encode density information: smaller radii indicate dense regions while larger radii correspond to sparse areas. We introduce a novel similarity-based scoring method that measures pattern consistency by comparing ensemble representations against a theoretical anomaly reference pattern. Additionally, we enhance the performance of Isolation Forest by using ISER and adapting the scoring function to address axis-parallel bias and local anomaly detection limitations. Comprehensive experiments on 22 real-world datasets demonstrate ISER's superior performance over 11 baseline methods.

  _Alessandro Brusaferri, Andrea Ballarino_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Dynamical downscaling is crucial for deriving high-resolution meteorological fields from coarse-scale simulations, enabling detailed analysis for critical applications such as weather forecasting and renewable energy modeling. Generative Diffusion models (DMs) have recently emerged as powerful data-driven tools for this task, offering reconstruction fidelity and more scalable sampling supporting uncertainty quantification. However, DMs lack finite-sample guarantees against overconfident predictions, resulting in miscalibrated grid-point-level uncertainty estimates hindering their reliability in operational contexts. In this work, we tackle this issue by augmenting the downscaling pipeline with a conformal prediction framework. Specifically, the DM's samples are post-processed to derive conditional quantile estimates, incorporated into a conformalized quantile regression procedure targeting locally adaptive prediction intervals with finite-sample marginal validity. The proposed approach is evaluated on ERA5 reanalysis data over Italy, downscaled to a 2-km grid. Results demonstrate grid-point-level uncertainty estimates with markedly improved coverage and stable probabilistic scores relative to the DM baseline, highlighting the potential of conformalized generative models for more trustworthy probabilistic downscaling to high-resolution meteorological fields.

  _Rui Xu, Sihong Xie_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Conformal Prediction (CP) provides distribution-free uncertainty quantification by constructing prediction sets that guarantee coverage of the true labels. This reliability makes CP valuable for high-stakes federated learning scenarios such as multi-center healthcare. However, standard CP assumes i.i.d. data, which is violated in federated settings where client distributions differ substantially. Existing federated CP methods address this by maintaining marginal coverage on each client, but such guarantees often fail to reflect input-conditional uncertainty. In this work, we propose Federated Conditional Conformal Prediction (Fed-CCP) via generative models, which aims for conditional coverage that adapts to local data heterogeneity. Fed-CCP leverages generative models, such as normalizing flows or diffusion models, to approximate conditional data distributions without requiring the sharing of raw data. This enables each client to locally calibrate conformal scores that reflect its unique uncertainty, while preserving global consistency through federated aggregation. Experiments on real datasets demonstrate that Fed-CCP achieves more adaptive prediction sets.

  _Anna Hedstr√∂m, Salim I. Amoukou, Tom Bewley, Saumitra Mishra, Manuela Veloso_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce Mechanistic Error Reduction with Abstention (MERA), a principled framework for steering language models (LMs) to mitigate errors through selective, adaptive interventions. Unlike existing methods that rely on fixed, manually tuned steering strengths, often resulting in under or oversteering, MERA addresses these limitations by (i) optimising the intervention direction, and (ii) calibrating when, and how much to steer, thereby provably improving performance or abstaining when no confident correction is possible. Experiments across diverse datasets, and LM families demonstrate safe, effective, non-degrading error correction, and that MERA outperforms existing baselines. Moreover, MERA can be applied on top of existing steering techniques to further enhance their performance, establishing it as a general-purpose, and efficient approach to mechanistic activation steering.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  One of the key challenges of collaborative machine learning, without data sharing, is multimodal data heterogeneity in real-world settings. While Federated Learning (FL) enables model training across multiple clients, existing frameworks, such as horizontal and vertical FL, are only effective in `ideal' settings that meet specific assumptions. Hence, they struggle to address scenarios where neither all modalities nor all samples are represented across the participating clients. To address this gap, we propose BlendFL, a novel FL framework that seamlessly blends the principles of horizontal and vertical FL in a synchronized and non-restrictive fashion despite the asymmetry across clients. Specifically, any client within BlendFL can benefit from either of the approaches, or both simultaneously, according to its available dataset. In addition, BlendFL features a decentralized inference mechanism, empowering clients to run collaboratively trained local models using available local data, thereby reducing latency and reliance on central servers for inference. We also introduce BlendAvg, an adaptive global model aggregation strategy that prioritizes collaborative model updates based on each client's performance. We trained and evaluated BlendFL and other state-of-the-art baselines on three classification tasks using a large-scale real-world multimodal medical dataset and a popular multimodal benchmark. Our results highlight BlendFL's superior performance for both multimodal and unimodal classification. Ablation studies demonstrate BlendFL's faster convergence compared to traditional approaches, accelerating collaborative learning. Overall, in our study we highlight the potential of BlendFL for handling multimodal data heterogeneity for collaborative learning in real-world settings where data privacy is crucial, such as in healthcare and finance.

  The task of perspective-aware classification introduces a bottleneck in terms of parametric efficiency that did not get enough recognition in existing studies. In this article, we aim to address this issue by applying an existing architecture, the hypernetwork+adapters combination, to perspectivist classification. Ultimately, we arrive at a solution that can compete with specialized models in adopting user perspectives on hate speech and toxicity detection, while also making use of considerably fewer parameters. Our solution is architecture-agnostic and can be applied to a wide range of base models out of the box.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success in various domains, yet they often struggle with domain adaptation due to significant structural distribution shifts and insufficient exploration of transferable patterns. One of the main reasons behind this is that traditional approaches do not treat global and local patterns discriminatingly so that some local details in the graph may be violated after multi-layer GNN. Our key insight is that domain shifts can be better understood through spectral analysis, where low-frequency components often encode domain-invariant global patterns, and high-frequency components capture domain-specific local details. As such, we propose FracNet (\underline{\textbf{Fr}}equency \underline{\textbf{A}}ware \underline{\textbf{C}}ontrastive Graph \underline{\textbf{Net}}work) with two synergic modules to decompose the original graph into high-frequency and low-frequency components and perform frequency-aware domain adaption. Moreover, the blurring boundary problem of domain adaptation is improved by integrating with a contrastive learning framework. Besides the practical implication, we also provide rigorous theoretical proof to demonstrate the superiority of FracNet. Extensive experiments further demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art approaches.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language model (LLM) alignment is typically achieved through learning from human preference comparisons, making the quality of preference data critical to its success. Existing studies often pre-process raw training datasets to identify valuable preference pairs using external reward models or off-the-shelf LLMs, achieving improved overall performance but rarely examining whether individual, selected data point is genuinely beneficial. We assess data quality through individual influence on validation data using our newly proposed truncated influence function (TIF), which mitigates the over-scoring present in traditional measures and reveals that preference data quality is inherently a property of the model. In other words, a data pair that benefits one model may harm another. This leaves the need to improve the preference data selection approaches to be adapting to specific models. To this end, we introduce two candidate scoring functions (SFs) that are computationally simpler than TIF and positively correlated with it. They are also model dependent and can serve as potential indicators of individual data quality for preference data selection. Furthermore, we observe that these SFs inherently exhibit errors when compared to TIF. To this end, we combine them to offset their diverse error sources, resulting in a simple yet effective data selection rule that enables the models to achieve a more precise selection of valuable preference data. We conduct experiments across diverse alignment benchmarks and various LLM families, with results demonstrating that better alignment performance can be achieved using less data, showing the generality of our findings and new methods.

  _Yasushi Hasegawa, Masayuki Ohzeki_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We compare Ising ({-1,+1}) and QUBO ({0,1}) encodings for Boltzmann machine learning under a controlled protocol that fixes the model, sampler, and step size. Exploiting the identity that the Fisher information matrix (FIM) equals the covariance of sufficient statistics, we visualize empirical moments from model samples and reveal systematic, representation-dependent differences. QUBO induces larger cross terms between first- and second-order statistics, creating more small-eigenvalue directions in the FIM and lowering spectral entropy. This ill-conditioning explains slower convergence under stochastic gradient descent (SGD). In contrast, natural gradient descent (NGD)-which rescales updates by the FIM metric-achieves similar convergence across encodings due to reparameterization invariance. Practically, for SGD-based training, the Ising encoding provides more isotropic curvature and faster convergence; for QUBO, centering/scaling or NGD-style preconditioning mitigates curvature pathologies. These results clarify how representation shapes information geometry and finite-time learning dynamics in Boltzmann machines and yield actionable guidelines for variable encoding and preprocessing.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Healthcare fraud detection remains a critical challenge due to limited availability of labeled data, constantly evolving fraud tactics, and the high dimensionality of medical records. Traditional supervised methods are challenged by extreme label scarcity, while purely unsupervised approaches often fail to capture clinically meaningful anomalies. In this work, we introduce CleverCatch, a knowledge-guided weak supervision model designed to detect fraudulent prescription behaviors with improved accuracy and interpretability. Our approach integrates structured domain expertise into a neural architecture that aligns rules and data samples within a shared embedding space. By training encoders jointly on synthetic data representing both compliance and violation, CleverCatch learns soft rule embeddings that generalize to complex, real-world datasets. This hybrid design enables data-driven learning to be enhanced by domain-informed constraints, bridging the gap between expert heuristics and machine learning. Experiments on the large-scale real-world dataset demonstrate that CleverCatch outperforms four state-of-the-art anomaly detection baselines, yielding average improvements of 1.3\% in AUC and 3.4\% in recall. Our ablation study further highlights the complementary role of expert rules, confirming the adaptability of the framework. The results suggest that embedding expert rules into the learning process not only improves detection accuracy but also increases transparency, offering an interpretable approach for high-stakes domains such as healthcare fraud detection.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The rapid increase in multimodal data availability has sparked significant interest in cross-modal knowledge distillation (KD) techniques, where richer "teacher" modalities transfer information to weaker "student" modalities during model training to improve performance. However, despite successes across various applications, cross-modal KD does not always result in improved outcomes, primarily due to a limited theoretical understanding that could inform practice. To address this gap, we introduce the Cross-modal Complementarity Hypothesis (CCH): we propose that cross-modal KD is effective when the mutual information between teacher and student representations exceeds the mutual information between the student representation and the labels. We theoretically validate the CCH in a joint Gaussian model and further confirm it empirically across diverse multimodal datasets, including image, text, video, audio, and cancer-related omics data. Our study establishes a novel theoretical framework for understanding cross-modal KD and offers practical guidelines based on the CCH criterion to select optimal teacher modalities for improving the performance of weaker modalities.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Equivariant Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated significant success across various applications. To achieve completeness -- that is, the universal approximation property over the space of equivariant functions -- the network must effectively capture the intricate multi-body interactions among different nodes. Prior methods attain this via deeper architectures, augmented body orders, or increased degrees of steerable features, often at high computational cost and without polynomial-time solutions. In this work, we present a theoretically grounded framework for constructing complete equivariant GNNs that is both efficient and practical. We prove that a complete equivariant GNN can be achieved through two key components: 1) a complete scalar function, referred to as the canonical form of the geometric graph; and 2) a full-rank steerable basis set. Leveraging this finding, we propose an efficient algorithm for constructing complete equivariant GNNs based on two common models: EGNN and TFN. Empirical results demonstrate that our model demonstrates superior completeness and excellent performance with only a few layers, thereby significantly reducing computational overhead while maintaining strong practical efficacy.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Learning effective numerical representations, or embeddings, of programs is a fundamental prerequisite for applying machine learning to automate and enhance compiler optimization. Prevailing paradigms, however, present a dilemma. Static representations, derived from source code or intermediate representation (IR), are efficient and deterministic but offer limited insight into how a program will behave or evolve under complex code transformations. Conversely, dynamic representations, which rely on runtime profiling, provide profound insights into performance bottlenecks but are often impractical for large-scale tasks due to prohibitive overhead and inherent non-determinism. This paper transcends this trade-off by proposing a novel quasi-dynamic framework for program representation. The core insight is to model a program's optimization sensitivity. We introduce the Program Behavior Spectrum, a new representation generated by probing a program's IR with a diverse set of optimization sequences and quantifying the resulting changes in its static features. To effectively encode this high-dimensional, continuous spectrum, we pioneer a compositional learning approach. Product Quantization is employed to discretize the continuous reaction vectors into structured, compositional sub-words. Subsequently, a multi-task Transformer model, termed PQ-BERT, is pre-trained to learn the deep contextual grammar of these behavioral codes. Comprehensive experiments on two representative compiler optimization tasks -- Best Pass Prediction and -Oz Benefit Prediction -- demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art static baselines. Our code is publicly available atthis https URL.

  We study the client selection problem in Federated Learning (FL) within mobile edge computing (MEC) environments, particularly under the dependent multi-task settings, to reduce the total time required to complete various learning tasks. We propose CoDa-FL, a Cluster-oriented and Dependency-aware framework designed to reduce the total required time via cluster-based client selection and dependent task assignment. Our approach considers Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) for client clustering based on their local data distributions to lower computational cost and improve communication efficiency. We derive a direct and explicit relationship between intra-cluster EMD and the number of training rounds required for convergence, thereby simplifying the otherwise complex process of obtaining the optimal solution. Additionally, we incorporate a directed acyclic graph-based task scheduling mechanism to effectively manage task dependencies. Through numerical experiments, we validate that our proposed CoDa-FL outperforms existing benchmarks by achieving faster convergence, lower communication and computational costs, and higher learning accuracy under heterogeneous MEC settings.

  Masked diffusion models (MDMs) for text offer a compelling alternative to traditional autoregressive language models. Parallel generation makes them efficient, but their computational capabilities and the limitations inherent to their parallelism remain largely unexplored. To this end, we characterize what types of reasoning problems MDMs can provably solve and how efficiently. We do this by connecting MDMs to the well-understood reasoning frameworks of chain of thought (CoT) and padded looped transformers (PLTs) in the finite-precision log-width setting: We show that MDMs and polynomially-padded PLTs are, in fact, equivalent in this setting, and that MDMs can solve all problems that CoT-augmented transformers can. Moreover, we showcase classes of problems (including regular languages) for which MDMs are inherently more efficient than CoT transformers, where parallel generation allows for substantially faster reasoning.

  Based on Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), the paper introduces two optimizers, named Interpolational Accelerating Gradient Descent (IAGD) as well as Noise-Regularized Stochastic Gradient Descent (NRSGD). IAGD leverages second-order Newton Interpolation to expedite the convergence process during training, assuming relevancy in gradients between iterations. To avoid over-fitting, NRSGD incorporates a noise regularization technique that introduces controlled noise to the gradients during the optimization process. Comparative experiments of this research are conducted on the CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 datasets, benchmarking different CNNs(Convolutional Neural Networks) with IAGD and NRSGD against classical optimizers in Keras Package. Results demonstrate the potential of those two viable improvement methods in SGD, implicating the effectiveness of the advancements.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Computer models are indispensable tools for understanding the Earth system. While high-resolution operational models have achieved many successes, they exhibit persistent biases, particularly in simulating extreme events and statistical distributions. In contrast, coarse-grained idealized models isolate fundamental processes and can be precisely calibrated to excel in characterizing specific dynamical and statistical features. However, different models remain siloed by disciplinary boundaries. By leveraging the complementary strengths of models of varying complexity, we develop an explainable AI framework for Earth system emulators. It bridges the model hierarchy through a reconfigured latent data assimilation technique, uniquely suited to exploit the sparse output from the idealized models. The resulting bridging model inherits the high resolution and comprehensive variables of operational models while achieving global accuracy enhancements through targeted improvements from idealized models. Crucially, the mechanism of AI provides a clear rationale for these advancements, moving beyond black-box correction to physically insightful understanding in a computationally efficient framework that enables effective physics-assisted digital twins and uncertainty quantification. We demonstrate its power by significantly correcting biases in CMIP6 simulations of El Ni√±o spatiotemporal patterns, leveraging statistically accurate idealized models. This work also highlights the importance of pushing idealized model development and advancing communication between modeling communities.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Test-time scaling has enabled Large Language Models (LLMs) with remarkable reasoning capabilities, particularly in mathematical domains, through intermediate chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning before generating final answers. However, the specific sources and mechanisms underlying these reasoning capabilities remain insufficiently understood. Optimization reasoning, i.e. finding extrema under constraints, represents a fundamental abstraction that underpins critical applications in planning, control, resource allocation, and prompt search. To systematically evaluate this capability, we introduce ExtremBench, a benchmark dataset for solving mathematical extremal problems, curated from inequality exercises used for Chinese Mathematical Olympiad and transformed into $93$ standardized extrema-finding problems. We conduct extensive evaluations across various state-of-the-art open-source model families, including the Qwen3, GPT-OSS, and DeepSeek. Our results reveal that LLMs' extremal-solving reasoning capabilities do not always align with those of current mathematical benchmarks such as AIME25 and MATH-500, with some models showing strong general mathematical reasoning but poor extremal-solving skills, and vice versa. This discrepancy highlights a critical gap in current evaluation practices and suggests that existing benchmarks may not comprehensively capture the full spectrum of mathematical reasoning abilities.

  Channel state information (CSI) prediction is a promising strategy for ensuring reliable and efficient operation of massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) systems by providing timely downlink (DL) CSI. While deep learning-based methods have advanced beyond conventional model-driven and statistical approaches, they remain limited in robustness to practical non-Gaussian noise, generalization across diverse channel conditions, and computational efficiency. This paper introduces CSI-4CAST, a hybrid deep learning architecture that integrates 4 key components, i.e., Convolutional neural network residuals, Adaptive correction layers, ShuffleNet blocks, and Transformers, to efficiently capture both local and long-range dependencies in CSI prediction. To enable rigorous evaluation, this work further presents a comprehensive benchmark, CSI-RRG for Regular, Robustness and Generalization testing, which includes more than 300,000 samples across 3,060 realistic scenarios for both TDD and FDD systems. The dataset spans multiple channel models, a wide range of delay spreads and user velocities, and diverse noise types and intensity degrees. Experimental results show that CSI-4CAST achieves superior prediction accuracy with substantially lower computational cost, outperforming baselines in 88.9% of TDD scenarios and 43.8% of FDD scenario, the best performance among all evaluated models, while reducing FLOPs by 5x and 3x compared to LLM4CP, the strongest baseline. In addition, evaluation over CSI-RRG provides valuable insights into how different channel factors affect the performance and generalization capability of deep learning models. Both the dataset (this https URL) and evaluation protocols (this https URL) are publicly released to establish a standardized benchmark and to encourage further research on robust and efficient CSI prediction.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Current unlearning metrics for generative models evaluate success based on reference responses or classifier outputs rather than assessing the core objective: whether the unlearned model behaves indistinguishably from a model that never saw the unwanted data. This reference-specific approach creates systematic blind spots, allowing models to appear successful while retaining unwanted knowledge accessible through alternative prompts or attacks. We address these limitations by proposing Functional Alignment for Distributional Equivalence (FADE), a novel metric that measures distributional similarity between unlearned and reference models by comparing bidirectional likelihood assignments over generated samples. Unlike existing approaches that rely on predetermined references, FADE captures functional alignment across the entire output distribution, providing a principled assessment of genuine unlearning. Our experiments on the TOFU benchmark for LLM unlearning and the UnlearnCanvas benchmark for text-to-image diffusion model unlearning reveal that methods achieving near-optimal scores on traditional metrics fail to achieve distributional equivalence, with many becoming more distant from the gold standard than before unlearning. These findings expose fundamental gaps in current evaluation practices and demonstrate that FADE provides a more robust foundation for developing and assessing truly effective unlearning methods.

  _Athyrson Machado Ribeiro, Marcos Medeiros Raimundo_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reject Inference (RI) methods aim to address sample bias by inferring missing repayment data for rejected credit applicants. Traditional approaches often assume that the behavior of rejected clients can be extrapolated from accepted clients, despite potential distributional differences between the two populations. To mitigate this blind extrapolation, we propose a novel Confident Inlier Extrapolation framework (CI-EX). CI-EX iteratively identifies the distribution of rejected client samples using an outlier detection model and assigns labels to rejected individuals closest to the distribution of the accepted population based on probabilities derived from a supervised classification model. The effectiveness of our proposed framework is validated through experiments on two large real-world credit datasets. Performance is evaluated using the Area Under the Curve (AUC) as well as RI-specific metrics such as Kickout and a novel metric introduced in this work, denoted as Area under the Kickout. Our findings reveal that RI methods, including the proposed framework, generally involve a trade-off between AUC and RI-specific metrics. However, the proposed CI-EX framework consistently outperforms existing RI models from the credit literature in terms of RI-specific metrics while maintaining competitive performance in AUC across most experiments.

In this work, we introduce a suite of black-box evaluation tests to assess privacy-related memorization risks in foundation models trained on structured EHR data. Our framework includes methods for probing memorization at both the embedding and generative levels, and aims to distinguish between model generalization and harmful memorization in clinically relevant settings. We contextualize memorization in terms of its potential to compromise patient privacy, particularly for vulnerable subgroups. We validate our approach on a publicly available EHR foundation model and release an open-source toolkit to facilitate reproducible and collaborative privacy assessments in healthcare AI.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reinforcement learning (RL) policies deployed in real-world environments must remain reliable under adversarial perturbations. At the same time, modern deep RL agents are heavily over-parameterized, raising costs and fragility concerns. While pruning has been shown to improve robustness in supervised learning, its role in adversarial RL remains poorly understood. We develop the first theoretical framework for certified robustness under pruning in state-adversarial Markov decision processes (SA-MDPs). For Gaussian and categorical policies with Lipschitz networks, we prove that element-wise pruning can only tighten certified robustness bounds; pruning never makes the policy less robust. Building on this, we derive a novel three-term regret decomposition that disentangles clean-task performance, pruning-induced performance loss, and robustness gains, exposing a fundamental performance--robustness frontier. Empirically, we evaluate magnitude and micro-pruning schedules on continuous-control benchmarks with strong policy-aware adversaries. Across tasks, pruning consistently uncovers reproducible ``sweet spots'' at moderate sparsity levels, where robustness improves substantially without harming - and sometimes even enhancing - clean performance. These results position pruning not merely as a compression tool but as a structural intervention for robust RL.

  _Alex Gower_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Physical systems that naturally perform energy descent offer a direct route to accelerating machine learning. Oscillator Ising Machines (OIMs) exemplify this idea: their GHz-frequency dynamics mirror both the optimization of energy-based models (EBMs) and gradient descent on loss landscapes, while intrinsic noise corresponds to Langevin dynamics - supporting sampling as well as optimization. Equilibrium Propagation (EP) unifies these processes into descent on a single total energy landscape, enabling local learning rules without global backpropagation. We show that EP on OIMs achieves competitive accuracy ($\sim 97.2 \pm 0.1 \%$ on MNIST, $\sim 88.0 \pm 0.1 \%$ on Fashion-MNIST), while maintaining robustness under realistic hardware constraints such as parameter quantization and phase noise. These results establish OIMs as a fast, energy-efficient substrate for neuromorphic learning, and suggest that EBMs - often bottlenecked by conventional processors - may find practical realization on physical hardware whose dynamics directly perform their optimization.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Pseudo-Alignment is a pervasive challenge in many large language models for time series (LLM4TS) models, often causing them to underperform compared to linear models or randomly initialised backbones. However, there is limited discussion in the community for the reasons that pseudo-alignment occurs. In this work, we conduct a thorough investigation into the root causes of pseudo-alignment in LLM4TS and build a connection of pseudo-alignment to the cone effect in LLM. We demonstrate that pseudo-alignment arises from the interplay of cone effect within pretrained LLM components and the intrinsically low-dimensional manifold of time-series data. In addition, we also introduce \textit{\textbf{TimeSUP}}, a novel technique designed to mitigate this issue and improve forecast performance in existing LLM4TS approaches. TimeSUP addresses this by increasing the time series manifold to more closely match the intrinsic dimension of language embeddings, allowing the model to distinguish temporal signals clearly while still capturing shared structures across modalities. As a result, representations for time and language tokens remain distinct yet exhibit high cosine similarity, signifying that the model preserves each modality unique features while learning their commonalities in a unified embedding space. Empirically, TimeSUP consistently outperforms state-of-the-art LLM4TS methods and other lightweight baselines on long-term forecasting performance. Furthermore, it can be seamlessly integrated into four existing LLM4TS pipelines and delivers significant improvements in forecasting performance.

  _Ansh Tiwari, Ayush Chauhan_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Spiking neural networks (SNNs) promise energy-efficient artificial intelligence on neuromorphic hardware but struggle with tasks requiring both fast adaptation and long-term memory, especially in continual learning. We propose Local Timescale Gating (LT-Gate), a neuron model that combines dual time-constant dynamics with an adaptive gating mechanism. Each spiking neuron tracks information on a fast and a slow timescale in parallel, and a learned gate locally adjusts their influence. This design enables individual neurons to preserve slow contextual information while responding to fast signals, addressing the stability-plasticity dilemma. We further introduce a variance-tracking regularization that stabilizes firing activity, inspired by biological homeostasis. Empirically, LT-Gate yields significantly improved accuracy and retention in sequential learning tasks: on a challenging temporal classification benchmark it achieves about 51 percent final accuracy, compared to about 46 percent for a recent Hebbian continual-learning baseline and lower for prior SNN methods. Unlike approaches that require external replay or expensive orthogonalizations, LT-Gate operates with local updates and is fully compatible with neuromorphic hardware. In particular, it leverages features of Intel's Loihi chip (multiple synaptic traces with different decay rates) for on-chip learning. Our results demonstrate that multi-timescale gating can substantially enhance continual learning in SNNs, narrowing the gap between spiking and conventional deep networks on lifelong-learning tasks.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Accurate rainfall forecasting, particularly for extreme events, remains a significant challenge in climatology and the Earth system. This paper presents novel physics-informed Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) combined with extreme-value analysis techniques to improve gauge-station rainfall predictions across Thailand. The model leverages a graph-structured representation of gauge stations to capture complex spatiotemporal patterns, and it offers explainability through teleconnections. We preprocess relevant climate indices that potentially influence regional rainfall. The proposed Graph Attention Network with Long Short-Term Memory (Attention-LSTM) applies the attention mechanism using initial edge features derived from simple orographic-precipitation physics formulation. The embeddings are subsequently processed by LSTM layers. To address extremes, we perform Peak-Over-Threshold (POT) mapping using the novel Spatial Season-aware Generalized Pareto Distribution (GPD) method, which overcomes limitations of traditional machine-learning models. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms well-established baselines across most regions, including areas prone to extremes, and remains strongly competitive with the state of the art. Compared with the operational forecasting system SEAS5, our real-world application improves extreme-event prediction and offers a practical enhancement to produce fine-resolution maps that support decision-making in long-term water management.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Modern continuous-time generative models often induce V-shaped transport: each sample travels independently along nearly straight trajectories from prior to data, overlooking shared structure. We introduce Y-shaped generative flows, which move probability mass together along shared pathways before branching to target-specific endpoints. Our formulation is based on novel velocity-powered objective with a sublinear exponent (between zero and one). this concave dependence rewards joint and fast mass movement. Practically, we instantiate the idea in a scalable neural ODE training objective. On synthetic, image, and biology datasets, Y-flows recover hierarchy-aware structure, improve distributional metrics over strong flow-based baselines, and reach targets with fewer integration steps.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Retrosynthesis is one of the domains transformed by the rise of generative models, and it is one where the problem of nonsensical or erroneous outputs (hallucinations) is particularly insidious: reliable assessment of synthetic plans is time-consuming, with automatic methods lacking. In this work, we present RetroTrim, a retrosynthesis system that successfully avoids nonsensical plans on a set of challenging drug-like targets. Compared to common baselines in the field, our system is not only the sole method that succeeds in filtering out hallucinated reactions, but it also results in the highest number of high-quality paths overall. The key insight behind RetroTrim is the combination of diverse reaction scoring strategies, based on machine learning models and existing chemical databases. We show that our scoring strategies capture different classes of hallucinations by analyzing them on a dataset of labeled retrosynthetic intermediates. This approach formed the basis of our winning solution to the Standard Industries \$1 million Retrosynthesis Challenge. To measure the performance of retrosynthesis systems, we propose a novel evaluation protocol for reactions and synthetic paths based on a structured review by expert chemists. Using this protocol, we compare systems on a set of 32 novel targets, curated to reflect recent trends in drug structures. While the insights behind our methodology are broadly applicable to retrosynthesis, our focus is on targets in the drug-like domain. By releasing our benchmark targets and the details of our evaluation protocol, we hope to inspire further research into reliable retrosynthesis.

  _Martin Carrasco, Caio F. Deberaldini Netto, Vahan A. Martirosyan, Aneeqa Mehrab, Ehimare Okoyomon, Caterina Graziani_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The expressive power of graph neural networks (GNNs) is typically understood through their correspondence with graph isomorphism tests such as the Weisfeiler-Leman (WL) hierarchy. While more expressive GNNs can distinguish a richer set of graphs, they are also observed to suffer from higher generalization error. This work provides a theoretical explanation for this trade-off by linking expressivity and generalization through the lens of coloring algorithms. Specifically, we show that the number of equivalence classes induced by WL colorings directly bounds the GNNs Rademacher complexity -- a key data-dependent measure of generalization. Our analysis reveals that greater expressivity leads to higher complexity and thus weaker generalization guarantees. Furthermore, we prove that the Rademacher complexity is stable under perturbations in the color counts across different samples, ensuring robustness to sampling variability across datasets. Importantly, our framework is not restricted to message-passing GNNs or 1-WL, but extends to arbitrary GNN architectures and expressivity measures that partition graphs into equivalence classes. These results unify the study of expressivity and generalization in GNNs, providing a principled understanding of why increasing expressive power often comes at the cost of generalization.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) is essential for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLM), yet the widely adopted Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) suffers from entropy collapse, where entropy monotonically decreases, exploration vanishes, and policies converge prematurely. Existing entropy-regularized methods only partially alleviate this issue while introducing bias and instability, leaving entropy control unresolved and the connection between entropy, exploration, and performance unclear. We propose Arbitrary Entropy Policy Optimization (AEPO), which eliminates entropy collapse by replacing entropy bonuses with REINFORCE policy gradient on temperature-adjusted distributions and stabilizing entropy through temperature regulation. AEPO integrates three key designs: policy gradient as regularization, distribution as regularization, and REINFORCE as regularization, enabling precise entropy control without distorting optimization. Experiments demonstrate three major contributions: AEPO (1) stabilizes entropy at arbitrary target levels, effectively removing collapse in GRPO; (2) reveals a non-monotonic relation where performance first improves then declines with increasing entropy, clarifying the link between entropy, exploration, and reasoning; and (3) generalizes beyond entropy, providing a broader RFT paradigm where superior target distributions can serve as REINFORCE regularizers.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models excel at short-horizon reasoning tasks, but performance drops as reasoning horizon lengths increase. Existing approaches to combat this rely on inference-time scaffolding or costly step-level supervision, neither of which scales easily. In this work, we introduce a scalable method to bootstrap long-horizon reasoning capabilities using only existing, abundant short-horizon data. Our approach synthetically composes simple problems into complex, multi-step dependency chains of arbitrary length. We train models on this data using outcome-only rewards under a curriculum that automatically increases in complexity, allowing RL training to be scaled much further without saturating. Empirically, our method generalizes remarkably well: curriculum training on composed 6th-grade level math problems (GSM8K) boosts accuracy on longer, competition-level benchmarks (GSM-Symbolic, MATH-500, AIME) by up to 2.06x. It also transfers significantly to diverse out-of-distribution ReasoningGym domains and long-context benchmarks, indicating broader generalization. Importantly, our long-horizon improvements are significantly higher than baselines even at high pass@k, showing that models can learn new reasoning paths under RL. Theoretically, we show that curriculum RL with outcome rewards achieves an exponential improvement in sample complexity over full-horizon training, providing training signal comparable to dense supervision. h1 therefore introduces an efficient path towards scaling RL for long-horizon problems using only existing data.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Function regression/approximation is a fundamental application of machine learning. Neural networks (NNs) can be easily trained for function regression using a sufficient number of neurons and epochs. The forward-forward learning algorithm is a novel approach for training neural networks without backpropagation, and is well suited for implementation in neuromorphic computing and physical analogs for neural networks. To the best of the authors' knowledge, the Forward Forward paradigm of training and inferencing NNs is currently only restricted to classification tasks. This paper introduces a new methodology for approximating functions (function regression) using the Forward-Forward algorithm. Furthermore, the paper evaluates the developed methodology on univariate and multivariate functions, and provides preliminary studies of extending the proposed Forward-Forward regression to Kolmogorov Arnold Networks, and Deep Physical Neural Networks.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Uncertainty quantification is critical for ensuring robustness in high-stakes machine learning applications. We introduce HybridFlow, a modular hybrid architecture that unifies the modeling of aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty by combining a Conditional Masked Autoregressive normalizing flow for estimating aleatoric uncertainty with a flexible probabilistic predictor for epistemic uncertainty. The framework supports integration with any probabilistic model class, allowing users to easily adapt HybridFlow to existing architectures without sacrificing predictive performance. HybridFlow improves upon previous uncertainty quantification frameworks across a range of regression tasks, such as depth estimation, a collection of regression benchmarks, and a scientific case study of ice sheet emulation. We also provide empirical results of the quantified uncertainty, showing that the uncertainty quantified by HybridFlow is calibrated and better aligns with model error than existing methods for quantifying aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty. HybridFlow addresses a key challenge in Bayesian deep learning, unifying aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty modeling in a single robust framework.

  We introduce D2AC, a new model-free reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm designed to train expressive diffusion policies online effectively. At its core is a policy improvement objective that avoids the high variance of typical policy gradients and the complexity of backpropagation through time. This stable learning process is critically enabled by our second contribution: a robust distributional critic, which we design through a fusion of distributional RL and clipped double Q-learning. The resulting algorithm is highly effective, achieving state-of-the-art performance on a benchmark of eighteen hard RL tasks, including Humanoid, Dog, and Shadow Hand domains, spanning both dense-reward and goal-conditioned RL scenarios. Beyond standard benchmarks, we also evaluate a biologically motivated predator-prey task to examine the behavioral robustness and generalization capacity of our approach.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Most recent RL for LLMs (RL4LLM) methods avoid explicit critics, replacing them with average advantage baselines. This shift is largely pragmatic: conventional value functions are computationally expensive to train at LLM scale and often fail under sparse rewards and long reasoning horizons. We revisit this bottleneck from an architectural perspective and introduce Asymmetric Proximal Policy Optimization (AsyPPO), a simple and scalable framework that restores the critics role while remaining efficient in large-model settings. AsyPPO employs a set of lightweight mini-critics, each trained on disjoint prompt shards. This design encourages diversity while preserving calibration, reducing value-estimation bias. Beyond robust estimation, AsyPPO leverages inter-critic uncertainty to refine the policy update: (i) masking advantages in states where critics agree and gradients add little learning signal, and (ii) filtering high-divergence states from entropy regularization, suppressing spurious exploration. After training on open-source data with only 5,000 samples, AsyPPO consistently improves learning stability and performance across multiple benchmarks over strong baselines, such as GRPO, achieving performance gains of more than six percent on Qwen3-4b-Base and about three percent on Qwen3-8b-Base and Qwen3-14b-Base over classic PPO, without additional tricks. These results highlight the importance of architectural innovations for scalable, efficient algorithms.

  _Shawn Im, Sharon Li_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As large language models (LLMs) advance their capabilities, aligning these models with human preferences has become crucial. Preference optimization, which trains models to distinguish between preferred and non-preferred responses based on human feedback, has become a crucial component for aligning LLMs. However, most existing works assume noise-free feedback, which is unrealistic due to the inherent errors and inconsistencies in human judgments. This paper addresses the impact of noisy feedback on preference optimization, providing generalization guarantees under these conditions. In particular, we consider noise models that correspond to common real-world sources of noise, such as mislabeling and uncertainty. Unlike traditional analyses that assume convergence, our work focuses on finite-step preference optimization, offering new insights that are more aligned with practical LLM training. We describe how generalization decays with different types of noise across levels of noise rates based on the preference data distribution and number of samples. Our analysis for noisy preference learning applies to a broad family of preference optimization losses such as DPO, IPO, SLiC, etc. Empirical validation on contemporary LLMs confirms the practical relevance of our findings, offering valuable insights for developing AI systems that align with human preferences.

  Foundational models based on the transformer architecture are currently the state-of-the-art in general language modeling, as well as in scientific areas such as material science and climate. However, training and deploying these models is computationally challenging as the time and space complexity has a quadratic relation to the input sequence length. Several efforts exploring efficient computational paradigms and model architectures to address these limitations have been made. In this work, we explore spiking neural networks (SNNs) to design transformer models. A challenge in training large-scale SNNs, using existing surrogate learning methods is inefficient and time-consuming. On the other hand, techniques to convert existing transformer-based models to their SNN equivalent are not scalable, as achieving optimal performance comes at the cost of a large number of spike time-steps, i.e. increased latency. To address this, we propose NeurTransformer, a methodology for designing transformer-based SNN for inference using a supervised fine-tuning approach with existing conversion methods. The proposed methodology works by: (1) replacing the self-attention mechanism with a spike-based self-attention (SSA), (2) converting the feed-forward block of the trained transformer model to its equivalent SNN, and (3) fine-tuning the SSA block using SNN-based surrogate learning algorithms. We benchmark the proposed methodology and demonstrate its accuracy and scalability using three variants of the GPT-2 model of increasing model size. We observe that the converted GPT-2 small models demonstrate a 5-12% loss in cosine similarity and a 9.7% reduction in perplexity. Finally, we demonstrate the energy efficiency of the SSA block compared to the ASA block and show between 64.71% and 85.28% reductions in estimated energy consumption when implementing the self-attention mechanism on a digital hardware.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Off-policy reinforcement learning (RL) with function approximation offers an effective way to improve sample efficiency by reusing past experience. Within this setting, the actor-critic (AC) framework has achieved strong empirical success. However, both the critic and actor learning is challenging for the off-policy AC methods: first of all, in addition to the classic "deadly triad" instability of off-policy evaluation, it also suffers from a "moving target" problem, where the policy being evaluated changes continually; secondly, actor learning becomes less efficient due to the difficulty of estimating the exact off-policy policy gradient. The first challenge essentially reduces the problem to repeatedly performing off-policy evaluation for changing policies. For the second challenge, the off-policy policy gradient theorem requires a complex and often impractical algorithm to estimate an additional emphasis critic, which is typically neglected in practice, thereby reducing to the on-policy policy gradient as an approximation. In this work, we introduce a novel concept of functional critic modeling, which leads to a new AC framework that addresses both challenges for actor-critic learning under the deadly triad setting. We provide a theoretical analysis in the linear function setting, establishing the provable convergence of our framework, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first convergent off-policy target-based AC algorithm. From a practical perspective, we further propose a carefully designed neural network architecture for the functional critic modeling and demonstrate its effectiveness through preliminary experiments on widely used RL tasks from the DeepMind Control Benchmark.

  _Micah Adler_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  While self-attention is known to learn relations among tokens, we lack a formal understanding of its capacity: how many distinct relations can a single layer reliably recover for a given budget?To formalize this, we introduce Relational Graph Recognition (RGR), where the key-query channel represents a graph on $m$ items with $m'$ directed edges, and, given a context of items, must recover the neighbors of each item. We measure resources by the total key dimension $D_K = h\,d_k$. Within this framework, we analytically derive a capacity scaling law and validate it empirically. We show that $D_K = \Theta(m' \log m' / d_{\text{model}})$ is both necessary (information-theoretic lower bound) and sufficient (explicit construction) in a broad class of graphs to recover $m'$ relations. This scaling law directly leads to a new, capacity-based rationale for multi-head attention that applies even when each item only attends to a single target. When embeddings are uncompressed ($m = d_{\text{model}}$) and the graph is a permutation, a single head suffices. However, compression ($m > d_{\text{model}}$) forces relations into overlapping subspaces, creating interference that a single large head cannot disentangle. Our analysis shows that allocating a fixed $D_K$ across many small heads mitigates this interference, increasing the number of recoverable relations. Controlled single-layer experiments mirror the theory, revealing a sharp performance threshold that matches the predicted capacity scaling and confirms the benefit of distributing $D_K$ across multiple heads.Altogether, these results provide a concrete scaling law for self-attention capacity and a principled design rule for allocating key-query budget across heads.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this study, we introduce a method for learning group (known or unknown) equivariant functions by learning the associated quadratic form $x^T A x$ corresponding to the group from the data. Certain groups, known as orthogonal groups, preserve a specific quadratic form, and we leverage this property to uncover the underlying symmetry group under the assumption that it is orthogonal. By utilizing the corresponding unique symmetric matrix and its inherent diagonal form, we incorporate suitable inductive biases into the neural network architecture, leading to models that are both simplified and efficient. Our approach results in an invariant model that preserves norms, while the equivariant model is represented as a product of a norm-invariant model and a scale-invariant model, where the ``product'' refers to the group action.Moreover, we extend our framework to a more general setting where the function acts on tuples of input vectors via a diagonal (or product) group action. In this extension, the equivariant function is decomposed into an angular component extracted solely from the normalized first vector and a scale-invariant component that depends on the full Gram matrix of the tuple. This decomposition captures the inter-dependencies between multiple inputs while preserving the underlying group symmetry.We assess the effectiveness of our framework across multiple tasks, including polynomial regression, top quark tagging, and moment of inertia matrix prediction. Comparative analysis with baseline methods demonstrates that our model consistently excels in both discovering the underlying symmetry and efficiently learning the corresponding equivariant function.

  Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a powerful paradigm for optimizing large language models (LLMs) to handle complex reasoning tasks. A core challenge in this process lies in managing policy entropy, which reflects the balance between exploration and exploitation during training. Existing methods, such as proximal policy optimization (PPO) and its variants, discard valuable gradient signals from low-probability tokens due to the clipping mechanism. We systematically analyze the entropy dynamics and reveal that these clipped tokens play a critical yet overlooked role in regulating entropy evolution. We propose \textbf{C}oordinating \textbf{E}ntropy via \textbf{G}radient-\textbf{P}reserving \textbf{P}olicy \textbf{O}ptimization (CE-GPPO), a novel algorithm that reintroduces gradients from clipped tokens in native PPO in a gentle and bounded manner. By controlling the magnitude of gradients from tokens outside the clipping interval, CE-GPPO is able to achieve an exploration-exploitation trade-off. We provide theoretical justification and empirical evidence showing that CE-GPPO effectively mitigates entropy instability. Extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that CE-GPPO consistently outperforms strong baselines across different model scales.

  In real-world industrial settings, large language models (LLMs) must learn continually to keep pace with diverse and evolving tasks, requiring self-evolution to refine knowledge under dynamic data distributions.

To prevent transferring task-irrelevant noise through the shared pathway, we integrate a task-aware discriminator within a GAN. The discriminator encourages the shared expert to pass only task-aligned information during sequential training. Through adversarial learning, the shared expert acquires generalized representations that mimic the discriminator, while dedicated experts retain task-specific details, balancing knowledge retention and cross-task generalization and thereby supportingthis http URLexperiments on the public MTL5 benchmark and an industrial Tencent3 benchmark validate the effectiveness of MoE-CL for continual instruction tuning.

  Communication is essential for the collective execution of complex tasks by human agents, motivating interest in communication mechanisms for multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). However, existing communication protocols in MARL are often complex and non-differentiable. In this work, we introduce a self-attention-based communication module that exchanges information between the agents in MARL. Our proposed approach is fully differentiable, allowing agents to learn to generate messages in a reward-driven manner. The module can be seamlessly integrated with any action-value function decomposition method and can be viewed as an extension of such decompositions. Notably, it includes a fixed number of trainable parameters, independent of the number of agents. Experimental results on the SMAC and SMACv2 benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, which achieves state-of-the-art performance on a number of maps.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The quadratic complexity of self-attention limits its applicability and scalability on large unstructured meshes. We introduce Fast Low-rank Attention Routing Engine (FLARE), a linear complexity self-attention mechanism that routes attention through fixed-length latent sequences. Each attention head performs global communication among $N$ tokens by projecting the input sequence onto a fixed length latent sequence of $M \ll N$ tokens using learnable query tokens. By routing attention through a bottleneck sequence, FLARE learns a low-rank form of attention that can be applied at $O(NM)$ cost. FLARE not only scales to unprecedented problem sizes, but also delivers superior accuracy compared to state-of-the-art neural PDE surrogates across diverse benchmarks. We also release a new additive manufacturing dataset to spur further research. Our code is available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Low-rank training methods reduce the number of trainable parameters by re-parameterizing the weights with matrix decompositions (e.g., singular value decomposition). However, enforcing a fixed low-rank structure caps the rank of the weight matrices and can hinder the model's ability to learn complex patterns. Furthermore, the effective rank of the model's weights tends to decline during training, and this drop is accelerated when the model is reparameterized into a low-rank structure. In this study, we argue that strategically interleaving full-rank training epochs within low-rank training epochs can effectively restore the rank of the model's weights. Based on our findings, we propose a general dynamic-rank training framework that is readily applicable to a wide range of neural-network tasks. We first describe how to adjust the rank of weight matrix to alleviate the inevitable rank collapse that arises during training, and then present extensive empirical results that validate our claims and demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed framework. Our empirical study shows that the proposed method achieves almost the same computational cost as SVD-based low-rank training while achieving a comparable accuracy to full-rank training across various benchmarks.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multi-step agentic retrieval systems based on large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in complex information search tasks. However, these systems still face significant challenges in practical applications, particularly in generating factually inconsistent intermediate queries and inefficient search trajectories, which can lead to reasoning deviations or redundant computations. To address these issues, we propose DynaSearcher, an innovative search agent enhanced by dynamic knowledge graphs and multi-reward reinforcement learning (RL). Specifically, our system leverages knowledge graphs as external structured knowledge to guide the search process by explicitly modeling entity relationships, thereby ensuring factual consistency in intermediate queries and mitigating biases from irrelevant information. Furthermore, we employ a multi-reward RL framework for fine-grained control over training objectives such as retrieval accuracy, efficiency, and response quality. This framework promotes the generation of high-quality intermediate queries and comprehensive final answers, while discouraging unnecessary exploration and minimizing information omissions or redundancy. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art answer accuracy on six multi-hop question answering datasets, matching frontier LLMs while using only small-scale models and limited computational resources. Furthermore, our approach demonstrates strong generalization and robustness across diverse retrieval environments and larger-scale models, highlighting its broad applicability.

  Orthogonal finetuning (OFT) offers highly parameter-efficient adaptation while preventing catastrophic forgetting, but its high runtime and memory demands limit practical deployment. We identify the core computational bottleneck in OFT as its weight-centric implementation, which relies on costly matrix-matrix multiplications with cubic complexity. To overcome this, we propose OFTv2, an input-centric reformulation that instead uses matrix-vector multiplications (i.e., matrix-free computation), reducing the computational cost to quadratic. We further introduce the Cayley-Neumann parameterization, an efficient orthogonal parameterization that approximates the matrix inversion in the Cayley transform via a truncated Neumann series. These modifications allow OFTv2 to achieve up to 10x faster training and 3x lower GPU memory usage without compromising performance. In addition, we extend OFTv2 to support finetuning quantized foundation models and show that it outperforms the popular QLoRA in training stability, efficiency, and memory usage.

  Recent developed graph-based methods for diagnosing brain disorders using functional connectivity highly rely on predefined brain atlases, but overlook the rich information embedded within atlases and the confounding effects of site and phenotype variability. To address these challenges, we propose a two-stage Brain-to-Population Graph Learning (B2P-GL) framework that integrates the semantic similarity of brain regions and condition-based population graph modeling. In the first stage, termed brain representation learning, we leverage brain atlas knowledge from GPT-4 to enrich the graph representation and refine the brain graph through an adaptive node reassignment graph attention network. In the second stage, termed population disorder diagnosis, phenotypic data is incorporated into population graph construction and feature fusion to mitigate confounding effects and enhance diagnosis performance. Experiments on the ABIDE I, ADHD-200, and Rest-meta-MDD datasets show that B2P-GL outperforms state-of-the-art methods in prediction accuracy while enhancing interpretability. Overall, our proposed framework offers a reliable and personalized approach to brain disorder diagnosis, advancing clinical applicability.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit enhanced capabilities by Chain-of-Thought reasoning. However, the extended reasoning sequences introduce significant GPU memory overhead due to increased key-value (KV) cache. Existing KV cache compression methods mitigate memory bottlenecks but struggle in long reasoning tasks. In this paper, we analyze attention patterns in reasoning tasks and reveal a Token Importance Recurrence phenomenon: a large proportion of tokens regain high attention after multiple decoding steps, which is failed to capture by existing works and may lead to unpredictable eviction on such periodically critical tokens. To address this, we propose LazyEviction, an observation window-based lagged eviction framework retaining latent recurring tokens by prioritized eviction based on tokens' recurrence patterns. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LazyEviction reduces KV cache by 50%~70% while maintaining comparable accuracy, outperforming existing KV cache compression baselines.

  Human cognitive behavior arises from the interaction of specialized brain networks dedicated to distinct functions, such as language, logic, and social reasoning. Inspired by this organization, we propose Mixture of Cognitive Reasoners (MiCRo): a modular, transformer-based architecture post-trained with a curriculum that induces functional specialization across experts. Concretely, we partition the layers of a pretrained language model into four expert modules aligned with well-studied cognitive networks in the human brain. MiCRo offers three key advantages over standard language models. (1) The specialized experts are interpretable and causally meaningful -- ablating a module causes substantial drops on benchmarks requiring its specialized domain. (2) MiCRo's behavior can be dynamically steered at inference time by routing tokens to particular experts (e.g., favoring social over logical reasoning), enabling fine-grained control over outputs. (3) MiCRo outperforms or matches comparable baselines on both machine-learning reasoning benchmarks (e.g., GSM8K, BBH) and alignment to human behavior (CogBench), while maintaining interpretability. Taken together, cognitively grounded functional specialization yields models that are both more human-like and more human-interpretable.

  Time series data in real-world applications such as healthcare, climate modeling, and finance are often irregular, multimodal, and messy, with varying sampling rates, asynchronous modalities, and pervasive missingness. However, existing benchmarks typically assume clean, regularly sampled, unimodal data, creating a significant gap between research and real-world deployment. We introduce Time-IMM, a dataset specifically designed to capture cause-driven irregularity in multimodal multivariate time series. Time-IMM represents nine distinct types of time series irregularity, categorized into trigger-based, constraint-based, and artifact-based mechanisms. Complementing the dataset, we introduce IMM-TSF, a benchmark library for forecasting on irregular multimodal time series, enabling asynchronous integration and realistic evaluation. IMM-TSF includes specialized fusion modules, including a timestamp-to-text fusion module and a multimodality fusion module, which support both recency-aware averaging and attention-based integration strategies. Empirical results demonstrate that explicitly modeling multimodality on irregular time series data leads to substantial gains in forecasting performance. Time-IMM and IMM-TSF provide a foundation for advancing time series analysis under real-world conditions.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  While goal-conditioned behavior cloning (GCBC) methods can perform well on in-distribution training tasks, they do not necessarily generalize zero-shot to tasks that require conditioning on novel state-goal pairs, i.e. combinatorial generalization. In part, this limitation can be attributed to a lack of temporal consistency in the state representation learned by BC; if temporally correlated states are properly encoded to similar latent representations, then the out-of-distribution gap for novel state-goal pairs would be reduced. We formalize this notion by demonstrating how encouraging long-range temporal consistency via successor representations (SR) can facilitate generalization. We then propose a simple yet effective representation learning objective, $\text{BYOL-}\gamma$ for GCBC, which theoretically approximates the successor representation in the finite MDP case through self-predictive representations, and achieves competitive empirical performance across a suite of challenging tasks requiring combinatorial generalization.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms can find an optimal policy for a single agent to accomplish a particular task. However, many real-world problems require multiple agents to collaborate in order to achieve a common goal. For example, a robot executing a task in a warehouse may require the assistance of a drone to retrieve items from high shelves. In Decentralized Multi-Agent RL (DMARL), agents learn independently and then combine their policies at execution time, but often must satisfy constraints on compatibility of local policies to ensure that they can achieve the global task when combined. In this paper, we study how providing high-level symbolic knowledge to agents can help address unique challenges of this setting, such as privacy constraints, communication limitations, and performance concerns. In particular, we extend the formal tools used to check the compatibility of local policies with the team task, making decentralized training with theoretical guarantees usable in more scenarios. Furthermore, we empirically demonstrate that symbolic knowledge about the temporal evolution of events in the environment can significantly expedite the learning process in DMARL.

  Federated Learning (FL) enables privacy-preserving collaborative model training, but its effectiveness is often limited by client data heterogeneity. We introduce a client-selection algorithm that (i) dynamically forms nonoverlapping coalitions of clients based on asymptotic agreement and (ii) selects one representative from each coalition to minimize the variance of model updates. Our approach is inspired by social-network modeling, leveraging homophily-based proximity matrices for spectral clustering and techniques for identifying the most informative individuals to estimate a group's aggregate opinion. We provide theoretical convergence guarantees for the algorithm under mild, standard FL assumptions. Finally, we validate our approach by benchmarking it against three strong heterogeneity-aware baselines; the results show higher accuracy and faster convergence, indicating that the framework is both theoretically grounded and effective in practice.

  Although graph-based learning has attracted a lot of attention, graph representation learning is still a challenging task whose resolution may impact key application fields such as chemistry or biology. To this end, we introduce GRALE, a novel graph autoencoder that encodes and decodes graphs of varying sizes into a shared embedding space. GRALE is trained using an Optimal Transport-inspired loss that compares the original and reconstructed graphs and leverages a differentiable node matching module, which is trained jointly with the encoder and decoder. The proposed attention-based architecture relies on Evoformer, the core component of AlphaFold, which we extend to support both graph encoding and decoding. We show, in numerical experiments on simulated and molecular data, that GRALE enables a highly general form of pre-training, applicable to a wide range of downstream tasks, from classification and regression to more complex tasks such as graph interpolation, editing, matching, and prediction.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Diagnosis-Related Group (DRG) codes are essential for hospital reimbursement and operations but require labor-intensive assignment. Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle with DRG coding due to the out-of-distribution (OOD) nature of the task: pretraining corpora rarely contain private clinical or billing data. We introduce DRG-Sapphire, which uses large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) for automated DRG coding from clinical notes. Built on Qwen2.5-7B and trained with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) using rule-based rewards, DRG-Sapphire introduces a series of RL enhancements to address domain-specific challenges not seen in previous mathematical tasks. Our model achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on the MIMIC-IV benchmark and generates physician-validated reasoning for DRG assignments, significantly enhancing explainability. Our study further sheds light on broader challenges of applying RL to knowledge-intensive, OOD tasks. We observe that RL performance scales approximately linearly with the logarithm of the number of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) examples, suggesting that RL effectiveness is fundamentally constrained by the domain knowledge encoded in the base model. For OOD tasks like DRG coding, strong RL performance requires sufficient knowledge infusion prior to RL. Consequently, scaling SFT may be more effective and computationally efficient than scaling RL alone for such tasks.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Offline goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (GCRL) is a promising approach for pretraining generalist policies on large datasets of reward-free trajectories, akin to the self-supervised objectives used to train foundation models for computer vision and natural language processing. However, scaling GCRL to longer horizons remains challenging due to the combination of sparse rewards and discounting, which obscures the comparative advantages of primitive actions with respect to distant goals. Hierarchical RL methods achieve strong empirical results on long-horizon goal-reaching tasks, but their reliance on modular, timescale-specific policies and subgoal generation introduces significant additional complexity and hinders scaling to high-dimensional goal spaces. In this work, we introduce an algorithm to train a flat (non-hierarchical) goal-conditioned policy by bootstrapping on subgoal-conditioned policies with advantage-weighted importance sampling. Our approach eliminates the need for a generative model over the (sub)goal space, which we find is key for scaling to high-dimensional control in large state spaces. We further show that existing hierarchical and bootstrapping-based approaches correspond to specific design choices within our derivation. Across a comprehensive suite of state- and pixel-based locomotion and manipulation benchmarks, our method matches or surpasses state-of-the-art offline GCRL algorithms and scales to complex, long-horizon tasks where prior approaches fail.

  Large language models (LLMs) excel at complex tasks thanks to advances in their reasoning abilities. However, existing methods overlook the trade-off between reasoning effectiveness and efficiency, often encouraging unnecessarily long reasoning chains and wasting tokens. To address this, we propose Learning to Think (L2T), an information-theoretic reinforcement fine-tuning framework for LLMs to make the models achieve optimal reasoning with fewer tokens. Specifically, L2T treats each query-response interaction as a hierarchical session of multiple episodes and proposes a universal dense process reward, i.e., quantifies the episode-wise information gain in parameters, requiring no extra annotations or task-specific evaluators. We propose a method to quickly estimate this reward based on PAC-Bayes bounds and the Fisher information matrix. Theoretical analyses show that it significantly reduces computational complexity with high estimation accuracy. By immediately rewarding each episode's contribution and penalizing excessive updates, L2T optimizes the model via reinforcement learning to maximize the use of each episode and achieve effective updates. Empirical results on various reasoning benchmarks and base models demonstrate the advantage of L2T across different tasks, boosting both reasoning effectiveness and efficiency.

  The increasing number of satellites and orbital debris has made space congestion a critical issue, threatening satellite safety and sustainability. Challenges such as collision avoidance, station-keeping, and orbital maneuvering require advanced techniques to handle dynamic uncertainties and multi-agent interactions. Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise in this domain, enabling adaptive, autonomous policies for space operations; however, many existing RL frameworks rely on custom-built environments developed from scratch, which often use simplified models and require significant time to implement and validate the orbital dynamics, limiting their ability to fully capture real-world complexities. To address this, we introduce OrbitZoo, a versatile multi-agent RL environment built on a high-fidelity industry standard library, that enables realistic data generation, supports scenarios like collision avoidance and cooperative maneuvers, and ensures robust and accurate orbital dynamics. The environment is validated against a real satellite constellation, Starlink, achieving a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 0.16% compared to real-world data. This validation ensures reliability for generating high-fidelity simulations and enabling autonomous and independent satellite operations.

  Machine learning (ML) classification models are increasingly being used in a wide range of applications where it is important that predictions are accompanied by uncertainties, including in climate and earth observation, medical diagnosis and bioaerosol monitoring. The output of an ML classification model is a type of categorical variable known as a nominal property in the International Vocabulary of Metrology (VIM). However, concepts related to uncertainty evaluation for nominal properties are not defined in the VIM, nor is such evaluation addressed by the Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement (GUM). In this paper we propose a metrological conceptual uncertainty evaluation framework for nominal properties. This framework is based on probability mass functions and summary statistics thereof, and it is applicable to ML classification. We also illustrate its use in the context of two applications that exemplify the issues and have significant societal impact, namely, climate and earth observation and medical diagnosis. Our framework would enable an extension of the GUM to uncertainty for nominal properties, which would make both applicable to ML classification models.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Structural pruning enhances hardware-agnostic inference efficiency for large language models (LLMs) yet often fails to maintain comparable performance. Local pruning performs efficient layer-by-layer compression but ignores global topology. Although global pruning aims to identify an optimal sparse model, intuitive methods typically adopt a two-stage paradigm that first evaluates substructure saliency and then applies global pruning, which ignores inter-structure dependencies and fails to achieve end-to-end optimization. To address these limitations, we propose T√Ωr-the-Pruner, an efficient end-to-end search-based global structural pruning framework. This framework constructs a supernet by repeatedly applying local pruning across a range of sparsity ratios to each layer in an LLM, with the core goal of determining the optimal sparsity distribution under a target overall sparsity ratio. Concretely, we introduce an effective local pruning and an expectation error accumulation approach to improve supernet construction. Furthermore, we employ an iterative prune-and-search strategy with coarse-to-fine sparsity granularity to ensure efficient search convergence. Experimental results show that T√Ωr-the-Pruner achieves state-of-the-art structural pruning, retaining 97% of the dense model's performance while removing a challenging 50% of Llama-3.1-70B's parameters.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Language models famously improve under a smooth scaling law, but some specific capabilities exhibit sudden breakthroughs in performance. While advocates of "emergence" view breakthroughs as unlocked capabilities, others attribute them to thresholding effects on noncontinuous metrics. We propose that breakthroughs are instead driven by continuous changes in the probability distribution of training outcomes when performance is bimodally distributed across random seeds. In synthetic length generalization tasks, we show that different random seeds can produce either highly linear or emergent scaling trends. We reveal that sharp breakthroughs in metrics are produced by underlying continuous changes in their distribution across seeds. In a case study of inverse scaling, we show that even as the probability of a successful run declines, the average performance of a successful run increases monotonically. We validate our distributional scaling framework on realistic settings by measuring MMLU performance in LM populations. Our observations hold true even under continuous loss metrics, confirming that random variation must be considered when predicting a model's performance from its scale.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) suffer inference-time memory bottlenecks dominated by the attention Key-Value (KV) cache, which scales with model size and context length. While KV-cache quantization alleviates this cost, bit allocation between keys and values is often tuned heuristically, lacking theoretical grounding and generalizability. This paper proposes two theorems that anchor mixed-precision KV quantization in the intrinsic geometry of Transformer models. First, key projections systematically have larger spectral and Frobenius norms than value matrices, implying higher information density along the key path. Second, for any given memory budget, prioritizing precision for keys over values strictly reduces quantization error and better preserves accuracy. Empirical evaluations across various prominent LLMs and benchmarks show that key-favored allocations (e.g., 4-bit keys, 2-bit values) retain up to 98.3\% accuracy compared to uniform allocations (e.g., 4-bit for both), while conserving memory. These results transform bit allocation from ad hoc tuning into a theoretically grounded, geometry-driven design principle for efficient LLM inference. Source code is available atthis https URL.

  What computational structures emerge in transformers trained on next-token prediction? In this work, we provide evidence that transformers implement constrained Bayesian belief updating -- a parallelized version of partial Bayesian inference shaped by architectural constraints. We integrate the model-agnostic theory of optimal prediction with mechanistic interpretability to analyze transformers trained on a tractable family of hidden Markov models that generate rich geometric patterns in neural activations. Our primary analysis focuses on single-layer transformers, revealing how the first attention layer implements these constrained updates, with extensions to multi-layer architectures demonstrating how subsequent layers refine these representations. We find that attention carries out an algorithm with a natural interpretation in the probability simplex, and create representations with distinctive geometric structure. We show how both the algorithmic behavior and the underlying geometry of these representations can be theoretically predicted in detail -- including the attention pattern, OV-vectors, and embedding vectors -- by modifying the equations for optimal future token predictions to account for the architectural constraints of attention. Our approach provides a principled lens on how architectural constraints shape the implementation of optimal prediction, revealing why transformers develop specific intermediate geometric structures.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Rule-based explanation methods offer rigorous and globally interpretable insights into neural network behavior. However, existing approaches are mostly limited to small fully connected networks and depend on costly layerwise rule extraction and substitution processes. These limitations hinder their generalization to more complex architectures such as Transformers. Moreover, existing methods produce shallow, decision-tree-like rules that fail to capture rich, high-level abstractions in complex domains like computer vision and natural language processing. To address these challenges, we propose NEUROLOGIC, a novel framework that extracts interpretable logical rules directly from deep neural networks. Unlike previous methods, NEUROLOGIC can construct logic rules over hidden predicates derived from neural representations at any chosen layer, in contrast to costly layerwise extraction and rewriting. This flexibility enables broader architectural compatibility and improved scalability. Furthermore, NEUROLOGIC supports richer logical constructs and can incorporate human prior knowledge to ground hidden predicates back to the input space, enhancing interpretability. We validate NEUROLOGIC on Transformer-based sentiment analysis, demonstrating its ability to extract meaningful, interpretable logic rules and provide deeper insights-tasks where existing methods struggle to scale.

  Understanding the world and explaining it with scientific theories is a central aspiration of artificial intelligence research. Proposing theories, designing experiments to test them, and then revising them based on data are fundamental to scientific discovery. Despite the significant promise of LLM-based scientific agents, no benchmarks systematically test LLM's ability to propose scientific models, collect experimental data, and revise them in light of new data. We introduce BoxingGym, a benchmark with 10 environments for systematically evaluating both experimental design (e.g. collecting data to test a scientific theory) and model discovery (e.g. proposing and revising scientific theories). To enable tractable and quantitative evaluation, we implement each environment as a generative probabilistic model with which a scientific agent can run interactive experiments. These probabilistic models are drawn from various real-world scientific domains ranging from psychology to ecology. To quantitatively evaluate a scientific agent's ability to collect informative experimental data, we compute the expected information gain (EIG), an information-theoretic quantity which measures how much an experiment reduces uncertainty about the parameters of a generative model. A good scientific theory is a concise and predictive explanation. Therefore, to quantitatively evaluate model discovery, we ask a scientific agent to explain their model and then assess whether this explanation enables another scientific agent to make reliable predictions about this environment. In addition to this explanation-based evaluation, we compute standard model evaluation metrics such as prediction errors. We find that current LLMs, such as GPT-4o, struggle with both experimental design and model discovery. We find that augmenting the LLM-based agent with an explicit statistical model does not reliably improve these results.

  _Jiacheng Cen, Anyi Li, Ning Lin, Yuxiang Ren, Zihe Wang, Wenbing Huang_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Equivariant Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) that incorporate E(3) symmetry have achieved significant success in various scientific applications. As one of the most successful models, EGNN leverages a simple scalarization technique to perform equivariant message passing over only Cartesian vectors (i.e., 1st-degree steerable vectors), enjoying greater efficiency and efficacy compared to equivariant GNNs using higher-degree steerable vectors. This success suggests that higher-degree representations might be unnecessary. In this paper, we disprove this hypothesis by exploring the expressivity of equivariant GNNs on symmetric structures, including $k$-fold rotations and regular polyhedra. We theoretically demonstrate that equivariant GNNs will always degenerate to a zero function if the degree of the output representations is fixed to 1 or other specific values. Based on this theoretical insight, we propose HEGNN, a high-degree version of EGNN to increase the expressivity by incorporating high-degree steerable vectors while maintaining EGNN's efficiency through the scalarization trick. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that HEGNN not only aligns with our theoretical analyses on toy datasets consisting of symmetric structures, but also shows substantial improvements on more complicated datasets such as $N$-body and MD17. Our theoretical findings and empirical results potentially open up new possibilities for the research of equivariant GNNs.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Machine Learning models in real-world applications must continuously learn new tasks to adapt to shifts in the data-generating distribution. Yet, for Continual Learning (CL), models often struggle to balance learning new tasks (plasticity) with retaining previous knowledge (memory stability). Consequently, they are susceptible to Catastrophic Forgetting, which degrades performance and undermines the reliability of deployed systems. In the Bayesian CL literature, variational methods tackle this challenge by employing a learning objective that recursively updates the posterior distribution while constraining it to stay close to its previous estimate. Nonetheless, we argue that these methods may be ineffective due to compounding approximation errors over successive recursions. To mitigate this, we propose new learning objectives that integrate the regularization effects of multiple previous posterior estimations, preventing individual errors from dominating future posterior updates and compounding over time. We reveal insightful connections between these objectives and Temporal-Difference methods, a popular learning mechanism in Reinforcement Learning and Neuroscience. Experiments on challenging CL benchmarks show that our approach effectively mitigates Catastrophic Forgetting, outperforming strong Variational CL methods.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities but often struggle to align with human preferences, leading to harmful or undesirable outputs. Preference learning, which trains models to distinguish between preferred and non-preferred responses based on human feedback, has become a crucial component for ensuring that LLMs align with human values. An essential part of ensuring that LLMs are aligned for all people is accounting for a diverse set of values. This paper introduces a new theoretical framework to analyze how generalization scales with value diversity and sample quantity in models trained with direct preference optimization. Our framework rigorously assesses how well models generalize after a finite number of gradient steps, reflecting real-world LLM training practices. By analyzing the reward margin associated with each sample and its trajectory throughout training, we provide a bound on the generalization error that demonstrates the challenges of effectively learning a wide set of concepts or values. These insights are empirically validated on contemporary LLMs, underscoring the practical relevance of our theory.

  Data augmentation is a series of techniques that generate high-quality artificial data by manipulating existing data samples. By leveraging data augmentation techniques, AI models can achieve significantly improved applicability in tasks involving scarce or imbalanced datasets, thereby substantially enhancing AI models' generalization capabilities. Existing literature surveys only focus on a certain type of specific modality data and categorize these methods from modality-specific and operation-centric perspectives, which lacks a consistent summary of data augmentation methods across multiple modalities and limits the comprehension of how existing data samples serve the data augmentation process. To bridge this gap, this survey proposes a more enlightening taxonomy that encompasses data augmentation techniques for different common data modalities by investigating how to take advantage of the intrinsic relationship between and within instances. Additionally, it categorizes data augmentation methods across five data modalities through a unified inductive approach.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Learning effective reinforcement learning (RL) policies to solve real-world complex tasks can be quite challenging without a high-fidelity simulation environment. In most cases, we are only given imperfect simulators with simplified dynamics, which inevitably lead to severe sim-to-real gaps in RL policy learning. The recently emerged field of offline RL provides another possibility to learn policies directly from pre-collected historical data. However, to achieve reasonable performance, existing offline RL algorithms need impractically large offline data with sufficient state-action space coverage for training. This brings up a new question: is it possible to combine learning from limited real data in offline RL and unrestricted exploration through imperfect simulators in online RL to address the drawbacks of both approaches? In this study, we propose the Dynamics-Aware Hybrid Offline-and-Online Reinforcement Learning (H2O) framework to provide an affirmative answer to this question. H2O introduces a dynamics-aware policy evaluation scheme, which adaptively penalizes the Q function learning on simulated state-action pairs with large dynamics gaps, while also simultaneously allowing learning from a fixed real-world dataset. Through extensive simulation and real-world tasks, as well as theoretical analysis, we demonstrate the superior performance of H2O against other cross-domain online and offline RL algorithms. H2O provides a brand new hybrid offline-and-online RL paradigm, which can potentially shed light on future RL algorithm design for solving practical real-world tasks.

  _Shota Takayama, Katsuhide Fujita_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multi-agent reinforcement learning focuses on training the behaviors of multiple learning agents that coexist in a shared environment. Recently, MARL models, such as the Multi-Agent Transformer (MAT) and ACtion dEpendent deep Q-learning (ACE), have significantly improved performance by leveraging sequential decision-making processes. Although these models can enhance performance, they do not explicitly consider the importance of the order in which agents make decisions. In this paper, we propose an Agent Order of Action Decisions-MAT (AOAD-MAT), a novel MAT model that considers the order in which agents make decisions. The proposed model explicitly incorporates the sequence of action decisions into the learning process, allowing the model to learn and predict the optimal order of agent actions. The AOAD-MAT model leverages a Transformer-based actor-critic architecture that dynamically adjusts the sequence of agent actions. To achieve this, we introduce a novel MARL architecture that cooperates with a subtask focused on predicting the next agent to act, integrated into a Proximal Policy Optimization based loss function to synergistically maximize the advantage of the sequential decision-making. The proposed method was validated through extensive experiments on the StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge and Multi-Agent MuJoCo benchmarks. The experimental results show that the proposed AOAD-MAT model outperforms existing MAT and other baseline models, demonstrating the effectiveness of adjusting the AOAD order in MARL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) show potential for complex reasoning, yet their capacity for emergent coordination in Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) when operating under strict swarm-like constraints-limited local perception and communication-remains largely unexplored. Existing benchmarks often do not fully capture the unique challenges of decentralized coordination when agents operate with incomplete spatio-temporal information. To bridge this gap, we introduce SwarmBench, a novel benchmark designed to systematically evaluate the swarm intelligence capabilities of LLMs acting as decentralized agents. SwarmBench features five foundational MAS coordination tasks (Pursuit, Synchronization, Foraging, Flocking, Transport) within a configurable 2D grid environment, forcing agents to rely solely on local sensory input ($k\times k$ view) and local communication. We propose metrics for coordination effectiveness and analyze emergent group dynamics. Zero-shot evaluations of leading LLMs (e.g., deepseek-v3, o4-mini) reveal significant task-dependent performance variations. While some rudimentary coordination is observed, our results indicate that current LLMs significantly struggle with robust long-range planning and adaptive strategy formation under the uncertainty inherent in these decentralized scenarios. Assessing LLMs under such swarm-like constraints is crucial for understanding their utility in future decentralized intelligent systems. We release SwarmBench as an open, extensible toolkit-built on a customizable physical system-providing environments, prompts, evaluation scripts, and comprehensive datasets. This aims to foster reproducible research into LLM-based MAS coordination and the theoretical underpinnings of emergent collective behavior under severe informational decentralization.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Foraging for resources is a ubiquitous activity conducted by living organisms in a shared environment to maintain their homeostasis. Modelling multi-agent foraging in-silico allows us to study both individual and collective emergent behaviour in a tractable manner. Agent-based modelling has proven to be effective in simulating such tasks, though scaling the simulations to accommodate large numbers of agents with complex dynamics remains challenging. In this work, we present Foragax, a general-purpose, scalable, hardware-accelerated, multi-agent foraging toolkit. Leveraging the JAX library, our toolkit can simulate thousands of agents foraging in a common environment, in an end-to-end vectorized and differentiable manner. The toolkit provides agent-based modelling tools to model various foraging tasks, including options to design custom spatial and temporal agent dynamics, control policies, sensor models, and boundary conditions. Further, the number of agents during such simulations can be increased or decreased based on custom rules. While applied to foraging, the toolkit can also be used to model and simulate a wide range of other multi-agent scenarios.

  _Xinyi Chen, Yilun Chen, Yanwei Fu, Ning Gao, Jiaya Jia, Weiyang Jin, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce InternVLA-M1, a unified framework for spatial grounding and robot control that advances instruction-following robots toward scalable, general-purpose intelligence. Its core idea is spatially guided vision-language-action training, where spatial grounding serves as the critical link between instructions and robot actions. InternVLA-M1 employs a two-stage pipeline: (i) spatial grounding pre-training on over 2.3M spatial reasoning data to determine ``where to act'' by aligning instructions with visual, embodiment-agnostic positions, and (ii) spatially guided action post-training to decide ``how to act'' by generating embodiment-aware actions through plug-and-play spatial prompting. This spatially guided training recipe yields consistent gains: InternVLA-M1 outperforms its variant without spatial guidance by +14.6% on SimplerEnv Google Robot, +17% on WidowX, and +4.3% on LIBERO Franka, while demonstrating stronger spatial reasoning capability in box, point, and trace prediction. To further scale instruction following, we built a simulation engine to collect 244K generalizable pick-and-place episodes, enabling a 6.2% average improvement across 200 tasks and 3K+ objects. In real-world clustered pick-and-place, InternVLA-M1 improved by 7.3%, and with synthetic co-training, achieved +20.6% on unseen objects and novel configurations. Moreover, in long-horizon reasoning-intensive scenarios, it surpassed existing works by over 10%. These results highlight spatially guided training as a unifying principle for scalable and resilient generalist robots. Code and models are available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Although digital fabrication processes at the desktop scale have become proficient and prolific, systems aimed at producing larger-scale structures are still typically complex, expensive, and unreliable. In this work, we present an approach for the fabrication of scalable macroscale structures using simple robots and interlocking lattice building blocks. A target structure is first voxelized so that it can be populated with an architected lattice. These voxels are then grouped into larger interconnected blocks, which are produced using standard digital fabrication processes, leveraging their capability to produce highly complex geometries at a small scale. These blocks, on the size scale of tens of centimeters, are then fed to mobile relative robots that are able to traverse over the structure and place new blocks to form structures on the meter scale. To facilitate the assembly of large structures, we introduce a live digital twin simulation tool for controlling and coordinating assembly robots that enables both global planning for a target structure and live user design, interaction, or intervention. To improve assembly throughput, we introduce a new modular assembly robot, designed for hierarchical voxel handling. We validate this system by demonstrating the voxelization, hierarchical blocking, path planning, and robotic fabrication of a set of meter-scale objects.

  Drone technology is proliferating in many industries, including agriculture, logistics, defense, infrastructure, and environmental monitoring. Vision-based autonomy is one of its key enablers, particularly for real-world applications. This is essential for operating in novel, unstructured environments where traditional navigation methods may be unavailable. Autonomous drone racing has become the de facto benchmark for such systems. State-of-the-art research has shown that autonomous systems can surpass human-level performance in racing arenas. However, direct applicability to commercial and field operations is still limited as current systems are often trained and evaluated in highly controlled environments. In our contribution, the system's capabilities are analyzed within a controlled environment -- where external tracking is available for ground-truth comparison -- but also demonstrated in a challenging, uninstrumented environment -- where ground-truth measurements were never available. We show that our approach can match the performance of professional human pilots in both scenarios. We also publicly release the data from the flights carried out by our approach and a world-class human pilot.

  Visual-Language-Action (VLA) models report impressive success rates on robotic manipulation benchmarks, yet these results may mask fundamental weaknesses in robustness. We perform a systematic vulnerability analysis by introducing controlled perturbations across seven dimensions: objects layout, camera viewpoints, robot initial states, language instructions, light conditions, background textures and sensor noise. We comprehensively analyzed multiple state-of-the-art models and revealed consistent brittleness beneath apparent competence. Our analysis exposes critical weaknesses: models exhibit extreme sensitivity to perturbation factors, including camera viewpoints and robot initial states, with performance dropping from 95% to below 30% under modest perturbations. Surprisingly, models are largely insensitive to language variations, with further experiments revealing that models tend to ignore language instructions completely. Our findings challenge the assumption that high benchmark scores equate to true competency and highlight the need for evaluation practices that assess reliability under realistic variation.

The vector field plot reveals patterns that would be difficult for the analyst to extract from raw point-cloud data. After introducing our methodology, we apply the process to two proof-of-concept examples: one a simulation study and the other a field experiment. For both data sets, a human analyst was able to reason about a series of adversity mechanisms and iteratively remove those mechanisms from the raw data, to help focus attention on progressively smaller discrepancies.

  Building an online 3D LiDAR mapping system that produces a detailed surface reconstruction while remaining computationally efficient is a challenging task. In this paper, we present PlanarMesh, a novel incremental, mesh-based LiDAR reconstruction system that adaptively adjusts mesh resolution to achieve compact, detailed reconstructions in real-time. It introduces a new representation, planar-mesh, which combines plane modeling and meshing to capture both large surfaces and detailed geometry. The planar-mesh can be incrementally updated considering both local surface curvature and free-space information from sensor measurements. We employ a multi-threaded architecture with a Bounding Volume Hierarchy (BVH) for efficient data storage and fast search operations, enabling real-time performance. Experimental results show that our method achieves reconstruction accuracy on par with, or exceeding, state-of-the-art techniques-including truncated signed distance functions, occupancy mapping, and voxel-based meshing-while producing smaller output file sizes (10 times smaller than raw input and more than 5 times smaller than mesh-based methods) and maintaining real-time performance (around 2 Hz for a 64-beam sensor).

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  General robot manipulation requires the handling of previously unseen objects. Learning a physically accurate model at test time can provide significant benefits in data efficiency, predictability, and reuse between tasks. Tactile sensing can compliment vision with its robustness to occlusion, but its temporal sparsity necessitates careful online exploration to maintain data efficiency. Direct contact can also cause an unrestrained object to move, requiring both shape and location estimation. In this work, we propose a learning and exploration framework that uses only tactile data to simultaneously determine the shape and location of rigid objects with minimal robot motion. We build on recent advances in contact-rich system identification to formulate a loss function that penalizes physical constraint violation without introducing the numerical stiffness inherent in rigid-body contact. Optimizing this loss, we can learn cuboid and convex polyhedral geometries with less than 10s of randomly collected data after first contact. Our exploration scheme seeks to maximize Expected Information Gain and results in significantly faster learning in both simulated and real-robot experiments.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper presents the Hoecken-D Hand, an underactuated robotic gripper that combines a modified Hoecken linkage with a differential spring mechanism to achieve both linear parallel pinching and a mid-stroke transition to adaptive envelope. The original Hoecken linkage is reconfigured by replacing one member with differential links, preserving straight-line guidance while enabling contact-triggered reconfiguration without additional actuators. A double-parallelogram arrangement maintains fingertip parallelism during conventional pinching, whereas the differential mechanism allows one finger to wrap inward upon encountering an obstacle, improving stability on irregular or thin objects. The mechanism can be driven by a single linear actuator, minimizing complexity and cost; in our prototype, each finger is driven by its own linear actuator for simplicity. We perform kinematic modeling and force analysis to characterize grasp performance, including simulated grasping forces and spring-opening behavior under varying geometric parameters. The design was prototyped using PLA-based 3D printing, achieving a linear pinching span of approximately 200 mm. Preliminary tests demonstrate reliable grasping in both modes across a wide range of object geometries, highlighting the Hoecken-D Hand as a compact, adaptable, and cost-effective solution for manipulation in unstructured environments.

  This paper presents a novel underactuated adaptive robotic hand, Hockens-A Hand, which integrates the Hoeckens mechanism, a double-parallelogram linkage, and a specialized four-bar linkage to achieve three adaptive grasping modes: parallel pinching, asymmetric scooping, and enveloping grasping. Hockens-A Hand requires only a single linear actuator, leveraging passive mechanical intelligence to ensure adaptability and compliance in unstructured environments. Specifically, the vertical motion of the Hoeckens mechanism introduces compliance, the double-parallelogram linkage ensures line contact at the fingertip, and the four-bar amplification system enables natural transitions between different grasping modes. Additionally, the inclusion of a mesh-textured silicone phalanx further enhances the ability to envelop objects of various shapes and sizes. This study employs detailed kinematic analysis to optimize the push angle and design the linkage lengths for optimal performance. Simulations validated the design by analyzing the fingertip motion and ensuring smooth transitions between grasping modes. Furthermore, the grasping force was analyzed using power equations to enhance the understanding of the system'sthis http URLvalidation using a 3D-printed prototype demonstrates the three grasping modes of the hand in various scenarios under environmental constraints, verifying its grasping stability and broad applicability.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Legged robots, particularly quadrupeds, excel at navigating rough terrains, yet their performance under vertical ground perturbations, such as those from oscillating surfaces, remains underexplored. This study introduces a novel approach to enhance quadruped locomotion robustness by training the Unitree Go2 robot on an oscillating bridge - a 13.24-meter steel-and-concrete structure with a 2.0 Hz eigenfrequency designed to perturb locomotion. Using Reinforcement Learning (RL) with the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm in a MuJoCo simulation, we trained 15 distinct locomotion policies, combining five gaits (trot, pace, bound, free, default) with three training conditions: rigid bridge and two oscillating bridge setups with differing height regulation strategies (relative to bridge surface or ground). Domain randomization ensured zero-shot transfer to the real-world bridge. Our results demonstrate that policies trained on the oscillating bridge exhibit superior stability and adaptability compared to those trained on rigid surfaces. Our framework enables robust gait patterns even without prior bridge exposure. These findings highlight the potential of simulation-based RL to improve quadruped locomotion during dynamic ground perturbations, offering insights for designing robots capable of traversing vibrating environments.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Electromyography (EMG) signals are widely used for predicting body joint angles through machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) methods. However, these approaches often face challenges such as limited real-time applicability, non-representative test conditions, and the need for large datasets to achieve optimal performance. This paper presents a transfer-learning framework for knee joint angle prediction that requires only a few gait cycles from new subjects. Three datasets - Georgia Tech, the University of California Irvine (UCI), and the Sharif Mechatronic Lab Exoskeleton (SMLE) - containing four EMG channels relevant to knee motion were utilized. A lightweight attention-based CNN-LSTM model was developed and pre-trained on the Georgia Tech dataset, then transferred to the UCI and SMLE datasets. The proposed model achieved Normalized Mean Absolute Errors (NMAE) of 6.8 percent and 13.7 percent for one-step and 50-step predictions on abnormal subjects using EMG inputs alone. Incorporating historical knee angles reduced the NMAE to 3.1 percent and 3.5 percent for normal subjects, and to 2.8 percent and 7.5 percent for abnormal subjects. When further adapted to the SMLE exoskeleton with EMG, kinematic, and interaction force inputs, the model achieved 1.09 percent and 3.1 percent NMAE for one- and 50-step predictions, respectively. These results demonstrate robust performance and strong generalization for both short- and long-term rehabilitation scenarios.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Offline reinforcement learning enables sample-efficient policy acquisition without risky online interaction, yet policies trained on static datasets remain brittle under action-space perturbations such as actuator faults. This study introduces an offline-to-online framework that trains policies on clean data and then performs adversarial fine-tuning, where perturbations are injected into executed actions to induce compensatory behavior and improve resilience. A performance-aware curriculum further adjusts the perturbation probability during training via an exponential-moving-average signal, balancing robustness and stability throughout the learning process. Experiments on continuous-control locomotion tasks demonstrate that the proposed method consistently improves robustness over offline-only baselines and converges faster than training from scratch. Matching the fine-tuning and evaluation conditions yields the strongest robustness to action-space perturbations, while the adaptive curriculum strategy mitigates the degradation of nominal performance observed with the linear curriculum strategy. Overall, the results show that adversarial fine-tuning enables adaptive and robust control under uncertain environments, bridging the gap between offline efficiency and online adaptability.

  Modular Self-Reconfigurable Robot (MSRR) systems are a class of robots capable of forming higher-level robotic systems by altering the topological relationships between modules, offering enhanced adaptability and robustness in various environments. This paper presents a novel MSRR called MODUR, featuring dual-level reconfiguration capabilities designed to integrate reconfigurable mechanisms into MSRR. Specifically, MODUR can perform high-level self-reconfiguration among modules to create different configurations, while each module is also able to change its shape to execute basic motions. The design of MODUR primarily includes a compact connector and scissor linkage groups that provide actuation, forming a parallel mechanism capable of achieving both connector motion decoupling and adjacent position migration capabilities. Furthermore, the workspace, considering the interdependent connectors, is comprehensively analyzed, laying a theoretical foundation for the design of the module's basic motion. Finally, the motion of MODUR is validated through a series of experiments.

  Contact-rich manipulation depends on applying the correct grasp forces throughout the manipulation task, especially when handling fragile or deformable objects. Most existing imitation learning approaches often treat visuotactile feedback only as an additional observation, leaving applied forces as an uncontrolled consequence of gripper commands. In this work, we present Force-Aware Robotic Manipulation (FARM), an imitation learning framework that integrates high-dimensional tactile data to infer tactile-conditioned force signals, which in turn define a matching force-based action space. We collect human demonstrations using a modified version of the handheld Universal Manipulation Interface (UMI) gripper that integrates a GelSight Mini visual tactile sensor. For deploying the learned policies, we developed an actuated variant of the UMI gripper with geometry matching our handheld version. During policy rollouts, the proposed FARM diffusion policy jointly predicts robot pose, grip width, and grip force. FARM outperforms several baselines across three tasks with distinct force requirements -- high-force, low-force, and dynamic force adaptation -- demonstrating the advantages of its two key components: leveraging force-grounded, high-dimensional tactile observations and a force-based control space.

  LiDAR Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) systems are essential for enabling precise navigation and environmental reconstruction across various applications. Although current point-to-plane ICP algorithms perform effec- tively in structured, feature-rich environments, they struggle in scenarios with sparse features, repetitive geometric structures, and high-frequency motion. This leads to degeneracy in 6- DOF pose estimation. Most state-of-the-art algorithms address these challenges by incorporating additional sensing modalities, but LiDAR-only solutions continue to face limitations under such conditions. To address these issues, we propose a novel Degeneracy-Aware Multi-Metric LiDAR Odometry and Map- ping (DAMM-LOAM) module. Our system improves mapping accuracy through point cloud classification based on surface normals and neighborhood analysis. Points are classified into ground, walls, roof, edges, and non-planar points, enabling accurate correspondences. A Degeneracy-based weighted least squares-based ICP algorithm is then applied for accurate odom- etry estimation. Additionally, a Scan Context based back-end is implemented to support robust loop closures. DAMM-LOAM demonstrates significant improvements in odometry accuracy, especially in indoor environments such as long corridors

  Enabling robots to flexibly schedule and compose learned skills for novel long-horizon manipulation under diverse perturbations remains a core challenge. Early explorations with end-to-end VLA models show limited success, as these models struggle to generalize beyond the training distribution. Hierarchical approaches, where high-level planners generate subgoals for low-level policies, bring certain improvements but still suffer under complex perturbations, revealing limited capability in skill composition. However, existing benchmarks primarily emphasize task completion in long-horizon settings, offering little insight into compositional generalization, robustness, and the interplay between planning and execution. To systematically investigate these gaps, we propose RoboHiMan, a hierarchical evaluation paradigm for compositional generalization in long-horizon manipulation. RoboHiMan introduces HiMan-Bench, a benchmark of atomic and compositional tasks under diverse perturbations, supported by a multi-level training dataset for analyzing progressive data scaling, and proposes three evaluation paradigms (vanilla, decoupled, coupled) that probe the necessity of skill composition and reveal bottlenecks in hierarchical architectures. Experiments highlight clear capability gaps across representative models and architectures, pointing to directions for advancing models better suited to real-world long-horizon manipulation tasks.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) hold immense promise for enabling generalist robot manipulation. However, the best way to build them remains an open question. Current approaches often add complexity, such as modifying the existing vocabulary of a Vision-Language Model (VLM) with action tokens or introducing special action heads. Curiously, the simplest strategy of representing actions directly as text has remained largely unexplored. This work introduces VLA-0 to investigate this idea. We find that VLA-0 is not only effective; it is surprisingly powerful. With the right design, VLA-0 outperforms more involved models. On LIBERO, a popular benchmark for evaluating VLAs, VLA-0 outperforms all existing methods trained on the same robotic data, including $\pi_0.5$-KI, OpenVLA-OFT and SmolVLA. Furthermore, without large-scale robotics-specific training, it outperforms methods trained on large-scale robotic data, like $\pi_0.5$-KI, $\pi_0$, GR00T-N1 and MolmoAct. These findings also translate to the real world, where VLA-0 outperforms SmolVLA, a VLA model pre-trained on large-scale real data. This paper summarizes our unexpected findings and spells out the specific techniques required to unlock the high performance of this simple yet potent VLA design.

  In-Space Servicing, Assembly, and Manufacturing (ISAM) is a set of emerging operations that provides several benefits to improve the longevity, capacity, mo- bility, and expandability of existing and future space assets. Serial robotic ma- nipulators are particularly vital in accomplishing ISAM operations, however, the complex perturbation forces and motions associated with movement of a robotic arm on a free-flying satellite presents a complex controls problem requiring addi- tional study. While many dynamical models are developed, experimentally test- ing and validating these models is challenging given that the models operate in space, where satellites have six-degrees-of-freedom (6-DOF). This paper attempts to resolve those challenges by presenting the design and development of a new hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) experimental testbed utilized to emulate ISAM. This emulation will be accomplished by means of a 6-DOF UR3e robotic arm attached to a satellite bus. This satellite bus is mounted to a 1-DOF guide-rail system, en- abling the satellite bus and robotic arm to move freely in one linear direction. This experimental ISAM emulation system will explore and validate models for space motion, serial robot manipulation, and contact mechanics.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Safe large-scale coordination of multiple cooperative connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) hinges on communication that is both efficient and interpretable. Existing approaches either rely on transmitting high-bandwidth raw sensor data streams or neglect perception and planning uncertainties inherent in shared data, resulting in systems that are neither scalable nor safe. To address these limitations, we propose Uncertainty-Guided Natural Language Cooperative Autonomous Planning (UNCAP), a vision-language model-based planning approach that enables CAVs to communicate via lightweight natural language messages while explicitly accounting for perception uncertainty in decision-making. UNCAP features a two-stage communication protocol: (i) an ego CAV first identifies the subset of vehicles most relevant for information exchange, and (ii) the selected CAVs then transmit messages that quantitatively express their perception uncertainty. By selectively fusing messages that maximize mutual information, this strategy allows the ego vehicle to integrate only the most relevant signals into its decision-making, improving both the scalability and reliability of cooperative planning. Experiments across diverse driving scenarios show a 63% reduction in communication bandwidth with a 31% increase in driving safety score, a 61% reduction in decision uncertainty, and a four-fold increase in collision distance margin during near-miss events.

  We present Actron3D, a framework that enables robots to acquire transferable 6-DoF manipulation skills from just a few monocular, uncalibrated, RGB-only human videos. At its core lies the Neural Affordance Function, a compact object-centric representation that distills actionable cues from diverse uncalibrated videos-geometry, visual appearance, and affordance-into a lightweight neural network, forming a memory bank of manipulation skills. During deployment, we adopt a pipeline that retrieves relevant affordance functions and transfers precise 6-DoF manipulation policies via coarse-to-fine optimization, enabled by continuous queries to the multimodal features encoded in the neural functions. Experiments in both simulation and the real world demonstrate that Actron3D significantly outperforms prior methods, achieving a 14.9 percentage point improvement in average success rate across 13 tasks while requiring only 2-3 demonstration videos per task.

  Elongate limbless robots have the potential to locomote through tightly packed spaces for applications such as search-and-rescue and industrial inspections. The capability to effectively and robustly maneuver elongate limbless robots is crucial to realize such potential. However, there has been limited research on turning strategies for such systems. To achieve effective and robust turning performance in cluttered spaces, we take inspiration from a microscopic nematode, C. elegans, which exhibits remarkable maneuverability in rheologically complex environments partially because of its ability to perform omega turns. Despite recent efforts to analyze omega turn kinematics, it remains unknown if there exists a wave equation sufficient to prescribe an omega turn, let alone its reconstruction on robot platforms. Here, using a comparative theory-biology approach, we prescribe the omega turn as a superposition of two traveling waves. With wave equations as a guideline, we design a controller for limbless robots enabling robust and effective turning behaviors in lab and cluttered field environments. Finally, we show that such omega turn controllers can also generalize to elongate multi-legged robots, demonstrating an alternative effective body-driven turning strategy for elongate robots, with and without limbs.

  Path planning for 3D solid objects is a challenging problem, requiring a search in a six-dimensional configuration space, which is, nevertheless, essential in many robotic applications such as bin-picking and assembly. The commonly used sampling-based planners, such as Rapidly-exploring Random Trees, struggle with narrow passages where the sampling probability is low, increasing the time needed to find a solution. In scenarios like robotic bin-picking, various objects must be transported through the same environment. However, traditional planners start from scratch each time, losing valuable information gained during the planning process. We address this by using a library of past solutions, allowing the reuse of previous experiences even when planning for a new, previously unseen object. Paths for a set of objects are stored, and when planning for a new object, we find the most similar one in the library and use its paths as approximate solutions, adjusting for possible mutual transformations. The configuration space is then sampled along the approximate paths. Our method is tested in various narrow passage scenarios and compared with state-of-the-art methods from the OMPL library. Results show significant speed improvements (up to 85% decrease in the required time) of our method, often finding a solution in cases where the other planners fail. Our implementation of the proposed method is released as an open-source package.

  In this letter, we introduce Geometric Model Predictive Path Integral (GMPPI), a sampling-based controller capable of tracking agile trajectories while avoiding obstacles. In each iteration, GMPPI generates a large number of candidate rollout trajectories and then averages them to create a nominal control to be followed by the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). We propose using geometric SE(3) control to generate part of the rollout trajectories, significantly increasing precision in agile flight. Furthermore, we introduce varying rollout simulation time step length and dynamic cost and noise parameters, vastly improving tracking performance of smooth and low-speed trajectories over an existing Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) implementation. Finally, we propose an integration of GMPPI with a stereo depth camera, enabling online obstacle avoidance at high speeds, a crucial step towards autonomous UAV flights in complex environments. The proposed controller can track simulated agile reference trajectories with position error similar to the geometric SE(3) controller. However, the same configuration of the proposed controller can avoid obstacles in a simulated forest environment at speeds of up to 13m/s, surpassing the performance of a state-of-the-art obstacle-aware planner. In real-world experiments, GMPPI retains the capability to track agile trajectories and avoids obstacles at speeds of up to 10m/s.

  Robotic manipulation policies often struggle to generalize to novel objects, limiting their real-world utility. In contrast, cognitive science suggests that children develop generalizable dexterous manipulation skills by mastering a small set of simple toys and then applying that knowledge to more complex items. Inspired by this, we study if similar generalization capabilities can also be achieved by robots. Our results indicate robots can learn generalizable grasping using randomly assembled objects that are composed from just four shape primitives: spheres, cuboids, cylinders, and rings. We show that training on these "toys" enables robust generalization to real-world objects, yielding strong zero-shot performance. Crucially, we find the key to this generalization is an object-centric visual representation induced by our proposed detection pooling mechanism. Evaluated in both simulation and on physical robots, our model achieves a 67% real-world grasping success rate on the YCB dataset, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches that rely on substantially more in-domain data. We further study how zero-shot generalization performance scales by varying the number and diversity of training toys and the demonstrations per toy. We believe this work offers a promising path to scalable and generalizable learning in robotic manipulation.

  Many language-guided robotic systems rely on collapsing spatial reasoning into discrete points, making them brittle to perceptual noise and semantic ambiguity. To address this challenge, we propose RoboMAP, a framework that represents spatial targets as continuous, adaptive affordance heatmaps. This dense representation captures the uncertainty in spatial grounding and provides richer information for downstream policies, thereby significantly enhancing task success and interpretability. RoboMAP surpasses the previous state-of-the-art on a majority of grounding benchmarks with up to a 50x speed improvement, and achieves an 82\% success rate in real-world manipulation. Across extensive simulated and physical experiments, it demonstrates robust performance and shows strong zero-shot generalization to navigation. More details and videos can be found atthis https URL.

  Generalist robot policies can now perform a wide range of manipulation skills, but evaluating and improving their ability with unfamiliar objects and instructions remains a significant challenge. Rigorous evaluation requires a large number of real-world rollouts, while systematic improvement demands additional corrective data with expert labels. Both of these processes are slow, costly, and difficult to scale. World models offer a promising, scalable alternative by enabling policies to rollout within imagination space. However, a key challenge is building a controllable world model that can handle multi-step interactions with generalist robot policies. This requires a world model compatible with modern generalist policies by supporting multi-view prediction, fine-grained action control, and consistent long-horizon interactions, which is not achieved by previous works. In this paper, we make a step forward by introducing a controllable multi-view world model that can be used to evaluate and improve the instruction-following ability of generalist robot policies. Our model maintains long-horizon consistency with a pose-conditioned memory retrieval mechanism and achieves precise action control through frame-level action conditioning. Trained on the DROID dataset (95k trajectories, 564 scenes), our model generates spatially and temporally consistent trajectories under novel scenarios and new camera placements for over 20 seconds. We show that our method can accurately rank policy performance without real-world robot rollouts. Moreover, by synthesizing successful trajectories in imagination and using them for supervised fine-tuning, our approach can improve policy success by 44.7\%.

  In recent years, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated the ability to serve as high-level planners, enabling robots to follow complex human instructions. However, their effectiveness, especially in long-horizon tasks involving dual-arm humanoid robots, remains limited. This limitation arises from two main challenges: (i) the absence of simulation platforms that systematically support task evaluation and data collection for humanoid robots, and (ii) the insufficient embodiment awareness of current MLLMs, which hinders reasoning about dual-arm selection logic and body positions during planning. To address these issues, we present DualTHOR, a new dual-arm humanoid simulator, with continuous transition and a contingency mechanism. Building on this platform, we propose Proprio-MLLM, a model that enhances embodiment awareness by incorporating proprioceptive information with motion-based position embedding and a cross-spatial encoder. Experiments show that, while existing MLLMs struggle in this environment, Proprio-MLLM achieves an average improvement of 19.75% in planning performance. Our work provides both an essential simulation platform and an effective model to advance embodied intelligence in humanoid robotics. The code is available atthis https URL.

  Underwater environments present unique challenges for robotic operation, including complex hydrodynamics, limited visibility, and constrained communication. Although data-driven approaches have advanced embodied intelligence in terrestrial robots and enabled task-specific autonomous underwater robots, developing underwater intelligence capable of autonomously performing multiple tasks remains highly challenging, as large-scale, high-quality underwater datasets are still scarce. To address these limitations, we introduce USIM, a simulation-based multi-task Vision-Language-Action (VLA) dataset for underwater robots. USIM comprises over 561K frames from 1,852 trajectories, totaling approximately 15.6 hours of BlueROV2 interactions across 20 tasks in 9 diverse scenarios, ranging from visual navigation to mobile manipulation. Building upon this dataset, we propose U0, a VLA model for general underwater robots, which integrates binocular vision and other sensor modalities through multimodal fusion, and further incorporates a convolution-attention-based perception focus enhancement module (CAP) to improve spatial understanding and mobile manipulation. Across tasks such as inspection, obstacle avoidance, scanning, and dynamic tracking, the framework achieves a success rate of 80%, while in challenging mobile manipulation tasks, it reduces the distance to the target by 21.2% compared with baseline methods, demonstrating its effectiveness. USIM and U0 show that VLA models can be effectively applied to underwater robotic applications, providing a foundation for scalable dataset construction, improved task autonomy, and the practical realization of intelligent general underwater robots.

  The human ability to seamlessly perform multimodal reasoning and physical interaction in the open world is a core goal for general-purpose embodied intelligent systems. Recent vision-language-action (VLA) models, which are co-trained on large-scale robot and visual-text data, have demonstrated notable progress in general robot control. However, they still fail to achieve human-level flexibility in interleaved reasoning and interaction. In this work, introduce EO-Robotics, consists of EO-1 model and EO-Data1.5M dataset. EO-1 is a unified embodied foundation model that achieves superior performance in multimodal embodied reasoning and robot control through interleaved vision-text-action pre-training. The development of EO-1 is based on two key pillars: (i) a unified architecture that processes multimodal inputs indiscriminately (image, text, video, and action), and (ii) a massive, high-quality multimodal embodied reasoning dataset, EO-Data1.5M, which contains over 1.5 million samples with emphasis on interleaved vision-text-action comprehension. EO-1 is trained through synergies between auto-regressive decoding and flow matching denoising on EO-Data1.5M, enabling seamless robot action generation and multimodal embodied reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of interleaved vision-text-action learning for open-world understanding and generalization, validated through a variety of long-horizon, dexterous manipulation tasks across multiple embodiments. This paper details the architecture of EO-1, the data construction strategy of EO-Data1.5M, and the training methodology, offering valuable insights for developing advanced embodied foundation models.

  Accurate geospatial information is crucial for safe, autonomous Inland Waterway Transport (IWT), as existing charts (IENC) lack real-time detail and conventional LiDAR SLAM fails in waterway environments. These challenges lead to vertical drift and non-semantic maps, hindering autonomous navigation.This paper introduces Inland-LOAM, a LiDAR SLAM framework for waterways. It uses an improved feature extraction and a water surface planar constraint to mitigate vertical drift. A novel pipeline transforms 3D point clouds into structured 2D semantic maps using voxel-based geometric analysis, enabling real-time computation of navigational parameters like bridge clearances. An automated module extracts shorelines and exports them into a lightweight, IENC-compatible format.Evaluations on a real-world dataset show Inland-LOAM achieves superior localization accuracy over state-of-the-art methods. The generated semantic maps and shorelines align with real-world conditions, providing reliable data for enhanced situational awareness. The code and dataset will be publicly available

  _Beomjoon Lee, Changjoo Nam_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We address the bin packing problem (BPP), which aims to maximize bin utilization when packing a variety of items. The offline problem, where the complete information about the item set and their sizes is known in advance, is proven to be NP-hard. The semi-online and online variants are even more challenging, as full information about incoming items is unavailable. While existing methods have tackled both 2D and 3D BPPs, the 2D BPP remains underexplored in terms of fully maximizing utilization. We propose a hierarchical approach for solving the 2D online and semi-online BPP by combining deep reinforcement learning (RL) with heuristic search. The heuristic search selects which item to pack or unpack, determines the packing order, and chooses the orientation of each item, while the RL agent decides the precise position within the bin. Our method is capable of handling diverse scenarios, including repacking, varying levels of item information, differing numbers of accessible items, and coordination of dual manipulators. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves near-optimal utilization across various practical scenarios, largely due to its repacking capability. In addition, the algorithm is evaluated in a physics-based simulation environment, where execution time is measured to assess its real-world performance.

  _Yulin Zhou, Yuankai Lin, Fanzhe Peng, Jiahui Chen, Kaiji Huang, Hua Yang, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Standard imitation learning (IL) methods have achieved considerable success in robotics, yet often rely on the Markov assumption, which falters in long-horizon tasks where history is crucial for resolving perceptual ambiguity. This limitation stems not only from a conceptual gap but also from a fundamental computational barrier: prevailing architectures like Transformers are often constrained by quadratic complexity, rendering the processing of long, high-dimensional observation sequences infeasible. To overcome this dual challenge, we introduce Mamba Temporal Imitation Learning (MTIL). Our approach represents a new paradigm for robotic learning, which we frame as a practical synthesis of World Model and Dynamical System concepts. By leveraging the linear-time recurrent dynamics of State Space Models (SSMs), MTIL learns an implicit, action-oriented world model that efficiently encodes the entire trajectory history into a compressed, evolving state. This allows the policy to be conditioned on a comprehensive temporal context, transcending the confines of Markovian approaches. Through extensive experiments on simulated benchmarks (ACT, Robomimic, LIBERO) and on challenging real-world tasks, MTIL demonstrates superior performance against SOTA methods like ACT and Diffusion Policy, particularly in resolving long-term temporal ambiguities. Our findings not only affirm the necessity of full temporal context but also validate MTIL as a powerful and a computationally feasible approach for learning long-horizon, non-Markovian behaviors from high-dimensional observations.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper presents research findings on handling faulty measurements (i.e., outliers) of global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) for vehicle localization under adverse signal conditions in field applications, where raw GNSS data are frequently corrupted due to environmental interference such as multipath, signal blockage, or non-line-of-sight conditions. In this context, we investigate three strategies applied specifically to GNSS pseudorange observations: robust statistics for error mitigation, machine learning for faulty measurement prediction, and Bayesian inference for noise distribution approximation. Since previous studies have provided limited insight into the theoretical foundations and practical evaluations of these three methodologies within a unified problem statement (i.e., state estimation using ranging sensors), we conduct extensive experiments using real-world sensor data collected in diverse urban environments. Our goal is to examine both established techniques and newly proposed methods, thereby advancing the understanding of how to handle faulty range measurements, such as GNSS, for robust, long-term vehicle localization. In addition to presenting successful results, this work highlights critical observations and open questions to motivate future research in robust state estimation.

  Robot vision has greatly benefited from advancements in multimodal fusion techniques and vision-language models (VLMs). We adopt a task-oriented perspective to systematically review the applications and advancements of multimodal fusion methods and VLMs in the field of robot vision. For semantic scene understanding tasks, we categorize fusion approaches into encoder-decoder frameworks, attention-based architectures, and graph neural networks. Meanwhile, we also analyze the architectural characteristics and practical implementations of these fusion strategies in key tasks such as simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), 3D object detection, navigation, and manipulation. We compare the evolutionary paths and applicability of VLMs based on large language models (LLMs) with traditional multimodal fusionthis http URL, we conduct an in-depth analysis of commonly used datasets, evaluating their applicability and challenges in real-world robotic scenarios. Building on this analysis, we identify key challenges in current research, including cross-modal alignment, efficient fusion, real-time deployment, and domain adaptation. We propose future directions such as self-supervised learning for robust multimodal representations, structured spatial memory and environment modeling to enhance spatial intelligence, and the integration of adversarial robustness and human feedback mechanisms to enable ethically aligned system deployment. Through a comprehensive review, comparative analysis, and forward-looking discussion, we provide a valuable reference for advancing multimodal perception and interaction in robotic vision. A comprehensive list of studies in this survey is available atthis https URL.

  Accurate physical simulation is crucial for the development and validation of control algorithms in robotic systems. Recent works in Reinforcement Learning (RL) take notably advantage of extensive simulations to produce efficient robot control. State-of-the-art servo actuator models generally fail at capturing the complex friction dynamics of these systems. This limits the transferability of simulated behaviors to real-world applications. In this work, we present extended friction models that allow to more accurately simulate servo actuator dynamics. We propose a comprehensive analysis of various friction models, present a method for identifying model parameters using recorded trajectories from a pendulum test bench, and demonstrate how these models can be integrated into physics engines. The proposed friction models are validated on four distinct servo actuators and tested on 2R manipulators, showing significant improvements in accuracy over the standard Coulomb-Viscous model. Our results highlight the importance of considering advanced friction effects in the simulation of servo actuators to enhance the realism and reliability of robotic simulations.

  Uncertainties in dynamic road environments pose significant challenges for behavior and trajectory planning in autonomous driving. This paper introduces Hi-Drive, a hierarchical planning algorithm addressing uncertainties at both behavior and trajectory levels using a hierarchical Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) formulation. Hi-Drive employs driver models to represent uncertain behavioral intentions of other vehicles and uses their parameters to infer hidden driving styles. By treating driver models as high-level decision-making actions, our approach effectively manages the exponential complexity inherent in POMDPs. To further enhance safety and robustness, Hi-Drive integrates a trajectory optimization based on importance sampling, refining trajectories using a comprehensive analysis of critical agents. Evaluations on real-world urban driving datasets demonstrate that Hi-Drive significantly outperforms state-of-the-art planning-based and learning-based methods across diverse urban driving situations in real-world benchmarks.
