- **[Decoding Funded Research: Comparative Analysis of Topic Models and Uncovering the Effect of Gender and Geographic Location](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18803)**  `arXiv:2510.18803`  
  _Shirin Tavakoli Kafiabad, Andrea Schiffauerova, Ashkan Ebadi_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Optimizing national scientific investment requires a clear understanding of evolving research trends and the demographic and geographical forces shaping them, particularly in light of commitments to equity, diversity, and inclusion. This study addresses this need by analyzing 18 years (2005-2022) of research proposals funded by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC). We conducted a comprehensive comparative evaluation of three topic modelling approaches: Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), Structural Topic Modelling (STM), and BERTopic. We also introduced a novel algorithm, named COFFEE, designed to enable robust covariate effect estimation for BERTopic. This advancement addresses a significant gap, as BERTopic lacks a native function for covariate analysis, unlike the probabilistic STM. Our findings highlight that while all models effectively delineate core scientific domains, BERTopic outperformed by consistently identifying more granular, coherent, and emergent themes, such as the rapid expansion of artificial intelligence. Additionally, the covariate analysis, powered by COFFEE, confirmed distinct provincial research specializations and revealed consistent gender-based thematic patterns across various scientific disciplines. These insights offer a robust empirical foundation for funding organizations to formulate more equitable and impactful funding strategies, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of the scientific ecosystem.

- **[Seg the HAB: Language-Guided Geospatial Algae Bloom Reasoning and Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18751)**  `arXiv:2510.18751`  
  _Patterson Hsieh, Jerry Yeh, Mao-Chi He, Wen-Han Hsieh, Elvis Hsieh_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Climate change is intensifying the occurrence of harmful algal bloom (HAB), particularly cyanobacteria, which threaten aquatic ecosystems and human health through oxygen depletion, toxin release, and disruption of marine biodiversity. Traditional monitoring approaches, such as manual water sampling, remain labor-intensive and limited in spatial and temporal coverage. Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) for remote sensing have shown potential for scalable AI-driven solutions, yet challenges remain in reasoning over imagery and quantifying bloom severity. In this work, we introduce ALGae Observation and Segmentation (ALGOS), a segmentation-and-reasoning system for HAB monitoring that combines remote sensing image understanding with severity estimation. Our approach integrates GeoSAM-assisted human evaluation for high-quality segmentation mask curation and fine-tunes vision language model on severity prediction using the Cyanobacteria Aggregated Manual Labels (CAML) from NASA. Experiments demonstrate that ALGOS achieves robust performance on both segmentation and severity-level estimation, paving the way toward practical and automated cyanobacterial monitoring systems.

- **[Sherlock Your Queries: Learning to Ask the Right Questions for Dialogue-Based Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18659)**  `arXiv:2510.18659`  
  _Dong Yun, Marco Schouten, Dim Papadopoulos_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  User queries in information retrieval are often ambiguous, making it challenging for systems to identify a user's target from a single query. While recent dialogue-based interactive retrieval systems can clarify user intent, they are inefficient as they often lack an explicit strategy to ask the most informative questions. To address this limitation, we propose SherlockLLM, a dialogue-driven retrieval framework that learns an optimal questioning strategy via Reinforcement Learning (RL) and avoids the need for large-scale annotated dialogue data. In our framework, an agent is trained to generate a sequence of binary questions to efficiently narrow down the search space. To validate our approach, we introduce a benchmark with both structured and unstructured tasks. Experimental results show that SherlockLLM is a robust and efficient solution. On the structured tasks, its performance matches strong baselines and approaches the theoretical optimal defined by binary search. On the challenging unstructured task, our agent significantly outperforms these baselines, showcasing its ability to learn a highly effective information-seeking dialogue policy.

- **[Query Decomposition for RAG: Balancing Exploration-Exploitation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18633)**  `arXiv:2510.18633`  
  _Roxana Petcu, Kenton Murray, Daniel Khashabi, Evangelos Kanoulas, Maarten de Rijke, Dawn Lawrie, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems address complex user requests by decomposing them into subqueries, retrieving potentially relevant documents for each, and then aggregating them to generate an answer. Efficiently selecting informative documents requires balancing a key trade-off: (i) retrieving broadly enough to capture all the relevant material, and (ii) limiting retrieval to avoid excessive noise and computational cost. We formulate query decomposition and document retrieval in an exploitation-exploration setting, where retrieving one document at a time builds a belief about the utility of a given sub-query and informs the decision to continue exploiting or exploring an alternative. We experiment with a variety of bandit learning methods and demonstrate their effectiveness in dynamically selecting the most informative sub-queries. Our main finding is that estimating document relevance using rank information and human judgments yields a 35% gain in document-level precision, 15% increase in {\alpha}-nDCG, and better performance on the downstream task of long-form generation.

- **[Leveraging Association Rules for Better Predictions and Better Explanations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18628)**  `arXiv:2510.18628`  
  _Gilles Audemard, Sylvie Coste-Marquis, Pierre Marquis, Mehdi Sabiri, Nicolas Szczepanski_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present a new approach to classification that combines data and knowledge. In this approach, data mining is used to derive association rules (possibly with negations) from data. Those rules are leveraged to increase the predictive performance of tree-based models (decision trees and random forests) used for a classification task. They are also used to improve the corresponding explanation task through the generation of abductive explanations that are more general than those derivable without taking such rules into account. Experiments show that for the two tree-based models under consideration, benefits can be offered by the approach in terms of predictive performance and in terms of explanation sizes.

- **[VAR: Visual Attention Reasoning via Structured Search and Backtracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18619)**  `arXiv:2510.18619`  
  _Wei Cai, Jian Zhao, Yuchen Yuan, Tianle Zhang, Ming Zhu, Haichuan Tang, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), despite their advances, are hindered by their high hallucination tendency and heavy reliance on brittle, linear reasoning processes, leading to failures in complex tasks. To address these limitations, we introduce Visual Attention Reasoning (VAR), a novel framework that recasts grounded reasoning as a structured search over a reasoning trajectory space. VAR decomposes the reasoning process into two key stages: traceable evidence grounding and search-based chain-of-thought (CoT) generation, which incorporates a backtracking mechanism for self-correction. The search is guided by a multi-faceted reward function with semantic and geometric self-verification components, which penalize outputs that are not faithfully grounded in the visual input. We provide a theoretical analysis for our search strategy, validating its capability to find the correct solution with high probability. Experimental results show that our 7B model, VAR-7B, sets a new state-of-the-art on a comprehensive suite of hallucination and safety benchmarks, significantly outperforming existing open-source models and demonstrating competitive performance against leading proprietary systems.

- **[QuantEvolve: Automating Quantitative Strategy Discovery through Multi-Agent Evolutionary Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18569)**  `arXiv:2510.18569`  
  _Junhyeog Yun, Hyoun Jun Lee, Insu Jeon_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Automating quantitative trading strategy development in dynamic markets is challenging, especially with increasing demand for personalized investment solutions. Existing methods often fail to explore the vast strategy space while preserving the diversity essential for robust performance across changing market conditions. We present QuantEvolve, an evolutionary framework that combines quality-diversity optimization with hypothesis-driven strategy generation. QuantEvolve employs a feature map aligned with investor preferences, such as strategy type, risk profile, turnover, and return characteristics, to maintain a diverse set of effective strategies. It also integrates a hypothesis-driven multi-agent system to systematically explore the strategy space through iterative generation and evaluation. This approach produces diverse, sophisticated strategies that adapt to both market regime shifts and individual investment needs. Empirical results show that QuantEvolve outperforms conventional baselines, validating its effectiveness. We release a dataset of evolved strategies to support future research.

- **[Extracting alignment data in open models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18554)**  `arXiv:2510.18554`  
  _Federico Barbero, Xiangming Gu, Christopher A. Choquette-Choo, Chawin Sitawarin, Matthew Jagielski, Itay Yona, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this work, we show that it is possible to extract significant amounts of alignment training data from a post-trained model -- useful to steer the model to improve certain capabilities such as long-context reasoning, safety, instruction following, and maths. While the majority of related work on memorisation has focused on measuring success of training data extraction through string matching, we argue that embedding models are better suited for our specific goals. Distances measured through a high quality embedding model can identify semantic similarities between strings that a different metric such as edit distance will struggle to capture. In fact, in our investigation, approximate string matching would have severely undercounted (by a conservative estimate of $10\times$) the amount of data that can be extracted due to trivial artifacts that deflate the metric. Interestingly, we find that models readily regurgitate training data that was used in post-training phases such as SFT or RL. We show that this data can be then used to train a base model, recovering a meaningful amount of the original performance. We believe our work exposes a possibly overlooked risk towards extracting alignment data. Finally, our work opens up an interesting discussion on the downstream effects of distillation practices: since models seem to be regurgitating aspects of their training set, distillation can therefore be thought of as indirectly training on the model's original dataset.

- **[SOCIA-Nabla: Textual Gradient Meets Multi-Agent Orchestration for Automated Simulator Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18551)**  `arXiv:2510.18551`  
  _Yuncheng Hua, Sion Weatherhead, Mehdi Jafari, Hao Xue, Flora D. Salim_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this paper, we present SOCIA-Nabla, an end-to-end, agentic framework that treats simulator construction asinstance optimization over code within a textual computation graph. Specialized LLM-driven agents are embedded as graph nodes, and a workflow manager executes a loss-driven loop: code synthesis -> execution -> evaluation -> code repair. The optimizer performs Textual-Gradient Descent (TGD), while human-in-the-loop interaction is reserved for task-spec confirmation, minimizing expert effort and keeping the code itself as the trainable object. Across three CPS tasks, i.e., User Modeling, Mask Adoption, and Personal Mobility, SOCIA-Nabla attains state-of-the-art overall accuracy. By unifying multi-agent orchestration with a loss-aligned optimization view, SOCIA-Nabla converts brittle prompt pipelines into reproducible, constraint-aware simulator code generation that scales across domains and simulation granularities. This work is under review, and we will release the code soon.

- **[Physics-guided Emulators Reveal Resilience and Fragility under Operational Latencies and Outages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18535)**  `arXiv:2510.18535`  
  _Sarth Dubey, Subimal Ghosh, Udit Bhatia_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reliable hydrologic and flood forecasting requires models that remain stable when input data are delayed, missing, or inconsistent. However, most advances in rainfall-runoff prediction have been evaluated under ideal data conditions, emphasizing accuracy rather than operational resilience. Here, we develop an operationally ready emulator of the Global Flood Awareness System (GloFAS) that couples long- and short-term memory networks with a relaxed water-balance constraint to preserve physical coherence. Five architectures span a continuum of information availability: from complete historical and forecast forcings to scenarios with data latency and outages, allowing systematic evaluation of robustness. Trained in minimally managed catchments across the United States and tested in more than 5,000 basins, including heavily regulated rivers in India, the emulator reproduces the hydrological core of GloFAS and degrades smoothly as information quality declines. Transfer across contrasting hydroclimatic and management regimes yields reduced yet physically consistent performance, defining the limits of generalization under data scarcity and human influence. The framework establishes operational robustness as a measurable property of hydrological machine learning and advances the design of reliable real-time forecasting systems.

- **[Counterfactual Reasoning for Steerable Pluralistic Value Alignment of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18526)**  `arXiv:2510.18526`  
  _Hanze Guo, Jing Yao, Xiao Zhou, Xiaoyuan Yi, Xing Xie_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into applications serving users across diverse cultures, communities and demographics, it is critical to align LLMs with pluralistic human values beyond average principles (e.g., HHH). In psychological and social value theories such as Schwartz's Value Theory, pluralistic values are represented by multiple value dimensions paired with various priorities. However, existing methods encounter two challenges when aligning with such fine-grained value objectives: 1) they often treat multiple values as independent and equally important, ignoring their interdependence and relative priorities (value complexity); 2) they struggle to precisely control nuanced value priorities, especially those underrepresented ones (value steerability). To handle these challenges, we propose COUPLE, a COUnterfactual reasoning framework for PLuralistic valuE alignment. It introduces a structural causal model (SCM) to feature complex interdependency and prioritization among features, as well as the causal relationship between high-level value dimensions and behaviors. Moreover, it applies counterfactual reasoning to generate outputs aligned with any desired value objectives. Benefitting from explicit causal modeling, COUPLE also provides better interpretability. We evaluate COUPLE on two datasets with different value systems and demonstrate that COUPLE advances other baselines across diverse types of value objectives.

- **[Crucible: Quantifying the Potential of Control Algorithms through LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18491)**  `arXiv:2510.18491`  
  _Lianchen Jia, Chaoyang Li, Qian Houde, Tianchi Huang, Jiangchuan Liu, Lifeng Sun_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Control algorithms in production environments typically require domain experts to tune their parameters and logic for specific scenarios. However, existing research predominantly focuses on algorithmic performance under ideal or default configurations, overlooking the critical aspect of Tuning Potential. To bridge this gap, we introduce Crucible, an agent that employs an LLM-driven, multi-level expert simulation to turn algorithms and defines a formalized metric to quantitatively evaluate their Tuning Potential. We demonstrate Crucible's effectiveness across a wide spectrum of case studies, from classic control tasks to complex computer systems, and validate its findings in a real-world deployment. Our experimental results reveal that Crucible systematically quantifies the tunable space across different algorithms. Furthermore, Crucible provides a new dimension for algorithm analysis and design, which ultimately leads to performance improvements. Our code is available atthis https URL.

  _Haoran Zhang, Chenhao Zhu, Sicong Guo, Hanzhe Guo, Haiming Li, Donglin Yu_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Human players do more than press buttons: they ground what they see on screen into precise keyboard-mouse actions and, when stuck, they seek information before trying again. We ask whether current vision-language models (VLMs) can do the same. Despite encouraging results under simplified control or tool scaffolds, human-like play in a real client - mapping raw screenshots to temporally coherent low-level actions while deciding when to ask for guidance - remains an open challenge. We introduce StarBench, a turn-based RPG benchmark derived from Honkai: Star Rail that targets these two human-like competencies: multimodal decision-making from pixels to actions and agentic information seeking. StarBench standardizes evaluation across eight combat tasks and two regimes with shared tasks and metrics: (i) direct control, where agents receive only screenshots and must emit low-level primitives (click and keypress) with no semantic hints; and (ii) tool-assisted control, where higher-level intents can be mapped to primitives by detectors and OCR outputs provide optional textualized observations to ease UI grounding. To mirror human practice, StarBench also includes an ask-or-act diagnostic that measures whether and when agents choose to request brief guidance before proceeding, and how that choice affects subsequent performance. We report reference baselines for contemporary VLMs and a human reference. Results expose sizable gaps in perception-to-control fidelity in the direct regime, while showing that judicious information seeking correlates with improved success, establishing StarBench as a reproducible yardstick for agentic information seeking and multimodal decision-making in real-client play.

- **[LAFA: Agentic LLM-Driven Federated Analytics over Decentralized Data Sources](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18477)**  `arXiv:2510.18477`  
  _Haichao Ji, Zibo Wang, Yifei Zhu, Meng han, Dan Wang, Zhu Han_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great promise in automating data analytics tasks by interpreting natural language queries and generating multi-operation execution plans. However, existing LLM-agent-based analytics frameworks operate under the assumption of centralized data access, offering little to no privacy protection. In contrast, federated analytics (FA) enables privacy-preserving computation across distributed data sources, but lacks support for natural language input and requires structured, machine-readable queries. In this work, we present LAFA, the first system that integrates LLM-agent-based data analytics with FA. LAFA introduces a hierarchical multi-agent architecture that accepts natural language queries and transforms them into optimized, executable FA workflows. A coarse-grained planner first decomposes complex queries into sub-queries, while a fine-grained planner maps each subquery into a Directed Acyclic Graph of FA operations using prior structural knowledge. To improve execution efficiency, an optimizer agent rewrites and merges multiple DAGs, eliminating redundant operations and minimizing computational and communicational overhead. Our experiments demonstrate that LAFA consistently outperforms baseline prompting strategies by achieving higher execution plan success rates and reducing resource-intensive FA operations by a substantial margin. This work establishes a practical foundation for privacy-preserving, LLM-driven analytics that supports natural language input in the FA setting.

- **[Probabilistic Modeling of Intentions in Socially Intelligent LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18476)**  `arXiv:2510.18476`  
  _Feifan Xia, Yuyang Fang, Defang Li, Yantong Xie, Weikang Li, Yang Li, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present a probabilistic intent modeling framework for large language model (LLM) agents in multi-turn social dialogue. The framework maintains a belief distribution over a partner's latent intentions, initialized from contextual priors and dynamically updated through likelihood estimation after each utterance. The evolving distribution provides additional contextual grounding for the policy, enabling adaptive dialogue strategies under uncertainty. Preliminary experiments in the SOTOPIA environment show consistent improvements: the proposed framework increases the Overall score by 9.0% on SOTOPIA-All and 4.1% on SOTOPIA-Hard compared with the Qwen2.5-7B baseline, and slightly surpasses an oracle agent that directly observes partner intentions. These early results suggest that probabilistic intent modeling can contribute to the development of socially intelligent LLM agents.

  _Shaobo Wang, Yongliang Miao, Yuancheng Liu, and Qianli Ma, Ning Liao, Linfeng Zhang_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning capabilities, but scaling their performance often relies on massive reasoning datasets that are computationally expensive to train on. Existing data selection methods aim to curate smaller, high-quality subsets but often rely on costly external models or opaque heuristics. In this work, we shift the focus from external heuristics to the model's internal mechanisms. We find that complex reasoning tasks consistently activate a sparse, specialized subset of attention heads, forming core reasoning circuits. Building on this insight, we propose CircuitSeer, a novel data selection method that quantifies the reasoning complexity of data by measuring its influence on these crucial circuits. Extensive experiments on 4 models and 9 datasets demonstrate CircuitSeer's superiority. Notably, fine-tuning Qwen2.5-Math-7B on just 10% of data selected by our method achieves a 1.4-point gain in average Pass@1 over training on the full dataset, highlighting its efficiency and effectiveness.

- **[PlanU: Large Language Model Decision Making through Planning under Uncertainty](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18442)**  `arXiv:2510.18442`  
  _Ziwei Deng, Mian Deng, Chenjing Liang, Zeming Gao, Chennan Ma, Chenxing Lin, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being explored across a range of decision-making tasks. However, LLMs sometimes struggle with decision-making tasks under uncertainty that are relatively easy for humans, such as planning actions in stochastic environments. The adoption of LLMs for decision-making is impeded by uncertainty challenges, such as LLM uncertainty and environmental uncertainty. LLM uncertainty arises from the stochastic sampling process inherent to LLMs. Most LLM-based Decision-Making (LDM) approaches address LLM uncertainty through multiple reasoning chains or search trees. However, these approaches overlook environmental uncertainty, which leads to poor performance in environments with stochastic state transitions. Some recent LDM approaches deal with uncertainty by forecasting the probability of unknown variables. However, they are not designed for multi-step decision-making tasks that require interaction with the environment. To address uncertainty in LLM decision-making, we introduce PlanU, an LLM-based planning method that captures uncertainty within Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). PlanU models the return of each node in the MCTS as a quantile distribution, which uses a set of quantiles to represent the return distribution. To balance exploration and exploitation during tree search, PlanU introduces an Upper Confidence Bounds with Curiosity (UCC) score which estimates the uncertainty of MCTS nodes. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of PlanU in LLM-based decision-making tasks under uncertainty.

  _Minwei Kong, Ao Qu, Xiaotong Guo, Wenbin Ouyang, Chonghe Jiang, Han Zheng, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Optimization modeling enables critical decisions across industries but remains difficult to automate: informal language must be mapped to precise mathematical formulations and executable solver code. Prior LLM approaches either rely on brittle prompting or costly retraining with limited generalization. We present AlphaOPT, a self-improving experience library that enables an LLM to learn from limited demonstrations (even answers alone, without gold-standard programs) and solver feedback - without annotated reasoning traces or parameter updates. AlphaOPT operates in a continual two-phase cycle: (i) a Library Learning phase that reflects on failed attempts, extracting solver-verified, structured insights as {taxonomy, condition, explanation, example}; and (ii) a Library Evolution phase that diagnoses retrieval misalignments and refines the applicability conditions of stored insights, improving transfer across tasks. This design (1) learns efficiently from limited demonstrations without curated rationales, (2) expands continually without costly retraining by updating the library rather than model weights, and (3) makes knowledge explicit and interpretable for human inspection and intervention. Experiments show that AlphaOPT steadily improves with more data (65% to 72% from 100 to 300 training items) and surpasses the strongest baseline by 7.7% on the out-of-distribution OptiBench dataset when trained only on answers. Code and data are available at:this https URL.

- **[Automated urban waterlogging assessment and early warning through a mixture of foundation models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18425)**  `arXiv:2510.18425`  
  _Chenxu Zhang, Fuxiang Huang, Lei Zhang_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  With climate change intensifying, urban waterlogging poses an increasingly severe threat to global public safety and infrastructure. However, existing monitoring approaches rely heavily on manual reporting and fail to provide timely and comprehensive assessments. In this study, we present Urban Waterlogging Assessment (UWAssess), a foundation model-driven framework that automatically identifies waterlogged areas in surveillance images and generates structured assessment reports. To address the scarcity of labeled data, we design a semi-supervised fine-tuning strategy and a chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting strategy to unleash the potential of the foundation model for data-scarce downstream tasks. Evaluations on challenging visual benchmarks demonstrate substantial improvements in perception performance. GPT-based evaluations confirm the ability of UWAssess to generate reliable textual reports that accurately describe waterlogging extent, depth, risk and impact. This dual capability enables a shift of waterlogging monitoring from perception to generation, while the collaborative framework of multiple foundation models lays the groundwork for intelligent and scalable systems, supporting urban management, disaster response and climate resilience.

  _Guangfu Guo, Xiaoqian Lu, Yue Feng_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Visual Language Models (VLMs) achieve promising results in medical reasoning but struggle with hallucinations, vague descriptions, inconsistent logic and poor localization. To address this, we propose a agent framework named Medical Visual Reasoning Agent (\textbf{Med-VRAgent}). The approach is based on Visual Guidance and Self-Reward paradigms and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). By combining the Visual Guidance with tree search, Med-VRAgent improves the medical visual reasoning capabilities of VLMs. We use the trajectories collected by Med-VRAgent as feedback to further improve the performance by fine-tuning the VLMs with the proximal policy optimization (PPO) objective. Experiments on multiple medical VQA benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In glass bottle manufacturing, precise control of forming machines is critical for ensuring quality and minimizing defects. This study presents a deep learning-based control algorithm designed to optimize the forming process in real production environments. Using real operational data from active manufacturing plants, our neural network predicts the effects of parameter changes based on the current production setup. Through a specifically designed inversion mechanism, the algorithm identifies the optimal machine settings required to achieve the desired glass gob characteristics. Experimental results on historical datasets from multiple production lines show that the proposed method yields promising outcomes, suggesting potential for enhanced process stability, reduced waste, and improved product consistency. These results highlight the potential of deep learning to process control in glass manufacturing.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Self-play constitutes a fundamental paradigm for autonomous skill acquisition, whereby agents iteratively enhance their capabilities through self-directed environmental exploration. Conventional self-play frameworks exploit agent symmetry within zero-sum competitive settings, yet this approach proves inadequate for open-ended learning scenarios characterized by inherent asymmetry. Human pedagogical systems exemplify asymmetric instructional frameworks wherein educators systematically construct challenges calibrated to individual learners' developmental trajectories. The principal challenge resides in operationalizing these asymmetric, adaptive pedagogical mechanisms within artificial systems capable of autonomously synthesizing appropriate curricula without predetermined task hierarchies. Here we present Heterogeneous Adversarial Play (HAP), an adversarial Automatic Curriculum Learning framework that formalizes teacher-student interactions as a minimax optimization wherein task-generating instructor and problem-solving learner co-evolve through adversarial dynamics. In contrast to prevailing ACL methodologies that employ static curricula or unidirectional task selection mechanisms, HAP establishes a bidirectional feedback system wherein instructors continuously recalibrate task complexity in response to real-time learner performance metrics. Experimental validation across multi-task learning domains demonstrates that our framework achieves performance parity with SOTA baselines while generating curricula that enhance learning efficacy in both artificial agents and human subjects.

  This paper proposes Memory-Augmented State Machine Prompting (MASMP), a novel framework for LLM agents in real-time strategy games. Addressing key challenges like hallucinations and fragmented decision-making in existing approaches, MASMP integrates state machine prompting with memory mechanisms to unify structured actions with long-term tactical coherence. The framework features: (1) a natural language-driven state machine architecture that guides LLMs to emulate finite state machines and behavior trees through prompts, and (2) a lightweight memory module preserving strategic variables (e.g., tactics, priority units) across decision cycles. Experiments in StarCraft II demonstrate MASMP's 60% win rate against the hardest built-in AI (Lv7), vastly outperforming baselines (0%). Case studies reveal the method retains LLMs' semantic comprehension while resolving the "Knowing-Doing Gap" through strict state-action mapping, achieving both interpretability and FSM-like reliability. This work establishes a new paradigm for combining neural and symbolic AI in complex decision-making.

  Multi-class unsupervised anomaly detection (MUAD) has garnered growing research interest, as it seeks to develop a unified model for anomaly detection across multiple classes, i.e., eliminating the need to train separate models for distinct objects and thereby saving substantial computational resources. Under the MUAD setting, while advanced Transformer-based architectures have brought significant performance improvements, identity shortcuts persist: they directly copy inputs to outputs, narrowing the gap in reconstruction errors between normal and abnormal cases, and thereby making the two harder to distinguish. Therefore, we propose ShortcutBreaker, a novel unified feature-reconstruction framework for MUAD tasks, featuring two key innovations to address the issue of shortcuts. First, drawing on matrix rank inequality, we design a low-rank noisy bottleneck (LRNB) to project highdimensional features into a low-rank latent space, and theoretically demonstrate its capacity to prevent trivial identity reproduction. Second, leveraging ViTs global modeling capability instead of merely focusing on local features, we incorporate a global perturbation attention to prevent information shortcuts in the decoders. Extensive experiments are performed on four widely used anomaly detection benchmarks, including three industrial datasets (MVTec-AD, ViSA, and Real-IAD) and one medical dataset (Universal Medical). The proposed method achieves a remarkable image-level AUROC of 99.8%, 98.9%, 90.6%, and 87.8% on these four datasets, respectively, consistently outperforming previous MUAD methods across different scenarios.

  Geospatial data offers immense potential for understanding our planet. However, the sheer volume and diversity of this data along with its varied resolutions, timescales, and sparsity pose significant challenges for thorough analysis and interpretation. This paper introduces Earth AI, a family of geospatial AI models and agentic reasoning that enables significant advances in our ability to unlock novel and profound insights into our planet. This approach is built upon foundation models across three key domains--Planet-scale Imagery, Population, and Environment--and an intelligent Gemini-powered reasoning engine. We present rigorous benchmarks showcasing the power and novel capabilities of our foundation models and validate that when used together, they provide complementary value for geospatial inference and their synergies unlock superior predictive capabilities. To handle complex, multi-step queries, we developed a Gemini-powered agent that jointly reasons over our multiple foundation models along with large geospatial data sources and tools. On a new benchmark of real-world crisis scenarios, our agent demonstrates the ability to deliver critical and timely insights, effectively bridging the gap between raw geospatial data and actionable understanding.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As large language model (LLM) agents increasingly automate complex web tasks, they boost productivity while simultaneously introducing new security risks. However, relevant studies on web agent attacks remain limited. Existing red-teaming approaches mainly rely on manually crafted attack strategies or static models trained offline. Such methods fail to capture the underlying behavioral patterns of web agents, making it difficult to generalize across diverse environments. In web agent attacks, success requires the continuous discovery and evolution of attack strategies. To this end, we propose Genesis, a novel agentic framework composed of three modules: Attacker, Scorer, and Strategist. The Attacker generates adversarial injections by integrating the genetic algorithm with a hybrid strategy representation. The Scorer evaluates the target web agent's responses to provide feedback. The Strategist dynamically uncovers effective strategies from interaction logs and compiles them into a continuously growing strategy library, which is then re-deployed to enhance the Attacker's effectiveness. Extensive experiments across various web tasks show that our framework discovers novel strategies and consistently outperforms existing attack baselines.

  _Sion Weatherhead, Flora Salim, Aaron Belbasis_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Humans do not just find mistakes after the fact -- we often catch them mid-stream because 'reflection' is tied to the goal and its constraints. Today's large language models produce reasoning tokens and 'reflective' text, but is it functionally equivalent with human reflective reasoning? Prior work on closed-ended tasks -- with clear, external 'correctness' signals -- can make 'reflection' look effective while masking limits in self-correction. We therefore test eight frontier models on a simple, real-world task that is open-ended yet rule-constrained, with auditable success criteria: to produce valid scientific test items, then revise after considering their own critique. First-pass performance is poor (often zero valid items out of 4 required; mean $\approx$ 1), and reflection yields only modest gains (also $\approx$ 1). Crucially, the second attempt frequently repeats the same violation of constraint, indicating 'corrective gains' arise largely from chance production of a valid item rather than error detection and principled, constraint-sensitive repair. Performance before and after reflection deteriorates as open-endedness increases, and models marketed for 'reasoning' show no advantage. Our results suggest that current LLM 'reflection' lacks functional evidence of the active, goal-driven monitoring that helps humans respect constraints even on a first pass. Until such mechanisms are instantiated in the model itself, reliable performance requires external structure that enforces constraints.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Data quality plays a critical role in enhancing supervised fine-tuning (SFT) for large language models (LLMs), and token-level data selection has emerged as a promising direction for its fine-grained nature. Despite their strong empirical performance, existing token-level selection methods share two key limitations: (1) requiring training or accessing an additional reference model, and (2) relying solely on loss information for token selection, which cannot well preserve semantically important tokens that are not favored by loss-based metrics. To address these challenges, we propose ssToken, a Self-modulated and Semantic-aware Token Selection approach. ssToken leverages readily accessible history models to compute the per-token loss difference with the current model, which serves as a self-modulated signal that enables the model to adaptively select tokens along its optimization trajectory, rather than relying on excess loss from an offline-trained reference model as in prior works. We further introduce a semantic-aware, attention-based token importance estimation metric, orthogonal to loss-based selection and providing complementary semantic information for more effective filtering. Extensive experiments across different model families and scales demonstrate that both self-modulated selection and semantic-aware selection alone outperform full-data fine-tuning, while their integration--ssToken--achieves synergistic gains and further surpasses prior token-level selection methods, delivering performance improvements while maintaining training efficiency.

  The lack of a concrete definition for Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) obscures the gap between today's specialized AI and human-level cognition. This paper introduces a quantifiable framework to address this, defining AGI as matching the cognitive versatility and proficiency of a well-educated adult. To operationalize this, we ground our methodology in Cattell-Horn-Carroll theory, the most empirically validated model of human cognition. The framework dissects general intelligence into ten core cognitive domains-including reasoning, memory, and perception-and adapts established human psychometric batteries to evaluate AI systems. Application of this framework reveals a highly "jagged" cognitive profile in contemporary models. While proficient in knowledge-intensive domains, current AI systems have critical deficits in foundational cognitive machinery, particularly long-term memory storage. The resulting AGI scores (e.g., GPT-4 at 27%, GPT-5 at 58%) concretely quantify both rapid progress and the substantial gap remaining before AGI.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR)-based post-training of Large Language Models (LLMs) has been shown to improve accuracy on reasoning tasks and continues to attract significant attention. Existing RLVR methods, however, typically treat all tokens uniformly without accounting for token-level advantages. These methods primarily evaluate performance based on final answer correctness or Pass@K accuracy, and yet make claims about RL post-training leading to improved reasoning traces. This motivates our investigation into the effect of RL post-training on intermediate tokens which are not directly incentivized. To study this, we design an experimental setup using the GRPO algorithm with Qwen-2.5-0.5B model on the GSM8K dataset. We introduce trace coherence, a First-Order Logic (FOL)-based measure to capture the consistency of reasoning steps by identifying errors in the traces. We distinguish between trace validity and trace coherence, noting that the former implies logical soundness while the latter measures local coherence via lack of errors. Our results show that RL post-training overall improves trace coherence with the most significant gains on problems where the base model fails but the RL model succeeds. Surprisingly, RL enhances local coherence without necessarily producing valid or correct solutions. This highlights a crucial distinction: improved local coherence in reasoning steps does not guarantee final answer correctness. We argue that claims of improved reasoning via RL must be examined with care, as these may be based on improved trace coherence, which may not translate into fully valid mathematical proofs.

  Small Language Models (SLMs) offer compelling advantages in deployment cost and latency, but their accuracy often lags behind larger models, particularly for complex domain-specific tasks. While supervised fine-tuning can help bridge this performance gap, it requires substantial manual effort in data preparation and iterative optimization. We present PaDA-Agent (Pattern-guided Data Augmentation Agent), an evaluation-driven approach that streamlines the data augmentation process for SLMs through coordinated operations. Unlike state-of-the-art approaches that focus on model training errors only and generating error-correcting samples, PaDA-Agent discovers failure patterns from the validation data via evaluations and drafts targeted data augmentation strategies aiming to directly reduce the generalization gap. Our experimental results demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art LLM-based data augmentation approaches for Llama 3.2 1B Instruct model fine-tuning.

  _Soheil Abbasloo_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  What does it truly mean for a language model to "reason"? Most current evaluations and benchmarks reward models' correct standalone answers--but correctness alone reveals little about the process that produced them. In this work, we explore a different perspective: reasoning is not a static chain of steps, but a dynamic trajectory where ideas interact, clash, and evolve into deeper insights. To capture this dynamic, we draw on a well-established philosophical tradition: \textit{dialectics}, where reasoning unfolds through thesis, antithesis, and synthesis. Building on this, we present SIEV, a structured framework that evaluates reasoning of LLMs through dialectics. Unlike conventional evaluations, SIEV assesses not only the conclusion a model reaches, but how it gets there: its ability to resolve tension, integrate distinct ideas, and synthesize higher-order reasoning. This lens uncovers significant reasoning gaps in state-of-the-art models even under saturated benchmarks like GSM and MMLU. For instance, GPT-5-chat, a recent model, loses over 40 points (out of 100) when evaluated with SIEV on GSM. Our findings highlight that adopting a process-oriented, philosophically grounded approach enables a deeper, more rigorous, and more discriminative assessment of LLM reasoning.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) have redefined complex task automation with exceptional generalization capabilities. Despite these advancements, state-of-the-art methods rely on single-strategy prompting, missing the synergy of diverse reasoning approaches. No single strategy excels universally, highlighting the need for frameworks that fuse strategies to maximize performance and ensure robustness. We introduce the Select, Mix, and ReinvenT (SMaRT) framework, an innovative strategy fusion approach designed to overcome this constraint by creating balanced and efficient solutions through the seamless integration of diverse reasoning strategies. Unlike existing methods, which employ LLMs merely as evaluators, SMaRT uses them as intelligent integrators, unlocking the "best of all worlds" across tasks. Extensive empirical evaluations across benchmarks in reasoning, planning, and sequential decision-making highlight the robustness and adaptability of SMaRT. The framework consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in solution quality, constraint adherence, and performance metrics. This work redefines LLM-driven decision-making by pioneering a new paradigm in cross-strategy calibration, unlocking superior outcomes for reasoning systems and advancing the boundaries of self-refining methodologies.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  A central challenge in large language model inference is the trade-off between generation speed and output quality. Autoregressive models produce high-quality text but generate tokens sequentially. Diffusion models can generate tokens in parallel but often need many iterations to match the same quality. We propose planned diffusion, a hybrid method that combines the strengths of both paradigms. Planned diffusion works in two stages: first, the model creates a short autoregressive plan that breaks the output into smaller, independent spans. Second, the model generates these spans simultaneously using diffusion. This approach expands the speed-quality Pareto frontier and provides a practical path to faster, high-quality text generation. On AlpacaEval, a suite of 805 instruction-following prompts, planned diffusion achieves Pareto-optimal trade-off between quality and latency, achieving 1.27x to 1.81x speedup over autoregressive generation with only 0.87\% to 5.4\% drop in win rate, respectively. Our sensitivity analysis shows that the planning mechanism of planned diffusion is minimal and reliable, and simple runtime knobs exist to provide flexible control of the quality-latency trade-off.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) deliver powerful reasoning and generation capabilities but incur substantial run-time costs when operating in agentic workflows that chain together lengthy prompts and process rich data streams. We introduce CompactPrompt, an end-to-end pipeline that merges hard prompt compression with lightweight file-level data compression. CompactPrompt first prunes low-information tokens from prompts using self-information scoring and dependency-based phrase grouping. In parallel, it applies n-gram abbreviation to recurrent textual patterns in attached documents and uniform quantization to numerical columns, yielding compact yet semantically faithful representations. Integrated into standard LLM agents, CompactPrompt reduces total token usage and inference cost by up to 60% on benchmark dataset like TAT-QA and FinQA, while preserving output quality (Results in less than 5% accuracy drop for Claude-3.5-Sonnet, and GPT-4.1-Mini) CompactPrompt helps visualize real-time compression decisions and quantify cost-performance trade-offs, laying the groundwork for leaner generative AI pipelines.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable reasoning capabilities in mathematical and scientific tasks. To enhance complex reasoning, multi-agent systems have been proposed to harness the collective intelligence of LLM agents. However, existing collaboration structures are either predefined or rely on majority voting or round-table debates, which can suppress correct but less dominant agent contributions. Recent approaches model multi-agent systems as graph networks but optimize purely for agent performance, neglecting the quality of interactions. We hypothesize that effective agent communication is crucial for multi-agent reasoning and that debating quality plays a significant role. To address this, we propose $\ours$, a multi-agent verbal reinforcement learning algorithm that dynamically constructs and refines multi-agent collaboration structures. Our method defines action spaces and a feedback mechanism that evaluates communication robustness and coherence throughout the debate. The final decision is achieved through a majority vote over all the agents. We assess $\ours$ on various reasoning tasks, including mathematical reasoning, creative writing, scientific reasoning, and numerical sorting. Results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms single-agent prompting methods and state-of-the-art multi-agent frameworks on diverse tasks.

  Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as agents, expected to decompose goals, invoke tools, and verify results in dynamic environments. Realizing these capabilities requires access to agentic data- structured interaction records that couple user intents with tool specifications, argument-grounded calls, and verifiable execution traces. However, collecting such data from human annotators is costly, time-consuming, and difficult to scale.We present a unified framework for synthesizing agentic data using only LLMs, without any human-in-the-loop supervision. This framework decomposes generation into modular pipelines that produce complete interaction records spanning task specifications, tool definitions, policy pseudocode, natural language exchanges, and execution traces. Records conform to strict syntactic and semantic constraints, ensuring machine-parseability and faithful alignment across inputs, outputs, and tool calls.Beyond single tasks, there is support for both multi-task and multi-turn agent interactions, enabling the construction of datasets that reflect the full spectrum of tool-use competencies. To ensure quality and consistency, the framework integrates constrained generation formats, JSON-schema validation, and judge-based filtering.This paper formalizes the schema for agentic records, details the prompt design principles that guide generation, and introduces scalable pipelines for high-quality synthetic data. By providing a reproducible, LLM-only alternative to manual collection, hence advancing the development of agentic LLMs capable of robust tool use.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multi turn intent understanding is central to task oriented chatbots, yet real deployments face tight token budgets and noisy contexts, and most retrieval pipelines emphasize relevance while overlooking set level diversity and confounds such as more context or exemplar order. We ask whether retrieval diversity, rather than longer prompts, systematically improves LLM intent understanding under fixed budgets. We present a diversity aware retrieval framework that selects in context exemplars to balance intent coverage and linguistic variety, and integrates this selection with standard LLM decoders; the evaluation enforces budget matched prompts and randomized positions, and includes sensitivity analyses over exemplar count, diversity strength, and backbone size. On MultiWOZ 2.4 and SGD, the approach achieves strong gains in Joint Goal Accuracy under equal token budgets, surpassing strong LLM/DST baselines, with consistent improvements across K from 4 to 7 and moderate latency. Overall, the study isolates and validates the impact of content diversity in retrieval and offers a simple, deployable selection principle for building accurate, budget constrained multi turn intent systems.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The proliferation of Large Language Model (LLM) architectures presents a fundamental challenge: valuable, task-specific behaviors learned through fine-tuning methods like Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) are effectively trapped within their source model's architecture, herein referred to architectural lock-in. Existing transfer methods attempt to bridge this gap by aligning the static weight spaces of models, a brittle and indirect approach that relies on tenuous correlations between parameter geometries. This paper introduces a fundamentally different and more direct paradigm: the Cartridge Activation Space Transfer (CAST), a novel framework that liberates LoRA-encoded behaviors by learning a direct, nonlinear mapping between the activation manifolds, the geometric structures formed by the model's internal neuron activations, of two distinct LLM architectures. CAST treats a pre-trained LoRA as a frozen "behavioral kernel." It learns a set of lightweight, bidirectional projection heads that translate the target model's activation stream into the source model's latent space, apply the frozen kernel, and project the result back. This process, trained on a general text corpus without any task-specific data, effectively decouples the learned skill from the source architecture. We demonstrate that CAST enables true "zero-shot" translation of any standard LoRA adapter. Our experiments, including transfers between heterogeneous model families like Llama-2 and Mistral, show that CAST-translated adapters achieve 85-95\% of the performance of a LoRA fully retrained on the target model, quantitatively outperforming current weight-space transfer techniques and establishing a new state-of-the-art in model interoperability.

  We study a web-deployed, tool-augmented LLM health coach with real users. In a pilot with seven users (280 rated turns), offline policy evaluation (OPE) over factorized decision heads (Tool/Style) shows that a uniform heavy-tool policy raises average value on logs but harms specific subgroups, most notably low-health-literacy/high-self-efficacy users. A lightweight simulator with hidden archetypes further shows that adding a small early information-gain bonus reliably shortens trait identification and improves goal success and pass@3. Together, these early findings indicate an evaluation-first path to personalization: freeze the generator, learn subgroup-aware decision heads on typed rewards (objective tool outcomes and satisfaction), and always report per-archetype metrics to surface subgroup harms that averages obscure.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Uncertain knowledge graphs (UKGs) associate each triple with a confidence score to provide more precise knowledge representations. Recently, since real-world UKGs suffer from the incompleteness, uncertain knowledge graph (UKG) completion attracts more attention, aiming to complete missing triples and confidences. Current studies attempt to learn UKG embeddings to solve this problem, but they neglect the extremely imbalanced distributions of triple confidences. This causes that the learnt embeddings are insufficient to high-quality UKG completion. Thus, in this paper, to address the above issue, we propose a new semi-supervised Confidence Distribution Learning (ssCDL) method for UKG completion, where each triple confidence is transformed into a confidence distribution to introduce more supervision information of different confidences to reinforce the embedding learning process. ssCDL iteratively learns UKG embedding by relational learning on labeled data (i.e., existing triples with confidences) and unlabeled data with pseudo labels (i.e., unseen triples with the generated confidences), which are predicted by meta-learning to augment the training data and rebalance the distribution of triple confidences. Experiments on two UKG datasets demonstrate that ssCDL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in different evaluation metrics.

  Tool-augmented large language models (LLMs) are emerging as deep research agents, systems that decompose complex queries, retrieve external evidence, and synthesize grounded responses. Yet current agents remain limited by shallow retrieval, weak alignment metrics, and brittle tool-use behavior. We introduce PokeeResearch-7B, a 7B-parameter deep research agent built under a unified reinforcement learning framework for robustness, alignment, and scalability. PokeeResearch-7B is trained by an annotation-free Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF) framework to optimize policies using LLM-based reward signals that capture factual accuracy, citation faithfulness, and instruction adherence. A chain-of-thought-driven multi-call reasoning scaffold further enhances robustness through self-verification and adaptive recovery from tool failures. Among 10 popular deep research benchmarks, PokeeResearch-7B achieves state-of-the-art performance among 7B-scale deep research agents. This highlights that careful reinforcement learning and reasoning design can produce efficient, resilient, and research-grade AI agents.

  Aligning language models using LLM judge feedback offers a scalable alternative to human annotation, yet is plagued by judgment inconsistencies that destabilize reinforcement learning. While prior work has focused on judge accuracy, the critical issue of logical coherence particularly preference cycles has been largely unaddressed. To address this gap, this work introduces an end to end framework to systematically detect and resolve these inconsistencies within the reinforcement learning training loop. Our framework features two core contributions: the Conflict Detection Rate (CDR), a novel metric to quantify judgment conflicts, and Deconflicted Graph Rewards (DGR), a signal-purification framework that eliminates cycles before policy optimization. DGR constructs preference graphs from raw judgments, transforms them into conflict-free Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs), and generates a logically coherent reward signal compatible with any policy optimizer. Experiments confirm that our framework significantly improves training stability and model performance over strong baselines, establishing logical consistency as a crucial and now-addressable dimension of AI feedback.

  Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has advanced the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, prevailing RLVR methods exhibit a systematic bias toward exploitation over exploration, as evidenced by improved pass@1 but reduced pass@K (K>1) performance. To understand this issue, we analyze training dynamics of RLVR methods by tracking the token-level probability distributions over vocabulary candidates. Our analysis reveals a consistent probability concentration effect where the top-1 candidate increasingly accumulates probability mass and suppresses that of other candidates. More importantly, stronger over-concentration correlates with worse pass@K performance. Inspired by this finding, we propose Simple Pass@K Optimization (SimKO), a method designed to mitigate the over-concentration issue, thereby encouraging exploration. SimKO operates in an asymmetrical manner. For verified-correct responses, it boosts the probabilities of the top-K candidates. For verified-incorrect responses, it applies stronger penalties to the top-1 candidate. We observe that this asymmetric design is particularly effective at mitigating over-concentration when applied at tokens with high entropy. Across various math and logical-reasoning benchmarks, SimKO consistently yields higher pass@K for a wide range of K, providing a simple way to improve RLVR's exploration.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We study whether self-learning can scale LLM-based agents without relying on human-curated datasets or predefined rule-based rewards. Through controlled experiments in a search-agent setting, we identify two key determinants of scalable agent training: the source of reward signals and the scale of agent task data. We find that rewards from a Generative Reward Model (GRM) outperform rigid rule-based signals for open-domain learning, and that co-evolving the GRM with the policy further boosts performance. Increasing the volume of agent task data-even when synthetically generated-substantially enhances agentic capabilities. Building on these insights, we propose \textbf{Agentic Self-Learning} (ASL), a fully closed-loop, multi-role reinforcement learning framework that unifies task generation, policy execution, and evaluation within a shared tool environment and LLM backbone. ASL coordinates a Prompt Generator, a Policy Model, and a Generative Reward Model to form a virtuous cycle of harder task setting, sharper verification, and stronger solving. Empirically, ASL delivers steady, round-over-round gains, surpasses strong RLVR baselines (e.g., Search-R1) that plateau or degrade, and continues improving under zero-labeled-data conditions, indicating superior sample efficiency and robustness. We further show that GRM verification capacity is the main bottleneck: if frozen, it induces reward hacking and stalls progress; continual GRM training on the evolving data distribution mitigates this, and a small late-stage injection of real verification data raises the performance ceiling. This work establishes reward source and data scale as critical levers for open-domain agent learning and demonstrates the efficacy of multi-role co-evolution for scalable, self-improving agents.

  Large Language Model (LLM) agents are powering a growing share of interactive web applications, yet remain vulnerable to misuse and harm. Prior jailbreak research has largely focused on single-turn prompts, whereas real harassment often unfolds over multi-turn interactions. In this work, we present the Online Harassment Agentic Benchmark consisting of: (i) a synthetic multi-turn harassment conversation dataset, (ii) a multi-agent (e.g., harasser, victim) simulation informed by repeated game theory, (iii) three jailbreak methods attacking agents across memory, planning, and fine-tuning, and (iv) a mixed-methods evaluation framework. We utilize two prominent LLMs, LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct (open-source) and Gemini-2.0-flash (closed-source). Our results show that jailbreak tuning makes harassment nearly guaranteed with an attack success rate of 95.78--96.89% vs. 57.25--64.19% without tuning in Llama, and 99.33% vs. 98.46% without tuning in Gemini, while sharply reducing refusal rate to 1-2% in both models. The most prevalent toxic behaviors are Insult with 84.9--87.8% vs. 44.2--50.8% without tuning, and Flaming with 81.2--85.1% vs. 31.5--38.8% without tuning, indicating weaker guardrails compared to sensitive categories such as sexual or racial harassment. Qualitative evaluation further reveals that attacked agents reproduce human-like aggression profiles, such as Machiavellian/psychopathic patterns under planning, and narcissistic tendencies with memory. Counterintuitively, closed-source and open-source models exhibit distinct escalation trajectories across turns, with closed-source models showing significant vulnerability. Overall, our findings show that multi-turn and theory-grounded attacks not only succeed at high rates but also mimic human-like harassment dynamics, motivating the development of robust safety guardrails to ultimately keep online platforms safe and responsible.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in risk-sensitive applications such as real-world open-ended question answering (QA), ensuring the trustworthiness of their outputs has become critical. Existing selective conformal prediction (SCP) methods provide statistical guarantees by constructing prediction sets with a constrained miscoverage rate for correct answers. However, prior works unrealistically assume that admissible answers for all instances can be obtained via finite sampling, even for open-ended QA scenarios that lack a fixed and finite solution space. To address this, we introduce a two-stage risk control framework comprising abstention-aware sampling and conformalized filtering (SAFER). Firstly, on a held-out calibration set, SAFER calibrates a sampling budget within the maximum sampling cap, using the Clopper-Pearson exact method at a user-desired risk level (i.e., the maximum allowable miscoverage rate of the sampling sets). If the risk level cannot be satisfied within the cap, we abstain; otherwise, the calibrated sampling budget becomes the minimum requirements at test time. Then, we employ calibration instances where correct answers are attainable under the calibrated budget and apply the conformal risk control method to determine a statistically valid uncertainty threshold, which filters unreliable distractors from the candidate set for each test data point. In this stage, SAFER introduces an additional risk level to guide the calculation of the threshold, thereby controlling the risk of correct answers being excluded. Furthermore, we show that SAFER is compatible with various task-specific admission criteria and calibration-test split ratios, highlighting its robustness and high data efficiency.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a powerful paradigm to improve Large Language Models on reasoning tasks such as coding, math or logic. To assess the reasoning boundary (the fraction of problems a model can solve) researchers often report Pass@k at large sampling budgets. Recent results reveal a crossover phenomenon: while RLVR models outperform the base model at small k values, the base model usually outperforms them when sampling a very large number of completions. This has been interpreted as evidence that base models have a larger reasoning boundary. We argue that on tasks with discrete answer spaces, such as math with numeric outputs, Pass@k at large k reflects the increasingly higher chance of success in the limit of the number of trials rather than genuine reasoning, and can therefore be misleading. We propose Cover@tau, which measures the fraction of problems that a model can solve for which at least a tau proportion of completions are correct. Unlike Pass@k, Cover@tau captures reasoning under an explicit reliability threshold: models that rely on random guessing degrade rapidly as tau increases. We evaluate several RLVR models using Cover@tau-based metrics and illustrate how the relative rankings of popular algorithms change compared to Pass@1, offering a different perspective on reasoning boundaries.

  Recent trends in test-time scaling for reasoning models (e.g., OpenAI o1, DeepSeek-R1) have led to remarkable improvements through long Chain-of-Thought (CoT). However, existing benchmarks mainly focus on immediate, single-horizon tasks, failing to adequately evaluate models' ability to understand and respond to complex, long-horizon scenarios. To address this incomplete evaluation of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), we propose R-HORIZON, a method designed to stimulate long-horizon reasoning behaviors in LRMs through query composition. Based on R-HORIZON, we construct a long-horizon reasoning benchmark, comprising complex multi-step reasoning tasks with interdependent problems that span long reasoning horizons. Through comprehensive evaluation of LRMs using the R-HORIZON benchmark, we find that even the most advanced LRMs suffer significant performance degradation. Our analysis reveals that LRMs exhibit limited effective reasoning length and struggle to allocate thinking budget across multiple problems appropriately. Recognizing these limitations, we use R-HORIZON to construct long-horizon reasoning data for reinforcement learning with verified rewards (RLVR). Compared to training with single-horizon data, RLVR with R-HORIZON not only substantially improves performance on the multi-horizon reasoning tasks, but also promotes accuracy on standard reasoning tasks, with an increase of 7.5 on AIME2024. These results position R-HORIZON as a scalable, controllable, and low-cost paradigm for enhancing and evaluating the long-horizon reasoning capabilities of LRMs.

  Despite their strong performance on reasoning tasks, large reasoning models (LRMs) often suffer from overthinking, producing unnecessarily long outputs and incurring high end-to-end latency, a significant limitation to their real-world deployment. To address overthinking, early-exit mechanisms have been proposed to terminate reasoning before typical completion, showing that this approach can effectively shorten generation length with minimal impact on accuracy. However, their reliance on probing mechanisms introduces a detection overhead that limits their end-to-end latency gains and compromises their generalizability across diverse problems. Inspired by the use of hidden states in speculative decoding, we propose SpecExit, a novel framework that predicts both future tokens and an early-exit signal directly from a lightweight draft model without probing overhead. Our method offers significant improvements, reducing average generation length by 66\% and achieving a 2.5x speedup in end-to-end latency compared to the speculative decoding baseline, without compromising accuracy. Our method leverages the inherent signals from hidden states to provide effective early-exit signals, suggesting broader use of hidden states for efficient reasoning.

  We introduce transductive program synthesis, a new formulation of the program synthesis task that explicitly leverages test inputs during synthesis. While prior approaches to program synthesis--whether based on natural language descriptions or input-output examples--typically aim to generalize from training examples, they often struggle with robustness, especially in real-world settings where training examples are limited and test inputs involve various edge cases. To address this, we propose a novel framework that improves robustness by treating synthesis as an active learning over a finite hypothesis class defined by programs' outputs. We use an LLM to predict outputs for selected test inputs and eliminate inconsistent hypotheses, where the inputs are chosen via a greedy maximin algorithm to minimize the number of LLM queries required. We evaluate our approach on four benchmarks: Playgol, MBPP+, 1D-ARC, and programmatic world modeling on MiniGrid. We demonstrate that our method significantly improves program synthesis in both accuracy and efficiency. We release our code atthis https URL.

  Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in various domains, showing impressive potential on different tasks. Recently, reasoning LLMs have been proposed to improve the \textit{reasoning} or \textit{thinking} capabilities of LLMs to solve complex problems. Despite the promising results of reasoning LLMs, enhancing the multi-step reasoning capabilities of LLMs still remains a significant challenge. While existing optimization methods have advanced the LLM reasoning capabilities, they often treat reasoning trajectories as a whole, without considering the underlying critical steps within the trajectory. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{G}uided \textbf{P}ivotal \textbf{O}ptimization (GPO), a novel fine-tuning strategy that dives into the reasoning process to enable more effective improvements. GPO first identifies the `critical step' within a reasoning trajectory - a point that the model must carefully proceed to succeed at the problem. We locate the critical step by estimating the advantage function. GPO then resets the policy to the critical step, samples the new rollout and prioritizes the learning process on those rollouts. This focus allows the model to learn more effectively from pivotal moments within the reasoning process to improve the reasoning performance. We demonstrate that GPO is a general strategy that can be integrated with various optimization methods to improve reasoning performance. Besides theoretical analysis, our experiments across challenging reasoning benchmarks show that GPO can consistently and significantly enhance the performance of existing optimization methods, showcasing its effectiveness and generalizability in improving LLM reasoning by concentrating on pivotal moments within the generation process.

  While activation steering in large language models (LLMs) is a growing area of research, methods can often incur broader effects than desired. This motivates isolation of purer concept vectors to enable targeted interventions and understand LLM behavior at a more granular level. We present RepIt, a simple and data-efficient framework for isolating concept-specific representations. Across five frontier LLMs, RepIt enables precise interventions: it selectively suppresses refusal on targeted concepts while preserving refusal elsewhere, producing models that answer WMD-related questions while still scoring as safe on standard benchmarks. We further show that the corrective signal localizes to just 100-200 neurons and that robust target representations can be extracted from as few as a dozen examples on a single A6000. This efficiency raises a dual concern: manipulations can be performed with modest compute and data to extend to underrepresented data-scarce topics while evading existing benchmarks. By disentangling refusal vectors with RepIt, this work demonstrates that targeted interventions can counteract overgeneralization, laying the foundation for more granular control of model behavior.

  Large language models (LLMs) face persistent challenges when handling long-context tasks, most notably the lost in the middle issue, where information located in the middle of a long input tends to be underutilized. Some existing methods that reduce input have the risk of discarding key information, while others that extend context windows often lead to attention dispersion. To address these limitations, we propose Tree of Agents (TOA), a multi-agent reasoning framework that segments the input into chunks processed by independent agents. Each agent generates its local cognition, then agents dynamically exchange information for collaborative reasoning along tree-structured paths. TOA enables agents to probe different reasoning orders for multi-perspective understanding, effectively mitigating position bias and reducing hallucinations. To improve processing efficiency, we incorporate prefix-hash caching and adaptive pruning strategies, achieving significant performance improvements with comparable API overhead. Experiments show that TOA, powered by compact LLaMA3.1-8B, significantly outperforms multiple baselines and demonstrates comparable performance to the latest and much larger commercial models, such as Gemini1.5-pro, on various long-context tasks.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in automated code generation but frequently produce code that fails formal verification, an essential requirement for hardware and safety-critical domains. To overcome this fundamental limitation, we previously proposed PREFACE, a model-agnostic framework based on reinforcement learning (RL) that iteratively repairs the prompts provided to frozen LLMs, systematically steering them toward generating formally verifiable Dafny code without costly fine-tuning. This work presents Proof2Silicon, a novel end-to-end synthesis framework that embeds the previously proposed PREFACE flow to enable the generation of correctness-by-construction hardware directly from natural language specifications. Proof2Silicon operates by: (1) leveraging PREFACE's verifier-driven RL agent to optimize prompt generation iteratively, ensuring Dafny code correctness; (2) automatically translating verified Dafny programs into synthesizable high-level C using Dafny's Python backend and PyLog; and (3) employing Vivado HLS to produce RTL implementations. Evaluated rigorously on a challenging 100-task benchmark, PREFACE's RL-guided prompt optimization consistently improved Dafny verification success rates across diverse LLMs by up to 21%. Crucially, Proof2Silicon achieved an end-to-end hardware synthesis success rate of up to 72%, generating RTL designs through Vivado HLS synthesis flows. These results demonstrate a robust, scalable, and automated pipeline for LLM-driven, formally verified hardware synthesis, bridging natural-language specification and silicon realization.

  We introduce ComputerRL, a framework for autonomous desktop intelligence that enables agents to operate complex digital workspaces skillfully. ComputerRL features the API-GUI paradigm, which unifies programmatic API calls and direct GUI interaction to address the inherent mismatch between machine agents and human-centric desktop environments. Scaling end-to-end RL training is crucial for improvement and generalization across diverse desktop tasks; however, it remains challenging due to environmental inefficiency and instability during extended training. To support scalable and robust training, we develop a distributed RL infrastructure capable of orchestrating thousands of parallel virtual desktop environments to accelerate large-scale online RL. Furthermore, we propose Entropulse, a training strategy that alternates reinforcement learning with supervised fine-tuning, effectively mitigating entropy collapse during extended training runs. We employ ComputerRL on open models GLM-4-9B-0414 and GLM-4.1V-9B-Thinking, and evaluate them on the OSWorld benchmark. The AutoGLM-OS-9B achieves a new state-of-the-art accuracy of 48.9%, demonstrating significant improvements for general agents in desktop automation. Our code and the new OfficeWorld benchmark are available atthis https URL. The algorithm and framework are adopted in building AutoGLM (Liu et al., 2024b).

  With the rapid development of mobile intelligent assistant technologies, multi-modal AI assistants have become essential interfaces for daily user interactions. However, current evaluation methods face challenges including high manual costs, inconsistent standards, and subjective bias. This paper proposes an automated multi-modal evaluation framework based on large language models and multi-agent collaboration. The framework employs a three-tier agent architecture consisting of interaction evaluation agents, semantic verification agents, and experience decision agents. Through supervised fine-tuning on the Qwen3-8B model, we achieve a significant evaluation matching accuracy with human experts. Experimental results on eight major intelligent agents demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in predicting users' satisfaction and identifying generation defects.

  Uncovering hidden symbolic laws from time series data, as an aspiration dating back to Kepler's discovery of planetary motion, remains a core challenge in scientific discovery and artificial intelligence. While Large Language Models show promise in structured reasoning tasks, their ability to infer interpretable, context-aligned symbolic structures from time series data is still underexplored. To systematically evaluate this capability, we introduce SymbolBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to assess symbolic reasoning over real-world time series across three tasks: multivariate symbolic regression, Boolean network inference, and causal discovery. Unlike prior efforts limited to simple algebraic equations, SymbolBench spans a diverse set of symbolic forms with varying complexity. We further propose a unified framework that integrates LLMs with genetic programming to form a closed-loop symbolic reasoning system, where LLMs act both as predictors and evaluators. Our empirical results reveal key strengths and limitations of current models, highlighting the importance of combining domain knowledge, context alignment, and reasoning structure to improve LLMs in automated scientific discovery.

  Large Language Models have been shown to contain extensive world knowledge in their parameters, enabling impressive performance on many knowledge intensive tasks. However, when deployed in novel settings, LLMs often encounter situations where they must integrate parametric knowledge with new or unfamiliar information. In this work, we explore whether LLMs can combine knowledge in-context with their parametric knowledge through the lens of counterfactual reasoning. Through synthetic and real experiments in multi-hop reasoning problems, we show that LLMs generally struggle with counterfactual reasoning, often resorting to exclusively using their parametric knowledge. Moreover, we show that simple post-hoc finetuning can struggle to instill counterfactual reasoning ability -- often leading to degradation in stored parametric knowledge. Ultimately, our work reveals important limitations of current LLM's abilities to re-purpose parametric knowledge in novel settings.

  Coordinating multiple embodied agents in dynamic environments remains a core challenge in artificial intelligence, requiring both perception-driven reasoning and scalable cooperation strategies. While recent works have leveraged large language models (LLMs) for multi-agent planning, a few have begun to explore vision-language models (VLMs) for visual reasoning. However, these VLM-based approaches remain limited in their support for diverse embodiment types. In this work, we introduce VIKI-Bench, the first hierarchical benchmark tailored for embodied multi-agent cooperation, featuring three structured levels: agent activation, task planning, and trajectory perception. VIKI-Bench includes diverse robot embodiments, multi-view visual observations, and structured supervision signals to evaluate reasoning grounded in visual inputs. To demonstrate the utility of VIKI-Bench, we propose VIKI-R, a two-stage framework that fine-tunes a pretrained vision-language model (VLM) using Chain-of-Thought annotated demonstrations, followed by reinforcement learning under multi-level reward signals. Our extensive experiments show that VIKI-R significantly outperforms baselines method across all task levels. Furthermore, we show that reinforcement learning enables the emergence of compositional cooperation patterns among heterogeneous agents. Together, VIKI-Bench and VIKI-R offer a unified testbed and method for advancing multi-agent, visual-driven cooperation in embodied AI systems.

  Building credible simulators from data is difficult because structure design, parameter calibration, and out-of-distribution (OOD) robustness are tightly coupled. We introduce SOCIA (Simulation Orchestration for Computational Intelligence with Agents), a framework that treats simulator construction as joint structure-parameter co-optimization: it elicits mechanism-rich blueprints, exposes explicit tunable parameters, and instantiates a calibration schema, producing an executable simulator with built-in calibration hooks. SOCIA couples Bayesian Optimization for sample-efficient point calibration with Simulation-Based Inference for uncertainty-aware fitting; diagnostics trigger targeted structural edits in an outer refinement loop to co-optimize design and parameters under tight budgets. Across three diverse tasks, SOCIA consistently outperforms strong baselines, excelling on both in-distribution (ID) fitting and OOD shift. Ablations that weaken structure, calibration design, or tuning yield near-monotone degradations, underscoring the necessity of unified structure-parameter optimization. We will release the code soon.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Offline reinforcement learning (RL) aims to learn a policy from a static dataset without further interactions with the environment. Collecting sufficiently large datasets for offline RL is exhausting since this data collection requires colossus interactions with environments and becomes tricky when the interaction with the environment is restricted. Hence, how an agent learns the best policy with a minimal static dataset is a crucial issue in offline RL, similar to the sample efficiency problem in online RL. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective plug-and-play pretraining method to initialize a feature of a Q-network to enhance data efficiency in offline RL. Specifically, we introduce a shared Q-network structure that outputs predictions of the next state and Q-value. We pretrain the shared Q-network through a supervised regression task that predicts a next state and trains the shared Q-network using diverse offline RL methods. Through extensive experiments, we empirically demonstrate that our method enhances the performance of existing popular offline RL methods on the D4RL, Robomimic and V-D4RL benchmarks. Furthermore, we show that our method significantly boosts data-efficient offline RL across various data qualities and data distributions trough D4RL and ExoRL benchmarks. Notably, our method adapted with only 10% of the dataset outperforms standard algorithms even with full datasets.

  Being able to cooperate with diverse humans is an important component of many economically valuable AI tasks, from household robotics to autonomous driving. However, generalizing to novel humans requires training on data that captures the diversity of human behaviors. Adversarial training is a promising method that allows dynamic data generation and ensures that agents are robust. It creates a feedback loop where the agent's performance influences the generation of new adversarial data, which can be used immediately to train the agent. However, adversarial training is difficult to apply in a cooperative task; how can we train an adversarial cooperator? We propose a novel strategy that combines a pretrained generative model to simulate valid cooperative agent policies with adversarial training to maximize regret. We call our method GOAT: Generative Online Adversarial Training. In this framework, the GOAT dynamically searches the latent space of the generative model for coordination strategies where the learning policy, the Cooperator agent, underperforms. GOAT enables better generalization by exposing the Cooperator to various challenging interaction scenarios. We maintain realistic coordination strategies by keeping the generative model frozen, thus avoiding adversarial exploitation. We evaluate GOAT with real human partners, and the results demonstrate state of the art performance on the Overcooked benchmark, highlighting its effectiveness in generalizing to diverse human behaviors.

  Standard Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) relies on chunk-based retrieval, whereas GraphRAG advances this approach by graph-based knowledge representation. However, existing graph-based RAG approaches are constrained by binary relations, as each edge in an ordinary graph connects only two entities, limiting their ability to represent the n-ary relations (n >= 2) in real-world knowledge. In this work, we propose HyperGraphRAG, a novel hypergraph-based RAG method that represents n-ary relational facts via hyperedges, and consists of knowledge hypergraph construction, retrieval, and generation. Experiments across medicine, agriculture, computer science, and law demonstrate that HyperGraphRAG outperforms both standard RAG and previous graph-based RAG methods in answer accuracy, retrieval efficiency, and generation quality.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The ability of artificial intelligence agents to make optimal decisions and generalise them to different domains and tasks is compromised in complex scenarios. One way to address this issue has focused on learning efficient representations of the world and on how the actions of agents affect them in state-action transitions. Whereas such representations are procedurally efficient, they lack structural richness. To address this problem, we propose to enhance the agent's ontology and extend the traditional conceptualisation of trajectories to provide a more nuanced view of task execution. Structurally Enriched Trajectories (SETs) extend the encoding of sequences of states and their transitions by incorporating hierarchical relations between objects, interactions, and affordances. SETs are built as multi-level graphs, providing a detailed representation of the agent dynamics and a transferable functional abstraction of the task. SETs are integrated into an architecture, Structurally Enriched Trajectory Learning and Encoding (SETLE), that employs a heterogeneous graph-based memory structure of multi-level relational dependencies essential for generalisation. We demonstrate that SETLE can support downstream tasks, enabling agents to recognise task relevant structural patterns across CREATE and MiniGrid environments. Finally, we integrate SETLE with reinforcement learning and show measurable improvements in downstream performance, including breakthrough success rates in complex, sparse-reward tasks.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As AI systems advance beyond human capabilities, scalable oversight becomes critical: how can we supervise AI that exceeds our abilities? A key challenge is that human evaluators may form incorrect beliefs about AI behavior in complex tasks, leading to unreliable feedback and poor value inference. To address this, we propose modeling evaluators' beliefs to interpret their feedback more reliably. We formalize human belief models, analyze their theoretical role in value learning, and characterize when ambiguity remains. To reduce reliance on precise belief models, we introduce "belief model covering" as a relaxation. This motivates our preliminary proposal to use the internal representations of adapted foundation models to mimic human evaluators' beliefs. These representations could be used to learn correct values from human feedback even when evaluators misunderstand the AI's behavior. Our work suggests that modeling human beliefs can improve value learning and outlines practical research directions for implementing this approach to scalable oversight.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools in mathematical theorem proving, particularly when utilizing formal languages such as LEAN. A prevalent proof method involves the LLM prover iteratively constructing the proof tactic by tactic, typically following a best-first search scheme. However, this method often ignores the critical preference information inside the existing tactic trajectories, hindering the search for deeper proofs. We propose an intuitive yet effective method, which utilizes a critic model to capture the preference information and to guide the search of the prover model at runtime. Given the prover-critic framework, a large-scale expert iteration with more than 20,000 CPU days is then applied to further fine-tune the prover and the critic. The trained InternLM2.5-StepProver critic significantly boosts the performance of the prover model (59.4% to 65.9%). We also analyze the impact of the critic on various aspects of the theorem proving process during expert iteration, providing insights into its effectiveness.

- **[Counterfactual Effect Decomposition in Multi-Agent Sequential Decision Making](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12539)**  `arXiv:2410.12539`

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We address the challenge of explaining counterfactual outcomes in multi-agent Markov decision processes. In particular, we aim to explain the total counterfactual effect of an agent's action on the outcome of a realized scenario through its influence on the environment dynamics and the agents' behavior. To achieve this, we introduce a novel causal explanation formula that decomposes the counterfactual effect by attributing to each agent and state variable a score reflecting their respective contributions to the effect. First, we show that the total counterfactual effect of an agent's action can be decomposed into two components: one measuring the effect that propagates through all subsequent agents' actions and another related to the effect that propagates through the state transitions. Building on recent advancements in causal contribution analysis, we further decompose these two effects as follows. For the former, we consider agent-specific effects -- a causal concept that quantifies the counterfactual effect of an agent's action that propagates through a subset of agents. Based on this notion, we use Shapley value to attribute the effect to individual agents. For the latter, we consider the concept of structure-preserving interventions and attribute the effect to state variables based on their "intrinsic" contributions. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate the interpretability of our approach in a Gridworld environment with LLM-assisted agents and a sepsis management simulator.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Modeling large-scale time series has gained significant attention in recent years. However, its direct application in finance remains challenging due to substantial differences in data characteristics across domains. Specifically, financial systems feature inherent stochasticity and low signal-to-noise ratios, rendering traditional methods and pre-training approaches ineffective. This underscores the urgent need for a foundation model tailored to financial time series. To bridge this gap, we propose \textbf{LENS}, a pre-trained model for this domain. \textbf{LENS} effectively captures the complexity of financial stochastic systems through a carefully crafted model architecture and mitigates noise during pre-training by using an invertible embedding module. We provide a rigorous theoretical explanation of the model's effectiveness and validate its performance through extensive experiments. Pre-trained on a dataset comprising 100 billion financial observations, \textbf{LENS} achieves exceptional results across a wide range of critical downstream tasks. Moreover, our work offers practical insights into developing pre-trained time series models in high-noise environments, paving the way for further advancements in this pivotal research domain.

  _Lovis Heindrich, Falk Lieder_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The decisions of individuals and organizations are often suboptimal because fully rational decision-making is too demanding in the real world. Recent work suggests that some errors can be prevented by leveraging artificial intelligence to discover and teach clever heuristics. So far, this line of research has been limited to simplified, artificial decision-making tasks. This article is the first to extend this approach to a real-world decision problem, namely, executives deciding which project their organization should launch next. We develop a computational method (MGPS) that automatically discovers project selection strategies that are optimized for real people, and we develop an intelligent tutor that teaches the discovered project selection procedures. We evaluated MGPS on a computational benchmark and tested the intelligent tutor in a training experiment with two control conditions. MGPS outperformed a state-of-the-art method and was more computationally efficient. Moreover, people who practiced with our intelligent tutor learned significantly better project selection strategies than the control groups. These findings suggest that AI could be used to automate the process of discovering and formalizing the cognitive strategies taught by intelligent tutoring systems.

  _Akshat Gupta, Jay Yeung, Gopala Anumanchipalli, Anna Ivanova_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Growing evidence suggests that large language models do not use their depth uniformly, yet we still lack a fine-grained understanding of their layer-wise prediction dynamics. In this paper, we trace the intermediate representations of several open-weight models during inference and reveal a structured and nuanced use of depth. Specifically, we propose a "Guess-then-Refine" framework that explains how LLMs internally structure their computations to make predictions. We first show that the top-ranked predictions in early LLM layers are composed primarily of high-frequency tokens, which act as statistical guesses proposed by the model early on due to the lack of appropriate contextual information. As contextual information develops deeper into the model, these initial guesses get refined into contextually appropriate tokens. Even high-frequency token predictions from early layers get refined >70% of the time, indicating that correct token prediction is not "one-and-done". We then go beyond frequency-based prediction to examine the dynamic usage of layer depth across three case studies. (i) Part-of-speech analysis shows that function words are, on average, the earliest to be predicted correctly. (ii) Fact recall task analysis shows that, in a multi-token answer, the first token requires more computational depth than the rest. (iii) Multiple-choice task analysis shows that the model identifies the format of the response within the first half of the layers, but finalizes its response only toward the end. Together, our results provide a detailed view of depth usage in LLMs, shedding light on the layer-by-layer computations that underlie successful predictions and providing insights for future works to improve computational efficiency in transformer-based models.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Despite their remarkable capabilities, Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle to effectively leverage historical interaction information in dynamic and complex environments. Memory systems enable LLMs to move beyond stateless interactions by introducing persistent information storage, retrieval, and utilization mechanisms. However, existing memory systems often introduce substantial time and computational overhead. To this end, we introduce a new memory system called LightMem, which strikes a balance between the performance and efficiency of memory systems. Inspired by the Atkinson-Shiffrin model of human memory, LightMem organizes memory into three complementary stages. First, cognition-inspired sensory memory rapidly filters irrelevant information through lightweight compression and groups information according to their topics. Next, topic-aware short-term memory consolidates these topic-based groups, organizing and summarizing content for more structured access. Finally, long-term memory with sleep-time update employs an offline procedure that decouples consolidation from online inference. Experiments on LongMemEval with GPT and Qwen backbones show that LightMem outperforms strong baselines in accuracy (up to 10.9% gains) while reducing token usage by up to 117x, API calls by up to 159x, and runtime by over 12x.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present Ring-1T, the first open-source, state-of-the-art thinking model with a trillion-scale parameter. It features 1 trillion total parameters and activates approximately 50 billion per token. Training such models at a trillion-parameter scale introduces unprecedented challenges, including train-inference misalignment, inefficiencies in rollout processing, and bottlenecks in the RL system. To address these, we pioneer three interconnected innovations: (1) IcePop stabilizes RL training via token-level discrepancy masking and clipping, resolving instability from training-inference mismatches; (2) C3PO++ improves resource utilization for long rollouts under a token budget by dynamically partitioning them, thereby obtaining high time efficiency; and (3) ASystem, a high-performance RL framework designed to overcome the systemic bottlenecks that impede trillion-parameter model training. Ring-1T delivers breakthrough results across critical benchmarks: 93.4 on AIME-2025, 86.72 on HMMT-2025, 2088 on CodeForces, and 55.94 on ARC-AGI-v1. Notably, it attains a silver medal-level result on the IMO-2025, underscoring its exceptional reasoning capabilities. By releasing the complete 1T parameter MoE model to the community, we provide the research community with direct access to cutting-edge reasoning capabilities. This contribution marks a significant milestone in democratizing large-scale reasoning intelligence and establishes a new baseline for open-source model performance.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Faithfully personalizing large language models (LLMs) to align with individual user preferences is a critical but challenging task. While supervised fine-tuning (SFT) quickly reaches a performance plateau, standard reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) also struggles with the nuances of personalization. Scalar-based reward models are prone to reward hacking which leads to verbose and superficially personalized responses. To address these limitations, we propose Critique-Post-Edit, a robust reinforcement learning framework that enables more faithful and controllable personalization. Our framework integrates two key components: (1) a Personalized Generative Reward Model (GRM) that provides multi-dimensional scores and textual critiques to resist reward hacking, and (2) a Critique-Post-Edit mechanism where the policy model revises its own outputs based on these critiques for more targeted and efficient learning. Under a rigorous length-controlled evaluation, our method substantially outperforms standard PPO on personalization benchmarks. Personalized Qwen2.5-7B achieves an average 11\% win-rate improvement, and personalized Qwen2.5-14B model surpasses the performance of GPT-4.1. These results demonstrate a practical path to faithful, efficient, and controllable personalization.

  _Shuxin Lin, Dhaval Patel, Christodoulos Constantinides_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Small Language Models (SLMs) are becoming increasingly popular in specialized fields, such as industrial applications, due to their efficiency, lower computational requirements, and ability to be fine-tuned for domain-specific tasks, enabling accurate and cost-effective solutions. However, performing complex reasoning using SLMs in specialized fields such as Industry 4.0 remains challenging. In this paper, we propose a knowledge distillation framework for industrial asset health, which transfers reasoning capabilities via Chain-of-Thought (CoT) distillation from Large Language Models (LLMs) to smaller, more efficient models (SLMs). We discuss the advantages and the process of distilling LLMs using multi-choice question answering (MCQA) prompts to enhance reasoning and refine decision-making. We also perform in-context learning to verify the quality of the generated knowledge and benchmark the performance of fine-tuned SLMs with generated knowledge against widely used LLMs. The results show that the fine-tuned SLMs with CoT reasoning outperform the base models by a significant margin, narrowing the gap to their LLM counterparts.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Search agents have achieved significant advancements in enabling intelligent information retrieval and decision-making within interactive environments. Although reinforcement learning has been employed to train agentic models capable of more dynamic interactive retrieval, existing methods are limited by shallow tool-use depth and the accumulation of errors over multiple iterative interactions. In this paper, we present WebSeer, a more intelligent search agent trained via reinforcement learning enhanced with a self-reflection mechanism. Specifically, we construct a large dataset annotated with reflection patterns and design a two-stage training framework that unifies cold start and reinforcement learning within the self-reflection paradigm for real-world web-based environments, which enables the model to generate longer and more reflective tool-use trajectories. Our approach substantially extends tool-use chains and improves answer accuracy. Using a single 14B model, we achieve state-of-the-art results on HotpotQA and SimpleQA, with accuracies of 72.3% and 90.0%, respectively, and demonstrate strong generalization to out-of-distribution datasets.

  Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled progress in agentic coding, where models autonomously reason, plan, and act within interactive software development workflows. However, bridging the gap between static text-based training and dynamic real-world agentic execution remains a core challenge. In this technical report, we present KAT-Coder, a large-scale agentic code model trained through a multi-stage curriculum encompassing Mid-Term Training, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT), and Reinforcement-to-Deployment Adaptation. The Mid-Term stage enhances reasoning, planning, and reflection capabilities through a corpus of real software engineering data and synthetic agentic interactions. The SFT stage constructs a million-sample dataset balancing twenty programming languages, ten development contexts, and ten task archetypes. The RFT stage introduces a novel multi-ground-truth reward formulation for stable and sample-efficient policy optimization. Finally, the Reinforcement-to-Deployment phase adapts the model to production-grade IDE environments using Error-Masked SFT and Tree-Structured Trajectory Training. In summary, these stages enable KAT-Coder to achieve robust tool-use reliability, instruction alignment, and long-context reasoning, forming a deployable foundation for real-world intelligent coding agents. Our KAT series 32B model, KAT-Dev, has been open-sourced onthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  AI is rapidly transforming journalism, but the extent of its use in published newspaper articles remains unclear. We address this gap by auditing a large-scale dataset of 186K articles from online editions of 1.5K American newspapers published in the summer of 2025. Using Pangram, a state-of-the-art AI detector, we discover that approximately 9% of newly-published articles are either partially or fully AI-generated. This AI use is unevenly distributed, appearing more frequently in smaller, local outlets, in specific topics such as weather and technology, and within certain ownership groups. We also analyze 45K opinion pieces from Washington Post, New York Times, and Wall Street Journal, finding that they are 6.4 times more likely to contain AI-generated content than news articles from the same publications, with many AI-flagged op-eds authored by prominent public figures. Despite this prevalence, we find that AI use is rarely disclosed: a manual audit of 100 AI-flagged articles found only five disclosures of AI use. Overall, our audit highlights the immediate need for greater transparency and updated editorial standards regarding the use of AI in journalism to maintain public trust.

  _Taha Binhuraib, Greta Tuckute, Nicholas Blauch_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Spatial functional organization is a hallmark of biological brains: neurons are arranged topographically according to their response properties, at multiple scales. In contrast, representations within most machine learning models lack spatial biases, instead manifesting as disorganized vector spaces that are difficult to visualize and interpret. Here, we propose a novel form of self-attention that turns Transformers into "Topoformers" with topographic organization. We introduce spatial querying - where keys and queries are arranged on 2D grids, and local pools of queries are associated with a given key - and spatial reweighting, where we convert the standard fully connected layer of self-attention into a locally connected layer. We first demonstrate the feasibility of our approach by training a 1-layer Topoformer on a sentiment classification task. Training with spatial querying encourages topographic organization in the queries and keys, and spatial reweighting separately encourages topographic organization in the values and self-attention outputs. We then apply the Topoformer motifs at scale, training a BERT architecture with a masked language modeling objective. We find that the topographic variant performs on par with a non-topographic control model on NLP benchmarks, yet produces interpretable topographic organization as evaluated via eight linguistic test suites. Finally, analyzing an fMRI dataset of human brain responses to a large set of naturalistic sentences, we demonstrate alignment between low-dimensional topographic variability in the Topoformer model and human brain language network. Scaling up Topoformers further holds promise for greater interpretability in NLP research, and for more accurate models of the organization of linguistic information in the human brain.

  _Ming Li_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models demonstrate strong capabilities in single-turn instruction following but suffer from Lost-in-Conversation (LiC), a degradation in performance as information is revealed progressively in multi-turn settings. Motivated by the current progress on Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), we propose Curriculum Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Accuracy and Abstention Rewards (RLAAR), a framework that encourages models not only to generate correct answers, but also to judge the solvability of questions in the multi-turn conversation setting. Our approach employs a competence-gated curriculum that incrementally increases dialogue difficulty (in terms of instruction shards), stabilizing training while promoting reliability. Using multi-turn, on-policy rollouts and a mixed-reward system, RLAAR teaches models to balance problem-solving with informed abstention, reducing premature answering behaviors that cause LiC. Evaluated on LiC benchmarks, RLAAR significantly mitigates LiC performance decay (62.6% to 75.1%) and improves calibrated abstention rates (33.5% to 73.4%). Together, these results provide a practical recipe for building multi-turn reliable and trustworthy LLMs.

  _Josh McGiff, Nikola S. Nikolov_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Fine-tuning is widely used to tailor large language models for specific tasks such as neural machine translation (NMT). However, leveraging transfer learning is computationally expensive when fine-tuning large multilingual models with billions of parameters, thus creating a barrier to entry for researchers working on low-resource domains such as Irish translation. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) bridges this gap by training on a fraction of the original model parameters, with the Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) approach introducing small, trainable adapter layers. We introduce SemiAdapt and SemiLoRA as semi-supervised inference-efficient approaches that strengthen domain adaptation and lead to improved overall performance in NMT. We demonstrate that SemiAdapt can outperform full-domain fine-tuning, while most notably, SemiLoRA can propel PEFT methods to match or even outperform full-model fine-tuning. We further evaluate domain-by-dataset fine-tuning and demonstrate that our embedding-based inference methods perform especially well on larger and noisier corpora. All Irish translation models developed in this work are released as open resources. These methods aim to make high-quality domain adaptation and fine-tuning more accessible to researchers working with low-resource languages.

  The control of speech can be modelled as a dynamical system in which articulators are driven toward target positions. These models are typically evaluated using fleshpoint data, such as electromagnetic articulography (EMA), but recent methodological advances make ultrasound imaging a promising alternative. We evaluate whether the parameters of a linear harmonic oscillator can be reliably estimated from ultrasound tongue kinematics and compare these with parameters estimated from simultaneously-recorded EMA data. We find that ultrasound and EMA yield comparable dynamical parameters, while mandibular short tendon tracking also adequately captures jaw motion. This supports using ultrasound kinematics to evaluate dynamical articulatory models.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Digital dehumanization, although a critical issue, remains largely overlooked within the field of computational linguistics and Natural Language Processing. The prevailing approach in current research concentrating primarily on a single aspect of dehumanization that identifies overtly negative statements as its core marker. This focus, while crucial for understanding harmful online communications, inadequately addresses the broader spectrum of dehumanization. Specifically, it overlooks the subtler forms of dehumanization that, despite not being overtly offensive, still perpetuate harmful biases against marginalized groups in online interactions. These subtler forms can insidiously reinforce negative stereotypes and biases without explicit offensiveness, making them harder to detect yet equally damaging. Recognizing this gap, we use different sampling methods to collect a theory-informed bilingual dataset from Twitter and Reddit. Using crowdworkers and experts to annotate 16,000 instances on a document- and span-level, we show that our dataset covers the different dimensions of dehumanization. This dataset serves as both a training resource for machine learning models and a benchmark for evaluating future dehumanization detection techniques. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we fine-tune ML models on this dataset, achieving performance that surpasses state-of-the-art models in zero and few-shot in-context settings.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models have become the latest trend in natural language processing, heavily featuring in the digital tools we use every day. However, their replies often reflect a narrow cultural viewpoint that overlooks the diversity of global users. This missing capability could be referred to as cultural reasoning, which we define here as the capacity of a model to recognise culture-specific knowledge values and social norms, and to adjust its output so that it aligns with the expectations of individual users. Because culture shapes interpretation, emotional resonance, and acceptable behaviour, cultural reasoning is essential for identity-aware AI. When this capacity is limited or absent, models can sustain stereotypes, ignore minority perspectives, erode trust, and perpetuate hate. Recent empirical studies strongly suggest that current models default to Western norms when judging moral dilemmas, interpreting idioms, or offering advice, and that fine-tuning on survey data only partly reduces this tendency. The present evaluation methods mainly report static accuracy scores and thus fail to capture adaptive reasoning in context. Although broader datasets can help, they cannot alone ensure genuine cultural competence. Therefore, we argue that cultural reasoning must be treated as a foundational capability alongside factual accuracy and linguistic coherence. By clarifying the concept and outlining initial directions for its assessment, a foundation is laid for future systems to be able to respond with greater sensitivity to the complex fabric of human culture.

  Diffusion language models (DLMs) have emerged as a promising alternative to the long-dominant autoregressive (AR) paradigm, offering a parallelable decoding process that could yield greater efficiency. Yet, in practice, current open-source DLMs often underperform their AR counterparts in speed, limiting their real-world utility. This work presents a systematic study of DLM efficiency, identifying key issues in prior evaluation methods. Through empirical benchmarking and a roofline-based theoretical analysis, we demonstrate that AR models generally achieve higher throughput, while DLMs consistently lag. We also investigate acceleration strategies, finding that techniques like dual cache and parallel decoding mainly offer gains at small batch sizes, with their benefits diminishing upon scaling. Our findings underscore the necessity of robust evaluation methods and improved acceleration strategies to advance research on DLMs.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The extraction of pharmacological knowledge from regulatory documents has become a key focus in biomedical natural language processing, with applications ranging from adverse event monitoring to AI-assisted clinical decision support. However, research in this field has predominantly relied on English-language corpora such as DrugBank, leaving a significant gap in resources tailored to other healthcare systems. To address this limitation, we introduce DART (Drug Annotation from Regulatory Texts), the first structured corpus of Italian Summaries of Product Characteristics derived from the official repository of the Italian Medicines Agency (AIFA). The dataset was built through a reproducible pipeline encompassing web-scale document retrieval, semantic segmentation of regulatory sections, and clinical summarization using a few-shot-tuned large language model with low-temperature decoding. DART provides structured information on key pharmacological domains such as indications, adverse drug reactions, and drug-drug interactions. To validate its utility, we implemented an LLM-based drug interaction checker that leverages the dataset to infer clinically meaningful interactions. Experimental results show that instruction-tuned LLMs can accurately infer potential interactions and their clinical implications when grounded in the structured textual fields of DART. We publicly release our code on GitHub:this https URL.

  Online medical forums have long served as vital platforms where patients seek professional healthcare advice, generating vast amounts of valuable knowledge. However, the informal nature and linguistic complexity of forum interactions pose significant challenges for automated question answering systems, especially when dealing with non-English languages. We present two comprehensive Italian medical benchmarks: \textbf{IMB-QA}, containing 782,644 patient-doctor conversations from 77 medical categories, and \textbf{IMB-MCQA}, comprising 25,862 multiple-choice questions from medical specialty examinations. We demonstrate how Large Language Models (LLMs) can be leveraged to improve the clarity and consistency of medical forum data while retaining their original meaning and conversational style, and compare a variety of LLM architectures on both open and multiple-choice question answering tasks. Our experiments with Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and domain-specific fine-tuning reveal that specialized adaptation strategies can outperform larger, general-purpose models in medical question answering tasks. These findings suggest that effective medical AI systems may benefit more from domain expertise and efficient information retrieval than from increased model scale. We release both datasets and evaluation frameworks in our GitHub repository to support further research on multilingual medical question answering:this https URL.

To address this, we developed a WordNet annotated with the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR), integrating its semantic networks with language-proficiency levels. We automated this process using a large language model to measure the semantic similarity between sense definitions in WordNet and entries in the English Vocabulary Profile Online. To validate our method, we constructed a large-scale corpus containing both sense and CEFR-level information from our annotated WordNet and used it to develop contextual lexical classifiers. Our experiments demonstrate that models fine-tuned on our corpus perform comparably to those trained on gold-standard annotations. Furthermore, by combining our corpus with the gold-standard data, we developed a practical classifier that achieves a Macro-F1 score of 0.81, indicating the high accuracy of our annotations. Our annotated WordNet, corpus, and classifiers are publicly available to help bridge the gap between natural language processing and language education, thereby facilitating more effective and efficient language learning.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Attributing the behavior of Transformer models to internal computations is a central challenge in mechanistic interpretability. We introduce DePass, a unified framework for feature attribution based on a single decomposed forward pass. DePass decomposes hidden states into customized additive components, then propagates them with attention scores and MLP's activations fixed. It achieves faithful, fine-grained attribution without requiring auxiliary training. We validate DePass across token-level, model component-level, and subspace-level attribution tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness and fidelity. Our experiments highlight its potential to attribute information flow between arbitrary components of a Transformer model. We hope DePass serves as a foundational tool for broader applications in interpretability.

  Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems are increasingly vital in dynamic domains like online gaming, yet the lack of a dedicated benchmark has impeded standardized evaluation in this area. The core difficulty lies in Dual Dynamics: the constant interplay between game content updates and the shifting focus of the player community. Furthermore, the necessity of automating such a benchmark introduces a critical requirement for player-centric authenticity to ensure generated questions are realistic. To address this integrated challenge, we introduce ChronoPlay, a novel framework for the automated and continuous generation of game RAG benchmarks. ChronoPlay utilizes a dual-dynamic update mechanism to track both forms of change, and a dual-source synthesis engine that draws from official sources and player community to ensure both factual correctness and authentic query patterns. We instantiate our framework on three distinct games to create the first dynamic RAG benchmark for the gaming domain, offering new insights into model performance under these complex and realistic conditions.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models are increasingly used for creative writing and engagement content, raising safety concerns about the outputs. Therefore, casting humor generation as a testbed, this work evaluates how funniness optimization in modern LLM pipelines couples with harmful content by jointly measuring humor, stereotypicality, and toxicity. This is further supplemented by analyzing incongruity signals through information-theoretic metrics. Across six models, we observe that harmful outputs receive higher humor scores which further increase under role-based prompting, indicating a bias amplification loop between generators and evaluators. Information-theoretic analyses show harmful cues widen predictive uncertainty and surprisingly, can even make harmful punchlines more expected for some models, suggesting structural embedding in learned humor distributions. External validation on an additional satire-generation task with human perceived funniness judgments shows that LLM satire increases stereotypicality and typically toxicity, including for closed models. Quantitatively, stereotypical/toxic jokes gain $10-21\%$ in mean humor score, stereotypical jokes appear $11\%$ to $28\%$ more often among the jokes marked funny by LLM-based metric and up to $10\%$ more often in generations perceived as funny by humans.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Hallucination, where models generate fluent text unsupported by visual evidence, remains a major flaw in vision-language models and is particularly critical in sign language translation (SLT). In SLT, meaning depends on precise grounding in video, and gloss-free models are especially vulnerable because they map continuous signer movements directly into natural language without intermediate gloss supervision that serves as alignment. We argue that hallucinations arise when models rely on language priors rather than visual input. To capture this, we propose a token-level reliability measure that quantifies how much the decoder uses visual information. Our method combines feature-based sensitivity, which measures internal changes when video is masked, with counterfactual signals, which capture probability differences between clean and altered video inputs. These signals are aggregated into a sentence-level reliability score, providing a compact and interpretable measure of visual grounding. We evaluate the proposed measure on two SLT benchmarks (PHOENIX-2014T and CSL-Daily) with both gloss-based and gloss-free models. Our results show that reliability predicts hallucination rates, generalizes across datasets and architectures, and decreases under visual degradations. Beyond these quantitative trends, we also find that reliability distinguishes grounded tokens from guessed ones, allowing risk estimation without references; when combined with text-based signals (confidence, perplexity, or entropy), it further improves hallucination risk estimation. Qualitative analysis highlights why gloss-free models are more susceptible to hallucinations. Taken together, our findings establish reliability as a practical and reusable tool for diagnosing hallucinations in SLT, and lay the groundwork for more robust hallucination detection in multimodal generation.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Chain-of-Thought (CoT) is widely applied to improve the LLM capability in math, coding and reasoning tasks. However, its performance is limited for open-domain tasks since there are no clearly defined reasoning steps or logical transitions. To mitigate such challenges, we propose another prompt-based paradigm called Chain of Conceptual Thought (CoCT), where the LLM first tags a concept, then generates the detailed content. The chain of concepts is allowed within the utterance, encouraging the LLM's deep and strategic thinking. We experiment with this paradigm in daily and emotional support conversations where the concept is comprised of emotions, strategies and topics. Automatic, human and model evaluations suggest that CoCT surpasses baselines such as Self-Refine, ECoT, ToT, SoT and RAG, suggesting a potential effective prompt-based paradigm of LLM for a wider scope of tasks.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) now support context windows of hundreds of thousands to millions of tokens, enabling applications such as long-document summarization, large-scale code synthesis, multi-document question answering and persistent multi-turn dialogue. However, such extended contexts exacerbate the quadratic cost of self-attention, leading to severe latency in autoregressive decoding. Existing sparse attention methods alleviate these costs but rely on heuristic patterns that struggle to recall critical key-value (KV) pairs for each query, resulting in accuracy degradation. We introduce Adamas, a lightweight yet highly accurate sparse attention mechanism designed for long-context inference. Adamas applies the Hadamard transform, bucketization and 2-bit compression to produce compact representations, and leverages Manhattan-distance estimation for efficient top-k selections. Experiments show that Adamas matches the accuracy of full attention with only a 64-token budget, achieves near-lossless performance at 128, and supports up to 8x higher sparsity than prior state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods while delivering up to 4.4x self-attention and 1.5x end-to-end speedups on 32K-length sequences. Remarkably, Adamas attains comparable or even lower perplexity than full attention, underscoring its effectiveness in maintaining accuracy under aggressive sparsity.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Distilling the tool-using capabilities of large language models (LLMs) into smaller, more efficient small language models (SLMs) is a key challenge for their practical application. The predominant approach, supervised fine-tuning (SFT), suffers from poor generalization as it trains models to imitate a static set of teacher trajectories rather than learn a robust methodology. While reinforcement learning (RL) offers an alternative, the standard RL using sparse rewards fails to effectively guide SLMs, causing them to struggle with inefficient exploration and adopt suboptimal strategies. To address these distinct challenges, we propose MENTOR, a framework that synergistically combines RL with teacher-guided distillation. Instead of simple imitation, MENTOR employs an RL-based process to learn a more generalizable policy through exploration. In addition, to solve the problem of reward sparsity, it uses a teacher's reference trajectory to construct a dense, composite teacher-guided reward that provides fine-grained guidance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MENTOR significantly improves the cross-domain generalization and strategic competence of SLMs compared to both SFT and standard sparse-reward RL baselines.

  In this work, we address the challenge of building fair English ASR systems for second-language speakers. Our analysis of widely used ASR models, Whisper and Seamless-M4T, reveals large fluctuations in word error rate (WER) across 26 accent groups, indicating significant fairness gaps. To mitigate this, we propose fairness-prompted finetuning with lightweight adapters, incorporating Spectral Decoupling (SD), Group Distributionally Robust Optimization (Group-DRO), and Invariant Risk Minimization (IRM). Our proposed fusion of traditional empirical risk minimization (ERM) with cross-entropy and fairness-driven objectives (SD, Group DRO, and IRM) enhances fairness across accent groups while maintaining overall recognition accuracy. In terms of macro-averaged word error rate, our approach achieves a relative improvement of 58.7% and 58.5% over the large pretrained Whisper and SeamlessM4T, and 9.7% and 7.8% over them, finetuning with standard empirical risk minimization with cross-entropy loss.

  We present $\textbf{Korean SimpleQA (KoSimpleQA)}$, a benchmark for evaluating factuality in large language models (LLMs) with a focus on Korean cultural knowledge. KoSimpleQA is designed to be challenging yet easy to grade, consisting of 1,000 short, fact-seeking questions with unambiguous answers. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation across a diverse set of open-source LLMs of varying sizes that support Korean, and find that even the strongest model generates correct answer only 33.7% of the time, underscoring the challenging nature of KoSimpleQA. Notably, performance rankings on KoSimpleQA differ substantially from those on the English SimpleQA, highlighting the unique value of our dataset. Furthermore, our analysis of reasoning LLMs shows that engaging reasoning capabilities in the factual QA task can both help models better elicit their latent knowledge and improve their ability to abstain when uncertain.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Distantly Supervised Relation Extraction (DSRE) remains a long-standing challenge in NLP, where models must learn from noisy bag-level annotations while making sentence-level predictions. While existing state-of-the-art (SoTA) DSRE models rely on task-specific training, their integration with in-context learning (ICL) using large language models (LLMs) remains underexplored. A key challenge is that the LLM may not learn relation semantics correctly, due to noisy annotation.In response, we propose HYDRE -- HYbrid Distantly Supervised Relation Extraction framework. It first uses a trained DSRE model to identify the top-k candidate relations for a given test sentence, then uses a novel dynamic exemplar retrieval strategy that extracts reliable, sentence-level exemplars from training data, which are then provided in LLM prompt for outputting the final relation(s).We further extend HYDRE to cross-lingual settings for RE in low-resource languages. Using available English DSRE training data, we evaluate all methods on English as well as a newly curated benchmark covering four diverse low-resource Indic languages -- Oriya, Santali, Manipuri, and Tulu. HYDRE achieves up to 20 F1 point gains in English and, on average, 17 F1 points on Indic languages over prior SoTA DSRE models. Detailed ablations exhibit HYDRE's efficacy compared to other prompting strategies.

  Domain-adapted open-weight large language models (LLMs) offer promising healthcare applications, from queryable knowledge bases to multimodal assistants, with the crucial advantage of local deployment for privacy preservation. However, optimal adaptation strategies, evaluation methodologies, and performance relative to general-purpose LLMs remain poorly characterized. We investigated these questions in electrocardiography, an important area of cardiovascular medicine, by finetuning open-weight models on domain-specific literature and implementing a multi-layered evaluation framework comparing finetuned models, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and Claude Sonnet 3.7 as a representative general-purpose model. Finetuned Llama 3.1 70B achieved superior performance on multiple-choice evaluations and automatic text metrics, ranking second to Claude 3.7 in LLM-as-a-judge assessments. Human expert evaluation favored Claude 3.7 and RAG approaches for complex queries. Finetuned models significantly outperformed their base counterparts across nearly all evaluation modes. Our findings reveal substantial performance heterogeneity across evaluation methodologies, underscoring assessment complexity. Nevertheless, domain-specific adaptation through finetuning and RAG achieves competitive performance with proprietary models, supporting the viability of privacy-preserving, locally deployable clinical solutions.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Medical question answering (QA) requires extensive access to domain-specific knowledge. A promising direction is to enhance large language models (LLMs) with external knowledge retrieved from medical corpora or parametric knowledge stored in model parameters. Existing approaches typically fall into two categories: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which grounds model reasoning on externally retrieved evidence, and Generation-Augmented Generation (GAG), which depends solely on the models internal knowledge to generate contextual documents. However, RAG often suffers from noisy or incomplete retrieval, while GAG is vulnerable to hallucinated or inaccurate information due to unconstrained generation. Both issues can mislead reasoning and undermine answer reliability. To address these challenges, we propose MedRGAG, a unified retrieval-generation augmented framework that seamlessly integrates external and parametric knowledge for medical QA. MedRGAG comprises two key modules: Knowledge-Guided Context Completion (KGCC), which directs the generator to produce background documents that complement the missing knowledge revealed by retrieval; and Knowledge-Aware Document Selection (KADS), which adaptively selects an optimal combination of retrieved and generated documents to form concise yet comprehensive evidence for answer generation. Extensive experiments on five medical QA benchmarks demonstrate that MedRGAG achieves a 12.5% improvement over MedRAG and a 4.5% gain over MedGENIE, highlighting the effectiveness of unifying retrieval and generation for knowledge-intensive reasoning.

  Braille plays a vital role in education and information accessibility for visually impaired individuals. However, Braille information processing faces challenges such as data scarcity and ambiguities in mixed-text contexts. We construct English and Chinese Braille Mixed Datasets (EBMD/CBMD) with mathematical formulas to support diverse Braille domain research, and propose a syntax tree-based augmentation method tailored for Braille data. To address the underperformance of traditional fine-tuning methods in Braille-related tasks, we investigate Braille Knowledge-Based Fine-Tuning (BKFT), which reduces the learning difficulty of Braille contextual features. BrailleLLM employs BKFT via instruction tuning to achieve unified Braille translation, formula-to-Braille conversion, and mixed-text translation. Experiments demonstrate that BKFT achieves significant performance improvements over conventional fine-tuning in Braille translation scenarios. Our open-sourced datasets and methodologies establish a foundation for low-resource multilingual Braille research.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) and their multimodal variants can now process visual inputs, including images of text. This raises an intriguing question: can we compress textual inputs by feeding them as images to reduce token usage while preserving performance? In this paper, we show that visual text representations are a practical and surprisingly effective form of input compression for decoder LLMs. We exploit the idea of rendering long text inputs as a single image and provide it directly to the model. This leads to dramatically reduced number of decoder tokens required, offering a new form of input compression. Through experiments on two distinct benchmarks RULER (long-context retrieval) and CNN/DailyMail (document summarization) we demonstrate that this text-as-image method yields substantial token savings (often nearly half) without degrading task performance.

  Prompt Optimization has emerged as a crucial approach due to its capabilities in steering Large Language Models to solve various tasks. However, current works mainly rely on the random rewriting ability of LLMs, and the optimization process generally focus on specific influencing factors, which makes it easy to fall into local optimum. Besides, the performance of the optimized prompt is often unstable, which limits its transferability in different tasks. To address the above challenges, we propose $\textbf{DelvePO}$ ($\textbf{D}$irection-Guid$\textbf{e}$d Se$\textbf{l}$f-E$\textbf{v}$olving Framework for Fl$\textbf{e}$xible $\textbf{P}$rompt $\textbf{O}$ptimization), a task-agnostic framework to optimize prompts in self-evolve manner. In our framework, we decouple prompts into different components that can be used to explore the impact that different factors may have on various tasks. On this basis, we introduce working memory, through which LLMs can alleviate the deficiencies caused by their own uncertainties and further obtain key insights to guide the generation of new prompts. Extensive experiments conducted on different tasks covering various domains for both open- and closed-source LLMs, including DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B, Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct and GPT-4o-mini. Experimental results show that DelvePO consistently outperforms previous SOTA methods under identical experimental settings, demonstrating its effectiveness and transferability across different tasks.

  Character arcs are important theoretical devices employed in literary studies to understand character journeys, identify tropes across literary genres, and establish similarities between narratives. This work addresses the novel task of computationally generating event-centric, relation-based character arcs from narratives. Providing a quantitative representation for arcs brings tangibility to a theoretical concept and paves the way for subsequent applications. We present MARCUS (Modelling Arcs for Understanding Stories), an NLP pipeline that extracts events, participant characters, implied emotion, and sentiment to model inter-character relations. MARCUS tracks and aggregates these relations across the narrative to generate character arcs as graphical plots. We generate character arcs from two extended fantasy series, Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings. We evaluate our approach before outlining existing challenges, suggesting applications of our pipeline, and discussing future work.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) are commonly used as evaluators in various applications, but the reliability of the outcomes remains a challenge. One such challenge is using LLMs-as-judges for direct assessment, i.e., assigning scores from a specified range without any references. We first show that this challenge stems from LLM judge outputs being associated with score range bias, i.e., LLM judge outputs are highly sensitive to pre-defined score ranges, preventing the search for optimal score ranges. We also show that similar biases exist among models from the same family. We then mitigate this bias through contrastive decoding, achieving up to 11.3% relative improvement on average in Spearman correlation with human judgments across different score ranges.

  LLM Driven text-to-table (T2T) systems often rely on extensive prompt-engineering or iterative event extraction in code-parsable formats, which boosts scores but are computationally expensive and obscure how models actually reason over temporal evolving narratives to summarise key information. We present CMT-Bench, a diagnostic benchmark built from live cricket commentary that requires dynamic table generation across two evolving schemas under a dense, rule-governed policy. CMT-Bench is designed to probe robustness via three semantics-preserving dimensions: (i) extractive-cue ablation to separate extractive shortcuts from state tracking, (ii) temporal prefixing to test long-context stability, and (iii) entity-form perturbations (anonymization, outof-distribution substitutions, role-entangling paraphrases) to assess sensitivity to surface variation. Across diverse long-context stateof-the-art LLMs, we find large drops without extractive summaries, monotonic degradation with input length, and consistent accuracy drop under entity-form changes. Complementary distributional tests confirm significant shifts in numeric error patterns, indicating drift in reasoning rather than mere noise. Our results show that current LLMs are brittle in dynamic Textto-table generation, motivating robustness-first evaluation as a prerequisite for developing efficient and scalable approaches for this task.

  Prompt engineering is crucial for achieving reliable and effective outputs from large language models (LLMs), but its design requires specialized knowledge of prompting techniques and a deep understanding of target tasks. To address this challenge, we propose a novel method that adaptively selects task-appropriate prompting techniques based on users' abstract task descriptions and automatically generates high-quality prompts without relying on pre-existing templates or frameworks. The proposed method constructs a knowledge base that associates task clusters, characterized by semantic similarity across diverse tasks, with their corresponding prompting techniques. When users input task descriptions, the system assigns them to the most relevant task cluster and dynamically generates prompts by integrating techniques drawn from the knowledge base. An experimental evaluation of the proposed method on 23 tasks from BIG-Bench Extra Hard (BBEH) demonstrates superior performance compared with standard prompts and existing automatic prompt-generation tools, as measured by both arithmetic and harmonic mean scores. This research establishes a foundation for streamlining and standardizing prompt creation, enabling non-experts to effectively leverage LLMs.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Mechanistic interpretability strives to explain model behavior in terms of bottom-up primitives. The leading paradigm is to express hidden states as a sparse linear combination of basis vectors, called features. However, this only identifies which text sequences (exemplars) activate which features; the actual interpretation of features requires subjective inspection of these exemplars. This paper advocates for a different solution: rule-based descriptions that match token patterns in the input and correspondingly increase or decrease the likelihood of specific output tokens. Specifically, we extract rule-based descriptions of SAE features trained on the outputs of attention layers. While prior work treats the attention layers as an opaque box, we describe how it may naturally be expressed in terms of interactions between input and output features, of which we study three types: (1) skip-gram rules of the form "[Canadian city]... speaks --> English", (2) absence rules of the form "[Montreal]... speaks -/-> English," and (3) counting rules that toggle only when the count of a word exceeds a certain value or the count of another word. Absence and counting rules are not readily discovered by inspection of exemplars, where manual and automatic descriptions often identify misleading or incomplete explanations. We then describe a simple approach to extract these types of rules automatically from a transformer, and apply it to GPT-2 small. We find that a majority of features may be described well with around 100 skip-gram rules, though absence rules are abundant even as early as the first layer (in over a fourth of features). We also isolate a few examples of counting rules. This paper lays the groundwork for future research into rule-based descriptions of features by defining them, showing how they may be extracted, and providing a preliminary taxonomy of some of the behaviors they represent.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models exhibit a puzzling inconsistency: they solve complex problems yet frequently fail on seemingly simpler ones. We investigate whether LLMs internally encode problem difficulty in a way that aligns with human judgment, and whether this representation tracks generalization during reinforcement learning post-training. We train linear probes across layers and token positions on 60 models, evaluating on mathematical and coding subsets of Easy2HardBench. We find that human-labeled difficulty is strongly linearly decodable (AMC: $\rho \approx 0.88$) and exhibits clear model-size scaling, whereas LLM-derived difficulty is substantially weaker and scales poorly. Steering along the difficulty direction reveals that pushing models toward "easier" representations reduces hallucination and improves accuracy. During GRPO training on Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B, the human-difficulty probe strengthens and positively correlates with test accuracy across training steps, while the LLM-difficulty probe degrades and negatively correlates with performance. These results suggest that human annotations provide a stable difficulty signal that RL amplifies, while automated difficulty estimates derived from model performance become misaligned precisely as models improve. We release probe code and evaluation scripts to facilitate replication.

  This paper assesses the capacity of large language models (LLMs) to translate texts that include inter-sentential dependencies. We use the English-French DiscEvalMT benchmark (Bawden et al., 2018) with pairs of sentences containing translation challenges either for pronominal anaphora or for lexical cohesion. We evaluate 12 LLMs from the DeepSeek-R1, GPT, Llama, Mistral and Phi families on two tasks: (1) distinguishing a correct translation from a wrong but plausible one; (2) generating a correct translation. We compare prompts that encourage chain-of-thought reasoning with those that do not. The best models take advantage of reasoning and reach about 90% accuracy on the first task, and COMET scores of about 92% on the second task, with GPT-4, GPT-4o and Phi standing out. Moreover, we observe a "wise get wiser" effect: the improvements through reasoning are positively correlated with the scores of the models without reasoning.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at capturing latent semantics and contextual relationships across diverse modalities. However, in modeling user behavior from sequential interaction data, performance often suffers when such semantic context is limited or absent. We introduce LaMAR, a LLM-driven semantic enrichment framework designed to enrich such sequences automatically. LaMAR leverages LLMs in a few-shot setting to generate auxiliary contextual signals by inferring latent semantic aspects of a user's intent and item relationships from existing metadata. These generated signals, such as inferred usage scenarios, item intents, or thematic summaries, augment the original sequences with greater contextual depth. We demonstrate the utility of this generated resource by integrating it into benchmark sequential modeling tasks, where it consistently improves performance. Further analysis shows that LLM-generated signals exhibit high semantic novelty and diversity, enhancing the representational capacity of the downstream models. This work represents a new data-centric paradigm where LLMs serve as intelligent context generators, contributing a new method for the semi-automatic creation of training data and language resources.

  Structured pruning is a practical approach to deploying large language models (LLMs) efficiently, as it yields compact, hardware-friendly architectures. However, the dominant local paradigm is task-agnostic: by optimizing layer-wise reconstruction rather than task objectives, it tends to preserve perplexity or generic zero-shot behavior but fails to capitalize on modest task-specific calibration signals, often yielding limited downstream gains. We revisit global structured pruning and present GISP-Global Iterative Structured Pruning-a post-training method that removes attention heads and MLP channels using first-order, loss-based important weights aggregated at the structure level with block-wise normalization. An iterative schedule, rather than one-shot pruning, stabilizes accuracy at higher sparsity and mitigates perplexity collapse without requiring intermediate fine-tuning; the pruning trajectory also forms nested subnetworks that support a "prune-once, deploy-many" workflow. Furthermore, because importance is defined by a model-level loss, GISP naturally supports task-specific objectives; we instantiate perplexity for language modeling and a margin-based objective for decision-style tasks. Extensive experiments show that across Llama2-7B/13B, Llama3-8B, and Mistral-0.3-7B, GISP consistently lowers WikiText-2 perplexity and improves downstream accuracy, with especially strong gains at 40-50% sparsity; on DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-3-8B with GSM8K, task-aligned calibration substantially boosts exact-match accuracy.

  _Asim Mohamed, Martin Gubri_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multilingual watermarking aims to make large language model (LLM) outputs traceable across languages, yet current methods still fall short. Despite claims of cross-lingual robustness, they are evaluated only on high-resource languages. We show that existing multilingual watermarking methods are not truly multilingual: they fail to remain robust under translation attacks in medium- and low-resource languages. We trace this failure to semantic clustering, which fails when the tokenizer vocabulary contains too few full-word tokens for a given language. To address this, we introduce STEAM, a back-translation-based detection method that restores watermark strength lost through translation. STEAM is compatible with any watermarking method, robust across different tokenizers and languages, non-invasive, and easily extendable to new languages. With average gains of +0.19 AUC and +40%p TPR@1% on 17 languages, STEAM provides a simple and robust path toward fairer watermarking across diverse languages.

  Modern language models are evaluated on large benchmarks, which are difficult to make sense of, especially for model selection. Looking at the raw evaluation numbers themselves using a model-centric lens, we propose SimBA, a three phase framework to Simplify Benchmark Analysis. The three phases of SimBA are: stalk, where we conduct dataset & model comparisons, prowl, where we discover a representative subset, and pounce, where we use the representative subset to predict performance on a held-out set of models. Applying SimBA to three popular LM benchmarks: HELM, MMLU, and BigBenchLite reveals that across all three benchmarks, datasets and models relate strongly to one another (stalk). We develop an representative set discovery algorithm which covers a benchmark using raw evaluation scores alone. Using our algorithm, we find that with 6.25% (1/16), 1.7% (1/58), and 28.4% (21/74) of the datasets for HELM, MMLU, and BigBenchLite respectively, we achieve coverage levels of at least 95% (prowl). Additionally, using just these representative subsets, we can both preserve model ranks and predict performance on a held-out set of models with near zero mean-squared error (pounce). Taken together, SimBA can help model developers improve efficiency during model training and dataset creators validate whether their newly created dataset differs from existing datasets in a benchmark. Our code is open source, available atthis https URL.

  Knowledge editing techniques promise to implant new factual knowledge into large language models (LLMs). But do LLMs really believe these facts? We develop a framework to measure belief depth and use it to evaluate the success of knowledge editing techniques. We operationalize belief depth as the extent to which implanted knowledge 1) generalizes to related contexts (e.g. Fermi estimates several logical steps removed), 2) is robust to self-scrutiny and direct challenge, and 3) is represented similarly to genuine knowledge (as measured by linear probes). Our evaluations show that simple prompting and mechanistic editing techniques fail to implant knowledge deeply. In contrast, Synthetic Document Finetuning (SDF) - where models are trained on LLM-generated documents consistent with a fact - often succeeds at implanting beliefs that behave similarly to genuine knowledge. However, SDF's success is not universal, as implanted beliefs that contradict basic world knowledge are brittle and representationally distinct from genuine knowledge. Overall, our work introduces measurable criteria for belief depth and enables the rigorous evaluation necessary for deploying knowledge editing in real-world applications.

  Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has shown some success in augmenting large language models (LLMs) with external knowledge. However, as a non-parametric knowledge integration paradigm for LLMs, RAG methods heavily rely on external retrieval modules and the retrieved textual context prior. Especially for very large scale knowledge augmentation, they would introduce substantial inference latency due to expensive searches and much longer relevant context. In this paper, we propose a parametric knowledge integration method, called \textbf{AtlasKV}, a scalable, effective, and general way to augment LLMs with billion-scale knowledge graphs (KGs) (e.g. 1B triples) using very little GPU memory cost (e.g. less than 20GB VRAM). In AtlasKV, we introduce KG2KV and HiKVP to integrate KG triples into LLMs at scale with sub-linear time and memory complexity. It maintains strong knowledge grounding and generalization performance using the LLMs' inherent attention mechanism, and requires no external retrievers, long context priors, or retraining when adapting to new knowledge.

  Extending Named Entity Recognition (NER) models to new PII entities in noisy spoken-language data is a common need. We find that jointly fine-tuning a BERT model on standard semantic entities (PER, LOC, ORG) and new pattern-based PII (EMAIL, PHONE) results in minimal degradation for original classes. We investigate this "peaceful coexistence," hypothesizing that the model uses independent semantic vs. morphological feature mechanisms.Using an incremental learning setup as a diagnostic tool, we measure semantic drift and find two key insights. First, the LOC (location) entity is uniquely vulnerable due to a representation overlap with new PII, as it shares pattern-like features (e.g., postal codes). Second, we identify a "reverse O-tag representation drift." The model, initially trained to map PII patterns to 'O', blocks new learning. This is resolved only by unfreezing the 'O' tag's classifier, allowing the background class to adapt and "release" these patterns. This work provides a mechanistic diagnosis of NER model adaptation, highlighting feature independence, representation overlap, and 'O' tag plasticity.

  This paper presents a comprehensive comparative analysis of Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods for automated toxicity detection in online gaming chats. Traditional machine learning models with embeddings, large language models (LLMs) with zero-shot and few-shot prompting, fine-tuned transformer models, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) approaches are evaluated. The evaluation framework assesses three critical dimensions: classification accuracy, processing speed, and computational costs. A hybrid moderation system architecture is proposed that optimizes human moderator workload through automated detection and incorporates continuous learning mechanisms. The experimental results demonstrate significant performance variations across methods, with fine-tuned DistilBERT achieving optimal accuracy-cost trade-offs. The findings provide empirical evidence for deploying cost-effective, efficient content moderation systems in dynamic online gaming environments.

  Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning and planning capabilities, driving extensive research into task decomposition. Existing task decomposition methods focus primarily on memory, tool usage, and feedback mechanisms, achieving notable success in specific domains, but they often overlook the trade-off between performance and cost. In this study, we first conduct a comprehensive investigation on task decomposition, identifying six categorization schemes. Then, we perform an empirical analysis of three factors that influence the performance and cost of task decomposition: categories of approaches, characteristics of tasks, and configuration of decomposition and execution models, uncovering three critical insights and summarizing a set of practical principles. Building on this analysis, we propose the Select-Then-Decompose strategy, which establishes a closed-loop problem-solving process composed of three stages: selection, execution, and verification. This strategy dynamically selects the most suitable decomposition approach based on task characteristics and enhances the reliability of the results through a verification module. Comprehensive evaluations across multiple benchmarks show that the Select-Then-Decompose consistently lies on the Pareto frontier, demonstrating an optimal balance between performance and cost.

  Recent advances in enhancing the reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs) have been remarkably successful. LLMs trained with reinforcement learning (RL) for reasoning demonstrate strong performance in challenging tasks such as mathematics and coding, even with relatively small model sizes. However, despite these improvements in task accuracy, the assessment of creativity in LLM generations has been largely overlooked in reasoning tasks, in contrast to writing tasks. The lack of research on creativity assessment in reasoning primarily stems from two challenges: (1) the difficulty of defining the range of creativity, and (2) the necessity of human evaluation in the assessment process. To address these challenges, we propose CLAWS, a method that defines and classifies mathematical solutions into typical, creative, and hallucinated categories without human evaluation, by leveraging attention weights across prompt sections and output. CLAWS outperforms five existing white-box detection methods (Perplexity, Logit Entropy, Window Entropy, Hidden Score, and Attention Score) on five 7-8B math RL models (DeepSeek, Qwen, Mathstral, OpenMath2, and Oreal). We validate CLAWS on 4545 math problems collected from 181 math contests (AJHSME, AMC, AIME).

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The hallucination and credibility concerns of large language models (LLMs) are global challenges that the industry is collectively addressing. Recently, a significant amount of advances have been made on post-training and inference techniques to mitigate these challenges. However, it is widely agreed that unsafe and hallucinations of LLMs intrinsically originate from pre-training, involving pre-training data and the next-token prediction learning mechanism. In this paper, we focus on enhancing pre-training data to improve the trustworthiness and safety of LLMs. Since the data is vast, it's almost impossible to entirely purge the data of factual errors, logical inconsistencies, or distributional biases. Moreover, the pre-training data lack grounding in real-world knowledge. Each piece of data is treated as a sequence of tokens rather than as a representation of a part of the world. To overcome these issues, we propose approaches to enhancing our pre-training data with its context in the world and increasing a substantial amount of data reflecting industrial scenarios. We argue that most source data are created by the authors for specific purposes in a certain spatial-temporal context. They have played a role in the real world. By incorporating related world context information, we aim to better anchor pre-training data within real-world scenarios, thereby reducing uncertainty in model training and enhancing the model's safety and trustworthiness. We refer to our Data with World Context as DWC. We continue pre-training an earlier checkpoint of JT-35B-Base with 1.5 trillion of DWC tokens. We introduce our post-training procedures to activate the potentials of DWC. Compared with the Qwen model of a similar scale, JT-Safe-35B achieves an average performance improvement of 1.79% on the Safety and Trustworthy evaluation benchmarks, while being pretrained with only 6.2 trillion tokens.

  We present a mechanistic analysis of literary style in GPT-2, identifying individual neurons that discriminate between exemplary prose and rigid AI-generated text. Using Herman Melville's Bartleby, the Scrivener as a corpus, we extract activation patterns from 355 million parameters across 32,768 neurons in late layers. We find 27,122 statistically significant discriminative neurons ($p < 0.05$), with effect sizes up to $|d| = 1.4$. Through systematic ablation studies, we discover a paradoxical result: while these neurons correlate with literary text during analysis, removing them often improves rather than degrades generated prose quality. Specifically, ablating 50 high-discriminating neurons yields a 25.7% improvement in literary style metrics. This demonstrates a critical gap between observational correlation and causal necessity in neural networks. Our findings challenge the assumption that neurons which activate on desirable inputs will produce those outputs during generation, with implications for mechanistic interpretability research and AI alignment.

  The exponential increase in scientific literature and online information necessitates efficient methods for extracting knowledge from textual data. Natural language processing (NLP) plays a crucial role in addressing this challenge, particularly in text classification tasks. While large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in NLP, their accuracy can suffer in domain-specific contexts due to specialized vocabulary, unique grammatical structures, and imbalanced data distributions. In this systematic literature review (SLR), we investigate the utilization of pre-trained language models (PLMs) for domain-specific text classification. We systematically review 41 articles published between 2018 and January 2024, adhering to the PRISMA statement (preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses). This review methodology involved rigorous inclusion criteria and a multi-step selection process employing AI-powered tools. We delve into the evolution of text classification techniques and differentiate between traditional and modern approaches. We emphasize transformer-based models and explore the challenges and considerations associated with using LLMs for domain-specific text classification. Furthermore, we categorize existing research based on various PLMs and propose a taxonomy of techniques used in the field. To validate our findings, we conducted a comparative experiment involving BERT, SciBERT, and BioBERT in biomedical sentence classification. Finally, we present a comparative study on the performance of LLMs in text classification tasks across different domains. In addition, we examine recent advancements in PLMs for domain-specific text classification and offer insights into future directions and limitations in this rapidly evolving domain.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) achieve strong benchmark performance, yet user experiences remain inconsistent due to diverse preferences in style, tone, and reasoning mode. Nevertheless, existing alignment techniques such as reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) or Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) largely optimize toward population-level averages and overlook individual variation. Naive personalization strategies like per-user fine-tuning are computationally prohibitive, and in-context approaches that prepend raw user signals often suffer from inefficiency and noise. To address these challenges, we propose POPI, a general framework that introduces a preference inference model to distill heterogeneous user signals into concise natural language summaries. These summaries act as transparent, compact, and transferable personalization representations that condition a shared generation model to produce personalized responses. POPI jointly optimizes both preference inference and personalized generation under a unified objective using reinforcement learning, ensuring summaries maximally encode useful preference information. Extensive experiments across four personalization benchmarks demonstrate that POPI consistently improves personalization accuracy while reducing context overhead by a large margin. Moreover, optimized summaries seamlessly transfer to frozen off-the-shelf LLMs, enabling plug-and-play personalization without weight updates.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Emotions guide human decisions, but whether large language models (LLMs) use emotion similarly remains unknown. We tested this using altruistic third-party punishment, where an observer incurs a personal cost to enforce fairness, a hallmark of human morality and often driven by negative emotion. In a large-scale comparison of 4,068 LLM agents with 1,159 adults across 796,100 decisions, LLMs used emotion to guide punishment, sometimes even more strongly than humans did: Unfairness elicited stronger negative emotion that led to more punishment; punishing unfairness produced more positive emotion than accepting; and critically, prompting self-reports of emotion causally increased punishment. However, mechanisms diverged: LLMs prioritized emotion over cost, enforcing norms in an almost all-or-none manner with reduced cost sensitivity, whereas humans balanced fairness and cost. Notably, reasoning models (o3-mini, DeepSeek-R1) were more cost-sensitive and closer to human behavior than foundation models (GPT-3.5, DeepSeek-V3), yet remained heavily emotion-driven. These findings provide the first causal evidence of emotion-guided moral decisions in LLMs and reveal deficits in cost calibration and nuanced fairness judgements, reminiscent of early-stage human responses. We propose that LLMs progress along a trajectory paralleling human development; future models should integrate emotion with context-sensitive reasoning to achieve human-like emotional intelligence.

  Large language model (LLM) based search agents iteratively generate queries, retrieve external information, and reason to answer open-domain questions. While researchers have primarily focused on improving their utility, their safety behaviors remain underexplored. In this paper, we first evaluate search agents using red-teaming datasets and find that they are more likely to produce harmful outputs than base LLMs. For example, when asked "How can I track someone's location without their consent?", a base model refuses, whereas a search agent designed to retrieve and cite sources may lower its refusal threshold, fetch documents (e.g., court cases), and, once appended, synthesize them into an informative yet unsafe summary. We further show that utility-oriented fine-tuning intensifies this risk, motivating joint alignment of safety and utility. We present SafeSearch, a multi-objective reinforcement learning approach that couples a final-output safety/utility reward with a novel query-level shaping term that penalizes unsafe queries and rewards safe ones. Experiments show that SafeSearch reduces agent harmfulness by over 70% across three red-teaming datasets while producing safe, helpful responses, and matches the QA performance of a utility-only finetuned agent; further analyses confirm the effectiveness of the query-level reward in jointly improving safety and utility.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The core premise of AI debate as a scalable oversight technique is that it is harder to lie convincingly than to refute a lie, enabling the judge to identify the correct position. Yet, existing debate experiments have relied on datasets with ground truth, where lying is reduced to defending an incorrect proposition. This overlooks a subjective dimension: lying also requires the belief that the claim defended is false. In this work, we apply debate to subjective questions and explicitly measure large language models' prior beliefs before experiments. Debaters were asked to select their preferred position, then presented with a judge persona deliberately designed to conflict with their identified priors. This setup tested whether models would adopt sycophantic strategies, aligning with the judge's presumed perspective to maximize persuasiveness, or remain faithful to their prior beliefs. We implemented and compared two debate protocols, sequential and simultaneous, to evaluate potential systematic biases. Finally, we assessed whether models were more persuasive and produced higher-quality arguments when defending positions consistent with their prior beliefs versus when arguing against them. Our main findings show that models tend to prefer defending stances aligned with the judge persona rather than their prior beliefs, sequential debate introduces significant bias favoring the second debater, models are more persuasive when defending positions aligned with their prior beliefs, and paradoxically, arguments misaligned with prior beliefs are rated as higher quality in pairwise comparison. These results can inform human judges to provide higher-quality training signals and contribute to more aligned AI systems, while revealing important aspects of human-AI interaction regarding persuasion dynamics in language models.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models split into two families: reasoning-centric LLMs, which strengthen internal chain-of-thought reasoning but cannot invoke external tools, and agentic LLMs, which learn to interact with environments and leverage tools but often lag in deep reasoning. This divide arises from fundamentally different training objectives, leading to mismatched strengths and inefficiency on simple queries, where both families tend to overthink or over-call tools. In this work, we present Adaptive Agent Foundation Model (A$^2$FM), a unified framework that follows a route-then-align principle: the model first learns task-aware routing and then aligns mode-specific trajectories under a shared backbone. To address the inefficiency gap, we introduce a third mode-instant-that handles simple queries directly, preventing unnecessary reasoning or tool calls while complementing the agentic and reasoning modes. To jointly enhance accuracy and efficiency, we propose Adaptive Policy Optimization (APO), which enforces adaptive sampling across modes and applies a cost-regularized reward. On the 32B scale, A$^2$FM achieves 13.4% on BrowseComp, 70.4% on AIME25, and 16.7% on HLE, setting new SOTA among comparable models and performing competitively with frontier LLMs across agentic, reasoning, and general benchmarks. Notably, the adaptive execution achieves a cost of pass of only $0.00487 per correct answer-cutting cost by 45.2% relative to reasoning and 33.5% relative to agentic, thus delivering substantially higher cost efficiency while maintaining comparable accuracy.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a crucial approach for enhancing the capabilities of large language models. However, in Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models, the routing mechanism often introduces instability, even leading to catastrophic RL training collapse. We analyze the training-inference consistency of MoE models and identify a notable discrepancy in routing behaviors between the two phases. Moreover, even under identical conditions, the routing framework can yield divergent expert selections across repeated forward passes. To address this foundational inconsistency, we propose Rollout Routing Replay (R3), a method that records routing distributions from the inference engine and replays them during training. R3 significantly reduces training-inference policy KL divergence and mitigates extreme discrepancies without compromising training speed. Extensive experiments on various settings confirm that R3 succeeds in stabilizing RL training, preventing collapse and outperforming methods such as GSPO and TIS. We believe this work can offer a new solution for stabilizing RL in MoE models.

  The research evaluates lightweight medical abstract classification methods to establish their maximum performance capabilities under financial budget restrictions. On the public medical abstracts corpus, we finetune BERT base and Distil BERT with three objectives cross entropy (CE), class weighted CE, and focal loss under identical tokenization, sequence length, optimizer, and schedule. DistilBERT with plain CE gives the strongest raw argmax trade off, while a post hoc operating point selection (validation calibrated, classwise thresholds) sub stantially improves deployed performance; under this tuned regime, focal benefits most. We report Accuracy, Macro F1, and WeightedF1, release evaluation artifacts, and include confusion analyses to clarify error structure. The practical takeaway is to start with a compact encoder and CE, then add lightweight calibration or thresholding when deployment requires higher macro balance.

  Although Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit advanced reasoning ability, conventional alignment remains largely dominated by outcome reward models (ORMs) that judge only final answers. Process Reward Models(PRMs) address this gap by evaluating and guiding reasoning at the step or trajectory level. This survey provides a systematic overview of PRMs through the full loop: how to generate process data, build PRMs, and use PRMs for test-time scaling and reinforcement learning. We summarize applications across math, code, text, multimodal reasoning, robotics, and agents, and review emerging benchmarks. Our goal is to clarify design spaces, reveal open challenges, and guide future research toward fine-grained, robust reasoning alignment.

The system is modular in that one first creates a target phonology for the language using an agentic approach that refines its output at each step with commentary feedback on its previous attempt. Next, a set of sentences is 'translated' from their English original into a morphosyntactic markup that reflects the word order and morphosyntactic feature specifications of the desired target language, with affixes represented as morphosyntactic feature bundles. From this translated corpus, a lexicon is constructed using the phonological model and the set of morphemes (stems and affixes) extracted from the 'translated' sentences. The system is then instructed to provide an orthography for the language, using an existing script such as Latin or Cyrillic. Finally, the system writes a brief grammatical handbook of the language. The system can also translate further sentences into the target language.Our goal is twofold. First, we hope that these tools will be fun to use for creating artificially constructed languages. Second, we are interested in exploring what LLMs 'know' about language-not what they know about any particular language or linguistic phenomenon, but how much they know about and understand language and linguistic concepts. As we shall see, there is a fairly wide gulf in capabilities both among different LLMs and among different linguistic specifications, with it being notably easier for systems to deal with more common patterns than rarer ones. An additional avenue that we explore is the application of our approach to translating from high-resource into low-resource languages. While the results so far are mostly negative, we provide some evidence that an improved version of the present system could afford some real gains in such tasks.this https URL

  Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly rely on Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning to improve accuracy on complex tasks. However, always generating lengthy reasoning traces is inefficient, leading to excessive token usage and higher inference costs. This paper introduces the Hybrid Policy Optimization (i.e., HiPO), a framework for adaptive reasoning control that enables LLMs to selectively decide when to engage in detailed reasoning (Think-on) and when to respond directly (Think-off). Specifically, HiPO combines a hybrid data pipelineproviding paired Think-on and Think-off responseswith a hybrid reinforcement learning reward system that balances accuracy and efficiency while avoiding over-reliance on detailed reasoning. Experiments across mathematics and coding benchmarks demonstrate that HiPO can substantially reduce token length while maintaining or improving accuracy. Finally, we hope HiPO a can be a principled approach for efficient adaptive reasoning, advancing the deployment of reasoning-oriented LLMs in real-world, resource-sensitive settings.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Cascade systems route computational requests to smaller models when possible and defer to larger models only when necessary, offering a promising approach to balance cost and quality in LLM deployment. However, they face a fundamental challenge in open-ended text generation: determining output reliability when generation quality lies on a continuous spectrum, often with multiple valid responses. To address this, we propose semantic agreement -- meaning-level consensus between ensemble outputs -- as a training-free signal for reliable deferral. We show that when diverse model outputs agree semantically, their consensus is a stronger reliability signal than token-level confidence. Evaluated from 500M to 70B-parameter models, we find that semantic cascades match or surpass target-model quality at 40% of the cost and reduce latency by up to 60%. Our method requires no model internals, works across black-box APIs, and remains robust to model updates, making it a practical baseline for real-world LLM deployment.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Transformer-based language models such as BERT have become foundational in NLP, yet their performance degrades in specialized domains like patents, which contain long, technical, and legally structured text. Prior approaches to patent NLP have primarily relied on fine-tuning general-purpose models or domain-adapted variants pretrained with limited data. In this work, we pretrain 3 domain-specific masked language models for patents, using the ModernBERT architecture and a curated corpus of over 60 million patent records. Our approach incorporates architectural optimizations, including FlashAttention, rotary embeddings, and GLU feed-forward layers. We evaluate our models on four downstream patent classification tasks. Our model, ModernBERT-base-PT, consistently outperforms the general-purpose ModernBERT baseline on three out of four datasets and achieves competitive performance with a baseline PatentBERT. Additional experiments with ModernBERT-base-VX and Mosaic-BERT-large demonstrate that scaling the model size and customizing the tokenizer further enhance performance on selected tasks. Notably, all ModernBERT variants retain substantially faster inference over - 3x that of PatentBERT - underscoring their suitability for time-sensitive applications. These results underscore the benefits of domain-specific pretraining and architectural improvements for patent-focused NLP tasks.

  _Amber Shore, Russell Scheinberg, Ameeta Agrawal, So Young Lee_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) are intended to reflect human linguistic competencies. But humans have access to a broad and embodied context, which is key in detecting and resolving linguistic ambiguities, even in isolated text spans. A foundational case of semantic ambiguity is found in the task of coreference resolution: how is a pronoun related to an earlier person mention? This capability is implicit in nearly every downstream task, and the presence of ambiguity at this level can alter performance significantly. We show that LLMs can achieve good performance with minimal prompting in both coreference disambiguation and the detection of ambiguity in coreference, however, they cannot do both at the same time. We present the CORRECT-DETECT trade-off: though models have both capabilities and deploy them implicitly, successful performance balancing these two abilities remains elusive.

  In this paper, we introduce Spotlight, a novel paradigm for information extraction that produces concise, engaging narratives by highlighting the most compelling aspects of a document. Unlike traditional summaries, which prioritize comprehensive coverage, spotlights selectively emphasize intriguing content to foster deeper reader engagement with the source material. We formally differentiate spotlights from related constructs and support our analysis with a detailed benchmarking study using new datasets curated for this work. To generate high-quality spotlights, we propose a two-stage approach: fine-tuning a large language model on our benchmark data, followed by alignment via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Our comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that the resulting model not only identifies key elements with precision but also enhances readability and boosts the engagement value of the original document.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This study introduces a Large Language Model (LLM) scheme for generating individual travel diaries in agent-based transportation models. While traditional approaches rely on large quantities of proprietary household travel surveys, the method presented in this study generates personas stochastically from open-source American Community Survey (ACS) and Smart Location Database (SLD) data, then synthesizes diaries through direct prompting. This study features a novel one-to-cohort realism score: a composite of four metrics (Trip Count Score, Interval Score, Purpose Score, and Mode Score) validated against the Connecticut Statewide Transportation Study (CSTS) diaries, matched across demographic variables. The validation utilizes Jensen-Shannon Divergence to measure distributional similarities between generated and real diaries. When compared to diaries generated with classical methods (Negative Binomial for trip generation; Multinomial Logit for mode/purpose) calibrated on the validation set, LLM-generated diaries achieve comparable overall realism (LLM mean: 0.485 vs. 0.455). The LLM excels in determining trip purpose and demonstrates greater consistency (narrower realism score distribution), while classical models lead in numerical estimates of trip count and activity duration. Aggregate validation confirms the LLM's statistical representativeness (LLM mean: 0.612 vs. 0.435), demonstrating LLM's zero-shot viability and establishing a quantifiable metric of diary realism for future synthetic diary evaluation systems.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper provides a self-contained, from-scratch, exposition of key algorithms for instruction tuning of models: SFT, Rejection Sampling, REINFORCE, Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO), Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Explanations of these algorithms often assume prior knowledge, lack critical details, and/or are overly generalized and complex. Here, each method is discussed and developed step by step using simplified and explicit notation focused on LLMs, aiming to eliminate ambiguity and provide a clear and intuitive understanding of the concepts. By minimizing detours into the broader RL literature and connecting concepts to LLMs, we eliminate superfluous abstractions and reduce cognitive overhead. Following this exposition, we provide a literature review of new techniques and approaches beyond those detailed. Finally, new ideas for research and exploration in the form of GRAPE (Generalized Relative Advantage Policy Evolution) are presented.

  Complex games have long been an important benchmark for testing the progress of artificial intelligence algorithms. AlphaGo, AlphaZero, and MuZero have defeated top human players in Go and Chess, garnering widespread societal attention towards artificial intelligence. Concurrently, large language models (LLMs) have exhibited remarkable capabilities across various tasks, raising the question of whether LLMs can achieve similar success in complex games. In this paper, we explore the potential of LLMs in mastering complex card games. We systematically assess the learning capabilities of LLMs across eight diverse card games, evaluating the impact of fine-tuning on high-quality gameplay data, and examining the models' ability to retain general capabilities while mastering these games. Our findings indicate that: (1) LLMs can approach the performance of strong game AIs through supervised fine-tuning on high-quality data, (2) LLMs can achieve a certain level of proficiency in multiple complex card games simultaneously, with performance augmentation for games with similar rules and conflicts for dissimilar ones, and (3) LLMs experience a decline in general capabilities when mastering complex games, but this decline can be mitigated by integrating a certain amount of general instruction data. The evaluation results demonstrate strong learning ability and versatility of LLMs. The code is available atthis https URL

  The rise of multimodal data, integrating text, audio, and visuals, has created new opportunities for studying multimodal tasks such as intent detection. This work investigates the effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) and non-LLMs, including text-only and multi-modal models, in the multimodal intent detection task. Our study reveals that Mistral-7B, a text-only LLM, outperforms most competitive multimodal models by approximately 9% on MIntRec-1 and 4% on MIntRec2.0 datasets. This performance advantage comes from a strong textual bias in these datasets, where over 90% of the samples require textual input, either alone or in combination with other modalities, for correct classification. We confirm the modality bias of these datasets via human evaluation, too. Next, we propose a framework to debias the datasets, and upon debiasing, more than 70% of the samples in MIntRec-1 and more than 50% in MIntRec2.0 get removed, resulting in significant performance degradation across all models, with smaller multimodal fusion models being the most affected with an accuracy drop of over 50 - 60%. Further, we analyze the context-specific relevance of different modalities through empirical analysis. Our findings highlight the challenges posed by modality bias in multimodal intent datasets and emphasize the need for unbiased datasets to evaluate multimodal models effectively.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We investigate whether synthetic question-answer (QA) data generated by large language models (LLMs) can serve as an effective proxy for human-labeled benchmarks when the latter is unavailable. We assess the reliability of synthetic benchmarks across two experiments: one varying retriever parameters while keeping the generator fixed, and another varying the generator with fixed retriever parameters. Across four datasets, of which two open-domain and two proprietary, we find that synthetic benchmarks reliably rank the RAGs varying in terms of retriever configuration, aligning well with human-labeled benchmark baselines. However, they do not consistently produce reliable RAG rankings when comparing generator architectures. The breakdown possibly arises from a combination of task mismatch between the synthetic and human benchmarks, and stylistic bias favoring certain generators.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Emergent communication (EmCom) with deep neural network-based agents promises to yield insights into the nature of human language, but remains focused primarily on a few subfield-specific goals and metrics that prioritize communication schemes which represent attributes with unique characters one-to-one and compose them syntactically. We thus reinterpret a common EmCom setting, the attribute-value reconstruction game, by imposing a small-vocabulary constraint to simulate double articulation, and formulating a novel setting analogous to naturalistic inflectional morphology (enabling meaningful comparison to natural language communication schemes). We develop new metrics and explore variations of this game motivated by real properties of inflectional morphology: concatenativity and fusion. Through our experiments, we discover that simulated phonological constraints encourage concatenative morphology, and emergent languages replicate the tendency of natural languages to fuse grammatical attributes.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) have been extensively adopted in Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC), showcasing significant research advancements. However, as black-box models driven by deep neural architectures, current LLM-based KGC methods rely on implicit knowledge representation with parallel propagation of erroneous knowledge, thereby hindering their ability to produce conclusive and decisive reasoning outcomes. We aim to integrate neural-perceptual structural information with ontological knowledge, leveraging the powerful capabilities of LLMs to achieve a deeper understanding of the intrinsic logic of the knowledge. We propose an ontology enhanced KGC method using LLMs -- OL-KGC. It first leverages neural perceptual mechanisms to effectively embed structural information into the textual space, and then uses an automated extraction algorithm to retrieve ontological knowledge from the knowledge graphs (KGs) that needs to be completed, which is further transformed into a textual format comprehensible to LLMs for providing logic guidance. We conducted extensive experiments on three widely-used benchmarks -- FB15K-237, UMLS and WN18RR. The experimental results demonstrate that OL-KGC significantly outperforms existing mainstream KGC methods across multiple evaluation metrics, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The predictive uncertainty of machine translation (MT) models is typically used as a quality estimation proxy. In this work, we posit that apart from confidently translating when a single correct translation exists, models should also maintain uncertainty when the input is ambiguous. We use uncertainty to measure gender bias in MT systems. When the source sentence includes a lexeme whose gender is not overtly marked, but whose target-language equivalent requires gender specification, the model must infer the appropriate gender from the context and can be susceptible to biases. Prior work measured bias via gender accuracy, however it cannot be applied to ambiguous cases. Using semantic uncertainty, we are able to assess bias when translating both ambiguous and unambiguous source sentences, and find that high translation accuracy does not correlate with exhibiting uncertainty appropriately, and that debiasing affects the two cases differently.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has become a dominant architecture for scaling Large Language Models (LLMs) efficiently by decoupling total parameters from computational cost. However, this decoupling creates a critical challenge: predicting the model capacity of a given MoE configurations (e.g., expert activation ratio and granularity) remains an unresolved problem. To address this gap, we introduce Efficiency Leverage (EL), a metric quantifying the computational advantage of an MoE model over a dense equivalent. We conduct a large-scale empirical study, training over 300 models up to 28B parameters, to systematically investigate the relationship between MoE architectural configurations and EL. Our findings reveal that EL is primarily driven by the expert activation ratio and the total compute budget, both following predictable power laws, while expert granularity acts as a non-linear modulator with a clear optimal range. We integrate these discoveries into a unified scaling law that accurately predicts the EL of an MoE architecture based on its configuration. To validate our derived scaling laws, we designed and trained Ling-mini-beta, a pilot model for Ling-2.0 series with only 0.85B active parameters, alongside a 6.1B dense model for comparison. When trained on an identical 1T high-quality token dataset, Ling-mini-beta matched the performance of the 6.1B dense model while consuming over 7x fewer computational resources, thereby confirming the accuracy of our scaling laws. This work provides a principled and empirically-grounded foundation for the scaling of efficient MoE models.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multilingual generation with large language models (LLMs) is often of poor quality for mid- to low-resource languages, but the causes for this are not well-understood. We first demonstrate the existence of an implicit task-solving-->translation pipeline for generation, whereby the model first solves the required task in a largely target-language-agnostic manner, and subsequently translates answer concepts into the intended target language. We hypothesize that the failure of the translation stage, despite task-solving success, is an important culprit for the observed low quality of final outputs, and formalize this as the translation barrier hypothesis. We quantify the extent to which either stage in the pipeline is responsible for final failure for a word translation task across 108 language pairs, and find that the translation barrier explains a dominant portion of error for a majority of language pairs, and is especially severe for low-resource target languages. Our results highlight an important bottleneck for end-to-end multilingual generation, relevant for future work seeking to improve multilinguality in LLMs.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We identify semantically coherent, context-consistent network components in large language models (LLMs) using coactivation of sparse autoencoder (SAE) features collected from just a handful of prompts. Focusing on concept-relation prediction tasks, we show that ablating these components for concepts (e.g., countries and words) and relations (e.g., capital city and translation language) changes model outputs in predictable ways, while amplifying these components induces counterfactual responses. Notably, composing relation and concept components yields compound counterfactual outputs. Further analysis reveals that while most concept components emerge from the very first layer, more abstract relation components are concentrated in later layers. Lastly, we show that extracted components more comprehensively capture concepts and relations than individual features while maintaining specificity. Overall, our findings suggest a modular organization of knowledge accessed through compositional operations, and advance methods for efficient, targeted LLM manipulation.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce EvaLearn, a pioneering benchmark designed to evaluate large language models (LLMs) on their learning capability and efficiency in challenging tasks, a critical, yet underexplored aspect of model potential. EvaLearn contains 648 challenging problems across six task types, grouped into 182 sequences, each sequence dedicated to one task type. Diverging from most existing benchmarks that evaluate models in parallel, EvaLearn requires models to solve problems sequentially, allowing them to leverage the experience gained from previous solutions. EvaLearn provides five comprehensive automated metrics to evaluate models and quantify their learning capability and efficiency. We extensively benchmark nine frontier models and observe varied performance profiles: some models, such as Claude-3.7-sonnet, start with moderate initial performance but exhibit strong learning ability, while some models struggle to benefit from experience and may even show negative transfer. Moreover, we investigate model performance under two learning settings and find that instance-level rubrics and teacher-model feedback further facilitate model learning. Importantly, we observe that current LLMs with stronger static abilities do not show a clear advantage in learning capability across all tasks, highlighting that EvaLearn evaluates a new dimension of model performance. We hope EvaLearn provides a novel evaluation perspective for assessing LLM potential and understanding the gap between models and human capabilities, promoting the development of deeper and more dynamic evaluation approaches. All datasets, the automatic evaluation framework, and the results studied in this paper are available at the GitHub repository.

  Building Task-Oriented Dialogue (TOD) systems that generalize across different tasks remains a challenging problem. Data-driven approaches often struggle to transfer effectively to unseen tasks. While recent schema-based TOD frameworks improve generalization by decoupling task logic from language understanding, their reliance on neural or generative models often obscures how task schemas influence behaviour and hence impair interpretability. In this work, we introduce a novel framework, CoDial (Code for Dialogue), which converts a TOD task schema, represented as a novel structured heterogeneous graph, to programmatic LLM guardrailing code, such as NVIDIA's Colang, enabling interpretable and efficient alignment of dialogue policies during inference. We introduce two paradigms, $\text{CoDial}_{\text{free}}$ and $\text{CoDial}_{\text{structured}}$ for generating LLM guardrails, and propose a feedback mechanism that integrates human feedback to iteratively improve the generated code. Empirically, CoDial achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on the widely used STAR dataset and is on par with SOTA on the MultiWOZ dataset, while also providing interpretability. We additionally demonstrate CoDial's iterative improvement via manual and LLM-aided feedback, making it a practical tool for expert-guided alignment of LLMs in high-stakes domains.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT, LLaMA, and Claude achieve remarkable performance in text generation but remain opaque in their decision-making processes, limiting trust and accountability in high-stakes applications. We present gSMILE (generative SMILE), a model-agnostic, perturbation-based framework for token-level interpretability in LLMs. Extending the SMILE methodology, gSMILE uses controlled prompt perturbations, Wasserstein distance metrics, and weighted linear surrogates to identify input tokens with the most significant impact on the output. This process enables the generation of intuitive heatmaps that visually highlight influential tokens and reasoning paths. We evaluate gSMILE across leading LLMs (OpenAI's gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct, Meta's LLaMA 3.1 Instruct Turbo, and Anthropic's Claude 2.1) using attribution fidelity, attribution consistency, attribution stability, attribution faithfulness, and attribution accuracy as metrics. Results show that gSMILE delivers reliable human-aligned attributions, with Claude 2.1 excelling in attention fidelity and GPT-3.5 achieving the highest output consistency. These findings demonstrate gSMILE's ability to balance model performance and interpretability, enabling more transparent and trustworthy AI systems.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable results across diverse downstream tasks, but their monolithic nature restricts scalability and efficiency in complex problem-solving. While recent research explores multi-agent collaboration among LLMs, most approaches rely on static organizational structures that struggle to adapt as task complexity and agent numbers grow, resulting in coordination overhead and inefficiencies. To this end, we propose a puppeteer-style paradigm for LLM-based multi-agent collaboration, where a centralized orchestrator ("puppeteer") dynamically directs agents ("puppets") in response to evolving task states. This orchestrator is trained via reinforcement learning to adaptively sequence and prioritize agents, enabling flexible and evolvable collective reasoning. Experiments on closed- and open-domain scenarios show that this method achieves superior performance with reduced computational costs. Analyses further reveal that the key improvements consistently stem from the emergence of more compact, cyclic reasoning structures under the orchestrator's evolution.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning capabilities through test-time scaling approaches, particularly when fine-tuned with chain-of-thought (CoT) data distilled from more powerful large reasoning models (LRMs). However, these reasoning chains often contain verbose elements that mirror human problem-solving, categorized as progressive reasoning (the essential solution development path) and functional elements (verification processes, alternative solution approaches, and error corrections). While progressive reasoning is crucial, the functional elements significantly increase computational demands during test-time inference. We introduce PIR (Perplexity-based Importance Refinement), a principled framework that quantitatively evaluates the importance of each reasoning step based on its impact on answer prediction confidence. PIR systematically identifies and selectively prunes only low-importance functional steps while preserving progressive reasoning components, creating optimized training data that maintains the integrity of the core solution path while reducing verbosity. Models fine-tuned on PIR-optimized data exhibit superior test-time scaling properties, generating more concise reasoning chains while achieving improved accuracy (+0.9\% to +6.6\%) with significantly reduced token usage (-3\% to -41\%) across challenging reasoning benchmarks (AIME, AMC, and GPQA Diamond). Our approach demonstrates strong generalizability across different model sizes, data sources, and token budgets, offering a practical solution for deploying reasoning-capable LLMs in scenarios where efficient test-time scaling, response time, and computational efficiency are valuable constraints.

  We introduce DanmakuTPPBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to advance multi-modal Temporal Point Process (TPP) modeling in the era of Large Language Models (LLMs). While TPPs have been widely studied for modeling temporal event sequences, existing datasets are predominantly unimodal, hindering progress in models that require joint reasoning over temporal, textual, and visual information. To address this gap, DanmakuTPPBench comprises two complementary components: (1) DanmakuTPP-Events, a novel dataset derived from the Bilibili video platform, where user-generated bullet comments (Danmaku) naturally form multi-modal events annotated with precise timestamps, rich textual content, and corresponding video frames; (2) DanmakuTPP-QA, a challenging question-answering dataset constructed via a novel multi-agent pipeline powered by state-of-the-art LLMs and multi-modal LLMs (MLLMs), targeting complex temporal-textual-visual reasoning. We conduct extensive evaluations using both classical TPP models and recent MLLMs, revealing significant performance gaps and limitations in current methods' ability to model multi-modal event dynamics. Our benchmark establishes strong baselines and calls for further integration of TPP modeling into the multi-modal language modeling landscape. Project page:this https URL

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multimodal in-context learning (ICL) has emerged as a key mechanism for harnessing the capabilities of large vision-language models (LVLMs). However, its effectiveness remains highly sensitive to the quality of input ICL sequences, particularly for tasks involving complex reasoning or open-ended generation. A major limitation is our limited understanding of how LVLMs actually exploit these sequences during inference. To bridge this gap, we systematically interpret multimodal ICL through the lens of task mapping, which reveals how local and global relationships within and among demonstrations guide model reasoning. Building on this insight, we present TACO, a lightweight transformer-based model equipped with task-aware attention that dynamically configures ICL sequences. By injecting task-mapping signals into the autoregressive decoding process, TACO creates a bidirectional synergy between sequence construction and task reasoning. Experiments on five LVLMs and nine datasets demonstrate that TACO consistently surpasses baselines across diverse ICL tasks.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve superior performance through Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, but these token-level reasoning chains are computationally expensive and inefficient. In this paper, we introduce Compressed Latent Reasoning (CoLaR), a novel framework that dynamically compresses reasoning processes in latent space through a two-stage training approach. First, during supervised fine-tuning, CoLaR extends beyond next-token prediction by incorporating an auxiliary next compressed embedding prediction objective. This process merges embeddings of consecutive tokens using a compression factor randomly sampled from a predefined range, and trains a specialized latent head to predict distributions of subsequent compressed embeddings. Second, we enhance CoLaR through reinforcement learning (RL) that leverages the latent head's non-deterministic nature to explore diverse reasoning paths and exploit more compact ones. This approach enables CoLaR to: i) perform reasoning at a dense latent level (i.e., silently), substantially reducing reasoning chain length, and ii) dynamically adjust reasoning speed at inference time by simply prompting the desired compression factor. Extensive experiments across four mathematical reasoning datasets demonstrate that CoLaR achieves 14.1% higher accuracy than latent-based baseline methods at comparable compression ratios, and reduces reasoning chain length by 53.3% with only 4.8% performance degradation compared to explicit CoT method. Moreover, when applied to more challenging mathematical reasoning tasks, our RL-enhanced CoLaR demonstrates performance gains of up to 5.4% while dramatically reducing latent reasoning chain length by 82.8%. The code and models will be released upon acceptance.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Automated fact-checking has been a challenging task for the research community. Past works tried various strategies, such as end-to-end training, retrieval-augmented generation, and prompt engineering, to build robust fact-checking systems. However, their accuracy has not been very high for real-world deployment. We, on the other hand, propose a simple yet effective strategy, where entailed justifications generated by LLMs are used to train encoder-only language models (ELMs) for fact-checking. We conducted a rigorous set of experiments, comparing our approach with recent works and various prompting and fine-tuning strategies to demonstrate the superiority of our approach. Additionally, we did quality analysis of model explanations, ablation studies, and error analysis to provide a comprehensive understanding of our approach.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Continued pretraining and instruction tuning on large-scale multilingual data have proven to be effective in scaling large language models (LLMs) to low-resource languages. However, the unaligned nature of such data limits its ability to effectively capture cross-lingual semantics. In contrast, multi-way parallel data, where identical content is aligned across multiple languages, provides stronger cross-lingual consistency and offers greater potential for improving multilingual performance. In this paper, we introduce a large-scale, high-quality multi-way parallel corpus, TED2025, based on TED Talks. The corpus spans 113 languages, with up to 50 languages aligned in parallel, ensuring extensive multilingual coverage. Using this dataset, we investigate best practices for leveraging multi-way parallel data to enhance LLMs, including strategies for continued pretraining, instruction tuning, and the analysis of key influencing factors. Experiments on six multilingual benchmarks show that models trained on multiway parallel data consistently outperform those trained on unaligned multilingual data.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  With the growing requirement for natural human-computer interaction, speech-based systems receive increasing attention as speech is one of the most common forms of daily communication. However, the existing speech models still experience high latency when generating the first audio token during streaming, which poses a significant bottleneck for deployment. To address this issue, we propose VITA-Audio, an end-to-end large speech model with fast audio-text token generation. Specifically, we introduce a lightweight Multiple Cross-modal Token Prediction (MCTP) module that efficiently generates multiple audio tokens within a single model forward pass, which not only accelerates the inference but also significantly reduces the latency for generating the first audio in streaming scenarios. In addition, a four-stage progressive training strategy is explored to achieve model acceleration with minimal loss of speech quality. To our knowledge, VITA-Audio is the first multi-modal large language model capable of generating audio output during the first forward pass, enabling real-time conversational capabilities with minimal latency. VITA-Audio is fully reproducible and is trained on open-source data only. Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves an inference speedup of 3~5x at the 7B parameter scale, but also significantly outperforms open-source models of similar model size on multiple benchmarks for automatic speech recognition (ASR), text-to-speech (TTS), and spoken question answering (SQA) tasks.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Test-time domain adaptation (TTDA) is an excellent method which helps generalize models across domains, tasks, and distributions without the use of labeled datasets. Thus, TTDA is very useful in natural language processing (NLP) in the dialectal setting, since oftentimes, models are trained on Standard American English (SAE), evaluated on Indian English (IndE), Singaporean English (SingE), or Nigerian English (NgE), of which distribution differs significantly from the former. This is especially useful since dialectal datasets are scarce. In this paper, we explore one of the most famous TTDA techniques, SHOT, in dialectal NLP. We finetune and evaluate SHOT on different combinations of dialectal GLUE. Our findings show that SHOT is a viable technique when labeled datasets are unavailable. We also theoretically propose the concept of dialectal gap and show that it has a positive correlation with the effectiveness of SHOT. We also find that in many cases, finetuning on SAE yields higher performance than finetuning on dialectal data.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) suffer from temporal misalignment issues especially across long span of time. The issue arises from knowing that LLMs are trained on large amounts of data where temporal information is rather sparse over long times, such as thousands of years, resulting in insufficient learning or catastrophic forgetting by the LLMs. This paper proposes a methodology named "Ticktack" for addressing the LLM's long-time span misalignment in a yearly setting. Specifically, we first propose to utilize the sexagenary year expression instead of the Gregorian year expression employed by LLMs, achieving a more uniform distribution in yearly granularity. Then, we employ polar coordinates to model the sexagenary cycle of 60 terms and the year order within each term, with additional temporal encoding to ensure LLMs understand them. Finally, we present a temporal representational alignment approach for post-training LLMs that effectively distinguishes time points with relevant knowledge, hence improving performance on time-related tasks, particularly over a long period. We also create a long time span benchmark for evaluation. Experimental results prove the effectiveness of our proposal.

  The rapid development of multilingual large language models (LLMs) highlights the need for high-quality, diverse, and well-curated multilingual datasets. In this paper, we introduce DCAD-2000 (Data Cleaning as Anomaly Detection), a large-scale multilingual corpus constructed from newly extracted Common Crawl data and existing multilingual sources. DCAD-2000 covers 2,282 languages, 46.72TB of text, and 8.63 billion documents, spanning 155 high- and medium-resource languages and 159 writing scripts. To overcome the limitations of existing data cleaning approaches, which rely on manually designed heuristic thresholds, we reframe data cleaning as an anomaly detection problem. This dynamic filtering paradigm substantially improves data quality by automatically identifying and removing noisy or anomalous content. By fine-tuning LLMs on DCAD-2000, we demonstrate notable improvements in data quality, robustness of the cleaning pipeline, and downstream performance, particularly for low-resource languages across multiple multilingual benchmarks.

  Large language models have been widely applied, but can inadvertently encode sensitive or harmful information, raising significant safety concerns. Machine unlearning has emerged to alleviate this concern; however, existing training-time unlearning approaches, relying on coarse-grained loss combinations, have limitations in precisely separating knowledge and balancing removal effectiveness with model utility. In contrast, we propose Fine-grained Activation manipuLation by Contrastive Orthogonal uNalignment (FALCON), a novel representation-guided unlearning approach that leverages information-theoretic guidance for efficient parameter selection, employs contrastive mechanisms to enhance representation separation, and projects conflict gradients onto orthogonal subspaces to resolve conflicts between forgetting and retention objectives. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FALCON achieves superior unlearning effectiveness while maintaining model utility, exhibiting robust resistance against knowledge recovery attempts.

  Most of the world's languages and dialects are low-resource, and lack support in mainstream machine translation (MT) models. However, many of them have a closely-related high-resource language (HRL) neighbor, and differ in linguistically regular ways from it. This underscores the importance of model robustness to dialectal variation and cross-lingual generalization to the HRL dialect continuum. We present DialUp, consisting of a training-time technique for adapting a pretrained model to dialectal data (M->D), and an inference-time intervention adapting dialectal data to the model expertise (D->M). M->D induces model robustness to potentially unseen and unknown dialects by exposure to synthetic data exemplifying linguistic mechanisms of dialectal variation, whereas D->M treats dialectal divergence for known target dialects. These methods show considerable performance gains for several dialects from four language families, and modest gains for two other language families. We also conduct feature and error analyses, which show that language varieties with low baseline MT performance are more likely to benefit from these approaches.

  WHAT-IF -- Writing a Hero's Alternate Timeline through Interactive Fiction -- is a system that uses zero-shot meta-prompting to create branching narratives from a prewritten story. Played as an interactive fiction (IF) game, WHAT-IF lets the player choose between decisions that the large language model (LLM) GPT-4 generates as possible branches in the story. Starting with an existing linear plot as input, a branch is created at each key decision taken by the main character. By meta-prompting the LLM to consider the major plot points from the story, the system produces coherent and well-structured alternate storylines. WHAT-IF stores the branching plot tree in a graph which helps it to both keep track of the story for prompting and maintain the structure for the final IF system. A demo of WHAT-IF can be found atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Quantifying uncertainty in black-box LLMs is vital for reliable responses and scalable oversight. Existing methods, which gauge a model's uncertainty through evaluating self-consistency in responses to the target query, can be misleading: an LLM may confidently provide an incorrect answer to a target query, yet give a confident and accurate answer to that same target query when answering a knowledge-preserving perturbation of the query. We systematically analyze the model behaviors and demonstrate that this discrepancy stems from suboptimal retrieval of parametric knowledge, often due to contextual biases that prevent consistent access to stored knowledge. We then introduce DiverseAgentEntropy, a novel, theoretically-grounded method employing multi-agent interaction across diverse query variations for uncertainty estimation of black-box LLMs. This approach more accurately assesses an LLM's true uncertainty and improves hallucination detection, outperforming existing self-consistency based techniques.

  Uncertainty quantification (UQ) has emerged as a promising approach for detecting hallucinations and low-quality output of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, obtaining proper uncertainty scores is complicated by the conditional dependency between the generation steps of an autoregressive LLM because it is hard to model it explicitly. Here, we propose to learn this dependency from attention-based features. In particular, we train a regression model that leverages LLM attention maps, probabilities on the current generation step, and recurrently computed uncertainty scores from previously generated tokens. To incorporate the recurrent features, we also suggest a two-staged training procedure. Our experimental evaluation on ten datasets and three LLMs shows that the proposed method is highly effective for selective generation, achieving substantial improvements over rivaling unsupervised and supervised approaches.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has brought a pressing challenge: how to reliably assess hallucinations to guarantee model trustworthiness. Although Automatic Hallucination Evaluation (AHE) has become an indispensable component of this effort, the field remains fragmented in its methodologies, limiting both conceptual clarity and practical progress. This survey addresses this critical gap through a systematic analysis of 105 evaluation methods, revealing that 77.1% specifically target LLMs, a paradigm shift that demands new evaluation frameworks. We formulate a structured framework to organize the field, based on a survey of foundational datasets and benchmarks and a taxonomy of evaluation methodologies, which together systematically document the evolution from pre-LLM to post-LLM approaches. Beyond taxonomical organization, we identify fundamental limitations in current approaches and their implications for real-world deployment. To guide future research, we delineate key challenges and propose strategic directions, including enhanced interpretability mechanisms and integration of application-specific evaluation criteria, ultimately providing a roadmap for developing more robust and practical hallucination evaluation systems.

  While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at holistic understanding, they struggle in capturing the dense world with complex scenes, requiring fine-grained analysis of intricate details and object inter-relationships. Region-level MLLMs have been a promising step. However, previous attempts are generally optimized to understand given regions in isolation, neglecting crucial global contexts. To address this, we introduce Grasp Any Region (GAR) for comprehen- sive region-level visual understanding. Empowered by an effective RoI-aligned feature replay technique, GAR supports (1) precise perception by leveraging necessary global contexts, and (2) modeling interactions between multiple prompts. Together, it then naturally achieves (3) advanced compositional reasoning to answer specific free-form questions about any region, shifting the paradigm from passive description to active dialogue. Moreover, we construct GAR-Bench, which not only provides a more accurate evaluation of single-region comprehension, but also, more importantly, measures interactions and complex reasoning across multiple regions. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that GAR-1B not only maintains the state-of-the-art captioning capabilities, e.g., outperforming DAM-3B +4.5 on DLC-Bench, but also excels at modeling relationships between multiple prompts with advanced comprehension capabilities, even surpassing InternVL3-78B on GAR-Bench-VQA. More importantly, our zero-shot GAR-8B even outperforms in-domain VideoRefer-7B on VideoRefer-BenchQ, indicating its strong capabilities can be easily transferred to videos.

  Reasoning about dynamic spatial relationships is essential, as both observers and objects often move simultaneously. Although vision-language models (VLMs) and visual expertise models excel in 2D tasks and static scenarios, their ability to fully understand dynamic 3D scenarios remains limited. We introduce Dynamic Spatial Intelligence and propose DSI-Bench, a benchmark with nearly 1,000 dynamic videos and over 1,700 manually annotated questions covering nine decoupled motion patterns of observers and objects. Spatially and temporally symmetric designs reduce biases and enable systematic evaluation of models' reasoning about self-motion and object motion. Our evaluation of 14 VLMs and expert models reveals key limitations: models often conflate observer and object motion, exhibit semantic biases, and fail to accurately infer relative relationships in dynamic scenarios. Our DSI-Bench provides valuable findings and insights about the future development of general and expertise models with dynamic spatial intelligence.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Benefiting from pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models, real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR) methods can synthesize rich and realistic details. However, due to the inherent stochasticity of T2I models, different noise inputs often lead to outputs with varying perceptual quality. Although this randomness is sometimes seen as a limitation, it also introduces a wider perceptual quality range, which can be exploited to improve Real-ISR performance. To this end, we introduce Direct Perceptual Preference Optimization for Real-ISR (DP$^2$O-SR), a framework that aligns generative models with perceptual preferences without requiring costly human annotations. We construct a hybrid reward signal by combining full-reference and no-reference image quality assessment (IQA) models trained on large-scale human preference datasets. This reward encourages both structural fidelity and natural appearance. To better utilize perceptual diversity, we move beyond the standard best-vs-worst selection and construct multiple preference pairs from outputs of the same model. Our analysis reveals that the optimal selection ratio depends on model capacity: smaller models benefit from broader coverage, while larger models respond better to stronger contrast in supervision. Furthermore, we propose hierarchical preference optimization, which adaptively weights training pairs based on intra-group reward gaps and inter-group diversity, enabling more efficient and stable learning. Extensive experiments across both diffusion- and flow-based T2I backbones demonstrate that DP$^2$O-SR significantly improves perceptual quality and generalizes well to real-world benchmarks.

  People see text. Humans read by recognizing words as visual objects, including their shapes, layouts, and patterns, before connecting them to meaning, which enables us to handle typos, distorted fonts, and various scripts effectively. Modern large language models (LLMs), however, rely on subword tokenization, fragmenting text into pieces from a fixed vocabulary. While effective for high-resource languages, this approach over-segments low-resource languages, yielding long, linguistically meaningless sequences and inflating computation. In this work, we challenge this entrenched paradigm and move toward a vision-centric alternative. Our method, SeeTok, renders text as images (visual-text) and leverages pretrained multimodal LLMs to interpret them, reusing strong OCR and text-vision alignment abilities learned from large-scale multimodal training. Across three different language tasks, SeeTok matches or surpasses subword tokenizers while requiring 4.43 times fewer tokens and reducing FLOPs by 70.5%, with additional gains in cross-lingual generalization, robustness to typographic noise, and linguistic hierarchy. SeeTok signals a shift from symbolic tokenization to human-like visual reading, and takes a step toward more natural and cognitively inspired language models.

  Federated learning (FL) enables multiple clients to collaboratively train machine learning models without exposing local data, balancing performance and privacy. However, domain shift and label heterogeneity across clients often hinder the generalization of the aggregated global model. Recently, large-scale vision-language models like CLIP have shown strong zero-shot classification capabilities, raising the question of how to effectively fine-tune CLIP across domains in a federated setting. In this work, we propose an adaptive federated prompt tuning framework, FedDEAP, to enhance CLIP's generalization in multi-domain scenarios. Our method includes the following three key components: (1) To mitigate the loss of domain-specific information caused by label-supervised tuning, we disentangle semantic and domain-specific features in images by using semantic and domain transformation networks with unbiased mappings; (2) To preserve domain-specific knowledge during global prompt aggregation, we introduce a dual-prompt design with a global semantic prompt and a local domain prompt to balance shared and personalized information; (3) To maximize the inclusion of semantic and domain information from images in the generated text features, we align textual and visual representations under the two learned transformations to preserve semantic and domain consistency. Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in enhancing the generalization of CLIP for federated image recognition across multiple domains.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Graph Transformers (GTs) have emerged as a powerful paradigm for graph representation learning due to their ability to model diverse node interactions. However, existing GTs often rely on intricate architectural designs tailored to specific interactions, limiting their flexibility. To address this, we propose a unified hierarchical mask framework that reveals an underlying equivalence between model architecture and attention mask construction. This framework enables a consistent modeling paradigm by capturing diverse interactions through carefully designed attention masks. Theoretical analysis under this framework demonstrates that the probability of correct classification positively correlates with the receptive field size and label consistency, leading to a fundamental design principle: an effective attention mask should ensure both a sufficiently large receptive field and a high level of label consistency. While no single existing mask satisfies this principle across all scenarios, our analysis reveals that hierarchical masks offer complementary strengths, motivating their effective integration. Then, we introduce M3Dphormer, a Mixture-of-Experts-based Graph Transformer with Multi-Level Masking and Dual Attention Computation. M3Dphormer incorporates three theoretically grounded hierarchical masks and employs a bi-level expert routing mechanism to adaptively integrate multi-level interaction information. To ensure scalability, we further introduce a dual attention computation scheme that dynamically switches between dense and sparse modes based on local mask sparsity. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that M3Dphormer achieves state-of-the-art performance, validating the effectiveness of our unified framework and model design.

  Video tracking aims at finding the specific target in subsequent frames given its initial state. Due to the varying granularity of target states across different tasks, most existing trackers are tailored to a single task and heavily rely on custom-designed modules within the individual task, which limits their generalization and leads to redundancy in both model design and parameters. To unify video tracking tasks, we present SAM 2++, a unified model towards tracking at any granularity, including masks, boxes, and points. First, to extend target granularity, we design task-specific prompts to encode various task inputs into general prompt embeddings, and a unified decoder to unify diverse task results into a unified form pre-output. Next, to satisfy memory matching, the core operation of tracking, we introduce a task-adaptive memory mechanism that unifies memory across different granularities. Finally, we introduce a customized data engine to support tracking training at any granularity, producing a large and diverse video tracking dataset with rich annotations at three granularities, termed Tracking-Any-Granularity, which represents a comprehensive resource for training and benchmarking on unified tracking. Comprehensive experiments on multiple benchmarks confirm that SAM 2++ sets a new state of the art across diverse tracking tasks at different granularities, establishing a unified and robust tracking framework.

  Tuberculosis remains a critical global health issue, particularly in resource-limited and remote areas. Early detection is vital for treatment, yet the lack of skilled radiologists underscores the need for artificial intelligence (AI)-driven screening tools. Developing reliable AI models is challenging due to the necessity for large, high-quality datasets, which are costly to obtain. To tackle this, we propose a teacher--student framework which enhances both disease and symptom detection on chest X-rays by integrating two supervised heads and a self-supervised head. Our model achieves an accuracy of 98.85% for distinguishing between COVID-19, tuberculosis, and normal cases, and a macro-F1 score of 90.09% for multilabel symptom detection, significantly outperforming baselines. The explainability assessments also show the model bases its predictions on relevant anatomical features, demonstrating promise for deployment in clinical screening and triage settings.

  The original CLIP text encoder is limited by a maximum input length of 77 tokens, which hampers its ability to effectively process long texts and perform fine-grained semantic understanding. In addition, the CLIP text encoder lacks support for multilingual inputs. All these limitations significantly restrict its applicability across a broader range of tasks. Recent studies have attempted to replace the CLIP text encoder with an LLM-based embedder to enhance its ability in processing long texts, multilingual understanding, and fine-grained semantic comprehension. However, because the representation spaces of LLMs and the vision-language space of CLIP are pretrained independently without alignment priors, direct alignment using contrastive learning can disrupt the intrinsic vision-language alignment in the CLIP image encoder, leading to an underutilization of the knowledge acquired during pre-training. To address this challenge, we propose ProCLIP, a curriculum learning-based progressive vision-language alignment framework to effectively align the CLIP image encoder with an LLM-based embedder. Specifically, ProCLIP first distills knowledge from CLIP's text encoder into the LLM-based embedder to leverage CLIP's rich pretrained knowledge while establishing initial alignment between the LLM embedder and CLIP image encoder. Subsequently, ProCLIP further aligns the CLIP image encoder with the LLM-based embedder through image-text contrastive tuning, employing self-distillation regularization to avoid overfitting. To achieve a more effective alignment, instance semantic alignment loss and embedding structure alignment loss are employed during representation inheritance and contrastive tuning.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  A recent class of hyperspectral anomaly detection methods that can be trained once on background datasets and then universally deployed -- without per-scene retraining or parameter tuning -- has demonstrated remarkable efficiency and robustness. Building upon this paradigm, we focus on the integration of spectral and spatial cues and introduce a novel "Rebellious Student" framework for complementary feature learning. Unlike conventional teacher-student paradigms driven by imitation, our method intentionally trains the spatial branch to diverge from the spectral teacher, thereby learning complementary spatial patterns that the teacher fails to capture. A two-stage learning strategy is adopted: (1) a spectral enhancement network is first trained via reverse distillation to obtain robust background spectral representations; and (2) a spatial network -- the rebellious student -- is subsequently optimized using decorrelation losses that enforce feature orthogonality while maintaining reconstruction fidelity to avoid irrelevant noise. Once trained, the framework enhances both spectral and spatial background features, enabling parameter-free and training-free anomaly detection when paired with conventional detectors. Extensive experiments on the HAD100 benchmark show substantial improvements over several established baselines with minimal computational overhead, confirming the effectiveness and generality of the proposed complementary learning paradigm.

  Recent advances in video generation have made it possible to produce visually compelling videos, with wide-ranging applications in content creation, entertainment, and virtual reality. However, most existing diffusion transformer based video generation models are limited to low-resolution outputs (<=720P) due to the quadratic computational complexity of the attention mechanism with respect to the output width and height. This computational bottleneck makes native high-resolution video generation (1080P/2K/4K) impractical for both training and inference. To address this challenge, we present UltraGen, a novel video generation framework that enables i) efficient and ii) end-to-end native high-resolution video synthesis. Specifically, UltraGen features a hierarchical dual-branch attention architecture based on global-local attention decomposition, which decouples full attention into a local attention branch for high-fidelity regional content and a global attention branch for overall semantic consistency. We further propose a spatially compressed global modeling strategy to efficiently learn global dependencies, and a hierarchical cross-window local attention mechanism to reduce computational costs while enhancing information flow across different local windows. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UltraGen can effectively scale pre-trained low-resolution video models to 1080P and even 4K resolution for the first time, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods and super-resolution based two-stage pipelines in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations.

  _Jannis Fleckenstein, David Kreismann, Tamara Rosemary Govindasamy, Thomas Brunschwiler, Etienne Vos, Mattia Rigotti_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As urbanization and climate change progress, urban heat island effects are becoming more frequent and severe. To formulate effective mitigation plans, cities require detailed air temperature data, yet conventional machine learning models with limited data often produce inaccurate predictions, particularly in underserved areas. Geospatial foundation models trained on global unstructured data offer a promising alternative by demonstrating strong generalization and requiring only minimal fine-tuning. In this study, an empirical ground truth of urban heat patterns is established by quantifying cooling effects from green spaces and benchmarking them against model predictions to evaluate the model's accuracy. The foundation model is subsequently fine-tuned to predict land surface temperatures under future climate scenarios, and its practical value is demonstrated through a simulated inpainting that highlights its role for mitigation support. The results indicate that foundation models offer a powerful way for evaluating urban heat island mitigation strategies in data-scarce regions to support more climate-resilient cities.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper investigates the problem of Generalized Category Discovery (GCD). Given a partially labelled dataset, GCD aims to categorize all unlabelled images, regardless of whether they belong to known or unknown classes. Existing approaches typically depend on either single-level semantics or manually designed abstract hierarchies, which limit their generalizability and scalability. To address these limitations, we introduce a SEmantic-aware hierArchical Learning framework (SEAL), guided by naturally occurring and easily accessible hierarchical structures. Within SEAL, we propose a Hierarchical Semantic-Guided Soft Contrastive Learning approach that exploits hierarchical similarity to generate informative soft negatives, addressing the limitations of conventional contrastive losses that treat all negatives equally. Furthermore, a Cross-Granularity Consistency (CGC) module is designed to align the predictions from different levels of granularity. SEAL consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance on fine-grained benchmarks, including the SSB benchmark, Oxford-Pet, and the Herbarium19 dataset, and further demonstrates generalization on coarse-grained datasets.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a pivotal technique for real-time view synthesis in colonoscopy, enabling critical applications such as virtual colonoscopy and lesion tracking. However, the vanilla 3DGS assumes static illumination and that observed appearance depends solely on viewing angle, which causes incompatibility with the photometric variations in colonoscopic scenes induced by dynamic light source/camera. This mismatch forces most 3DGS methods to introduce structure-violating vaporous Gaussian blobs between the camera and tissues to compensate for illumination attenuation, ultimately degrading the quality of 3D reconstructions. Previous works only consider the illumination attenuation caused by light distance, ignoring the physical characters of light source and camera. In this paper, we propose ColIAGS, an improved 3DGS framework tailored for colonoscopy. To mimic realistic appearance under varying illumination, we introduce an Improved Appearance Modeling with two types of illumination attenuation factors, which enables Gaussians to adapt to photometric variations while preserving geometry accuracy. To ensure the geometry approximation condition of appearance modeling, we propose an Improved Geometry Modeling using high-dimensional view embedding to enhance Gaussian geometry attribute prediction. Furthermore, another cosine embedding input is leveraged to generate illumination attenuation solutions in an implicit manner. Comprehensive experimental results on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our proposed ColIAGS achieves the dual capabilities of novel view synthesis and accurate geometric reconstruction. It notably outperforms other state-of-the-art methods by achieving superior rendering fidelity while significantly reducing Depth MSE. Code will be available.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Although Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated proficiency in video captioning, practical applications require captions that follow specific user instructions rather than generating exhaustive, unconstrained descriptions. Current benchmarks, however, primarily assess descriptive comprehensiveness while largely overlooking instruction-following capabilities. To address this gap, we introduce IF-VidCap, a new benchmark for evaluating controllable video captioning, which contains 1,400 high-quality samples. Distinct from existing video captioning or general instruction-following benchmarks, IF-VidCap incorporates a systematic framework that assesses captions on two dimensions: format correctness and content correctness. Our comprehensive evaluation of over 20 prominent models reveals a nuanced landscape: despite the continued dominance of proprietary models, the performance gap is closing, with top-tier open-source solutions now achieving near-parity. Furthermore, we find that models specialized for dense captioning underperform general-purpose MLLMs on complex instructions, indicating that future work should simultaneously advance both descriptive richness and instruction-following fidelity.

  _Siyong Jian, Huan Wang_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Autoregressive image generation models like Janus-Pro produce high-quality images, but at the significant cost of high memory and ever-growing computational demands due to the large number of visual tokens. While KV cache compression has been extensively studied in language modeling, it still remains largely unexplored for the image generation domain. In this work, we begin by identifying a distinct and prominent attention phenomenon, which we term spatial locality and emergent semantic sink. To leverage this key insight, we introduce a novel KV cache compression framework. Specifically, we compress the KV cache for all visual tokens by adaptively decoupling attention heads into two separate types: for spatial-locality heads, our method maintains a short recent token window; for semantic-sink heads, it strategically preserves a compact set of highly-attended tokens. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves a 5$\times$ reduction in memory usage and a notable 6.6$\times$ speedup in overall throughput with only minimal visual quality loss, thereby enabling highly efficient native autoregressive image generation on resource-constrained hardware.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper addresses metric 3D reconstruction of indoor scenes by exploiting their inherent geometric regularities with compact representations. Using planar 3D primitives - a well-suited representation for man-made environments - we introduce PLANA3R, a pose-free framework for metric Planar 3D Reconstruction from unposed two-view images. Our approach employs Vision Transformers to extract a set of sparse planar primitives, estimate relative camera poses, and supervise geometry learning via planar splatting, where gradients are propagated through high-resolution rendered depth and normal maps of primitives. Unlike prior feedforward methods that require 3D plane annotations during training, PLANA3R learns planar 3D structures without explicit plane supervision, enabling scalable training on large-scale stereo datasets using only depth and normal annotations. We validate PLANA3R on multiple indoor-scene datasets with metric supervision and demonstrate strong generalization to out-of-domain indoor environments across diverse tasks under metric evaluation protocols, including 3D surface reconstruction, depth estimation, and relative pose estimation. Furthermore, by formulating with planar 3D representation, our method emerges with the ability for accurate plane segmentation. The project page is available atthis https URL

  _Peiqin Zhuang, Lei Bai, Yichao Wu, Ding Liang, Luping Zhou, Yali Wang, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recently, action recognition has been dominated by transformer-based methods, thanks to their spatiotemporal contextual aggregation capacities. However, despite the significant progress achieved on scene-related datasets, they do not perform well on motion-sensitive datasets due to the lack of elaborate motion modeling designs. Meanwhile, we observe that the widely-used cost volume in traditional action recognition is highly similar to the affinity matrix defined in self-attention, but equipped with powerful motion modeling capacities. In light of this, we propose to integrate those effective motion modeling properties into the existing transformer in a unified and neat way, with the proposal of the Explicit Motion Information Mining module (EMIM). In EMIM, we propose to construct the desirable affinity matrix in a cost volume style, where the set of key candidate tokens is sampled from the query-based neighboring area in the next frame in a sliding-window manner. Then, the constructed affinity matrix is used to aggregate contextual information for appearance modeling and is converted into motion features for motion modeling as well. We validate the motion modeling capacities of our method on four widely-used datasets, and our method performs better than existing state-of-the-art approaches, especially on motion-sensitive datasets, i.e., Something-Something V1 & V2.

  _Yiqi Lin, Alex Jinpeng Wang, Linjie Li, Zhengyuan Yang, Mike Zheng Shou_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Contrastive vision-language models such as CLIP have demonstrated strong performance across a wide range of multimodal tasks by learning from aligned image-text pairs. However, their ability to handle complex, real-world web documents remains limited, particularly in scenarios where text and images are interleaved, loosely aligned, or embedded in visual form. To address these challenges, we propose Vision-Centric Contrastive Learning (VC2L), a unified framework that models text, images, and their combinations using a single vision transformer. VC2L operates entirely in pixel space by rendering all inputs, whether textual, visual, or combined, as images, thus eliminating the need for OCR, text tokenization, or modality fusion strategy. To capture complex cross-modal relationships in multimodal web documents, VC2L employs a snippet-level contrastive learning objective that aligns consecutive multimodal segments, leveraging the inherent coherence of documents without requiring explicitly paired image-text data. To assess the effectiveness of this approach, we introduce three retrieval benchmarks, AnyCIR, SeqCIR, and CSR, designed to evaluate cross-modal retrieval, fine-grained sequential understanding, and generalization to unseen data, respectively. Empirical results show that VC2L achieves competitive or superior performance compared to CLIP-style models on both the proposed benchmarks and established datasets such as M-BEIR and MTEB. These findings underscore the potential of multimodal web data as a valuable training resource for contrastive learning and illustrate the scalability of a unified, vision-centric approach for multimodal representation learning.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent progress in text-to-image (T2I) generation underscores the importance of reliable benchmarks in evaluating how accurately generated images reflect the semantics of their textual prompt. However, (1) existing benchmarks lack the diversity of prompt scenarios and multilingual support, both essential for real-world applicability; (2) they offer only coarse evaluations across primary dimensions, covering a narrow range of sub-dimensions, and fall short in fine-grained sub-dimension assessment. To address these limitations, we introduce UniGenBench++, a unified semantic assessment benchmark for T2I generation. Specifically, it comprises 600 prompts organized hierarchically to ensure both coverage and efficiency: (1) spans across diverse real-world scenarios, i.e., 5 main prompt themes and 20 subthemes; (2) comprehensively probes T2I models' semantic consistency over 10 primary and 27 sub evaluation criteria, with each prompt assessing multiple testpoints. To rigorously assess model robustness to variations in language and prompt length, we provide both English and Chinese versions of each prompt in short and long forms. Leveraging the general world knowledge and fine-grained image understanding capabilities of a closed-source Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM), i.e., Gemini-2.5-Pro, an effective pipeline is developed for reliable benchmark construction and streamlined model assessment. Moreover, to further facilitate community use, we train a robust evaluation model that enables offline assessment of T2I model outputs. Through comprehensive benchmarking of both open- and closed-sourced T2I models, we systematically reveal their strengths and weaknesses across various aspects.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Long video generation with Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) is bottlenecked by the quadratic scaling of full attention with sequence length. Since attention is highly redundant, outputs are dominated by a small subset of query-key pairs. Existing sparse methods rely on blockwise coarse estimation, whose accuracy-efficiency trade-offs are constrained by block size. This paper introduces Mixture-of-Groups Attention (MoGA), an efficient sparse attention that uses a lightweight, learnable token router to precisely match tokens without blockwise estimation. Through semantic-aware routing, MoGA enables effective long-range interactions. As a kernel-free method, MoGA integrates seamlessly with modern attention stacks, including FlashAttention and sequence parallelism. Building on MoGA, we develop an efficient long video generation model that end-to-end produces minute-level, multi-shot, 480p videos at 24 fps, with a context length of approximately 580k. Comprehensive experiments on various video generation tasks validate the effectiveness of our approach.

  _Hanif Rasyidi, Moshiur Farazi_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper investigates various factors that influence the performance of end-to-end deep learning approaches for historical writer identification (HWI), a task that remains challenging due to the diversity of handwriting styles, document degradation, and the limited number of labelled samples per writer. These conditions often make accurate recognition difficult, even for human experts. Traditional HWI methods typically rely on handcrafted image processing and clustering techniques, which tend to perform well on small and carefully curated datasets. In contrast, end-to-end pipelines aim to automate the process by learning features directly from document images. However, our experiments show that many of these models struggle to generalise in more realistic, document-level settings, especially under zero-shot scenarios where writers in the test set are not present in the training data. We explore different combinations of pre-processing methods, backbone architectures, and post-processing strategies, including text segmentation, patch sampling, and feature aggregation. The results suggest that most configurations perform poorly due to weak capture of low-level visual features, inconsistent patch representations, and high sensitivity to content noise. Still, we identify one end-to-end setup that achieves results comparable to the top-performing system, despite using a simpler design. These findings point to key challenges in building robust end-to-end systems and offer insight into design choices that improve performance in historical document writer identification.

  _Hichem Sahbi_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper devises a novel interactive satellite image change detection algorithm based on active learning. Our framework employs an iterative process that leverages a question-and-answer model. This model queries the oracle (user) about the labels of a small subset of images (dubbed as display), and based on the oracle's responses, change detection model is dynamically updated. The main contribution of our framework resides in a novel invertible network that allows augmenting displays, by mapping them from highly nonlinear input spaces to latent ones, where augmentation transformations become linear and more tractable. The resulting augmented data are afterwards mapped back to the input space, and used to retrain more effective change detection criteria in the subsequent iterations of active learning. Experimental results demonstrate superior performance of our proposed method compared to the related work.

  Semantic segmentation of electron microscopy (EM) images of biological samples remains a challenge in the life sciences. EM data captures details of biological structures, sometimes with such complexity that even human observers can find it overwhelming. We introduce {\epsilon}-Seg, a method based on hierarchical variational autoencoders (HVAEs), employing center-region masking, sparse label contrastive learning (CL), a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) prior, and clustering-free label prediction. Center-region masking and the inpainting loss encourage the model to learn robust and representative embeddings to distinguish the desired classes, even if training labels are sparse (0.05% of the total image data or less). For optimal performance, we employ CL and a GMM prior to shape the latent space of the HVAE such that encoded input patches tend to cluster wrt. the semantic classes we wish to distinguish. Finally, instead of clustering latent embeddings for semantic segmentation, we propose a MLP semantic segmentation head to directly predict class labels from latent embeddings. We show empirical results of {\epsilon}-Seg and baseline methods on 2 dense EM datasets of biological tissues and demonstrate the applicability of our method also on fluorescence microscopy data. Our results show that {\epsilon}-Seg is capable of achieving competitive sparsely-supervised segmentation results on complex biological image data, even if only limited amounts of training labels are available.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Neural network compression has gained increasing attention in recent years, particularly in computer vision applications, where the need for model reduction is crucial for overcoming deployment constraints. Pruning is a widely used technique that prompts sparsity in model structures, e.g. weights, neurons, and layers, reducing size and inference costs. Structured pruning is especially important as it allows for the removal of entire structures, which further accelerates inference time and reduces memory overhead. However, it can be computationally expensive, requiring iterative retraining and optimization. To overcome this problem, recent methods considered one-shot setting, which applies pruning directly at post-training. Unfortunately, they often lead to a considerable drop in performance. In this paper, we focus on this issue by proposing a novel one-shot pruning framework that relies on explainable deep learning. First, we introduce a causal-aware pruning approach that leverages cause-effect relations between model predictions and structures in a progressive pruning process. It allows us to efficiently reduce the size of the network, ensuring that the removed structures do not deter the performance of the model. Then, through experiments conducted on convolution neural network and vision transformer baselines, pre-trained on classification tasks, we demonstrate that our method consistently achieves substantial reductions in model size, with minimal impact on performance, and without the need for fine-tuning. Overall, our approach outperforms its counterparts, offering the best trade-off. Our code is available on GitHub.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Though recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable progress across a wide range of multimodal tasks, understanding 3D spatial relationships from limited views remains a significant challenge. Previous reasoning methods typically rely on pure text (e.g., topological cognitive maps) or on 2D visual cues. However, their limited representational capacity hinders performance in specific tasks that require 3D spatial imagination. To address this limitation, we propose 3DThinker, a framework that can effectively exploits the rich geometric information embedded within images while reasoning, like humans do. Our framework is the first to enable 3D mentaling during reasoning without any 3D prior input, and it does not rely on explicitly labeled 3D data for training. Specifically, our training consists of two stages. First, we perform supervised training to align the 3D latent generated by VLM while reasoning with that of a 3D foundation model (e.g., VGGT). Then, we optimize the entire reasoning trajectory solely based on outcome signals, thereby refining the underlying 3D mentaling. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks show that 3DThinker consistently outperforms strong baselines and offers a new perspective toward unifying 3D representations into multimodal reasoning. Our code will be available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multimodal dataset distillation aims to synthesize a small set of image-text pairs that enables efficient training of large-scale vision-language models. While dataset distillation has shown promise in unimodal tasks, extending it to multimodal contrastive learning presents key challenges: learning cross-modal alignment and managing the high computational cost of large encoders. Prior approaches address scalability by freezing the text encoder and update only the image encoder and text projection layer. However, we find this severely limits semantic alignment and becomes a bottleneck for performance scaling. We propose CovMatch, a scalable dataset distillation framework that aligns the cross-covariance of real and synthetic features while regularizing feature distributions within each modality. Unlike prior approaches, CovMatch enables joint optimization of both encoders, leading to stronger cross-modal alignment and improved performance. Evaluated on Flickr30K and COCO, CovMatch outperforms state-of-the-art multimodal distillation methods and achieves up to 6.8% absolute gains in retrieval accuracy using only 500 synthetic pairs.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present Kaleido, a subject-to-video~(S2V) generation framework, which aims to synthesize subject-consistent videos conditioned on multiple reference images of target subjects. Despite recent progress in S2V generation models, existing approaches remain inadequate at maintaining multi-subject consistency and at handling background disentanglement, often resulting in lower reference fidelity and semantic drift under multi-image conditioning. These shortcomings can be attributed to several factors. Primarily, the training dataset suffers from a lack of diversity and high-quality samples, as well as cross-paired data, i.e., paired samples whose components originate from different instances. In addition, the current mechanism for integrating multiple reference images is suboptimal, potentially resulting in the confusion of multiple subjects. To overcome these limitations, we propose a dedicated data construction pipeline, incorporating low-quality sample filtering and diverse data synthesis, to produce consistency-preserving training data. Moreover, we introduce Reference Rotary Positional Encoding (R-RoPE) to process reference images, enabling stable and precise multi-image integration. Extensive experiments across numerous benchmarks demonstrate that Kaleido significantly outperforms previous methods in consistency, fidelity, and generalization, marking an advance in S2V generation.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Robust perception in automated driving requires reliable performance under adverse conditions, where sensors may be affected by partial failures or environmental occlusions. Although existing autonomous driving datasets inherently contain sensor noise and environmental variability, very few enable controlled, parameterised, and reproducible degradations across multiple sensing modalities. This gap limits the ability to systematically evaluate how perception and fusion architectures perform under well-defined adverse conditions. To address this limitation, we introduce the Occluded nuScenes Dataset, a novel extension of the widely used nuScenes benchmark. For the camera modality, we release both the full and mini versions with four types of occlusions, two adapted from public implementations and two newly designed. For radar and LiDAR, we provide parameterised occlusion scripts that implement three types of degradations each, enabling flexible and repeatable generation of occluded data. This resource supports consistent, reproducible evaluation of perception models under partial sensor failures and environmental interference. By releasing the first multi-sensor occlusion dataset with controlled and reproducible degradations, we aim to advance research on robust sensor fusion, resilience analysis, and safety-critical perception in automated driving.

  This technical report outlines the top-ranking solution for RoboSense 2025: Track 3, achieving state-of-the-art performance on 3D object detection under various sensor placements. Our submission utilizes GBlobs, a local point cloud feature descriptor specifically designed to enhance model generalization across diverse LiDAR configurations. Current LiDAR-based 3D detectors often suffer from a \enquote{geometric shortcut} when trained on conventional global features (\ie, absolute Cartesian coordinates). This introduces a position bias that causes models to primarily rely on absolute object position rather than distinguishing shape and appearance characteristics. Although effective for in-domain data, this shortcut severely limits generalization when encountering different point distributions, such as those resulting from varying sensor placements. By using GBlobs as network input features, we effectively circumvent this geometric shortcut, compelling the network to learn robust, object-centric representations. This approach significantly enhances the model's ability to generalize, resulting in the exceptional performance demonstrated in this challenge.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Typical template-based object pose pipelines estimate the pose by retrieving the closest matching template and aligning it with the observed image. However, failure to retrieve the correct template often leads to inaccurate pose predictions. To address this, we reformulate template-based object pose estimation as a ray alignment problem, where the viewing directions from multiple posed template images are learned to align with a non-posed query image. Inspired by recent progress in diffusion-based camera pose estimation, we embed this formulation into a diffusion transformer architecture that aligns a query image with a set of posed templates. We reparameterize object rotation using object-centered camera rays and model object translation by extending scale-invariant translation estimation to dense translation offsets. Our model leverages geometric priors from the templates to guide accurate query pose inference. A coarse-to-fine training strategy based on narrowed template sampling improves performance without modifying the network architecture. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets show competitive results of our method compared to state-of-the-art approaches in unseen object pose estimation.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The rise of convenience packaging has led to generation of enormous waste, making efficient waste sorting crucial for sustainable waste management. To address this, we developed DWaste, a computer vision-powered platform designed for real-time waste sorting on resource-constrained smartphones and edge devices, including offline functionality. We benchmarked various image classification models (EfficientNetV2S/M, ResNet50/101, MobileNet) and object detection (YOLOv8n, YOLOv11n) using a subset of our own waste data set and annotated it using the custom tool Annotated Lab. We found a clear trade-off between accuracy and resource consumption: the best classifier, EfficientNetV2S, achieved high accuracy (~ 96%) but suffered from high latency (~ 0.22s) and elevated carbon emissions. In contrast, lightweight object detection models delivered strong performance (up to 77% mAP) with ultra-fast inference (~ 0.03s) and significantly smaller model sizes (< 7MB), making them ideal for real-time, low-power use. Model quantization further maximized efficiency, substantially reducing model size and VRAM usage by up to 75%.

  Vehicle make and model recognition (VMMR) is an important task in intelligent transportation systems, but existing approaches struggle to adapt to newly released models. Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) provides strong visual-text alignment, yet its fixed pretrained weights limit performance without costly image-specific finetuning. We propose a pipeline that integrates vision language models (VLMs) with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to support zero-shot recognition through text-based reasoning. A VLM converts vehicle images into descriptive attributes, which are compared against a database of textual features. Relevant entries are retrieved and combined with the description to form a prompt, and a language model (LM) infers the make and model. This design avoids large-scale retraining and enables rapid updates by adding textual descriptions of new vehicles. Experiments show that the proposed method improves recognition by nearly 20% over the CLIP baseline, demonstrating the potential of RAG-enhanced LM reasoning for scalable VMMR in smart-city applications.

  _Jinfeng Liu, Lingtong Kong, Mi Zhou, Jinwen Chen, Dan Xu_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce Mono4DGS-HDR, the first system for reconstructing renderable 4D high dynamic range (HDR) scenes from unposed monocular low dynamic range (LDR) videos captured with alternating exposures. To tackle such a challenging problem, we present a unified framework with two-stage optimization approach based on Gaussian Splatting. The first stage learns a video HDR Gaussian representation in orthographic camera coordinate space, eliminating the need for camera poses and enabling robust initial HDR video reconstruction. The second stage transforms video Gaussians into world space and jointly refines the world Gaussians with camera poses. Furthermore, we propose a temporal luminance regularization strategy to enhance the temporal consistency of the HDR appearance. Since our task has not been studied before, we construct a new evaluation benchmark using publicly available datasets for HDR video reconstruction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Mono4DGS-HDR significantly outperforms alternative solutions adapted from state-of-the-art methods in both rendering quality and speed.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The performance of Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) is critically dependent on the quality of their visual tokenizer. While recent works have explored incorporating Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) via distillation, we identify a fundamental flaw in this approach: it inevitably weakens the robustness of alignment with the original VFM, causing the aligned latents to deviate semantically under distribution shifts. In this paper, we bypass distillation by proposing a more direct approach: Vision Foundation Model Variational Autoencoder (VFM-VAE). To resolve the inherent tension between the VFM's semantic focus and the need for pixel-level fidelity, we redesign the VFM-VAE decoder with Multi-Scale Latent Fusion and Progressive Resolution Reconstruction blocks, enabling high-quality reconstruction from spatially coarse VFM features. Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive analysis of representation dynamics during diffusion training, introducing the proposed SE-CKNNA metric as a more precise tool for this diagnosis. This analysis allows us to develop a joint tokenizer-diffusion alignment strategy that dramatically accelerates convergence. Our innovations in tokenizer design and training strategy lead to superior performance and efficiency: our system reaches a gFID (w/o CFG) of 2.20 in merely 80 epochs (a 10x speedup over prior tokenizers). With continued training to 640 epochs, it further attains a gFID (w/o CFG) of 1.62, establishing direct VFM integration as a superior paradigm for LDMs.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This work introduces a new latent diffusion model to generate high-quality 3D chest CT scans conditioned on 3D anatomical masks. The method synthesizes volumetric images of size 256x256x256 at 1 mm isotropic resolution using a single mid-range GPU, significantly lowering the computational cost compared to existing approaches. The conditioning masks delineate lung and nodule regions, enabling precise control over the output anatomical features. Experimental results demonstrate that conditioning solely on nodule masks leads to anatomically incorrect outputs, highlighting the importance of incorporating global lung structure for accurate conditional synthesis. The proposed approach supports the generation of diverse CT volumes with and without lung nodules of varying attributes, providing a valuable tool for training AI models or healthcare professionals.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  At the core of Camouflaged Object Detection (COD) lies segmenting objects from their highly similar surroundings. Previous efforts navigate this challenge primarily through image-level modeling or annotation-based optimization. Despite advancing considerably, this commonplace practice hardly taps valuable dataset-level contextual information or relies on laborious annotations. In this paper, we propose RISE, a RetrIeval SElf-augmented paradigm that exploits the entire training dataset to generate pseudo-labels for single images, which could be used to train COD models. RISE begins by constructing prototype libraries for environments and camouflaged objects using training images (without ground truth), followed by K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) retrieval to generate pseudo-masks for each image based on these libraries. It is important to recognize that using only training images without annotations exerts a pronounced challenge in crafting high-quality prototype libraries. In this light, we introduce a Clustering-then-Retrieval (CR) strategy, where coarse masks are first generated through clustering, facilitating subsequent histogram-based image filtering and cross-category retrieval to produce high-confidence prototypes. In the KNN retrieval stage, to alleviate the effect of artifacts in feature maps, we propose Multi-View KNN Retrieval (MVKR), which integrates retrieval results from diverse views to produce more robust and precise pseudo-masks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RISE outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised and prompt-based methods. Code is available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advancements in vision transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated that larger models often achieve superior performance. However, training these models remains computationally intensive and costly. To address this challenge, we introduce ScaleNet, an efficient approach for scaling ViT models. Unlike conventional training from scratch, ScaleNet facilitates rapid model expansion with negligible increases in parameters, building on existing pretrained models. This offers a cost-effective solution for scaling up ViTs. Specifically, ScaleNet achieves model expansion by inserting additional layers into pretrained ViTs, utilizing layer-wise weight sharing to maintain parameters efficiency. Each added layer shares its parameter tensor with a corresponding layer from the pretrained model. To mitigate potential performance degradation due to shared weights, ScaleNet introduces a small set of adjustment parameters for each layer. These adjustment parameters are implemented through parallel adapter modules, ensuring that each instance of the shared parameter tensor remains distinct and optimized for its specific function. Experiments on the ImageNet-1K dataset demonstrate that ScaleNet enables efficient expansion of ViT models. With a 2$\times$ depth-scaled DeiT-Base model, ScaleNet achieves a 7.42% accuracy improvement over training from scratch while requiring only one-third of the training epochs, highlighting its efficiency in scaling ViTs. Beyond image classification, our method shows significant potential for application in downstream vision areas, as evidenced by the validation in object detection task.

  This paper presents an automated system for cricket video analysis that leverages deep learning techniques to extract wicket-taking deliveries, detect cricket balls, and model ball trajectories. The system employs the YOLOv8 architecture for pitch and ball detection, combined with optical character recognition (OCR) for scorecard extraction to identify wicket-taking moments. Through comprehensive image preprocessing, including grayscale transformation, power transformation, and morphological operations, the system achieves robust text extraction from video frames. The pitch detection model achieved 99.5% mean Average Precision at 50% IoU (mAP50) with a precision of 0.999, while the ball detection model using transfer learning attained 99.18% mAP50 with 0.968 precision and 0.978 recall. The system enables trajectory modeling on detected pitches, providing data-driven insights for identifying batting weaknesses. Experimental results on multiple cricket match videos demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach for automated cricket analytics, offering significant potential for coaching and strategic decision-making.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Tensor decomposition is a powerful tool for data analysis and has been extensively employed in the field of hyperspectral-multispectral image fusion (HMF). Existing tensor decomposition-based fusion methods typically rely on disruptive data vectorization/reshaping or impose rigid constraints on the arrangement of factor tensors, hindering the preservation of spatial-spectral structures and the modeling of cross-dimensional correlations. Although recent advances utilizing the Fully-Connected Tensor Network (FCTN) decomposition have partially alleviated these limitations, the process of reorganizing data into higher-order tensors still disrupts the intrinsic spatial-spectral structure. Furthermore, these methods necessitate extensive manual parameter tuning and exhibit limited robustness against noise and spatial degradation. To alleviate these issues, we propose the Bayesian FCTN (BFCTN) method. Within this probabilistic framework, a hierarchical sparse prior that characterizing the sparsity of physical elements, establishes connections between the factor tensors. This framework explicitly models the intrinsic physical coupling among spatial structures, spectral signatures, and local scene homogeneity. For model learning, we develop a parameter estimation method based on Variational Bayesian inference (VB) and the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm, which significantly reduces the need for manual parameter tuning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BFCTN not only achieves state-of-the-art fusion accuracy and strong robustness but also exhibits practical applicability in complex real-world scenarios.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Background and Objective: In brain imaging, geometric surface models are essential for analyzing the 3D shapes of anatomical structures. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is associated with significant cortical atrophy, making such shape analysis a valuable diagnostic tool. The objective of this study is to introduce and validate a novel local surface representation method for the automated and accurate diagnosis of AD. Methods: The study utilizes T1-weighted MRI scans from 160 participants (80 AD patients and 80 healthy controls) from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Cortical surface models were reconstructed from the MRI data using Freesurfer. Key geometric attributes were computed from the 3D meshes. Area distortion and conformal factor were derived using Ricci flow for conformal parameterization, while Gaussian curvature was calculated directly from the mesh geometry. Shannon entropy was applied to these three features to create compact and informative feature vectors. The feature vectors were used to train and evaluate a suite of classifiers (e.g. XGBoost, MLP, Logistic Regression, etc.). Results: Statistical significance of performance differences between classifiers was evaluated using paired Welch's t-test. The method proved highly effective in distinguishing AD patients from healthy controls. The Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and Logistic Regression classifiers outperformed all others, achieving an accuracy and F$_1$ Score of 98.62%. Conclusions: This study confirms that the entropy of conformally-derived geometric features provides a powerful and robust metric for cortical morphometry. The high classification accuracy underscores the method's potential to enhance the study and diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease, offering a straightforward yet powerful tool for clinical research applications.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Adversarial pruning methods have emerged as a powerful tool for compressing neural networks while preserving robustness against adversarial attacks. These methods typically follow a three-step pipeline: (i) pretrain a robust model, (ii) select a binary mask for weight pruning, and (iii) finetune the pruned model. To select the binary mask, these methods minimize a robust loss by assigning an importance score to each weight, and then keep the weights with the highest scores. However, this score-space optimization can lead to sharp local minima in the robust loss landscape and, in turn, to an unstable mask selection, reducing the robustness of adversarial pruning methods. To overcome this issue, we propose a novel plug-in method for adversarial pruning, termed Score-space Sharpness-aware Adversarial Pruning (S2AP). Through our method, we introduce the concept of score-space sharpness minimization, which operates during the mask search by perturbing importance scores and minimizing the corresponding robust loss. Extensive experiments across various datasets, models, and sparsity levels demonstrate that S2AP effectively minimizes sharpness in score space, stabilizing the mask selection, and ultimately improving the robustness of adversarial pruning methods.

  Image complexity assessment (ICA) is a challenging task in perceptual evaluation due to the subjective nature of human perception and the inherent semantic diversity in real-world images. Existing ICA methods predominantly rely on hand-crafted or shallow convolutional neural network-based features of a single visual modality, which are insufficient to fully capture the perceived representations closely related to image complexity. Recently, cross-modal scene semantic information has been shown to play a crucial role in various computer vision tasks, particularly those involving perceptual understanding. However, the exploration of cross-modal scene semantic information in the context of ICA remains unaddressed. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel ICA method called Cross-Modal Scene Semantic Alignment (CM-SSA), which leverages scene semantic alignment from a cross-modal perspective to enhance ICA performance, enabling complexity predictions to be more consistent with subjective human perception. Specifically, the proposed CM-SSA consists of a complexity regression branch and a scene semantic alignment branch. The complexity regression branch estimates image complexity levels under the guidance of the scene semantic alignment branch, while the scene semantic alignment branch is used to align images with corresponding text prompts that convey rich scene semantic information by pair-wise learning. Extensive experiments on several ICA datasets demonstrate that the proposed CM-SSA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches. Codes are available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The vulnerability of deep neural networks (DNNs) has been preliminarily verified. Existing black-box adversarial attacks usually require multi-round interaction with the model and consume numerous queries, which is impractical in the real-world and hard to scale to recently emerged Video-LLMs. Moreover, no attack in the video domain directly leverages feature maps to shift the clean-video feature space. We therefore propose FeatureFool, a stealthy, video-domain, zero-query black-box attack that utilizes information extracted from a DNN to alter the feature space of clean videos. Unlike query-based methods that rely on iterative interaction, FeatureFool performs a zero-query attack by directly exploiting DNN-extracted information. This efficient approach is unprecedented in the video domain. Experiments show that FeatureFool achieves an attack success rate above 70\% against traditional video classifiers without any queries. Benefiting from the transferability of the feature map, it can also craft harmful content and bypass Video-LLM recognition. Additionally, adversarial videos generated by FeatureFool exhibit high quality in terms of SSIM, PSNR, and Temporal-Inconsistency, making the attack barely perceptible. This paper may contain violent or explicit content.

  Human-Object Interaction Detection (HOI-DET) aims to localize human-object pairs and identify their interactive relationships. To aggregate contextual cues, existing methods typically propagate information across all detected entities via self-attention mechanisms, or establish message passing between humans and objects with bipartite graphs. However, they primarily focus on pairwise relationships, overlooking that interactions in real-world scenarios often emerge from collective behaviors (multiple humans and objects engaging in joint activities). In light of this, we revisit relation modeling from a group view and propose GroupHOI, a framework that propagates contextual information in terms of geometric proximity and semantic similarity. To exploit the geometric proximity, humans and objects are grouped into distinct clusters using a learnable proximity estimator based on spatial features derived from bounding boxes. In each group, a soft correspondence is computed via self-attention to aggregate and dispatch contextual cues. To incorporate the semantic similarity, we enhance the vanilla transformer-based interaction decoder with local contextual cues from HO-pair features. Extensive experiments on HICO-DET and V-COCO benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of GroupHOI over the state-of-the-art methods. It also exhibits leading performance on the more challenging Nonverbal Interaction Detection (NVI-DET) task, which involves varied forms of higher-order interactions within groups.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Direct preference optimization (DPO) methods have shown strong potential in aligning text-to-image diffusion models with human preferences by training on paired comparisons. These methods improve training stability by avoiding the REINFORCE algorithm but still struggle with challenges such as accurately estimating image probabilities due to the non-linear nature of the sigmoid function and the limited diversity of offline datasets. In this paper, we introduce Diffusion Denoising Ranking Optimization (Diffusion-DRO), a new preference learning framework grounded in inverse reinforcement learning. Diffusion-DRO removes the dependency on a reward model by casting preference learning as a ranking problem, thereby simplifying the training objective into a denoising formulation and overcoming the non-linear estimation issues found in prior methods. Moreover, Diffusion-DRO uniquely integrates offline expert demonstrations with online policy-generated negative samples, enabling it to effectively capture human preferences while addressing the limitations of offline data. Comprehensive experiments show that Diffusion-DRO delivers improved generation quality across a range of challenging and unseen prompts, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines in both both quantitative metrics and user studies.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Audio-Visual Question Answering (AVQA) requires models to effectively utilize both visual and auditory modalities to answer complex and diverse questions about audio-visual scenes. However, existing methods lack sufficient flexibility and dynamic adaptability in temporal sampling and modality preference awareness, making it difficult to focus on key information based on the question. This limits their reasoning capability in complex scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework named AV-Master. It enhances the model's ability to extract key information from complex audio-visual scenes with substantial redundant content by dynamically modeling both temporal and modality dimensions. In the temporal dimension, we introduce a dynamic adaptive focus sampling mechanism that progressively focuses on audio-visual segments most relevant to the question, effectively mitigating redundancy and segment fragmentation in traditional sampling methods. In the modality dimension, we propose a preference-aware strategy that models each modality's contribution independently, enabling selective activation of critical features. Furthermore, we introduce a dual-path contrastive loss to reinforce consistency and complementarity across temporal and modality dimensions, guiding the model to learn question-specific cross-modal collaborative representations. Experiments on four large-scale benchmarks show that AV-Master significantly outperforms existing methods, especially in complex reasoning tasks.

  Compared to the prosperity of pre-training models in natural image understanding, the research on large-scale pre-training models for facial knowledge learning is still limited. Current approaches mainly rely on manually assembled and annotated face datasets for training, but labeling such datasets is labor-intensive and the trained models have limited scalability beyond the training data. To address these limitations, we present a generative pre-training model for facial knowledge learning that leverages large-scale web-built data for training. We use texts and images containing human faces crawled from the internet and conduct pre-training on self-supervised tasks, including masked image/language modeling (MILM) and image-text matching (ITM). During the generation stage, we further utilize the image-text matching loss to pull the generation distribution towards the control signal for controllable image/text generation. Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art pre-training models for various facial downstream tasks, such as attribution classification and expression recognition. Furthermore, our approach is also applicable to a wide range of face editing tasks, including face attribute editing, expression manipulation, mask removal, and photo inpainting.

  Realistic view extrapolation is critical for closed-loop simulation in autonomous driving, yet it remains a significant challenge for current Novel View Synthesis (NVS) methods, which often produce distorted and inconsistent images beyond the original trajectory. This report presents our winning solution which ctook first place in the RealADSim Workshop NVS track at ICCV 2025. To address the core challenges of street view extrapolation, we introduce a comprehensive four-stage pipeline. First, we employ a data-driven initialization strategy to generate a robust pseudo-LiDAR point cloud, avoiding local minima. Second, we inject strong geometric priors by modeling the road surface with a novel dimension-reduced SDF termed 2D-SDF. Third, we leverage a generative prior to create pseudo ground truth for extrapolated viewpoints, providing auxilary supervision. Finally, a data-driven adaptation network removes time-specific artifacts. On the RealADSim-NVS benchmark, our method achieves a final score of 0.441, ranking first among all participants.

  The increasing frequency of natural and human-induced disasters necessitates advanced visual recognition techniques capable of analyzing critical photographic data. With progress in artificial intelligence and resilient computational systems, rapid and accurate disaster classification has become crucial for efficient rescue operations. However, visual recognition in disaster contexts faces significant challenges due to limited and diverse data from the difficulties in collecting and curating comprehensive, high-quality disaster imagery. Few-Shot Learning (FSL) provides a promising approach to data scarcity, yet current FSL research mainly relies on generic benchmark datasets lacking remote-sensing disaster imagery, limiting its practical effectiveness. Moreover, disaster images exhibit high intra-class variation and inter-class similarity, hindering the performance of conventional metric-based FSL methods. To address these issues, this paper introduces the Attention-based Bhattacharyya-Hellinger Feature Aggregation Network (ATTBHFA-Net), which linearly combines the Bhattacharyya coefficient and Hellinger distances to compare and aggregate feature probability distributions for robust prototype formation. The Bhattacharyya coefficient serves as a contrastive margin that enhances inter-class separability, while the Hellinger distance regularizes same-class alignment. This framework parallels contrastive learning but operates over probability distributions rather than embedded feature points. Furthermore, a Bhattacharyya-Hellinger distance-based contrastive loss is proposed as a distributional counterpart to cosine similarity loss, used jointly with categorical cross-entropy to significantly improve FSL performance. Experiments on four FSL benchmarks and two disaster image datasets demonstrate the superior effectiveness and generalization of ATTBHFA-Net compared to existing approaches.

  Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have recently achieved impressive results in multimodal tasks such as image captioning and visual question answering. However, they remain prone to object hallucination -- generating descriptions of nonexistent or misidentified objects. Prior work has partially mitigated this via auxiliary training objectives or external modules, but challenges remain in terms of scalability, adaptability, and model independence. To address these limitations, we propose Adaptive Token Ensemble Decoding (ATED), a training-free, token-level ensemble framework that mitigates hallucination by aggregating predictions from multiple LVLMs during inference. ATED dynamically computes uncertainty-based weights for each model, reflecting their reliability at each decoding step. It also integrates diverse decoding paths to improve contextual grounding and semantic consistency. Experiments on standard hallucination detection benchmarks demonstrate that ATED significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, reducing hallucination without compromising fluency or relevance. Our findings highlight the benefits of adaptive ensembling and point to a promising direction for improving LVLM robustness in high-stakes applications. The code is available atthis https URL.

  Autonomous driving world models are expected to work effectively across three core dimensions: state, action, and reward. Existing models, however, are typically restricted to limited state modalities, short video sequences, imprecise action control, and a lack of reward awareness. In this paper, we introduce OmniNWM, an omniscient panoramic navigation world model that addresses all three dimensions within a unified framework. For state, OmniNWM jointly generates panoramic videos of RGB, semantics, metric depth, and 3D occupancy. A flexible forcing strategy enables high-quality long-horizon auto-regressive generation. For action, we introduce a normalized panoramic Plucker ray-map representation that encodes input trajectories into pixel-level signals, enabling highly precise and generalizable control over panoramic video generation. Regarding reward, we move beyond learning reward functions with external image-based models: instead, we leverage the generated 3D occupancy to directly define rule-based dense rewards for driving compliance and safety. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OmniNWM achieves state-of-the-art performance in video generation, control accuracy, and long-horizon stability, while providing a reliable closed-loop evaluation framework through occupancy-grounded rewards.

  Imaging technologies are fundamental to biomedical research and modern medicine, requiring analysis of high-resolution images across various modalities. While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) show promise for biomedical image analysis, most are designed for low-resolution images from general-purpose datasets, risking critical information loss. We investigate how image resolution affects MLLM performance in biomedical applications and demonstrate that: (1) native-resolution training and inference significantly improve performance across multiple tasks, (2) misalignment between training and inference resolutions severely degrades performance, and (3) mixed-resolution training effectively mitigates misalignment and balances computational constraints with performance requirements. Based on these findings, we recommend prioritizing native-resolution inference and mixed-resolution datasets to optimize biomedical MLLMs for transformative impact in scientific research and clinical applications.

  Incentivizing the reasoning ability of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) is essential for medical applications to transparently analyze medical scans and provide reliable diagnosis. However, existing medical MLLMs rely solely on internal knowledge during reasoning, leading to hallucinated reasoning and factual inaccuracies when encountering cases beyond their training scope. Although recent Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods elicit the medical model's proactive retrieval ability during reasoning, they are confined to unimodal LLMs, neglecting the crucial visual information during reasoning and retrieval. Consequently, we propose the first Multimodal Medical Reasoning-with-Retrieval framework, Med-RwR, which actively retrieves external knowledge by querying observed symptoms or domain-specific medical concepts during reasoning. Specifically, we design a two-stage reinforcement learning strategy with tailored rewards that stimulate the model to leverage both visual diagnostic findings and textual clinical information for effective retrieval. Building on this foundation, we further propose a Confidence-Driven Image Re-retrieval (CDIR) method for test-time scaling when low prediction confidence is detected. Evaluation on various public medical benchmarks demonstrates Med-RwR's significant improvements over baseline models, proving the effectiveness of enhancing reasoning capabilities with external knowledge integration. Furthermore, Med-RwR demonstrates remarkable generalizability to unfamiliar domains, evidenced by 8.8% performance gain on our proposed EchoCardiography Benchmark (ECBench), despite the scarcity of echocardiography data in the training corpus.

  We introduce a novel framework for metric depth estimation that enhances pretrained diffusion-based monocular depth estimation (DB-MDE) models with stereo vision guidance. While existing DB-MDE methods excel at predicting relative depth, estimating absolute metric depth remains challenging due to scale ambiguities in single-image scenarios. To address this, we reframe depth estimation as an inverse problem, leveraging pretrained latent diffusion models (LDMs) conditioned on RGB images, combined with stereo-based geometric constraints, to learn scale and shift for accurate depth recovery. Our training-free solution seamlessly integrates into existing DB-MDE frameworks and generalizes across indoor, outdoor, and complex environments. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach matches or surpasses state-of-the-art methods, particularly in challenging scenarios involving translucent and specular surfaces, all without requiring retraining.

  Identity preserving editing of faces is a generative task that enables modifying the illumination, adding/removing eyeglasses, face aging, editing hairstyles, modifying expression etc., while preserving the identity of the face. Recent progress in 2D generative models have enabled photorealistic editing of faces using simple techniques leveraging the compositionality in GANs. However, identity preserving editing for 3D faces with a given set of attributes is a challenging task as the generative model must reason about view consistency from multiple poses and render a realistic 3D face. Further, 3D portrait editing requires large-scale attribute labelled datasets and presents a trade-off between editability in low-resolution and inflexibility to editing in high resolution. In this work, we aim to alleviate some of the constraints in editing 3D faces by identifying latent space directions that correspond to photorealistic edits. To address this, we present a method that builds on recent advancements in 3D-aware deep generative models and 2D portrait editing techniques to perform efficient few-shot identity preserving attribute editing for 3D-aware generative models. We aim to show from experimental results that using just ten or fewer labelled images of an attribute is sufficient to estimate edit directions in the latent space that correspond to 3D-aware attribute editing. In this work, we leverage an existing face dataset with masks to obtain the synthetic images for few attribute examples required for estimating the edit directions. Further, to demonstrate the linearity of edits, we investigate one-shot stylization by performing sequential editing and use the (2D) Attribute Style Manipulation (ASM) technique to investigate a continuous style manifold for 3D consistent identity preserving face aging.

  Unlike offline processing, streaming video vision-language models face two fundamental constraints: causality and accumulation. Causality prevents access to future frames that offline methods exploit, while accumulation causes tokens to grow unbounded, creating efficiency bottlenecks. However, existing approaches only regulate post-LLM kv-cache, leaving costly pre-LLM prefill unchanged. We introduce StreamingTOM, a training-free, plug-and-play two-stage framework that addresses both pre-LLM and post-LLM bottlenecks with predictable latency. Causal Temporal Reduction imposes a fixed per-frame budget and selects tokens based on adjacent-frame changes and token saliency, drastically reducing per-frame prefill cost by processing only a compact subset of visual tokens per frame instead of all visual tokens. Online Quantized Memory stores tokens in 4-bit format, retrieves relevant groups on demand, and dequantizes them, keeping the active kv-cache bounded regardless of stream length. Experiments demonstrate our method achieves $15.7\times$ kv-cache compression, $1.2\times$ lower peak memory and $2\times$ faster TTFT compared to prior SOTA. StreamingTOM maintains state-of-the-art accuracy among training-free methods with an average of $63.8\%$ on offline benchmarks and $55.8\%/3.7$ on RVS. These results highlight the practical benefits of our two-stage approach for efficient streaming video understanding with bounded growth.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In medical image segmentation tasks, Domain Generalization (DG) under the Federated Learning (FL) framework is crucial for addressing challenges related to privacy protection and data heterogeneity. However, traditional federated learning methods fail to account for the imbalance in information aggregation across clients in cross-domain scenarios, leading to the Global Drift (GD) problem and a consequent decline in model generalization performance. This motivates us to delve deeper and define a new critical issue: global drift in federated domain generalization for medical imaging (FedDG-GD). In this paper, we propose a novel tree topology framework called TreeFedDG. First, starting from the distributed characteristics of medical images, we design a hierarchical parameter aggregation method based on a tree-structured topology to suppress deviations in the global model direction. Second, we introduce a parameter difference-based style mixing method (FedStyle), which enforces mixing among clients with maximum parameter differences to enhance robustness against drift. Third, we develop a a progressive personalized fusion strategy during model distribution, ensuring a balance between knowledge transfer and personalized features. Finally, during the inference phase, we use feature similarity to guide the retrieval of the most relevant model chain from the tree structure for ensemble decision-making, thereby fully leveraging the advantages of hierarchical knowledge. We conducted extensive experiments on two publicly available datasets. The results demonstrate that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art domain generalization approaches in these challenging tasks and achieves better balance in cross-domain performance.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Existing 3D human mesh recovery methods often fail to fully exploit the latent information (e.g., human motion, shape alignment), leading to issues with limb misalignment and insufficient local details in the reconstructed human mesh (especially in complex scenes). Furthermore, the performance improvement gained by modelling mesh vertices and pose node interactions using attention mechanisms comes at a high computational cost. To address these issues, we propose a two-stage network for human mesh recovery based on latent information and low dimensional learning. Specifically, the first stage of the network fully excavates global (e.g., the overall shape alignment) and local (e.g., textures, detail) information from the low and high-frequency components of image features and aggregates this information into a hybrid latent frequency domain feature. This strategy effectively extracts latent information. Subsequently, utilizing extracted hybrid latent frequency domain features collaborates to enhance 2D poses to 3D learning. In the second stage, with the assistance of hybrid latent features, we model the interaction learning between the rough 3D human mesh template and the 3D pose, optimizing the pose and shape of the human mesh. Unlike existing mesh pose interaction methods, we design a low-dimensional mesh pose interaction method through dimensionality reduction and parallel optimization that significantly reduces computational costs without sacrificing reconstruction accuracy. Extensive experimental results on large publicly available datasets indicate superiority compared to the most state-of-the-art.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable success in natural scene understanding, yet their application to underwater environments remains largely unexplored. Underwater imagery presents unique challenges including severe light attenuation, color distortion, and suspended particle scattering, while requiring specialized knowledge of marine ecosystems and organism taxonomy. To bridge this gap, we introduce UWBench, a comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for underwater vision-language understanding. UWBench comprises 15,003 high-resolution underwater images captured across diverse aquatic environments, encompassing oceans, coral reefs, and deep-sea habitats. Each image is enriched with human-verified annotations including 15,281 object referring expressions that precisely describe marine organisms and underwater structures, and 124,983 question-answer pairs covering diverse reasoning capabilities from object recognition to ecological relationship understanding. The dataset captures rich variations in visibility, lighting conditions, and water turbidity, providing a realistic testbed for model evaluation. Based on UWBench, we establish three comprehensive benchmarks: detailed image captioning for generating ecologically informed scene descriptions, visual grounding for precise localization of marine organisms, and visual question answering for multimodal reasoning about underwater environments. Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art VLMs demonstrate that underwater understanding remains challenging, with substantial room for improvement. Our benchmark provides essential resources for advancing vision-language research in underwater contexts and supporting applications in marine science, ecological monitoring, and autonomous underwater exploration. Our code and benchmark will be available.

  3D human meshes show a natural hierarchical structure (like torso-limbs-fingers). But existing video-based 3D human mesh recovery methods usually learn mesh features in Euclidean space. It's hard to catch this hierarchical structure accurately. So wrong human meshes are reconstructed. To solve this problem, we propose a hyperbolic space learning method leveraging temporal motion prior for recovering 3D human meshes from videos. First, we design a temporal motion prior extraction module. This module extracts the temporal motion features from the input 3D pose sequences and image feature sequences respectively. Then it combines them into the temporal motion prior. In this way, it can strengthen the ability to express features in the temporal motion dimension. Since data representation in non-Euclidean space has been proved to effectively capture hierarchical relationships in real-world datasets (especially in hyperbolic space), we further design a hyperbolic space optimization learning strategy. This strategy uses the temporal motion prior information to assist learning, and uses 3D pose and pose motion information respectively in the hyperbolic space to optimize and learn the mesh features. Then, we combine the optimized results to get an accurate and smooth human mesh. Besides, to make the optimization learning process of human meshes in hyperbolic space stable and effective, we propose a hyperbolic mesh optimization loss. Extensive experimental results on large publicly available datasets indicate superiority in comparison with most state-of-the-art.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Understanding 3D scenes is pivotal for autonomous driving, robotics, and augmented reality. Recent semantic Gaussian Splatting approaches leverage large-scale 2D vision models to project 2D semantic features onto 3D scenes. However, they suffer from two major limitations: (1) insufficient contextual cues for individual masks during preprocessing and (2) inconsistencies and missing details when fusing multi-view features from these 2D models. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{OpenInsGaussian}, an \textbf{Open}-vocabulary \textbf{Ins}tance \textbf{Gaussian} segmentation framework with Context-aware Cross-view Fusion. Our method consists of two modules: Context-Aware Feature Extraction, which augments each mask with rich semantic context, and Attention-Driven Feature Aggregation, which selectively fuses multi-view features to mitigate alignment errors and incompleteness. Through extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, OpenInsGaussian achieves state-of-the-art results in open-vocabulary 3D Gaussian segmentation, outperforming existing baselines by a large margin. These findings underscore the robustness and generality of our proposed approach, marking a significant step forward in 3D scene understanding and its practical deployment across diverse real-world scenarios.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Zero-shot 3D object classification is crucial for real-world applications like autonomous driving, however it is often hindered by a significant domain gap between the synthetic data used for training and the sparse, noisy LiDAR scans encountered in the real-world. Current methods trained solely on synthetic data fail to generalize to outdoor scenes, while those trained only on real data lack the semantic diversity to recognize rare or unseen objects.We introduce BlendCLIP, a multimodal pretraining framework that bridges this synthetic-to-real gap by strategically combining the strengths of both domains. We first propose a pipeline to generate a large-scale dataset of object-level triplets -- consisting of a point cloud, image, and text description -- mined directly from real-world driving data and human annotated 3D boxes. Our core contribution is a curriculum-based data mixing strategy that first grounds the model in the semantically rich synthetic CAD data before progressively adapting it to the specific characteristics of real-world scans.Our experiments show that our approach is highly label-efficient: introducing as few as 1.5\% real-world samples per batch into training boosts zero-shot accuracy on the nuScenes benchmark by 27\%. Consequently, our final model achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging outdoor datasets like nuScenes and TruckScenes, improving over the best prior method by 19.3\% on nuScenes, while maintaining strong generalization on diverse synthetic benchmarks. Our findings demonstrate that effective domain adaptation, not full-scale real-world annotation, is the key to unlocking robust open-vocabulary 3D perception.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present DeepSeek-OCR as an initial investigation into the feasibility of compressing long contexts via optical 2D mapping. DeepSeek-OCR consists of two components: DeepEncoder and DeepSeek3B-MoE-A570M as the decoder. Specifically, DeepEncoder serves as the core engine, designed to maintain low activations under high-resolution input while achieving high compression ratios to ensure an optimal and manageable number of vision tokens. Experiments show that when the number of text tokens is within 10 times that of vision tokens (i.e., a compression ratio < 10x), the model can achieve decoding (OCR) precision of 97%. Even at a compression ratio of 20x, the OCR accuracy still remains at about 60%. This shows considerable promise for research areas such as historical long-context compression and memory forgetting mechanisms in LLMs. Beyond this, DeepSeek-OCR also demonstrates high practical value. On OmniDocBench, it surpasses GOT-OCR2.0 (256 tokens/page) using only 100 vision tokens, and outperforms MinerU2.0 (6000+ tokens per page on average) while utilizing fewer than 800 vision tokens. In production, DeepSeek-OCR can generate training data for LLMs/VLMs at a scale of 200k+ pages per day (a single A100-40G). Codes and model weights are publicly accessible atthis http URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper presents a generation-based debiasing framework for object detection. Prior debiasing methods are often limited by the representation diversity of samples, while naive generative augmentation often preserves the biases it aims to solve. Moreover, our analysis reveals that simply generating more data for rare classes is suboptimal due to two core issues: i) instance frequency is an incomplete proxy for the true data needs of a model, and ii) current layout-to-image synthesis lacks the fidelity and control to generate high-quality, complex scenes. To overcome this, we introduce the representation score (RS) to diagnose representational gaps beyond mere frequency, guiding the creation of new, unbiased layouts. To ensure high-quality synthesis, we replace ambiguous text prompts with a precise visual blueprint and employ a generative alignment strategy, which fosters communication between the detector and generator. Our method significantly narrows the performance gap for underrepresented object groups, \eg, improving large/rare instances by 4.4/3.6 mAP over the baseline, and surpassing prior L2I synthesis models by 15.9 mAP for layout accuracy in generated images.

  Safety evaluation of multimodal foundation models often treats vision and language inputs separately, missing risks from joint interpretation where benign content becomes harmful in combination. Existing approaches also fail to distinguish clearly unsafe content from borderline cases, leading to problematic over-blocking or under-refusal of genuinely harmful content. We present Vision Language Safety Understanding (VLSU), a comprehensive framework to systematically evaluate multimodal safety through fine-grained severity classification and combinatorial analysis across 17 distinct safety patterns. Using a multi-stage pipeline with real-world images and human annotation, we construct a large-scale benchmark of 8,187 samples spanning 15 harm categories. Our evaluation of eleven state-of-the-art models reveals systematic joint understanding failures: while models achieve 90%-plus accuracy on clear unimodal safety signals, performance degrades substantially to 20-55% when joint image-text reasoning is required to determine the safety label. Most critically, 34% of errors in joint image-text safety classification occur despite correct classification of the individual modalities, further demonstrating absent compositional reasoning capabilities. Additionally, we find that models struggle to balance refusing unsafe content while still responding to borderline cases that deserve engagement. For example, we find that instruction framing can reduce the over-blocking rate on borderline content from 62.4% to 10.4% in Gemini-1.5, but only at the cost of under-refusing on unsafe content with refusal rate dropping from 90.8% to 53.9%. Overall, our framework exposes weaknesses in joint image-text understanding and alignment gaps in current models, and provides a critical test bed to enable the next milestones in research on robust vision-language safety.

  Papillary thyroid microcarcinoma (PTMC) is increasingly managed with radio-frequency ablation (RFA), yet accurate lesion segmentation in ultrasound videos remains difficult due to low contrast, probe-induced motion, and heat-related artifacts. The recent Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM-2) generalizes well to static images, but its frame-independent design yields unstable predictions and temporal drift in interventional ultrasound. We introduce \textbf{EMA-SAM}, a lightweight extension of SAM-2 that incorporates a confidence-weighted exponential moving average pointer into the memory bank, providing a stable latent prototype of the tumour across frames. This design preserves temporal coherence through probe pressure and bubble occlusion while rapidly adapting once clear evidence reappears. On our curated PTMC-RFA dataset (124 minutes, 13 patients), EMA-SAM improves \emph{maxDice} from 0.82 (SAM-2) to 0.86 and \emph{maxIoU} from 0.72 to 0.76, while reducing false positives by 29\%. On external benchmarks, including VTUS and colonoscopy video polyp datasets, EMA-SAM achieves consistent gains of 2--5 Dice points over SAM-2. Importantly, the EMA pointer adds \textless0.1\% FLOPs, preserving real-time throughput of $\sim$30\,FPS on a single A100 GPU. These results establish EMA-SAM as a robust and efficient framework for stable tumour tracking, bridging the gap between foundation models and the stringent demands of interventional ultrasound.

  Most current medical vision language models struggle to jointly generate diagnostic text and pixel-level segmentation masks in response to complex visual questions. This represents a major limitation towards clinical application, as assistive systems that fail to provide both modalities simultaneously offer limited value to medical practitioners. To alleviate this limitation, we first introduce RadDiagSeg-D, a dataset combining abnormality detection, diagnosis, and multi-target segmentation into a unified and hierarchical task. RadDiagSeg-D covers multiple imaging modalities and is precisely designed to support the development of models that produce descriptive text and corresponding segmentation masks in tandem. Subsequently, we leverage the dataset to propose a novel vision-language model, RadDiagSeg-M, capable of joint abnormality detection, diagnosis, and flexible segmentation. RadDiagSeg-M provides highly informative and clinically useful outputs, effectively addressing the need to enrich contextual information for assistive diagnosis. Finally, we benchmark RadDiagSeg-M and showcase its strong performance across all components involved in the task of multi-target text-and-mask generation, establishing a robust and competitive baseline.

  Detecting anomalies in crowded scenes is challenging due to severe inter-person occlusions and highly dynamic, context-dependent motion patterns. Existing approaches often struggle to adapt to varying crowd densities and lack interpretable anomaly indicators. To address these limitations, we introduce VelocityNet, a dual-pipeline framework that combines head detection and dense optical flow to extract person-specific velocities. Hierarchical clustering categorizes these velocities into semantic motion classes (halt, slow, normal, and fast), and a percentile-based anomaly scoring system measures deviations from learned normal patterns. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in real-time detection of diverse anomalous motion patterns within densely crowded environments.

  Accurate 3D reconstruction of lunar surfaces is essential for space exploration. However, existing stereo vision reconstruction methods struggle in this context due to the Moon's lack of texture, difficult lighting variations, and atypical orbital trajectories. State-of-the-art deep learning models, trained on human-scale datasets, have rarely been tested on planetary imagery and cannot be transferred directly to lunar conditions. To address this issue, we introduce LunarStereo, the first open dataset of photorealistic stereo image pairs of the Moon, simulated using ray tracing based on high-resolution topography and reflectance models. It covers diverse altitudes, lighting conditions, and viewing angles around the lunar South Pole, offering physically grounded supervision for 3D reconstruction tasks. Based on this dataset, we adapt the MASt3R model to the lunar domain through fine-tuning on LunarStereo. We validate our approach through extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments on both synthetic and real lunar data, evaluating 3D surface reconstruction and relative pose estimation. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real lunar data validate the approach, demonstrating significant improvements over zero-shot baselines and paving the way for robust cross-scale generalization in extraterrestrial environments.

  Generative world models (WMs) can now simulate worlds with striking visual realism, which naturally raises the question of whether they can endow embodied agents with predictive perception for decision making. Progress on this question has been limited by fragmented evaluation: most existing benchmarks adopt open-loop protocols that emphasize visual quality in isolation, leaving the core issue of embodied utility unresolved, i.e., do WMs actually help agents succeed at embodied tasks? To address this gap, we introduce World-in-World, the first open platform that benchmarks WMs in a closed-loop world that mirrors real agent-environment interactions. World-in-World provides a unified online planning strategy and a standardized action API, enabling heterogeneous WMs for decision making. We curate four closed-loop environments that rigorously evaluate diverse WMs, prioritize task success as the primary metric, and move beyond the common focus on visual quality; we also present the first data scaling law for world models in embodied settings. Our study uncovers three surprises: (1) visual quality alone does not guarantee task success, controllability matters more; (2) scaling post-training with action-observation data is more effective than upgrading the pretrained video generators; and (3) allocating more inference-time compute allows WMs to substantially improve closed-loop performance.

  Collaborative driving systems leverage vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication across multiple agents to enhance driving safety and efficiency. Traditional V2X systems take raw sensor data, neural features, or perception results as communication media, which face persistent challenges, including high bandwidth demands, semantic loss, and interoperability issues. Recent advances investigate natural language as a promising medium, which can provide semantic richness, decision-level reasoning, and human-machine interoperability at significantly lower bandwidth. Despite great promise, this paradigm shift also introduces new vulnerabilities within language communication, including message loss, hallucinations, semantic manipulation, and adversarial attacks. In this work, we present the first systematic study of full-stack safety and security issues in natural-language-based collaborative driving. Specifically, we develop a comprehensive taxonomy of attack strategies, including connection disruption, relay/replay interference, content spoofing, and multi-connection forgery. To mitigate these risks, we introduce an agentic defense pipeline, which we call SafeCoop, that integrates a semantic firewall, language-perception consistency checks, and multi-source consensus, enabled by an agentic transformation function for cross-frame spatial alignment. We systematically evaluate SafeCoop in closed-loop CARLA simulation across 32 critical scenarios, achieving 69.15% driving score improvement under malicious attacks and up to 67.32% F1 score for malicious detection. This study provides guidance for advancing research on safe, secure, and trustworthy language-driven collaboration in transportation systems. Our project page isthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As the field continues its push for ever more resources, this work turns the spotlight on a critical question: how can vision-language models (VLMs) be adapted to thrive in low-resource, budget-constrained settings? While large VLMs offer strong performance, they are impractical to deploy in such settings. Small VLMs, on the other hand, are efficient but typically require costly fine-tuning to close the performance gap with larger models in the deployment domain. Inspired by the in-context learning framework, we propose an online In-Context Distillation (ICD) method, in which a small VLM collaborates with a stronger teacher model at inference time, distilling its knowledge via sparse demonstrations to efficiently bridge the gap between them. Our method is built on an in-depth analysis that identifies the scale and the choice of models for which vision-language ICL is currently feasible, and demonstrates the advantage of ICL over fine-tuning under constrained compute budgets. We enhance our method with a novel cross-modal demonstration selection strategy, teacher test-time scaling to reduce noise, and student uncertainty conditioning to dynamically populate a demonstration pool and minimize teacher queries. Our ICD method significantly boosts the performance of small models (up to 33%) using scarce teacher annotations (as low as 4%), and competes with the teacher's zero-shot performance.

  The problem of 3D reconstruction from posed images is undergoing a fundamental transformation, driven by continuous advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). By modeling scenes explicitly as collections of 3D Gaussians, 3DGS enables efficient rasterization through volumetric splatting, offering thus a seamless integration with common graphics pipelines. Despite its real-time rendering capabilities for novel view synthesis, 3DGS suffers from a high memory footprint, the tendency to bake lighting effects directly into its representation, and limited support for secondary-ray effects. This tutorial provides a concise yet comprehensive overview of the 3DGS pipeline, starting from its splatting formulation and then exploring the main efforts in addressing its limitations. Finally, we survey a range of applications that leverage 3DGS for surface reconstruction, avatar modeling, animation, and content generation-highlighting its efficient rendering and suitability for feed-forward pipelines.

  Vision Transformers (ViTs) partition input images into uniformly sized patches regardless of their content, resulting in long input sequence lengths for high-resolution images. We present Adaptive Patch Transformers (APT), which addresses this by using multiple different patch sizes within the same image. APT reduces the total number of input tokens by allocating larger patch sizes in more homogeneous areas and smaller patches in more complex ones. APT achieves a drastic speedup in ViT inference and training, increasing throughput by 40% on ViT-L and 50% on ViT-H while maintaining downstream performance, and can be applied to a previously fine-tuned ViT, converging in as little as 1 epoch. It also significantly reduces training and inference time without loss of performance in high-resolution dense visual tasks, achieving up to 30\% faster training and inference in visual QA, object detection, and semantic segmentation.

While techniques like optical microscopy, Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), and Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) provide a sound basis for detection, applying these approaches requires usually manual analysis and prevents efficient use in large screening studies. To this end, machine learning (ML) has emerged as a powerful tool in advancing microplastic detection. In this exploratory study, we investigate potential, limitations and future directions of advancing the detection and quantification of MP particles and fibres using a combination of SEM imaging and machine learning-based object detection. For simplicity, we focus on a filtration scenario where image backgrounds exhibit a symmetric and repetitive pattern. Our findings indicate differences in the quality of YOLO models for the given task and the relevance of optimizing preprocessing. At the same time, we identify open challenges, such as limited amounts of expert-labeled data necessary for reliable training of ML models.

  Personalized image generative models are highly proficient at synthesizing images from text or a single image, yet they lack explicit control for composing objects from specific parts of multiple source images without user specified masks or annotations. To address this, we introduce Chimera, a personalized image generation model that generates novel objects by combining specified parts from different source images according to textual instructions. To train our model, we first construct a dataset from a taxonomy built on 464 unique (part, subject) pairs, which we term semantic atoms. From this, we generate 37k prompts and synthesize the corresponding images with a high-fidelity text-to-image model. We train a custom diffusion prior model with part-conditional guidance, which steers the image-conditioning features to enforce both semantic identity and spatial layout. We also introduce an objective metric PartEval to assess the fidelity and compositional accuracy of generation pipelines. Human evaluations and our proposed metric show that Chimera outperforms other baselines by 14% in part alignment and compositional accuracy and 21% in visual quality.

  We introduce HouseTour, a method for spatially-aware 3D camera trajectory and natural language summary generation from a collection of images depicting an existing 3D space. Unlike existing vision-language models (VLMs), which struggle with geometric reasoning, our approach generates smooth video trajectories via a diffusion process constrained by known camera poses and integrates this information into the VLM for 3D-grounded descriptions. We synthesize the final video using 3D Gaussian splatting to render novel views along the trajectory. To support this task, we present the HouseTour dataset, which includes over 1,200 house-tour videos with camera poses, 3D reconstructions, and real estate descriptions. Experiments demonstrate that incorporating 3D camera trajectories into the text generation process improves performance over methods handling each task independently. We evaluate both individual and end-to-end performance, introducing a new joint metric. Our work enables automated, professional-quality video creation for real estate and touristic applications without requiring specialized expertise or equipment.

  Autonomous driving systems remain critically vulnerable to the long-tail of rare, out-of-distribution scenarios with semantic anomalies. While Vision Language Models (VLMs) offer promising reasoning capabilities, naive prompting approaches yield unreliable performance and depend on expensive proprietary models, limiting practical deployment. We introduce SAVANT (Semantic Analysis with Vision-Augmented Anomaly deTection), a structured reasoning framework that achieves high accuracy and recall in detecting anomalous driving scenarios from input images through layered scene analysis and a two-phase pipeline: structured scene description extraction followed by multi-modal evaluation. Our approach transforms VLM reasoning from ad-hoc prompting to systematic analysis across four semantic layers: Street, Infrastructure, Movable Objects, and Environment. SAVANT achieves 89.6% recall and 88.0% accuracy on real-world driving scenarios, significantly outperforming unstructured baselines. More importantly, we demonstrate that our structured framework enables a fine-tuned 7B parameter open-source model (Qwen2.5VL) to achieve 90.8% recall and 93.8% accuracy - surpassing all models evaluated while enabling local deployment at near-zero cost. By automatically labeling over 9,640 real-world images with high accuracy, SAVANT addresses the critical data scarcity problem in anomaly detection and provides a practical path toward reliable, accessible semantic monitoring for autonomous systems.

  Engagement detection in online learning environments is vital for improving student outcomes and personalizing instruction. We present ViBED-Net (Video-Based Engagement Detection Network), a novel deep learning framework designed to assess student engagement from video data using a dual-stream architecture. ViBED-Net captures both facial expressions and full-scene context by processing facial crops and entire video frames through EfficientNetV2 for spatial feature extraction. These features are then analyzed over time using two temporal modeling strategies: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and Transformer encoders. Our model is evaluated on the DAiSEE dataset, a large-scale benchmark for affective state recognition in e-learning. To enhance performance on underrepresented engagement classes, we apply targeted data augmentation techniques. Among the tested variants, ViBED-Net with LSTM achieves 73.43\% accuracy, outperforming existing state-of-the-art approaches. ViBED-Net demonstrates that combining face-aware and scene-aware spatiotemporal cues significantly improves engagement detection accuracy. Its modular design allows flexibility for application across education, user experience research, and content personalization. This work advances video-based affective computing by offering a scalable, high-performing solution for real-world engagement analysis. The source code for this project is available onthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Deep-learning-based segmentation algorithms have substantially advanced the field of medical image analysis, particularly in structural delineations in MRIs. However, an important consideration is the intrinsic bias in the data. Concerns about unfairness, such as performance disparities based on sensitive attributes like race and sex, are increasingly urgent. In this work, we evaluate the results of three different segmentation models (UNesT, nnU-Net, and CoTr) and a traditional atlas-based method (ANTs), applied to segment the left and right nucleus accumbens (NAc) in MRI images. We utilize a dataset including four demographic subgroups: black female, black male, white female, and white male. We employ manually labeled gold-standard segmentations to train and test segmentation models. This study consists of two parts: the first assesses the segmentation performance of models, while the second measures the volumes they produce to evaluate the effects of race, sex, and their interaction. Fairness is quantitatively measured using a metric designed to quantify fairness in segmentation performance. Additionally, linear mixed models analyze the impact of demographic variables on segmentation accuracy and derived volumes. Training on the same race as the test subjects leads to significantly better segmentation accuracy for some models. ANTs and UNesT show notable improvements in segmentation accuracy when trained and tested on race-matched data, unlike nnU-Net, which demonstrates robust performance independent of demographic matching. Finally, we examine sex and race effects on the volume of the NAc using segmentations from the manual rater and from our biased models. Results reveal that the sex effects observed with manual segmentation can also be observed with biased models, whereas the race effects disappear in all but one model.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  3D weakly supervised semantic segmentation (3D WSSS) aims to achieve semantic segmentation by leveraging sparse or low-cost annotated data, significantly reducing reliance on dense point-wise annotations. Previous works mainly employ class activation maps or pre-trained vision-language models to address this challenge. However, the low quality of pseudo-labels and the insufficient exploitation of 3D geometric priors jointly create significant technical bottlenecks in developing high-performance 3D WSSS models. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective 3D weakly supervised semantic segmentation method that integrates 3D geometric priors into a class-aware guidance mechanism to generate high-fidelity pseudo labels. Concretely, our designed methodology first employs Class-Aware Label Refinement module to generate more balanced and accurate pseudo labels for semantic categrories. This initial refinement stage focuses on enhancing label quality through category-specific optimization. Subsequently, the Geometry-Aware Label Refinement component is developed, which strategically integrates implicit 3D geometric constraints to effectively filter out low-confidence pseudo labels that fail to comply with geometric plausibility. Moreover, to address the challenge of extensive unlabeled regions, we propose a Label Update strategy that integrates Self-Training to propagate labels into these areas. This iterative process continuously enhances pseudo-label quality while expanding label coverage, ultimately fostering the development of high-performance 3D WSSS models. Comprehensive experimental validation reveals that our proposed methodology achieves state-of-the-art performance on both ScanNet and S3DIS benchmarks while demonstrating remarkable generalization capability in unsupervised settings, maintaining competitive accuracy through its robust design.

  Gender classification systems often inherit and amplify demographic imbalances in their training data. We first audit five widely used gender classification datasets, revealing that all suffer from significant intersectional underrepresentation. To measure the downstream impact of these flaws, we train identical MobileNetV2 classifiers on the two most balanced of these datasets, UTKFace and FairFace. Our fairness evaluation shows that even these models exhibit significant bias, misclassifying female faces at a higher rate than male faces and amplifying existing racial skew. To counter these data-induced biases, we construct BalancedFace, a new public dataset created by blending images from FairFace and UTKFace, supplemented with images from other collections to fill missing demographic gaps. It is engineered to equalize subgroup shares across 189 intersections of age, race, and gender using only real, unedited images. When a standard classifier is trained on BalancedFace, it reduces the maximum True Positive Rate gap across racial subgroups by over 50% and brings the average Disparate Impact score 63% closer to the ideal of 1.0 compared to the next-best dataset, all with a minimal loss of overall accuracy. These results underline the profound value of data-centric interventions and provide an openly available resource for fair gender classification research.

  The field of Optical Music Recognition (OMR) is currently hindered by the scarcity of real annotated data, particularly when dealing with handwritten historical musical scores. In similar fields, such as Handwritten Text Recognition, it was proven that synthetic examples produced with image generation techniques could help to train better-performing recognition architectures. This study explores the generation of realistic, handwritten-looking scores by implementing a music symbol-level Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) and assembling its output into a full score using the Smashcima engraving software. We have systematically evaluated the visual fidelity of these generated samples, concluding that the generated symbols exhibit a high degree of realism, marking significant progress in synthetic score generation.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this work, we introduce MUSE (Model-based Uncertainty-aware Similarity Estimation), a training-free framework designed for model-based zero-shot 2D object detection and segmentation. MUSE leverages 2D multi-view templates rendered from 3D unseen objects and 2D object proposals extracted from input query images. In the embedding stage, it integrates class and patch embeddings, where the patch embeddings are normalized using generalized mean pooling (GeM) to capture both global and local representations efficiently. During the matching stage, MUSE employs a joint similarity metric that combines absolute and relative similarity scores, enhancing the robustness of matching under challenging scenarios. Finally, the similarity score is refined through an uncertainty-aware object prior that adjusts for proposal reliability. Without any additional training or fine-tuning, MUSE achieves state-of-the-art performance on the BOP Challenge 2025, ranking first across the Classic Core, H3, and Industrial tracks. These results demonstrate that MUSE offers a powerful and generalizable framework for zero-shot 2D object detection and segmentation.

  We introduce InsideOut, an extension of 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) that bridges the gap between high-fidelity RGB surface details and subsurface X-ray structures. The fusion of RGB and X-ray imaging is invaluable in fields such as medical diagnostics, cultural heritage restoration, and manufacturing. We collect new paired RGB and X-ray data, perform hierarchical fitting to align RGB and X-ray radiative Gaussian splats, and propose an X-ray reference loss to ensure consistent internal structures. InsideOut effectively addresses the challenges posed by disparate data representations between the two modalities and limited paired datasets. This approach significantly extends the applicability of 3DGS, enhancing visualization, simulation, and non-destructive testing capabilities across various domains.

  Traditional human activity recognition uses either direct image analysis or data from wearable inertial measurement units (IMUs), but can be ineffective in challenging underwater environments. We introduce a novel hybrid approach that bridges this gap to monitor scuba diver safety. Our method leverages computer vision to generate high-fidelity motion data, effectively creating a ``pseudo-IMU'' from a stream of 3D human joint keypoints. This technique circumvents the critical problem of wireless signal attenuation in water, which plagues conventional diver-worn sensors communicating with an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV). We apply this system to the vital task of identifying anomalous scuba diver behavior that signals the onset of a medical emergency such as cardiac arrest -- a leading cause of scuba diving fatalities. By integrating our classifier onboard an AUV and conducting experiments with simulated distress scenarios, we demonstrate the utility and effectiveness of our method for advancing robotic monitoring and diver safety.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present an ultra-efficient post-training method for shortcutting large-scale pre-trained flow matching diffusion models into efficient few-step samplers, enabled by novel velocity field self-distillation. While shortcutting in flow matching, originally introduced by shortcut models, offers flexible trajectory-skipping capabilities, it requires a specialized step-size embedding incompatible with existing models unless retraining from scratch$\unicode{x2013}$a process nearly as costly as pretraining itself.Our key contribution is thus imparting a more aggressive shortcut mechanism to standard flow matching models (e.g., Flux), leveraging a unique distillation principle that obviates the need for step-size embedding. Working on the velocity field rather than sample space and learning rapidly from self-guided distillation in an online manner, our approach trains efficiently, e.g., producing a 3-step Flux less than one A100 day. Beyond distillation, our method can be incorporated into the pretraining stage itself, yielding models that inherently learn efficient, few-step flows without compromising quality. This capability also enables, to our knowledge, the first few-shot distillation method (e.g., 10 text-image pairs) for dozen-billion-parameter diffusion models, delivering state-of-the-art performance at almost free cost.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Backchannels are subtle listener responses, such as nods, smiles, or short verbal cues like "yes" or "uh-huh," which convey understanding and agreement in conversations. These signals provide feedback to speakers, improve the smoothness of interaction, and play a crucial role in developing human-like, responsive AI systems. However, the expression of backchannel behaviors is often significantly influenced by individual differences, operating across multiple scales: from instant dynamics such as response intensity (frame-level) to temporal patterns such as frequency and rhythm preferences (sequence-level). This presents a complex pattern recognition problem that contemporary emotion recognition methods have yet to fully address. Particularly, existing individualized methods in emotion recognition often operate at a single scale, overlooking the complementary nature of multi-scale behavioral cues. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Cascaded Multi-Scale Individual Standardization Network (CMIS-Net) that extracts individual-normalized backchannel features by removing person-specific neutral baselines from observed expressions. Operating at both frame and sequence levels, this normalization allows model to focus on relative changes from each person's baseline rather than absolute expression values. Furthermore, we introduce an implicit data augmentation module to address the observed training data distributional bias, improving model generalization. Comprehensive experiments and visualizations demonstrate that CMIS-Net effectively handles individual differences and data imbalance, achieving state-of-the-art performance in backchannel agreement detection.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Glioblastoma (GBM) is an aggressive primary brain tumor with a median survival of approximately 15 months. In clinical practice, the Stupp protocol serves as the standard first-line treatment. However, patients exhibit highly heterogeneous therapeutic responses which required at least two months before first visual impact can be observed, typically with MRI. Early prediction treatment response is crucial for advancing personalized medicine. Disease Progression Modeling (DPM) aims to capture the trajectory of disease evolution, while Treatment Response Prediction (TRP) focuses on assessing the impact of therapeutic interventions. Whereas most TRP approaches primarly rely on timeseries data, we consider the problem of early visual TRP as a slice-to-slice translation model generating post-treatment MRI from a pre-treatment MRI, thus reflecting the tumor evolution. To address this problem we propose a Latent Diffusion Model with a concatenation-based conditioning from the pre-treatment MRI and the tumor localization, and a classifier-free guidance to enhance generation quality using survival information, in particular post-treatment tumor evolution. Our model were trained and tested on a local dataset consisting of 140 GBM patients collected at Centre Fran√ßois Baclesse. For each patient we collected pre and post T1-Gd MRI, tumor localization manually delineated in the pre-treatment MRI by medical experts, and survival information.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) rely heavily on instruction tuning to align vision and language capabilities, yet the computational cost of training on large-scale datasets remains a major bottleneck. Existing data selection methods aim to mitigate this by selecting important and diverse subsets, but they often suffer from two critical drawbacks: high computational overhead from processing the entire dataset and suboptimal data selection due to separate treatment of importance and diversity.We introduce CoIDO, a novel dual-objective framework that jointly optimizes data importance and diversity to overcome these challenges. Unlike existing approaches that require costly evaluations across the whole dataset, CoIDO employs a lightweight plug-in scorer. This scorer is trained on just a small random sample of data to learn the distribution of the candidate set, drastically reducing computational demands. By leveraging a homoscedastic uncertainty-based formulation, CoIDO effectively balances importance and diversity during training, enabling efficient and scalable data selection.In our experiments, we trained the CoIDO scorer using only 20 percent of randomly sampled data. Once trained, CoIDO was applied to the entire dataset to select a 20 percent subset for instruction tuning. On the widely used LLaVA-1.5-7B model across ten downstream tasks, this selected subset achieved an impressive 98.2 percent of the performance of full-data fine-tuning, on average.

  Multi-label image classification demands adaptive training strategies to navigate complex, evolving visual-semantic landscapes, yet conventional methods rely on static configurations that falter in dynamic settings. We propose MAT-Agent, a novel multi-agent framework that reimagines training as a collaborative, real-time optimization process. By deploying autonomous agents to dynamically tune data augmentation, optimizers, learning rates, and loss functions, MAT-Agent leverages non-stationary multi-armed bandit algorithms to balance exploration and exploitation, guided by a composite reward harmonizing accuracy, rare-class performance, and training stability. Enhanced with dual-rate exponential moving average smoothing and mixed-precision training, it ensures robustness and efficiency. Extensive experiments across Pascal VOC, COCO, and VG-256 demonstrate MAT-Agent's superiority: it achieves an mAP of 97.4 (vs. 96.2 for PAT-T), OF1 of 92.3, and CF1 of 91.4 on Pascal VOC; an mAP of 92.8 (vs. 92.0 for HSQ-CvN), OF1 of 88.2, and CF1 of 87.1 on COCO; and an mAP of 60.9, OF1 of 70.8, and CF1 of 61.1 on VG-256. With accelerated convergence and robust cross-domain generalization, MAT-Agent offers a scalable, intelligent solution for optimizing complex visual models, paving the way for adaptive deep learning advancements.

  Large language models (LLMs) increasingly rely on long-context modeling for tasks such as document understanding, code analysis, and multi-step reasoning. However, scaling context windows to the million-token level brings prohibitive computational and memory costs, limiting the practicality of long-context LLMs. In this work, we take a different perspective-visual context scaling-to tackle this challenge. Instead of extending token-based sequences, we propose Glyph, a framework that renders long texts into images and processes them with vision-language models (VLMs). This approach substantially compresses textual input while preserving semantic information, and we further design an LLM-driven genetic search to identify optimal visual rendering configurations for balancing accuracy and compression. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our method achieves 3-4x token compression while maintaining accuracy comparable to leading LLMs such as Qwen3-8B on various long-context benchmarks. This compression also leads to around 4x faster prefilling and decoding, and approximately 2x faster SFT training. Furthermore, under extreme compression, a 128K-context VLM could scale to handle 1M-token-level text tasks. In addition, the rendered text data benefits real-world multimodal tasks, such as document understanding. Our code and model are released atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Image editing has achieved remarkable progress recently. Modern editing models could already follow complex instructions to manipulate the original content. However, beyond completing the editing instructions, the accompanying physical effects are the key to the generation realism. For example, removing an object should also remove its shadow, reflections, and interactions with nearby objects. Unfortunately, existing models and benchmarks mainly focus on instruction completion but overlook these physical effects. So, at this moment, how far are we from physically realistic image editing? To answer this, we introduce PICABench, which systematically evaluates physical realism across eight sub-dimension (spanning optics, mechanics, and state transitions) for most of the common editing operations (add, remove, attribute change, etc.). We further propose the PICAEval, a reliable evaluation protocol that uses VLM-as-a-judge with per-case, region-level human annotations and questions. Beyond benchmarking, we also explore effective solutions by learning physics from videos and construct a training dataset PICA-100K. After evaluating most of the mainstream models, we observe that physical realism remains a challenging problem with large rooms to explore. We hope that our benchmark and proposed solutions can serve as a foundation for future work moving from naive content editing toward physically consistent realism.

  AI systems must adapt to evolving visual environments, especially in domains where object appearances change over time. We introduce Car Models in Time (CaMiT), a fine-grained dataset capturing the temporal evolution of car models, a representative class of technological artifacts. CaMiT includes 787K labeled samples of 190 car models (2007-2023) and 5.1M unlabeled samples (2005-2023), supporting both supervised and self-supervised learning. Static pretraining on in-domain data achieves competitive performance with large-scale generalist models while being more resource-efficient, yet accuracy declines when models are tested across years. To address this, we propose a time-incremental classification setting, a realistic continual learning scenario with emerging, evolving, and disappearing classes. We evaluate two strategies: time-incremental pretraining, which updates the backbone, and time-incremental classifier learning, which updates only the final layer, both improving temporal robustness. Finally, we explore time-aware image generation that leverages temporal metadata during training, yielding more realistic outputs. CaMiT offers a rich benchmark for studying temporal adaptation in fine-grained visual recognition and generation.

Traditional detectors (SIFT, SURF, ORB, BRISK, etc.) and learning based methods (SuperPoint, R2D2, LF-Net, D2-Net, etc.) have shown strong performance yet suffer from key limitations: sensitivity to photometric changes, low keypoint density and repeatability, limited adaptability to challenging scenes, and lack of semantic understanding, often failing to prioritize visually important regions. We present DeepDetect, an intelligent, all-in-one, dense keypoint detector that unifies the strengths of classical detectors using deep learning. Firstly, we create ground-truth masks by fusing outputs of 7 keypoint and 2 edge detectors, extracting diverse visual cues from corners and blobs to prominent edges and textures in the images. Afterwards, a lightweight and efficient model: ESPNet, is trained using these masks as labels, enabling DeepDetect to focus semantically on images while producing highly dense keypoints, that are adaptable to diverse and visually degraded conditions. Evaluations on the Oxford Affine Covariant Regions dataset demonstrate that DeepDetect surpasses other detectors in keypoint density, repeatability, and the number of correct matches, achieving maximum values of 0.5143 (average keypoint density), 0.9582 (average repeatability), and 59,003 (correct matches).

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Parkinson's disease (PD) severity diagnosis is crucial for early detecting potential patients and adopting tailored interventions. Diagnosing PD based on facial expression is grounded in PD patients' "masked face" symptom and gains growing interest recently for its convenience and affordability. However, current facial expression-based approaches often rely on single type of expression which can lead to misdiagnosis, and ignore the class imbalance across different PD stages which degrades the prediction performance. Moreover, most existing methods focus on binary classification (i.e., PD / non-PD) rather than diagnosing the severity of PD. To address these issues, we propose a new facial expression-based method for PD severity diagnosis which integrates multiple facial expression features through attention-based feature fusion. Moreover, we mitigate the class imbalance problem via an adaptive class balancing strategy which dynamically adjusts the contribution of training samples based on their class distribution and classification difficulty. Experimental results demonstrate the promising performance of the proposed method for PD severity diagnosis, as well as the efficacy of attention-based feature fusion and adaptive class balancing.

  Instruction-based image editing has achieved remarkable progress; however, models solely trained via supervised fine-tuning often overfit to annotated patterns, hindering their ability to explore and generalize beyond training distributions. To this end, we introduce Edit-R1, a novel post-training framework for instruction-based image editing based on policy optimization. Specifically, we utilize Diffusion Negative-aware Finetuning (DiffusionNFT), a likelihood-free policy optimization method consistent with the flow matching forward process, thereby enabling the use of higher-order samplers and more efficient training. Another key challenge here is the absence of a universal reward model, resulting from the diverse nature of editing instructions and tasks. To bridge this gap, we employ a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) as a unified, training-free reward model, leveraging its output logits to provide fine-grained feedback. Furthermore, we carefully design a low-variance group filtering mechanism to reduce MLLM scoring noise and stabilize optimization. UniWorld-V2, trained with this framework, achieves \textbf{state-of-the-art} results on the ImgEdit and GEdit-Bench benchmarks, scoring 4.49 and 7.83, respectively. Crucially, our framework is model-agnostic, delivering substantial performance gains when applied to diverse base models like Qwen-Image-Edit and FLUX-Kontext, demonstrating its wide applicability.

  Existing research on 3D Large Language Models (LLMs) still struggles to achieve grounded question-answering, primarily due to the under-exploration of the mech- anism of human-like scene-object grounded reasoning. This paper bridges the gap by presenting a novel framework. We first introduce a grounded Chain-of- Thought reasoning method in 3D scenes (SCENECOT), decoupling a complex reasoning task into simpler and manageable problems, and building corresponding visual clues based on multimodal expert modules. To enable such a method, we develop SCENECOT-185K, the first large-scale grounded CoT reasoning dataset, consisting of 185K high-quality instances. Extensive experiments across various complex 3D scene reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our new framework achieves strong performance with high grounding-QA coherence. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first successful application of CoT reasoning to 3D scene understanding, enabling step-by-step human-like reasoning and showing potential for extension to broader 3D scene understanding scenarios.

  Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) are increasingly applied to scientific research, yet it remains unclear whether they can reliably understand and reason over the multimodal complexity of papers. A central challenge lies in detecting and resolving inconsistencies across text, figures, tables, and equations, issues that are often subtle, domain-specific, and ultimately undermine clarity, reproducibility, and trust. Existing benchmarks overlook this issue, either isolating single modalities or relying on synthetic errors that fail to capture real-world complexity. We introduce PRISMM-Bench (Peer-Review-sourced Inconsistency Set for Multimodal Models), the first benchmark grounded in real reviewer-flagged inconsistencies in scientific papers. Through a multi-stage pipeline of review mining, LLM-assisted filtering and human verification, we curate 262 inconsistencies from 242 papers. Based on this set, we design three tasks, namely inconsistency identification, remedy and pair matching, which assess a model's capacity to detect, correct, and reason over inconsistencies across different modalities. Furthermore, to address the notorious problem of choice-only shortcuts in multiple-choice evaluation, where models exploit answer patterns without truly understanding the question, we further introduce structured JSON-based answer representations that minimize linguistic biases by reducing reliance on superficial stylistic cues. We benchmark 21 leading LMMs, including large open-weight models (GLM-4.5V 106B, InternVL3 78B) and proprietary models (Gemini 2.5 Pro, GPT-5 with high reasoning). Results reveal strikingly low performance (26.1-54.2%), underscoring the challenge of multimodal scientific reasoning and motivating progress towards trustworthy scientific assistants.

  The sparse cross-modality detector offers more advantages than its counterpart, the Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) detector, particularly in terms of adaptability for downstream tasks and computational cost savings. However, existing sparse detectors overlook the quality of token representation, leaving it with a sub-optimal foreground quality and limited performance. In this paper, we identify that the geometric structure preserved and the class distribution are the key to improving the performance of the sparse detector, and propose a Sparse Selector (SS). The core module of SS is Ray-Aware Supervision (RAS), which preserves rich geometric information during the training stage, and Class-Balanced Supervision, which adaptively reweights the salience of class semantics, ensuring that tokens associated with small objects are retained during token sampling. Thereby, outperforming other sparse multi-modal detectors in the representation of tokens. Additionally, we design Ray Positional Encoding (Ray PE) to address the distribution differences between the LiDAR modality and the image. Finally, we integrate the aforementioned module into an end-to-end sparse multi-modality detector, dubbed CrossRay3D. Experiments show that, on the challenging nuScenes benchmark, CrossRay3D achieves state-of-the-art performance with 72.4 mAP and 74.7 NDS, while running 1.84 faster than other leading methods. Moreover, CrossRay3D demonstrates strong robustness even in scenarios where LiDAR or camera data are partially or entirely missing.

  Recent progress in diffusion-based visual generation has largely relied on latent diffusion models with variational autoencoders (VAEs). While effective for high-fidelity synthesis, this VAE+diffusion paradigm suffers from limited training efficiency, slow inference, and poor transferability to broader vision tasks. These issues stem from a key limitation of VAE latent spaces: the lack of clear semantic separation and strong discriminative structure. Our analysis confirms that these properties are crucial not only for perception and understanding tasks, but also for the stable and efficient training of latent diffusion models. Motivated by this insight, we introduce SVG, a novel latent diffusion model without variational autoencoders, which leverages self-supervised representations for visual generation. SVG constructs a feature space with clear semantic discriminability by leveraging frozen DINO features, while a lightweight residual branch captures fine-grained details for high-fidelity reconstruction. Diffusion models are trained directly on this semantically structured latent space to facilitate more efficient learning. As a result, SVG enables accelerated diffusion training, supports few-step sampling, and improves generative quality. Experimental results further show that SVG preserves the semantic and discriminative capabilities of the underlying self-supervised representations, providing a principled pathway toward task-general, high-quality visual representations.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification relies on Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) with spatial patch features, yet existing methods struggle to capture global dependencies due to the immense size of WSIs and the local nature of patch embeddings. This limitation hinders the modeling of coarse structures essential for robust diagnostic prediction. We propose Fourier Transform Multiple Instance Learning (FFT-MIL), a framework that augments MIL with a frequency-domain branch to provide compact global context. Low-frequency crops are extracted from WSIs via the Fast Fourier Transform and processed through a modular FFT-Block composed of convolutional layers and Min-Max normalization to mitigate the high variance of frequency data. The learned global frequency feature is fused with spatial patch features through lightweight integration strategies, enabling compatibility with diverse MIL architectures. FFT-MIL was evaluated across six state-of-the-art MIL methods on three public datasets (BRACS, LUAD, and IMP). Integration of the FFT-Block improved macro F1 scores by an average of 3.51% and AUC by 1.51%, demonstrating consistent gains across architectures and datasets. These results establish frequency-domain learning as an effective and efficient mechanism for capturing global dependencies in WSI classification, complementing spatial features and advancing the scalability and accuracy of MIL-based computational pathology.

  Aligning features from different modalities, is one of the most fundamental challenges for cross-modal tasks. Although pre-trained vision-language models can achieve a general alignment between image and text, they often require parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) for further adjustment. Today's PEFT methods (e.g., prompt tuning, LoRA-based, or adapter-based) always selectively fine-tune a subset of parameters, which can slightly adjust either visual or textual features, and avoid overfitting. In this paper, we are the first to highlight that all existing PEFT methods perform one-step adjustment. It is insufficient for complex (or difficult) datasets, where features of different modalities are highly entangled. To this end, we propose the first model-agnostic multi-step adjustment approach by learning a cross-modal velocity field: Flow Matching Alignment (FMA). Specifically, to ensure the correspondence between categories during training, we first utilize a fixed coupling strategy. Then, we propose a noise augmentation strategy to alleviate the data scarcity issue. Finally, we design an early-stopping solver, which terminates the transformation process earlier, improving both efficiency and accuracy. Compared with one-step PEFT methods, FMA has the multi-step rectification ability to achieve more precise and robust alignment. Extensive results have demonstrated that FMA can consistently yield significant performance gains across various benchmarks and backbones, particularly on challenging datasets.

  Recent advances in image-to-video (I2V) generation have achieved remarkable progress in synthesizing high-quality, temporally coherent videos from static images. Among all the applications of I2V, human-centric video generation includes a large portion. However, existing I2V models encounter difficulties in maintaining identity consistency between the input human image and the generated video, especially when the person in the video exhibits significant expression changes and movements. This issue becomes critical when the human face occupies merely a small fraction of the image. Since humans are highly sensitive to identity variations, this poses a critical yet under-explored challenge in I2V generation. In this paper, we propose Identity-Preserving Reward-guided Optimization (IPRO), a novel video diffusion framework based on reinforcement learning to enhance identity preservation. Instead of introducing auxiliary modules or altering model architectures, our approach introduces a direct and effective tuning algorithm that optimizes diffusion models using a face identity scorer. To improve performance and accelerate convergence, our method backpropagates the reward signal through the last steps of the sampling chain, enabling richer gradient feedback. We also propose a novel facial scoring mechanism that treats faces in ground-truth videos as facial feature pools, providing multi-angle facial information to enhance generalization. A KL-divergence regularization is further incorporated to stabilize training and prevent overfitting to the reward signal. Extensive experiments on Wan 2.2 I2V model and our in-house I2V model demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Our project and code are available atthis https URL.

  Fully open multimodal large language models (MLLMs) currently lag behind proprietary counterparts, primarily due to a significant gap in data quality for supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Existing open-source datasets are often plagued by widespread noise and a critical deficit in complex reasoning data, such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT), which hinders the development of advanced model capabilities. Addressing these challenges, our work makes three primary contributions. First, we introduce Honey-Data-15M, a new SFT dataset comprising approximately 15 million QA pairs, processed through multiple cleaning techniques and enhanced with a novel dual-level (short and long) CoT enrichment strategy. Second, we introduce HoneyPipe, the data curation pipeline, and its underlying framework DataStudio, providing the community with a transparent and adaptable methodology for data curation that moves beyond static dataset releases. Finally, to validate our dataset and pipeline, we train Bee-8B, an 8B model on Honey-Data-15M. Experiments show that Bee-8B establishes a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) for fully open MLLMs, achieving performance that is competitive with, and in some cases surpasses, recent semi-open models such as InternVL3.5-8B. Our work delivers to the community a suite of foundational resources, including: the Honey-Data-15M corpus; the full-stack suite comprising HoneyPipe and DataStudio; training recipes; an evaluation harness; and the model weights. This effort demonstrates that a principled focus on data quality is a key pathway to developing fully open MLLMs that are highly competitive with their semi-open counterparts.

  Vision language models (VLMs) are increasingly deployed as controllers with access to external tools for complex reasoning and decision-making, yet their effectiveness remains limited by the scarcity of high-quality multimodal trajectories and the cost of manual annotation. We address this challenge with a vision-centric agent tuning framework that automatically synthesizes multimodal trajectories, generates step-wise preference pairs, and trains a VLM controller for robust tool-use reasoning. Our pipeline first constructs M-TRACE, a large-scale dataset of 28.5K multimodal tasks with 177K verified trajectories, enabling imitation-based trajectory tuning. Building on this, we develop MATRIX Agent, a controller finetuned on M-TRACE for step-wise tool reasoning. To achieve finer alignment, we further introduce Pref-X, a set of 11K automatically generated preference pairs, and optimize MATRIX on it via step-wise preference learning. Across three benchmarks, Agent-X, GTA, and GAIA, MATRIX consistently surpasses both open- and closed-source VLMs, demonstrating scalable and effective multimodal tool use.

  The recent rapid advancement of Text-to-Video (T2V) generation technologies, which are critical to build ``world models'', makes the existing benchmarks increasingly insufficient to evaluate state-of-the-art T2V models. First, current evaluation dimensions, such as per-frame aesthetic quality and temporal consistency, are no longer able to differentiate state-of-the-art T2V models. Second, event-level temporal causality, which not only distinguishes video from other modalities but also constitutes a crucial component of world models, is severely underexplored in existing benchmarks. Third, existing benchmarks lack a systematic assessment of world knowledge, which are essential capabilities for building world models. To address these issues, we introduce VideoVerse, a comprehensive benchmark that focuses on evaluating whether a T2V model could understand complex temporal causality and world knowledge in the real world. We collect representative videos across diverse domains (e.g., natural landscapes, sports, indoor scenes, science fiction, chemical and physical experiments) and extract their event-level descriptions with inherent temporal causality, which are then rewritten into text-to-video prompts by independent annotators. For each prompt, we design a suite of binary evaluation questions from the perspective of dynamic and static properties, with a total of ten carefully defined evaluation dimensions. In total, our VideoVerse comprises 300 carefully curated prompts, involving 815 events and 793 binary evaluation questions. Consequently, a human preference aligned QA-based evaluation pipeline is developed by using modern vision-language models. Finally, we perform a systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art open-source and closed-source T2V models on VideoVerse, providing in-depth analysis on how far the current T2V generators are from world models.

  Unified multimodal models have shown promising results in multimodal content generation and editing but remain largely limited to the image domain. In this work, we present UniVideo, a versatile framework that extends unified modeling to the video domain. UniVideo adopts a dual-stream design, combining a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) for instruction understanding with a Multimodal DiT (MMDiT) for video generation. This design enables accurate interpretation of complex multimodal instructions while preserving visual consistency. Built on this architecture, UniVideo unifies diverse video generation and editing tasks under a single multimodal instruction paradigm and is jointly trained across them. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniVideo matches or surpasses state-of-the-art task-specific baselines in text/image-to-video generation, in-context video generation and in-context video editing. Notably, the unified design of UniVideo enables two forms of generalization. First, UniVideo supports task composition, such as combining editing with style transfer, by integrating multiple capabilities within a single instruction. Second, even without explicit training on free-form video editing, UniVideo transfers its editing capability from large-scale image editing data to this setting, handling unseen instructions such as green-screening characters or changing materials within a video. Beyond these core capabilities, UniVideo also supports visual-prompt-based video generation, where the MLLM interprets visual prompts and guides the MMDiT during synthesis. To foster future research, we will release our model and code.

  Panorama has a full FoV (360$^\circ\times$180$^\circ$), offering a more complete visual description than perspective images. Thanks to this characteristic, panoramic depth estimation is gaining increasing traction in 3D vision. However, due to the scarcity of panoramic data, previous methods are often restricted to in-domain settings, leading to poor zero-shot generalization. Furthermore, due to the spherical distortions inherent in panoramas, many approaches rely on perspective splitting (e.g., cubemaps), which leads to suboptimal efficiency. To address these challenges, we propose $\textbf{DA}$$^{\textbf{2}}$: $\textbf{D}$epth $\textbf{A}$nything in $\textbf{A}$ny $\textbf{D}$irection, an accurate, zero-shot generalizable, and fully end-to-end panoramic depth estimator. Specifically, for scaling up panoramic data, we introduce a data curation engine for generating high-quality panoramic depth data from perspective, and create $\sim$543K panoramic RGB-depth pairs, bringing the total to $\sim$607K. To further mitigate the spherical distortions, we present SphereViT, which explicitly leverages spherical coordinates to enforce the spherical geometric consistency in panoramic image features, yielding improved performance. A comprehensive benchmark on multiple datasets clearly demonstrates DA$^{2}$'s SoTA performance, with an average 38% improvement on AbsRel over the strongest zero-shot baseline. Surprisingly, DA$^{2}$ even outperforms prior in-domain methods, highlighting its superior zero-shot generalization. Moreover, as an end-to-end solution, DA$^{2}$ exhibits much higher efficiency over fusion-based approaches. Both the code and the curated panoramic data has be released. Project page:this https URL.

  Referential grounding in outdoor driving scenes is challenging due to large scene variability, many visually similar objects, and dynamic elements that complicate resolving natural-language references (e.g., "the black car on the right"). We propose LLM-RG, a hybrid pipeline that combines off-the-shelf vision-language models for fine-grained attribute extraction with large language models for symbolic reasoning. LLM-RG processes an image and a free-form referring expression by using an LLM to extract relevant object types and attributes, detecting candidate regions, generating rich visual descriptors with a VLM, and then combining these descriptors with spatial metadata into natural-language prompts that are input to an LLM for chain-of-thought reasoning to identify the referent's bounding box. Evaluated on the Talk2Car benchmark, LLM-RG yields substantial gains over both LLM and VLM-based baselines. Additionally, our ablations show that adding 3D spatial cues further improves grounding. Our results demonstrate the complementary strengths of VLMs and LLMs, applied in a zero-shot manner, for robust outdoor referential grounding.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Federated Prompt Learning (FPL) enables communication-efficient adaptation by tuning lightweight prompts on top of frozen pre-trained models. Existing FPL methods typically rely on global information, which is only available after the second training round, to facilitate collaboration among client models. Therefore, they are inherently dependent on multi-round communication to fully exhibit their strengths. Moreover, existing one-shot federated learning methods typically focus on fitting seen tasks, but lack cross-task generalization. To bridge this gap, we propose the Global Prompt Refinement with Non-Interfering Attention Masking (GPR-NIAM) method for one-shot FPL. The core idea is to design a masking mechanism that restricts excessive interaction between the original text embeddings and the learnable prompt embeddings. GPR-NIAM achieves this through the collaboration of two key modules. Firstly, the attention isolation module suppresses attention from the learnable prompt tokens to the original text tokens, and reweights the reverse attention which preserves generalization across tasks. Secondly, the cross-silo collaborative refinement module integrates decentralized visual knowledge into a unified base and calibrates the global prompt through multi-source cross-modal knowledge alignment, further mitigating the inconsistency caused by data heterogeneity. Extensive experiments conducted on ten benchmark datasets under two tasks show that GPR-NIAM outperforms eight state-of-the-art methods in both class-level and domain-level generalization.

  Recent advances in Large Multi-modal Models (LMMs) have demonstrated their remarkable success as general-purpose multi-modal assistants, with particular focuses on holistic image- and video-language understanding. Conversely, less attention has been given to scaling fine-grained pixel-level understanding capabilities, where the models are expected to realize pixel-level alignment between visual signals and language semantics. Some previous studies have applied LMMs to related tasks such as region-level captioning and referring expression segmentation. However, these models are limited to performing either referring or segmentation tasks independently and fail to integrate these fine-grained perception capabilities into visual reasoning. To bridge this gap, we propose UniPixel, a large multi-modal model capable of flexibly comprehending visual prompt inputs and generating mask-grounded responses. Our model distinguishes itself by seamlessly integrating pixel-level perception with general visual understanding capabilities. Specifically, UniPixel processes visual prompts and generates relevant masks on demand, and performs subsequent reasoning conditioning on these intermediate pointers during inference, thereby enabling fine-grained pixel-level reasoning. The effectiveness of our approach has been verified on 10 benchmarks across a diverse set of tasks, including pixel-level referring/segmentation and object-centric understanding in images/videos. A novel PixelQA task that jointly requires referring, segmentation, and question answering is also designed to verify the flexibility of our method.

  World models allow agents to simulate the consequences of actions in imagined environments for planning, control, and long-horizon decision-making. However, existing autoregressive world models struggle with visually coherent predictions due to disrupted spatial structure, inefficient decoding, and inadequate motion modeling. In response, we propose \textbf{S}cale-wise \textbf{A}utoregression with \textbf{M}otion \textbf{P}r\textbf{O}mpt (\textbf{SAMPO}), a hybrid framework that combines visual autoregressive modeling for intra-frame generation with causal modeling for next-frame generation. Specifically, SAMPO integrates temporal causal decoding with bidirectional spatial attention, which preserves spatial locality and supports parallel decoding within each scale. This design significantly enhances both temporal consistency and rollout efficiency. To further improve dynamic scene understanding, we devise an asymmetric multi-scale tokenizer that preserves spatial details in observed frames and extracts compact dynamic representations for future frames, optimizing both memory usage and model performance. Additionally, we introduce a trajectory-aware motion prompt module that injects spatiotemporal cues about object and robot trajectories, focusing attention on dynamic regions and improving temporal consistency and physical realism. Extensive experiments show that SAMPO achieves competitive performance in action-conditioned video prediction and model-based control, improving generation quality with 4.4$\times$ faster inference. We also evaluate SAMPO's zero-shot generalization and scaling behavior, demonstrating its ability to generalize to unseen tasks and benefit from larger model sizes.

  Common computer vision systems typically assume ideal pinhole cameras but fail when facing real-world camera effects such as fisheye distortion and rolling shutter, mainly due to the lack of learning from training data with camera effects. Existing data generation approaches suffer from either high costs, sim-to-real gaps or fail to accurately model camera effects. To address this bottleneck, we propose 4D Gaussian Ray Tracing (4D-GRT), a novel two-stage pipeline that combines 4D Gaussian Splatting with physically-based ray tracing for camera effect simulation. Given multi-view videos, 4D-GRT first reconstructs dynamic scenes, then applies ray tracing to generate videos with controllable, physically accurate camera effects. 4D-GRT achieves the fastest rendering speed while performing better or comparable rendering quality compared to existing baselines. Additionally, we construct eight synthetic dynamic scenes in indoor environments across four camera effects as a benchmark to evaluate generated videos with camera effects.

This paper investigates whether advanced vision language models (VLMs) share this resilience. We construct two psychophysics inspired benchmarks across distinct writing systems, Chinese logographs and English alphabetic words, by splicing, recombining, and overlaying glyphs to yield ''visible but unreadable'' stimuli for models while remaining legible to humans. Despite strong performance on clean text, contemporary VLMs show a severe drop under these perturbations, frequently producing unrelated or incoherent outputs. The pattern suggests a structural limitation: models heavily leverage generic visual invariances but under rely on compositional priors needed for robust literacy. We release stimuli generation code, prompts, and evaluation protocols to facilitate transparent replication and follow up work. Our findings motivate architectures and training strategies that encode symbol segmentation, composition, and binding across scripts, and they delineate concrete challenges for deploying multimodal systems in education, accessibility, cultural heritage, and security.

  _Trixia Simangan, Ahmed Nadeem Abbasi, Yipeng Hu, Shaheer U. Saeed_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Cryoablation is a minimally invasive localised treatment for prostate cancer that destroys malignant tissue during de-freezing, while sparing surrounding healthy structures. Its success depends on accurate preoperative planning of cryoprobe placements to fully cover the tumour and avoid critical anatomy. This planning is currently manual, expertise-dependent, and time-consuming, leading to variability in treatment quality and limited scalability. In this work, we introduce Cryo-RL, a reinforcement learning framework that models cryoablation planning as a Markov decision process and learns an optimal policy for cryoprobe placement. Within a simulated environment that models clinical constraints and stochastic intraoperative variability, an agent sequentially selects cryoprobe positions and ice sphere diameters. Guided by a reward function based on tumour coverage, this agent learns a cryoablation strategy that leads to optimal cryoprobe placements without the need for any manually-designed plans. Evaluated on 583 retrospective prostate cancer cases, Cryo-RL achieved over 8 percentage-point Dice improvements compared with the best automated baselines, based on geometric optimisation, and matched human expert performance while requiring substantially less planning time. These results highlight the potential of reinforcement learning to deliver clinically viable, reproducible, and efficient cryoablation plans.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Image geolocalization aims to predict the geographic location of images captured anywhere on Earth, but its global nature presents significant challenges. Current evaluation methodologies suffer from two major limitations. First, data leakage: advanced approaches often rely on large vision-language models (LVLMs) to predict image locations, yet these models are frequently pretrained on the test datasets, compromising the accuracy of evaluating a model's actual geolocalization capability. Second, existing metrics primarily rely on exact geographic coordinates to assess predictions, which not only neglects the reasoning process but also raises privacy concerns when user-level location data is required. To address these issues, we propose GeoArena, a first open platform for evaluating LVLMs on worldwide image geolocalization tasks, offering true in-the-wild and human-centered benchmarking. GeoArena enables users to upload in-the-wild images for a more diverse evaluation corpus, and it leverages pairwise human judgments to determine which model output better aligns with human expectations. Our platform has been deployed online for two months, during which we collected over thousands voting records. Based on this data, we conduct a detailed analysis and establish a leaderboard of different LVLMs on the image geolocalization task. GeoArena has been open-sourced to support future research.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Trustworthy AI is mandatory for the broad deployment of autonomous vehicles. Although end-to-end approaches derive control commands directly from raw data, interpreting these decisions remains challenging, especially in complex urban scenarios. This is mainly attributed to very deep neural networks with non-linear decision boundaries, making it challenging to grasp the logic behind AI-driven decisions. This paper presents a method to enhance interpretability while optimizing control commands in autonomous driving. To address this, we propose loss functions that promote the interpretability of our model by generating sparse and localized feature maps. The feature activations allow us to explain which image regions contribute to the predicted control command. We conduct comprehensive ablation studies on the feature extraction step and validate our method on the CARLA benchmarks. We also demonstrate that our approach improves interpretability, which correlates with reducing infractions, yielding a safer, high-performance driving model. Notably, our monocular, non-ensemble model surpasses the top-performing approaches from the CARLA Leaderboard by achieving lower infraction scores and the highest route completion rate, all while ensuring interpretability.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Conditional image generative models hold considerable promise to produce infinite amounts of synthetic training data. Yet, recent progress in generation quality has come at the expense of generation diversity, limiting the utility of these models as a source of synthetic training data. Although guidance-based approaches have been introduced to improve the utility of generated data by focusing on quality or diversity, the (implicit or explicit) utility functions oftentimes disregard the potential distribution shift between synthetic and real data. In this work, we introduce Chamfer Guidance: a training-free guidance approach which leverages a handful of real exemplar images to characterize the quality and diversity of synthetic data. We show that by leveraging the proposed Chamfer Guidance, we can boost the diversity of the generations w.r.t. a dataset of real images while maintaining or improving the generation quality on ImageNet-1k and standard geo-diversity benchmarks. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art few-shot performance with as little as 2 exemplar real images, obtaining 96.4% in terms of precision, and 86.4% in terms of distributional coverage, which increase to 97.5% and 92.7%, respectively, when using 32 real images. We showcase the benefits of the Chamfer Guidance generation by training downstream image classifiers on synthetic data, achieving accuracy boost of up to 15% for in-distribution over the baselines, and up to 16% in out-of-distribution. Furthermore, our approach does not require using the unconditional model, and thus obtains a 31% reduction in FLOPs w.r.t. classifier-free-guidance-based approaches at sampling time.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The Object Goal Navigation (ObjectNav) task challenges agents to locate a specified object in an unseen environment by imagining unobserved regions of the scene. Prior approaches rely on deterministic and discriminative models to complete semantic maps, overlooking the inherent uncertainty in indoor layouts and limiting their ability to generalize to unseen environments. In this work, we propose GOAL, a generative flow-based framework that models the semantic distribution of indoor environments by bridging observed regions with LLM-enriched full-scene semantic maps. During training, spatial priors inferred from large language models (LLMs) are encoded as two-dimensional Gaussian fields and injected into target maps, distilling rich contextual knowledge into the flow model and enabling more generalizable completions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GOAL achieves state-of-the-art performance on MP3D and Gibson, and shows strong generalization in transfer settings to HM3D.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Unsupervised video Object-Centric Learning (OCL) is promising as it enables object-level scene representation and dynamics modeling as we humans do. Mainstream video OCL methods adopt a recurrent architecture: An aggregator aggregates current video frame into object features, termed slots, under some queries; A transitioner transits current slots to queries for the next frame. This is an effective architecture but all existing implementations both (\textit{i1}) neglect to incorporate next frame features, the most informative source for query prediction, and (\textit{i2}) fail to learn transition dynamics, the knowledge essential for query prediction. To address these issues, we propose Random Slot-Feature pair for learning Query prediction (RandSF.Q): (\textit{t1}) We design a new transitioner to incorporate both slots and features, which provides more information for query prediction; (\textit{t2}) We train the transitioner to predict queries from slot-feature pairs randomly sampled from available recurrences, which drives it to learn transition dynamics. Experiments on scene representation demonstrate that our method surpass existing video OCL methods significantly, e.g., up to 10 points on object discovery, setting new state-of-the-art. Such superiority also benefits downstream tasks like dynamics modeling. Our core source code and training logs are available onthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Separating moving and static objects from a moving camera viewpoint is essential for 3D reconstruction, autonomous navigation, and scene understanding in robotics. Existing approaches often rely primarily on optical flow, which struggles to detect moving objects in complex, structured scenes involving camera motion. To address this limitation, we propose Focus of Expansion Likelihood and Segmentation (FoELS), a method based on the core idea of integrating both optical flow and texture information. FoELS computes the focus of expansion (FoE) from optical flow and derives an initial motion likelihood from the outliers of the FoE computation. This likelihood is then fused with a segmentation-based prior to estimate the final moving probability. The method effectively handles challenges including complex structured scenes, rotational camera motion, and parallel motion. Comprehensive evaluations on the DAVIS 2016 dataset and real-world traffic videos demonstrate its effectiveness and state-of-the-art performance.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Bed-related falls remain a major source of injury in hospitals and long-term care facilities, yet many commercial alarms trigger only after a patient has already left the bed. We show that early bed-exit intent can be predicted using only one low-cost load cell mounted under a bed leg. The resulting load signals are first converted into a compact set of complementary images: an RGB line plot that preserves raw waveforms and three texture maps-recurrence plot, Markov transition field, and Gramian angular field-that expose higher-order dynamics. We introduce ViFusionTST, a dual-stream Swin Transformer that processes the line plot and texture maps in parallel and fuses them through cross-attention to learn data-driven modality weights. To provide a realistic benchmark, we collected six months of continuous data from 95 beds in a long-term-care facility. On this real-world dataset ViFusionTST reaches an accuracy of 0.885 and an F1 score of 0.794, surpassing recent 1D and 2D time-series baselines across F1, recall, accuracy, and AUPRC. The results demonstrate that image-based fusion of load-sensor signals for time series classification is a practical and effective solution for real-time, privacy-preserving fall prevention.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in multimodal reasoning tasks through enhanced chain-of-thought capabilities. However, this advancement also introduces novel safety risks, as these models become increasingly vulnerable to harmful multimodal prompts that can trigger unethical or unsafe behaviors. Existing safety alignment approaches, primarily designed for unimodal language models, fall short in addressing the complex and nuanced threats posed by multimodal inputs. Moreover, current safety datasets lack the fine-grained, policy-grounded reasoning required to robustly align reasoning-capable VLMs. In this work, we introduce {MSR-Align}, a high-quality Multimodal Safety Reasoning dataset tailored to bridge this gap. MSR-Align supports fine-grained, deliberative reasoning over standardized safety policies across both vision and text modalities. Our data generation pipeline emphasizes multimodal diversity, policy-grounded reasoning, and rigorous quality filtering using strong multimodal judges. Extensive experiments demonstrate that fine-tuning VLMs on MSR-Align substantially improves robustness against both textual and vision-language jailbreak attacks, while preserving or enhancing general reasoning performance. MSR-Align provides a scalable and effective foundation for advancing the safety alignment of reasoning-capable VLMs. Our dataset is made publicly available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Global dependency modeling and spatial position modeling are two core issues of the foundational architecture design in current deep learning frameworks. Recently, Vision Transformers (ViTs) have achieved remarkable success in computer vision, leveraging the powerful global dependency modeling capability of the self-attention mechanism. Furthermore, Mamba2 has demonstrated its significant potential in natural language processing tasks by explicitly modeling the spatial adjacency prior through the structured mask. In this paper, we propose Polyline Path Masked Attention (PPMA) that integrates the self-attention mechanism of ViTs with an enhanced structured mask of Mamba2, harnessing the complementary strengths of both architectures. Specifically, we first ameliorate the traditional structured mask of Mamba2 by introducing a 2D polyline path scanning strategy and derive its corresponding structured mask, polyline path mask, which better preserves the adjacency relationships among image tokens. Notably, we conduct a thorough theoretical analysis on the structural characteristics of the proposed polyline path mask and design an efficient algorithm for the computation of the polyline path mask. Next, we embed the polyline path mask into the self-attention mechanism of ViTs, enabling explicit modeling of spatial adjacency prior. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks, including image classification, object detection, and segmentation, demonstrate that our model outperforms previous state-of-the-art approaches based on both state-space models and Transformers. For example, our proposed PPMA-T/S/B models achieve 48.7%/51.1%/52.3% mIoU on the ADE20K semantic segmentation task, surpassing RMT-T/S/B by 0.7%/1.3%/0.3%, respectively.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present HOIDiNi, a text-driven diffusion framework for synthesizing realistic and plausible human-object interaction (HOI). HOI generation is extremely challenging since it induces strict contact accuracies alongside a diverse motion manifold. While current literature trades off between realism and physical correctness, HOIDiNi optimizes directly in the noise space of a pretrained diffusion model using Diffusion Noise Optimization (DNO), achieving both. This is made feasible thanks to our observation that the problem can be separated into two phases: an object-centric phase, primarily making discrete choices of hand-object contact locations, and a human-centric phase that refines the full-body motion to realize this blueprint. This structured approach allows for precise hand-object contact without compromising motion naturalness. Quantitative, qualitative, and subjective evaluations on the GRAB dataset alone clearly indicate HOIDiNi outperforms prior works and baselines in contact accuracy, physical validity, and overall quality. Our results demonstrate the ability to generate complex, controllable interactions, including grasping, placing, and full-body coordination, driven solely by textual prompts.this https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Long-video understanding~(LVU) is a challenging problem in computer vision. Existing methods either downsample frames for single-pass reasoning, sacrificing fine-grained details, or depend on textual reasoning over task-agnostic representations, hindering task-specific perception and exploration. In this paper, we propose VideoExplorer, a framework grounded in the principle of ``thinking with video'', which naturally intertwines planning, temporal grounding, and scalable perception into a coherent reasoning process. Rather than reasoning over a static context, VideoExplorer iteratively formulates sub-questions, locates relevant moments, and performs task-oriented, temporally scalable video understanding until reaching the final answer, enabling faithful, efficient, and interpretable reasoning. To address the lack of LVU training resources, we construct a long-video reasoning dataset using difficulty-adaptive sampling to ensure high-quality trajectories on complex tasks. Building on this dataset, we design a two-stage training pipeline: supervised trajectory initialization followed by trajectory-level preference optimization, encouraging adaptive temporal grounding and iterative information integration guided by downstream rewards. Extensive evaluations on popular long-video understanding and reasoning benchmarks demonstrate VideoExplorer's significant advantage over existing baselines, highlighting its robustness, adaptability, and efficiency.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In real-word scenarios, person re-identification (ReID) expects to identify a person-of-interest via the descriptive query, regardless of whether the query is a single modality or a combination of multiple modalities. However, existing methods and datasets remain constrained to limited modalities, failing to meet this requirement. Therefore, we investigate a new challenging problem called Omni Multi-modal Person Re-identification (OM-ReID), which aims to achieve effective retrieval with varying multi-modal queries. To address dataset scarcity, we construct ORBench, the first high-quality multi-modal dataset comprising 1,000 unique identities across five modalities: RGB, infrared, color pencil, sketch, and textual description. This dataset also has significant superiority in terms of diversity, such as the painting perspectives and textual information. It could serve as an ideal platform for follow-up investigations in OM-ReID. Moreover, we propose ReID5o, a novel multi-modal learning framework for person ReID. It enables synergistic fusion and cross-modal alignment of arbitrary modality combinations in a single model, with a unified encoding and multi-expert routing mechanism proposed. Extensive experiments verify the advancement and practicality of our ORBench. A wide range of possible models have been evaluated and compared on it, and our proposed ReID5o model gives the best performance.

  Autonomous vehicles rely on detailed and accurate environmental information to operate safely. High definition (HD) maps offer a promising solution, but their high maintenance cost poses a significant barrier to scalable deployment. This challenge is addressed by online HD map construction methods, which generate local HD maps from live sensor data. However, these methods are inherently limited by the short perception range of onboard sensors. To overcome this limitation and improve general performance, recent approaches have explored the use of standard definition (SD) maps as prior, which are significantly easier to maintain. We propose SDTagNet, the first online HD map construction method that fully utilizes the information of widely available SD maps, like OpenStreetMap, to enhance far range detection accuracy. Our approach introduces two key innovations. First, in contrast to previous work, we incorporate not only polyline SD map data with manually selected classes, but additional semantic information in the form of textual annotations. In this way, we enrich SD vector map tokens with NLP-derived features, eliminating the dependency on predefined specifications or exhaustive class taxonomies. Second, we introduce a point-level SD map encoder together with orthogonal element identifiers to uniformly integrate all types of map elements. Experiments on Argoverse 2 and nuScenes show that this boosts map perception performance by up to +5.9 mAP (+45%) w.r.t. map construction without priors and up to +3.2 mAP (+20%) w.r.t. previous approaches that already use SD map priors.

  3D visual grounding has made notable progress in localizing objects within complex 3D scenes. However, grounding referring expressions beyond objects in 3D scenes remains unexplored. In this paper, we introduce Anywhere3D-Bench, a holistic 3D visual grounding benchmark consisting of 2,886 referring expression-3D bounding box pairs spanning four different grounding levels: human-activity areas, unoccupied space beyond objects, individual objects in the scene, and fine-grained object parts. We assess a range of state-of-the-art 3D visual grounding methods alongside large language models (LLMs) and multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) on Anywhere3D-Bench. Experimental results reveal that space-level and part-level visual grounding pose the greatest challenges: space-level tasks require a more comprehensive spatial reasoning ability, for example, modeling distances and spatial relations within 3D space, while part-level tasks demand fine-grained perception of object composition. Even the best performance model, OpenAI o4-mini, achieves only 23.00% accuracy on space-level tasks and 31.46% on part-level tasks, significantly lower than its performance on area-level and object-level tasks. These findings underscore a critical gap in current models' capacity to understand and reason about 3D scenes beyond object-level semantics.

  Automated parsing of scanned documents into richly structured, machine-readable formats remains a critical bottleneck in Document AI, as traditional multi-stage pipelines suffer from error propagation and limited adaptability to diverse layouts. We introduce layoutRL, an end-to-end reinforcement learning framework that trains models to be explicitly layout-aware by optimizing a composite reward of normalized edit distance, paragraph count accuracy, and reading order preservation. Leveraging our newly released dataset, Infinity-Doc-55K, which combines 55K high-fidelity synthetic scanned document parsing data with expert-filtered real-world documents, we instantiate layoutRL in a vision-language-model-based parser called Infinity-Parser. Evaluated on English and Chinese benchmarks for OCR, table and formula extraction, and reading order detection, Infinity-Parser achieves new state-of-the-art performance in both accuracy and structural fidelity, outpacing specialist pipelines and general-purpose vision-language models.

  The real world is messy and unstructured. Uncovering critical information often requires active, goal-driven exploration. It remains to be seen whether Vision-Language Models (VLMs), which recently emerged as a popular zero-shot tool in many difficult tasks, can operate effectively in such conditions. In this paper, we answer this question by introducing FlySearch, a 3D, outdoor, photorealistic environment for searching and navigating to objects in complex scenes. We define three sets of scenarios with varying difficulty and observe that state-of-the-art VLMs cannot reliably solve even the simplest exploration tasks, with the gap to human performance increasing as the tasks get harder. We identify a set of central causes, ranging from vision hallucination, through context misunderstanding, to task planning failures, and we show that some of them can be addressed by finetuning. We publicly release the benchmark, scenarios, and the underlying codebase.

  Recent strides in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have significantly advanced their performance in many reasoning tasks. However, Abstract Visual Reasoning (AVR) remains a critical challenge, primarily due to limitations in perceiving abstract graphics. To tackle this issue, we investigate the bottlenecks in current MLLMs and synthesize training data to improve their abstract visual perception. First, we propose VisuRiddles, a benchmark for AVR, featuring tasks meticulously constructed to assess models' reasoning capacities across five core dimensions and two high-level reasoning categories. Second, we introduce the Perceptual Riddle Synthesizer (PRS), an automated framework for generating riddles with fine-grained perceptual descriptions. PRS not only generates valuable training data for abstract graphics but also provides fine-grained perceptual description, crucially allowing for supervision over intermediate reasoning stages and thereby improving both training efficacy and model interpretability. Our extensive experimental results on VisuRiddles empirically validate that fine-grained visual perception is the principal bottleneck and our synthesis framework markedly enhances the performance of contemporary MLLMs on these challenging tasks.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent endeavors in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) aim to unify visual comprehension and generation. However, these two capabilities remain largely independent, as if they are two separate functions encapsulated within the same model. Consequently, visual comprehension does not enhance visual generation, and the reasoning mechanisms of LLMs have not been fully integrated to revolutionize image generation. In this paper, we propose to enable the collaborative co-evolution of visual comprehension and generation, advancing image generation into an iterative introspective process. We introduce a two-stage training approach: supervised fine-tuning teaches the MLLM with the foundational ability to generate genuine CoT for visual generation, while reinforcement learning activates its full potential via an exploration-exploitation trade-off. Ultimately, we unlock the Aha moment in visual generation, advancing MLLMs from text-to-image tasks to unified image generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model not only excels in text-to-image generation and image editing, but also functions as a superior image semantic evaluator with enhanced visual comprehension capabilities.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  While generalizable 3D Gaussian splatting enables efficient, high-quality rendering of unseen scenes, it heavily depends on precise camera poses for accurate geometry. In real-world scenarios, obtaining accurate poses is challenging, leading to noisy pose estimates and geometric misalignments. To address this, we introduce SHARE, a pose-free, feed-forward Gaussian splatting framework that overcomes these ambiguities by joint shape and camera rays estimation. Instead of relying on explicit 3D transformations, SHARE builds a pose-aware canonical volume representation that seamlessly integrates multi-view information, reducing misalignment caused by inaccurate pose estimates. Additionally, anchor-aligned Gaussian prediction enhances scene reconstruction by refining local geometry around coarse anchors, allowing for more precise Gaussian placement. Extensive experiments on diverse real-world datasets show that our method achieves robust performance in pose-free generalizable Gaussian splatting. Code is avilable atthis https URL

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Diffusion Transformers (DiT) have become the de-facto model for generating high-quality visual content like videos and images. A huge bottleneck is the attention mechanism where complexity scales quadratically with resolution and video length. One logical way to lessen this burden is sparse attention, where only a subset of tokens or patches are included in the calculation. However, existing techniques fail to preserve visual quality at extremely high sparsity levels and might even incur non-negligible compute overheads. To address this concern, we propose Re-ttention, which implements very high sparse attention for visual generation models by leveraging the temporal redundancy of Diffusion Models to overcome the probabilistic normalization shift within the attention mechanism. Specifically, Re-ttention reshapes attention scores based on the prior softmax distribution history in order to preserve the visual quality of the full quadratic attention at very high sparsity levels. Experimental results on T2V/T2I models such as CogVideoX and the PixArt DiTs demonstrate that Re-ttention requires as few as 3.1% of the tokens during inference, outperforming contemporary methods like FastDiTAttn, Sparse VideoGen and MInference.

DisasterM3 includes 26,988 bi-temporal satellite images and 123k instruction pairs across 5 continents, with three characteristics: 1) Multi-hazard: DisasterM3 involves 36 historical disaster events with significant impacts, which are categorized into 10 common natural and man-made disasters. 2)Multi-sensor: Extreme weather during disasters often hinders optical sensor imaging, making it necessary to combine Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery for post-disaster scenes. 3) Multi-task: Based on real-world scenarios, DisasterM3 includes 9 disaster-related visual perception and reasoning tasks, harnessing the full potential of VLM's reasoning ability with progressing from disaster-bearing body recognition to structural damage assessment and object relational reasoning, culminating in the generation of long-form disaster reports. We extensively evaluated 14 generic and remote sensing VLMs on our benchmark, revealing that state-of-the-art models struggle with the disaster tasks, largely due to the lack of a disaster-specific corpus, cross-sensor gap, and damage object counting insensitivity. Focusing on these issues, we fine-tune four VLMs using our dataset and achieve stable improvements across all tasks, with robust cross-sensor and cross-disaster generalization capabilities.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The real world is dynamic, yet most image fusion methods process static frames independently, ignoring temporal correlations in videos and leading to flickering and temporal inconsistency. To address this, we propose Unified Video Fusion (UniVF), a novel and unified framework for video fusion that leverages multi-frame learning and optical flow-based feature warping for informative, temporally coherent video fusion. To support its development, we also introduce Video Fusion Benchmark (VF-Bench), the first comprehensive benchmark covering four video fusion tasks: multi-exposure, multi-focus, infrared-visible, and medical fusion. VF-Bench provides high-quality, well-aligned video pairs obtained through synthetic data generation and rigorous curation from existing datasets, with a unified evaluation protocol that jointly assesses the spatial quality and temporal consistency of video fusion. Extensive experiments show that UniVF achieves state-of-the-art results across all tasks on VF-Bench. Project page:this https URL.

  We introduce CoLoRA (Convolutional Low-Rank Adaptation), a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method for convolutional neural networks (CNNs). CoLoRA extends LoRA to convolutional layers by decomposing kernel updates into lightweight depthwise and pointwisethis http URLdesign reduces the number of trainable parameters to 0.2 compared to conventional fine-tuning, preserves the original model size, and allows merging updates into the pretrained weights after each epoch, keeping inference complexity unchanged. On OCTMNISTv2, CoLoRA applied to VGG16 and ResNet50 achieves up to 1 percent accuracy and 0.013 AUC improvements over strong baselines (Vision Transformers, state-space, and Kolmogorov Arnold models) while reducing per-epoch training time by nearly 20 percent. Results indicate that CoLoRA provides a stable and effective alternative to full fine-tuning for medical image classification.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  By pretraining to synthesize coherent images from perturbed inputs, generative models inherently learn to understand object boundaries and scene compositions. How can we repurpose these generative representations for general-purpose perceptual organization? We finetune Stable Diffusion and MAE (encoder+decoder) for category-agnostic instance segmentation using our instance coloring loss exclusively on a narrow set of object types (indoor furnishings and cars). Surprisingly, our models exhibit strong zero-shot generalization, accurately segmenting objects of types and styles unseen in finetuning (and in many cases, MAE's ImageNet-1K pretraining too). Our best-performing models closely approach the heavily supervised SAM when evaluated on unseen object types and styles, and outperform it when segmenting fine structures and ambiguous boundaries. In contrast, existing promptable segmentation architectures or discriminatively pretrained models fail to generalize. This suggests that generative models learn an inherent grouping mechanism that transfers across categories and domains, even without internet-scale pretraining. Code, pretrained models, and demos are available on our website.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Learning general-purpose reasoning capabilities has long been a challenging problem in AI. Recent research in large language models (LLMs), such as DeepSeek-R1, has shown that reinforcement learning techniques like GRPO can enable pre-trained LLMs to develop reasoning capabilities using simple question-answer pairs. In this paper, we aim to train visual language models (VLMs) to perform reasoning on image data through reinforcement learning and visual question-answer pairs, without any explicit chain-of-thought (CoT) supervision. Our findings indicate that simply applying reinforcement learning to a VLM -- by prompting the model to produce a reasoning chain before providing an answer -- can lead the model to develop shortcuts from easy questions, thereby reducing its ability to generalize across unseen data distributions. We argue that the key to mitigating shortcut learning is to encourage the model to interpret images prior to reasoning. Therefore, we train the model to adhere to a caption-reason-answer output format: initially generating a detailed caption for an image, followed by constructing an extensive reasoning chain. When trained on 273K CoT-free visual question-answer pairs and using only reinforcement learning, our model, named Visionary-R1, outperforms strong multimodal models, such as GPT-4o, Claude3.5-Sonnet, and Gemini-1.5-Pro, on multiple visual reasoning benchmarks.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  DeepSeek-R1 has demonstrated remarkable effectiveness in incentivizing reasoning and generalization capabilities of large language models (LLMs) through reinforcement learning. Nevertheless, the potential of reasoning-induced computation has not been thoroughly explored in the context of image quality assessment (IQA), a task depending critically on visual reasoning. In this paper, we introduce VisualQuality-R1, a reasoning-induced no-reference IQA (NR-IQA) model, and we train it with reinforcement learning to rank, a learning algorithm tailored to the intrinsically relative nature of visual quality. Specifically, for a pair of images, we employ group relative policy optimization to generate multiple quality scores for each image. These estimates are used to compute comparative probabilities of one image having higher quality than the other under the Thurstone model. Rewards for each quality estimate are defined using continuous fidelity measures rather than discretized binary labels. Extensive experiments show that the proposed VisualQuality-R1 consistently outperforms discriminative deep learning-based NR-IQA models as well as a recent reasoning-induced quality regression method. Moreover, VisualQuality-R1 is capable of generating contextually rich, human-aligned quality descriptions, and supports multi-dataset training without requiring perceptual scale realignment. These features make VisualQuality-R1 especially well-suited for reliably measuring progress in a wide range of image processing tasks like super-resolution and image generation.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Morphometric measures derived from spinal cord segmentations can serve as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers in neurological diseases and injuries affecting the spinal cord. While robust, automatic segmentation methods to a wide variety of contrasts and pathologies have been developed over the past few years, whether their predictions are stable as the model is updated using new datasets has not been assessed. This is particularly important for deriving normative values from healthy participants. In this study, we present a spinal cord segmentation model trained on a multisite $(n=75)$ dataset, including 9 different MRI contrasts and several spinal cord pathologies. We also introduce a lifelong learning framework to automatically monitor the morphometric drift as the model is updated using additional datasets. The framework is triggered by an automatic GitHub Actions workflow every time a new model is created, recording the morphometric values derived from the model's predictions over time. As a real-world application of the proposed framework, we employed the spinal cord segmentation model to update a recently-introduced normative database of healthy participants containing commonly used measures of spinal cord morphometry. Results showed that: (i) our model outperforms previous versions and pathology-specific models on challenging lumbar spinal cord cases, achieving an average Dice score of $0.95 \pm 0.03$; (ii) the automatic workflow for monitoring morphometric drift provides a quick feedback loop for developing future segmentation models; and (iii) the scaling factor required to update the database of morphometric measures is nearly constant among slices across the given vertebral levels, showing minimum drift between the current and previous versions of the model monitored by the framework. The code and model are open-source and accessible via Spinal Cord Toolbox v7.0.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In modern smart agriculture, object detection plays a crucial role by enabling automation, precision farming, and monitoring of resources. From identifying crop health and pest infestations to optimizing harvesting processes, accurate object detection enhances both productivity and sustainability. However, training object detection models often requires large-scale data collection and raises privacy concerns, particularly when sensitive agricultural data is distributed across farms. To address these challenges, we propose VLLFL, a vision-language model-based lightweight federated learning framework (VLLFL). It harnesses the generalization and context-aware detection capabilities of the vision-language model (VLM) and leverages the privacy-preserving nature of federated learning. By training a compact prompt generator to boost the performance of the VLM deployed across different farms, VLLFL preserves privacy while reducing communication overhead. Experimental results demonstrate that VLLFL achieves 14.53% improvement in the performance of VLM while reducing 99.3% communication overhead. Spanning tasks from identifying a wide variety of fruits to detecting harmful animals in agriculture, the proposed framework offers an efficient, scalable, and privacy-preserving solution specifically tailored to agricultural applications.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present MaskWM, a simple, efficient, and flexible framework for image watermarking. MaskWM has two variants: (1) MaskWM-D, which supports global watermark embedding, watermark localization, and local watermark extraction for applications such as tamper detection; (2) MaskWM-ED, which focuses on local watermark embedding and extraction, offering enhanced robustness in small regions to support fine-grined image protection. MaskWM-D builds on the classical encoder-distortion layer-decoder training paradigm. In MaskWM-D, we introduce a simple masking mechanism during the decoding stage that enables both global and local watermark extraction. During training, the decoder is guided by various types of masks applied to watermarked images before extraction, helping it learn to localize watermarks and extract them from the corresponding local areas. MaskWM-ED extends this design by incorporating the mask into the encoding stage as well, guiding the encoder to embed the watermark in designated local regions, which improves robustness under regional attacks. Extensive experiments show that MaskWM achieves state-of-the-art performance in global and local watermark extraction, watermark localization, and multi-watermark embedding. It outperforms all existing baselines, including the recent leading model WAM for local watermarking, while preserving high visual quality of the watermarked images. In addition, MaskWM is highly efficient and adaptable. It requires only 20 hours of training on a single A6000 GPU, achieving 15x computational efficiency compared to WAM. By simply adjusting the distortion layer, MaskWM can be quickly fine-tuned to meet varying robustness requirements.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this paper we tackle a fundamental question: "Can we train latent diffusion models together with the variational auto-encoder (VAE) tokenizer in an end-to-end manner?" Traditional deep-learning wisdom dictates that end-to-end training is often preferable when possible. However, for latent diffusion transformers, it is observed that end-to-end training both VAE and diffusion-model using standard diffusion-loss is ineffective, even causing a degradation in final performance. We show that while diffusion loss is ineffective, end-to-end training can be unlocked through the representation-alignment (REPA) loss -- allowing both VAE and diffusion model to be jointly tuned during the training process. Despite its simplicity, the proposed training recipe (REPA-E) shows remarkable performance; speeding up diffusion model training by over 17x and 45x over REPA and vanilla training recipes, respectively. Interestingly, we observe that end-to-end tuning with REPA-E also improves the VAE itself; leading to improved latent space structure and downstream generation performance. In terms of final performance, our approach sets a new state-of-the-art; achieving FID of 1.12 and 1.69 with and without classifier-free guidance on ImageNet 256 x 256.

  _Ashesh Ashesh, Florian Jug_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Fluorescence microscopy, while being a key driver for progress in the life sciences, is also subject to technical limitations. To overcome them, computational multiplexing techniques have recently been proposed, which allow multiple cellular structures to be captured in a single image and later be unmixed. Existing image decomposition methods are trained on a set of superimposed input images and the respective unmixed target images. It is critical to note that the relative strength (mixing ratio) of the superimposed images for a given input is a priori unknown. However, existing methods are trained on a fixed intensity ratio of superimposed inputs, making them not cognizant of the range of relative intensities that can occur in fluorescence microscopy. In this work, we propose a novel method called scSplit that is cognizant of the severity of the above-mentioned mixing ratio. Our idea is based on InDI , a popular iterative method for image restoration, and an ideal starting point to embrace the unknown mixing ratio in any given input. We introduce (i) a suitably trained regressor network that predicts the degradation level (mixing ratio) of a given input image and (ii) a degradation-specific normalization module, enabling degradation-aware inference across all mixing ratios. We show that this method solves two relevant tasks in fluorescence microscopy, namely image splitting and bleedthrough removal, and empirically demonstrate the applicability of scSplit on 5 public datasets.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Diffusion-based inverse algorithms have shown remarkable performance across various inverse problems, yet their reliance on numerous denoising steps incurs high computational costs. While recent developments of fast diffusion ODE solvers offer effective acceleration for diffusion sampling without observations, their application in inverse problems remains limited due to the heterogeneous formulations of inverse algorithms and their prevalent use of approximations and heuristics, which often introduce significant errors that undermine the reliability of analytical solvers. In this work, we begin with an analysis of ODE solvers for inverse problems that reveals a linear combination structure of approximations for the inverse trajectory. Building on this insight, we propose a canonical form that unifies a broad class of diffusion-based inverse algorithms and facilitates the design of more generalizable solvers. Inspired by the linear subspace search strategy, we propose Learnable Linear Extrapolation (LLE), a lightweight approach that universally enhances the performance of any diffusion-based inverse algorithm conforming to our canonical form. LLE optimizes the combination coefficients to refine current predictions using previous estimates, alleviating the sensitivity of analytical solvers for inverse algorithms. Extensive experiments demonstrate consistent improvements of the proposed LLE method across multiple algorithms and tasks, indicating its potential for more efficient solutions and boosted performance of diffusion-based inverse algorithms with limited steps.

  3D landmark detection is a critical task in medical image analysis, and accurately detecting anatomical landmarks is essential for subsequent medical imaging tasks. However, mainstream deep learning methods in this field struggle to simultaneously capture fine-grained local features and model global spatial relationships, while maintaining a balance between accuracy and computational efficiency. Local feature extraction requires capturing fine-grained anatomical details, while global modeling requires understanding the spatial relationships within complex anatomical structures. The high-dimensional nature of 3D volume further exacerbates these challenges, as landmarks are sparsely distributed, leading to significant computational costs. Therefore, achieving efficient and precise 3D landmark detection remains a pressing challenge in medical image analysis.In this work, We propose a \textbf{H}ybrid \textbf{3}D \textbf{DE}tection \textbf{Net}(H3DE-Net), a novel framework that combines CNNs for local feature extraction with a lightweight attention mechanism designed to efficiently capture global dependencies in 3D volumetric data. This mechanism employs a hierarchical routing strategy to reduce computational cost while maintaining global context modeling. To our knowledge, H3DE-Net is the first 3D landmark detection model that integrates such a lightweight attention mechanism with CNNs. Additionally, integrating multi-scale feature fusion further enhances detection accuracy and robustness. Experimental results on a public CT dataset demonstrate that H3DE-Net achieves state-of-the-art(SOTA) performance, significantly improving accuracy and robustness, particularly in scenarios with missing landmarks or complex anatomical variations. We aready open-source our project, including code, data and model weights.

  Inherent limitations of contemporary machine learning systems in crucial areas -- importantly in continual learning, information reuse, comprehensibility, and integration with deliberate behavior -- are receiving increasing attention. To address these challenges, we introduce a system design, fueled by a novel learning approach conceptually grounded in principles of evolutionary developmental biology, that overcomes key limitations of current methods. Our design comprises three core components: The Modeller, a gradient-free learning mechanism inherently capable of continual learning and structural adaptation; a planner for goal-directed action over learned models; and a behavior encapsulation mechanism that can decompose complex behaviors into a hierarchical structure. We demonstrate proof-of-principle operation in a simple test environment. Additionally, we extend our modeling framework to higher-dimensional network-structured spaces, using MNIST for a shape detection task. Our framework shows promise in overcoming multiple major limitations of contemporary machine learning systems simultaneously and in an organic manner.

  Existing end-to-end autonomous driving (AD) algorithms typically follow the Imitation Learning (IL) paradigm, which faces challenges such as causal confusion and an open-loop gap. In this work, we propose RAD, a 3DGS-based closed-loop Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework for end-to-end Autonomous Driving. By leveraging 3DGS techniques, we construct a photorealistic digital replica of the real physical world, enabling the AD policy to extensively explore the state space and learn to handle out-of-distribution scenarios through large-scale trial and error. To enhance safety, we design specialized rewards to guide the policy in effectively responding to safety-critical events and understanding real-world causal relationships. To better align with human driving behavior, we incorporate IL into RL training as a regularization term. We introduce a closed-loop evaluation benchmark consisting of diverse, previously unseen 3DGS environments. Compared to IL-based methods, RAD achieves stronger performance in most closed-loop metrics, particularly exhibiting a 3x lower collision rate. Abundant closed-loop results are presented in the supplementary material. Code is available atthis https URLfor facilitating future research.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Virtual try-on, which aims to seamlessly fit garments onto person images, has recently seen significant progress with diffusion-based models. However, existing methods commonly resort to duplicated backbones or additional image encoders to extract garment features, which increases computational overhead and network complexity. In this paper, we propose ITVTON, an efficient framework that leverages the Diffusion Transformer (DiT) as its single generator to improve image fidelity. By concatenating garment and person images along the width dimension and incorporating textual descriptions from both, ITVTON effectively captures garment-person interactions while preserving realism. To further reduce computational cost, we restrict training to the attention parameters within a single Diffusion Transformer (Single-DiT) block. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ITVTON surpasses baseline methods both qualitatively and quantitatively, setting a new standard for virtual try-on. Moreover, experiments on 10,257 image pairs from IGPair confirm its robustness in real-world scenarios.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The rapid evolution of deepfake generation technologies necessitates the development of robust face forgery detection algorithms. Recent studies have demonstrated that wavelet analysis can enhance the generalization abilities of forgery detectors. Wavelets effectively capture key facial contours, often slender, fine-grained, and globally distributed, that may conceal subtle forgery artifacts imperceptible in the spatial domain. However, current wavelet-based approaches fail to fully exploit the distinctive properties of wavelet data, resulting in sub-optimal feature extraction and limited performance gains. To address this challenge, we introduce WMamba, a novel wavelet-based feature extractor built upon the Mamba architecture. WMamba maximizes the utility of wavelet information through two key innovations. First, we propose Dynamic Contour Convolution (DCConv), which employs specially crafted deformable kernels to adaptively model slender facial contours. Second, by leveraging the Mamba architecture, our method captures long-range spatial relationships with linear complexity. This efficiency allows for the extraction of fine-grained, globally distributed forgery artifacts from small image patches. Extensive experiments show that WMamba achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, highlighting its effectiveness in face forgery detection.

  Palmprint recognition has emerged as a prominent biometric technology, widely applied in diverse scenarios. Traditional handcrafted methods for palmprint recognition often fall short in representation capability, as they heavily depend on researchers' prior knowledge. Deep learning (DL) has been introduced to address this limitation, leveraging its remarkable successes across various domains. While existing surveys focus narrowly on specific tasks within palmprint recognition-often grounded in traditional methodologies-there remains a significant gap in comprehensive research exploring DL-based approaches across all facets of palmprint recognition. This paper bridges that gap by thoroughly reviewing recent advancements in DL-powered palmprint recognition. The paper systematically examines progress across key tasks, including region-of-interest segmentation, feature extraction, and security/privacy-oriented challenges. Beyond highlighting these advancements, the paper identifies current challenges and uncovers promising opportunities for future research.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  View transformation robustness (VTR) is critical for deep-learning-based multi-view 3D object reconstruction models, which indicates the methods' stability under inputs with various view transformations. However, existing research seldom focused on view transformation robustness in multi-view 3D object reconstruction. One direct way to improve the models' VTR is to produce data with more view transformations and add them to model training. Recent progress on large vision models, particularly Stable Diffusion models, has provided great potential for generating 3D models or synthesizing novel view images with only a single image input. Directly deploying these models at inference consumes heavy computation resources and their robustness to view transformations is not guaranteed either. To fully utilize the power of Stable Diffusion models without extra inference computation burdens, we propose to generate novel views with Stable Diffusion models for better view transformation robustness. Instead of synthesizing random views, we propose a reconstruction error-guided view selection method, which considers the reconstruction errors' spatial distribution of the 3D predictions and chooses the views that could cover the reconstruction errors as much as possible. The methods are trained and tested on sets with large view transformations to validate the 3D reconstruction models' robustness to view transformations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can outperform state-of-the-art 3D reconstruction methods and other view transformation robustness comparison methods.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Facial personalization faces challenges to maintain identity fidelity without disrupting the foundation model's prompt consistency. The mainstream personalization models employ identity embedding to integrate identity information within the attention mechanisms. However, our preliminary findings reveal that identity embeddings compromise the effectiveness of other tokens in the prompt, thereby limiting high prompt consistency and attribute-level controllability. Moreover, by deactivating identity embedding, personalization models still demonstrate the underlying foundation models' ability to control facial attributes precisely. It suggests that such foundation models' knowledge can be leveraged to cure the ill-aligned prompt consistency of personalization models. Building upon these insights, we propose FreeCure, a framework that improves the prompt consistency of personalization models with their latent foundation models' knowledge. First, by setting a dual inference paradigm with/without identity embedding, we identify attributes (e.g., hair, accessories, etc.) for enhancements. Second, we introduce a novel foundation-aware self-attention module, coupled with an inversion-based process to bring well-aligned attribute information to the personalization process. Our approach is training-free, and can effectively enhance a wide array of facial attributes; and it can be seamlessly integrated into existing popular personalization models based on both Stable Diffusion and FLUX. FreeCure has consistently shown significant improvements in prompt consistency across these facial personalization models while maintaining the integrity of their original identity fidelity.

  3D medical image analysis is essential for modern healthcare, yet traditional task-specific models are inadequate due to limited generalizability across diverse clinical scenarios. Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) offer a promising solution to these challenges. However, existing MLLMs have limitations in fully leveraging the rich, hierarchical information embedded in 3D medical images. Inspired by clinical practice, where radiologists focus on both 3D spatial structure and 2D planar content, we propose Med-2E3, a 3D medical MLLM that integrates a dual 3D-2D encoder architecture. To aggregate 2D features effectively, we design a Text-Guided Inter-Slice (TG-IS) scoring module, which scores the attention of each 2D slice based on slice contents and task instructions. To the best of our knowledge, Med-2E3 is the first MLLM to integrate both 3D and 2D features for 3D medical image analysis. Experiments on large-scale, open-source 3D medical multimodal datasets demonstrate that TG-IS exhibits task-specific attention distribution and significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art models.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Dynamic scene reconstruction poses a persistent challenge in 3D vision. Deformable 3D Gaussian Splatting has emerged as an effective method for this task, offering real-time rendering and high visual fidelity. This approach decomposes a dynamic scene into a static representation in a canonical space and time-varying scene motion. Scene motion is defined as the collective movement of all Gaussian points, and for compactness, existing approaches commonly adopt implicit neural fields or sparse control points. However, these methods predominantly rely on gradient-based optimization for all motion information. Due to the high degree of freedom, they struggle to converge on real-world datasets exhibiting complex motion. To preserve the compactness of motion representation and address convergence challenges, this paper proposes heterogeneous 3D control points, termed \textbf{H3D control points}, whose attributes are obtained using a hybrid strategy combining optical flow back-projection and gradient-based methods. This design decouples directly observable motion components from those that are geometrically occluded. Specifically, components of 3D motion that project onto the image plane are directly acquired via optical flow back projection, while unobservable portions are refined through gradient-based optimization. Experiments on the Neu3DV and CMU-Panoptic datasets demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art deformable 3D Gaussian splatting techniques. Remarkably, our method converges within just 100 iterations and achieves a per-frame processing speed of 2 seconds on a single NVIDIA RTX 4070 GPU.

  Colonoscopic Polyp Re-Identification aims to match the same polyp from a large gallery with images from different views taken using different cameras, which plays an important role in the prevention and treatment of colorectal cancer in computer-aided diagnosis. However, traditional methods for object ReID directly adopting CNN models trained on the ImageNet dataset usually produce unsatisfactory retrieval performance on colonoscopic datasets due to the large domain gap. Worsely, these solutions typically learn unimodal modal representations on the basis of visual samples, which fails to explore complementary information from other different modalities. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Deep Multimodal Collaborative Learning framework named DMCL for polyp re-identification, which can effectively encourage multimodal knowledge collaboration and reinforce generalization capability in medical scenarios. On the basis of it, a dynamic multimodal feature fusion strategy is introduced to leverage the optimized visual-text representations for multimodal fusion via end-to-end training. Experiments on the standard benchmarks show the benefits of the multimodal setting over state-of-the-art unimodal ReID models, especially when combined with the collaborative multimodal fusion strategy.

  As large language models (LLMs) evolve, their integration with 3D spatial data (3D-LLMs) has seen rapid progress, offering unprecedented capabilities for understanding and interacting with physical spaces. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of the methodologies enabling LLMs to process, understand, and generate 3D data. Highlighting the unique advantages of LLMs, such as in-context learning, step-by-step reasoning, open-vocabulary capabilities, and extensive world knowledge, we underscore their potential to significantly advance spatial comprehension and interaction within embodied Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems. Our investigation spans various 3D data representations, from point clouds to Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs). It examines their integration with LLMs for tasks such as 3D scene understanding, captioning, question-answering, and dialogue, as well as LLM-based agents for spatial reasoning, planning, and navigation. The paper also includes a brief review of other methods that integrate 3D and language. The meta-analysis presented in this paper reveals significant progress yet underscores the necessity for novel approaches to harness the full potential of 3D-LLMs. Hence, with this paper, we aim to chart a course for future research that explores and expands the capabilities of 3D-LLMs in understanding and interacting with the complex 3D world. To support this survey, we have established a project page where papers related to our topic are organized and listed:this https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Adapting language models (LMs) to new tasks via post-training carries the risk of degrading existing capabilities -- a phenomenon classically known as catastrophic forgetting. In this paper, toward identifying guidelines for mitigating this phenomenon, we systematically compare the forgetting patterns of two widely adopted post-training methods: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL). Our experiments reveal a consistent trend across LM families (Llama, Qwen) and tasks (instruction following, general knowledge, and arithmetic reasoning): RL leads to less forgetting than SFT while achieving comparable or higher target task performance. To investigate the cause for this difference, we consider a simplified setting in which the LM is modeled as a mixture of two distributions, one corresponding to prior knowledge and the other to the target task. We identify that the mode-seeking nature of RL, which stems from its use of on-policy data, enables keeping prior knowledge intact when learning the target task. We then verify this insight by demonstrating that the use on-policy data underlies the robustness of RL to forgetting in practical settings, as opposed to other algorithmic choices such as the KL regularization or advantage estimation. Lastly, as a practical implication, our results highlight the potential of mitigating forgetting using approximately on-policy data, which can be substantially more efficient to obtain than fully on-policy data.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Counterfactual inference provides a mathematical framework for reasoning about hypothetical outcomes under alternative interventions, bridging causal reasoning and predictive modeling. We present a counterfactual inference framework for individualized risk estimation and intervention analysis, illustrated through a clinical application to post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC) among patients with pre-existing heart failure (HF). Using longitudinal diagnosis, laboratory, and medication data from a large health-system cohort, we integrate regularized predictive modeling with counterfactual search to identify actionable pathways to PASC-related HF hospital admissions. The framework combines exact enumeration with optimization-based methods, including the Nearest Instance Counterfactual Explanations (NICE) and Multi-Objective Counterfactuals (MOC) algorithms, to efficiently explore high-dimensional intervention spaces. Applied to more than 2700 individuals with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and prior HF, the model achieved strong discriminative performance (AUROC: 0.88, 95% CI: 0.84-0.91) and generated interpretable, patient-specific counterfactuals that quantify how modifying comorbidity patterns or treatment factors could alter predicted outcomes. This work demonstrates how counterfactual reasoning can be formalized as an optimization problem over predictive functions, offering a rigorous, interpretable, and computationally efficient approach to personalized inference in complex biomedical systems.

  Value-based algorithms are a cornerstone of off-policy reinforcement learning due to their simplicity and training stability. However, their use has traditionally been restricted to discrete action spaces, as they rely on estimating Q-values for individual state-action pairs. In continuous action spaces, evaluating the Q-value over the entire action space becomes computationally infeasible. To address this, actor-critic methods are typically employed, where a critic is trained on off-policy data to estimate Q-values, and an actor is trained to maximize the critic's output. Despite their popularity, these methods often suffer from instability during training. In this work, we propose a purely value-based framework for continuous control that revisits structural maximization of Q-functions, introducing a set of key architectural and algorithmic choices to enable efficient and stable learning. We evaluate the proposed actor-free Q-learning approach on a range of standard simulation tasks, demonstrating performance and sample efficiency on par with state-of-the-art baselines, without the cost of learning a separate actor. Particularly, in environments with constrained action spaces, where the value functions are typically non-smooth, our method with structural maximization outperforms traditional actor-critic methods with gradient-based maximization. We have released our code atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce \textbf{BO4Mob}, a new benchmark framework for high-dimensional Bayesian Optimization (BO), driven by the challenge of origin-destination (OD) travel demand estimation in large urban road networks. Estimating OD travel demand from limited traffic sensor data is a difficult inverse optimization problem, particularly in real-world, large-scale transportation networks. This problem involves optimizing over high-dimensional continuous spaces where each objective evaluation is computationally expensive, stochastic, and non-differentiable. BO4Mob comprises five scenarios based on real-world San Jose, CA road networks, with input dimensions scaling up to 10,100. These scenarios utilize high-resolution, open-source traffic simulations that incorporate realistic nonlinear and stochastic dynamics. We demonstrate the benchmark's utility by evaluating five optimization methods: three state-of-the-art BO algorithms and two non-BO baselines. This benchmark is designed to support both the development of scalable optimization algorithms and their application for the design of data-driven urban mobility models, including high-resolution digital twins of metropolitan road networks.

  Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has become the mainstream technique for training LLM agents. However, RLVR highly depends on well-crafted task queries and corresponding ground-truth answers to provide accurate rewards, which requires massive human efforts and hinders the RL scaling processes, especially under agentic scenarios. Although a few recent works explore task synthesis methods, the difficulty of generated agentic tasks can hardly be controlled to provide effective RL training advantages. To achieve agentic RLVR with higher scalability, we explore self-play training for deep search agents, in which the learning LLM utilizes multi-turn search engine calling and acts simultaneously as both a task proposer and a problem solver. The task proposer aims to generate deep search queries with well-defined ground-truth answers and increasing task difficulty. The problem solver tries to handle the generated search queries and output the correct answer predictions. To ensure that each generated search query has accurate ground truth, we collect all the searching results from the proposer's trajectory as external knowledge, then conduct retrieval-augmentation generation (RAG) to test whether the proposed query can be correctly answered with all necessary search documents provided. In this search self-play (SSP) game, the proposer and the solver co-evolve their agent capabilities through both competition and cooperation. With substantial experimental results, we find that SSP can significantly improve search agents' performance uniformly on various benchmarks without any supervision under both from-scratch and continuous RL training setups.

  We present a simple, self-help online supervised finetuning (OSFT) paradigm for LLM reasoning. In this paradigm, the model generates its own responses and is immediately finetuned on this self-generated data. OSFT is a highly efficient training strategy for LLM reasoning, as it is reward-free and uses just one rollout by default. Experiment results show that OSFT achieves downstream performance on challenging mathematical reasoning tasks comparable to strong reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) methods such as GRPO. Our ablation study further demonstrates the efficiency and robustness of OSFT. The major mechanism of OSFT lies in facilitating the model's own existing preference (latent knowledge) learned from pretraining, which leads to reasoning ability improvement. We believe that OSFT offers an efficient and promising alternative to more complex, reward-based training paradigms. Our code is available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Iterative optimization is central to modern artificial intelligence (AI) and provides a crucial framework for understanding adaptive systems. This review provides a unified perspective on this subject, bridging classic theory with neural network training and biological learning. Although gradient-based methods, powered by the efficient but biologically implausible backpropagation (BP), dominate machine learning, their computational demands can hinder scalability in high-dimensional settings. In contrast, derivative-free or zeroth-order (ZO) optimization feature computationally lighter approaches that rely only on function evaluations and randomness. While generally less sample efficient, recent breakthroughs demonstrate that modern ZO methods can effectively approximate gradients and achieve performance competitive with BP in neural network models. This ZO paradigm is also particularly relevant for biology. Its core principles of random exploration (probing) and feedback-guided adaptation (reinforcing) parallel key mechanisms of biological learning, offering a mathematically principled perspective on how the brain learns. In this review, we begin by categorizing optimization approaches based on the order of derivative information they utilize, ranging from first-, second-, and higher-order gradient-based to ZO methods. We then explore how these methods are adapted to the unique challenges of neural network training and the resulting learning dynamics. Finally, we build upon these insights to view biological learning through an optimization lens, arguing that a ZO paradigm leverages the brain's intrinsic noise as a computational resource. This framework not only illuminates our understanding of natural intelligence but also holds vast implications for neuromorphic hardware, helping us design fast and energy-efficient AI systems that exploit intrinsic hardware noise.

  Leave-One-Out (LOO) provides an intuitive measure of feature importance but is computationally prohibitive. While Layer-Wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) offers a potentially efficient alternative, its axiomatic soundness in modern Transformers remains largely under-examined. In this work, we first show that the bilinear propagation rules used in recent advances of AttnLRP violate the implementation invariance axiom. We prove this analytically and confirm it empirically in linear attention layers. Second, we also revisit CP-LRP as a diagnostic baseline and find that bypassing relevance propagation through the softmax layer -- backpropagating relevance only through the value matrices -- significantly improves alignment with LOO, particularly in middle-to-late Transformer layers. Overall, our results suggest that (i) bilinear factorization sensitivity and (ii) softmax propagation error potentially jointly undermine LRP's ability to approximate LOO in Transformers.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Online topic models are unsupervised algorithms to identify latent topics in data streams that continuously evolve over time. Although these methods naturally align with real-world scenarios, they have received considerably less attention from the community compared to their offline counterparts, due to specific additional challenges. To tackle these issues, we present SB-SETM, an innovative model extending the Embedded Topic Model (ETM) to process data streams by merging models formed on successive partial document batches. To this end, SB-SETM (i) leverages a truncated stick-breaking construction for the topic-per-document distribution, enabling the model to automatically infer from the data the appropriate number of active topics at each timestep; and (ii) introduces a merging strategy for topic embeddings based on a continuous formulation of optimal transport adapted to the high dimensionality of the latent topic space. Numerical experiments show SB-SETM outperforming baselines on simulated scenarios. We extensively test it on a real-world corpus of news articles covering the Russian-Ukrainian war throughout 2022-2023.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Despite significant work on low-bit quantization-aware training (QAT), there is still a large accuracy gap between such techniques and native training. To address this, we introduce CAGE (Curvature-Aware Gradient Estimation), a new QAT method that augments the straight-through estimator (STE) gradient with a curvature-aware correction designed to counteract the loss increase induced by quantization. CAGE is derived from a multi-objective view of QAT that balances loss minimization with adherence to quantization constraints, yielding a principled correction term that depends on local curvature information. On the theoretical side, we introduce the notion of Pareto-optimal solutions for quantized optimization, and establish that CAGE yields strong convergence guarantees in the smooth non-convex setting. In terms of implementation, our approach is optimizer-agnostic, but we provide a highly-efficient implementation that leverages Adam statistics. When pre-training Llama-style models of up to 800M-parameters, CAGE recovers over 10% of the quantization-induced loss increase in the W4A4 regime over outlier-mitigation methods. These results indicate that curvature-aware gradient corrections can bridge the remaining performance gap beyond current outlier-handling methods.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Causal inference is essential for developing and evaluating medical interventions, yet real-world medical datasets are often difficult to access due to regulatory barriers. This makes synthetic data a potentially valuable asset that enables these medical analyses, along with the development of new inference methods themselves. Generative models can produce synthetic data that closely approximate real data distributions, yet existing methods do not consider the unique challenges that downstream causal inference tasks, and specifically those focused on treatments, pose. We establish a set of desiderata that synthetic data containing treatments should satisfy to maximise downstream utility: preservation of (i) the covariate distribution, (ii) the treatment assignment mechanism, and (iii) the outcome generation mechanism. Based on these desiderata, we propose a set of evaluation metrics to assess such synthetic data. Finally, we present STEAM: a novel method for generating Synthetic data for Treatment Effect Analysis in Medicine that mimics the data-generating process of data containing treatments and optimises for our desiderata. We empirically demonstrate that STEAM achieves state-of-the-art performance across our metrics as compared to existing generative models, particularly as the complexity of the true data-generating process increases.

  _Tung Nguyen, Tuan Pham, Troy Arcomano, Veerabhadra Kotamarthi, Ian Foster, Sandeep Madireddy, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Accurate weather forecasting across time scales is critical for anticipating and mitigating the impacts of climate change. Recent data-driven methods based on deep learning have achieved significant success in the medium range, but struggle at longer subseasonal-to-seasonal (S2S) horizons due to error accumulation in their autoregressive approach. In this work, we propose OmniCast, a scalable and skillful probabilistic model that unifies weather forecasting across timescales. OmniCast consists of two components: a VAE model that encodes raw weather data into a continuous, lower-dimensional latent space, and a diffusion-based transformer model that generates a sequence of future latent tokens given the initial conditioning tokens. During training, we mask random future tokens and train the transformer to estimate their distribution given conditioning and visible tokens using a per-token diffusion head. During inference, the transformer generates the full sequence of future tokens by iteratively unmasking random subsets of tokens. This joint sampling across space and time mitigates compounding errors from autoregressive approaches. The low-dimensional latent space enables modeling long sequences of future latent states, allowing the transformer to learn weather dynamics beyond initial conditions. OmniCast performs competitively with leading probabilistic methods at the medium-range timescale while being 10x to 20x faster, and achieves state-of-the-art performance at the subseasonal-to-seasonal scale across accuracy, physics-based, and probabilistic metrics. Furthermore, we demonstrate that OmniCast can generate stable rollouts up to 100 years ahead. Code and model checkpoints are available atthis https URL.

  _Chenbei Lu, Zaiwei Chen, Tongxin Li, Chenye Wu, Adam Wierman_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Traditional reinforcement learning (RL) assumes the agents make decisions based on Markov decision processes (MDPs) with one-step transition models. In many real-world applications, such as energy management and stock investment, agents can access multi-step predictions of future states, which provide additional advantages for decision making. However, multi-step predictions are inherently high-dimensional: naively embedding these predictions into an MDP leads to an exponential blow-up in state space and the curse of dimensionality. Moreover, existing RL theory provides few tools to analyze prediction-augmented MDPs, as it typically works on one-step transition kernels and cannot accommodate multi-step predictions with errors or partial action-coverage. We address these challenges with three key innovations: First, we propose the \emph{Bayesian value function} to characterize the optimal prediction-aware policy tractably. Second, we develop a novel \emph{Bellman-Jensen Gap} analysis on the Bayesian value function, which enables characterizing the value of imperfect predictions. Third, we introduce BOLA (Bayesian Offline Learning with Online Adaptation), a two-stage model-based RL algorithm that separates offline Bayesian value learning from lightweight online adaptation to real-time predictions. We prove that BOLA remains sample-efficient even under imperfect predictions. We validate our theory and algorithm on synthetic MDPs and a real-world wind energy storage control problem.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Casting complex inputs into tractable representations is a critical step across various fields. Diverse embedding models emerge from differences in architectures, loss functions, input modalities and datasets, each capturing unique aspects of the input. Multi-teacher distillation leverages this diversity to enrich representations but often remains tailored to specific tasks. In this paper, we introduce a task-agnostic framework based on a ``majority vote" objective function. We demonstrate that this function is bounded by the mutual information between student and teachers' embeddings, leading to a task-agnostic distillation loss that eliminates dependence on task-specific labels or prior knowledge. Our evaluations across text, vision models, and molecular modeling show that our method effectively leverages teacher diversity, resulting in representations enabling better performance for a wide range of downstream tasks such as classification, clustering, or regression. Additionally, we train and release state-of-the-art embedding models, enhancing downstream performance in various modalities.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The reasoning large language model (RLLM) has been proven competitive in solving complex reasoning tasks such as mathematics, coding, compared to general LLM. However, the serving performance and behavior of RLLM remains unexplored, which may undermine the deployment and utilization of RLLM in real-world scenario. To close this gap, in this paper, we conduct a comprehensive study of RLLM service. We first perform a pilot study on comparing the serving performance between RLLM and traditional LLM and reveal that there are several distinct differences regarding serving behavior: (1) significant memory usage and fluctuations; (2) straggler requests; (3) adaptive running time; (4) domain preference. Then we further investigate whether existing inference optimization techniques are valid for RLLM. Our main takeaways are that model quantization methods and speculative decoding can improve service system efficiency with small compromise to RLLM accuracy, while prefix caching, KV cache quantization may even degrade accuracy or serving performance for small RLLM. Lastly, we conduct evaluation under real world workload modeled by Gamma distribution to verify our findings. Empirical results of real world workload evaluation across different dataset are aligned with our main findings regarding RLLM serving. We hope our work can provide the research community and industry with insights to advance RLLM inference serving.

  The vast majority of cardiovascular diseases may be preventable if early signs and risk factors are detected. Cardiovascular monitoring with body-worn sensor devices like sensor patches allows for the detection of such signs while preserving the freedom and comfort of patients. However, the analysis of the sensor data must be robust, reliable, efficient, and highly accurate. Deep learning methods can automate data interpretation, reducing the workload of clinicians. In this work, we analyze the feasibility of applying deep learning models to the classification of synchronized electrocardiogram (ECG) and phonocardiogram (PCG) recordings on resource-constrained medical edge devices. We propose a convolutional neural network with early fusion of data to solve a binary classification problem. We train and validate our model on the synchronized ECG and PCG recordings from the Physionet Challenge 2016 dataset. Our approach reduces memory footprint and compute cost by three orders of magnitude compared to the state-of-the-art while maintaining competitive accuracy. We demonstrate the applicability of our proposed model on medical edge devices by analyzing energy consumption on a microcontroller and an experimental sensor device setup, confirming that on-device inference can be more energy-efficient than continuous data streaming.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We propose a flexible probabilistic model for predicting turn-taking patterns in group conversations based solely on individual characteristics and past speaking behavior. Many models of conversation dynamics cannot yield insights that generalize beyond a single group. Moreover, past works often aim to characterize speaking behavior through a universal formulation that may not be suitable for all groups. We thus develop a generalization of prior conversation models that predicts speaking turns among individuals in any group based on their individual characteristics, that is, personality traits, and prior speaking behavior. Importantly, our approach provides the novel ability to learn how speaking inclination varies based on when individuals last spoke. We apply our model to synthetic and real-world conversation data to verify the proposed approach and characterize real group interactions. Our results demonstrate that previous behavioral models may not always be realistic, motivating our data-driven yet theoretically grounded approach.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Water is essential for agricultural productivity. Assessing water shortages and reduced yield potential is a critical factor in decision-making for ensuring agricultural productivity and food security. Crop simulation models, which align with physical processes, offer intrinsic explainability but often perform poorly. Conversely, machine learning models for crop yield modeling are powerful and scalable, yet they commonly operate as black boxes and lack adherence to the physical principles of crop growth. This study bridges this gap by coupling the advantages of both worlds. We postulate that the crop yield is inherently defined by the water availability. Therefore, we formulate crop yield as a function of temporal water scarcity and predict both the crop drought stress and the sensitivity to water scarcity at fine-scale resolution. Sequentially modeling the crop yield response to water enables accurate yield prediction. To enforce physical consistency, a novel physics-informed loss function is proposed. We leverage multispectral satellite imagery, meteorological data, and fine-scale yield data. Further, to account for the uncertainty within the model, we build upon a deep ensemble approach. Our method surpasses state-of-the-art models like LSTM and Transformers in crop yield prediction with a coefficient of determination ($R^2$-score) of up to 0.82 while offering high explainability. This method offers decision support for industry, policymakers, and farmers in building a more resilient agriculture in times of changing climate conditions.

  _Satwik Bhattamishra, Phil Blunsom, Varun Kanade_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We study the learnability of languages in the Next Symbol Prediction (NSP) setting, where a learner receives only positive examples from a language together with, for every prefix, (i) whether the prefix itself is in the language and (ii) which next symbols can lead to an accepting string. This setting has been used in prior works to empirically analyze neural sequence models, and additionally, we observe that efficient algorithms for the NSP setting can be used to learn the (truncated) support of language models. We formalize the setting so as to make it amenable to PAC-learning analysis. While the setting provides a much richer set of labels than the conventional classification setting, we show that learning concept classes such as DFAs and Boolean formulas remains computationally hard. The proof is via a construction that makes almost all additional labels uninformative, yielding a reduction from the conventional learning problem to learning with NSP labels. Under cryptographic assumptions, the reduction implies that the problem of learning DFAs is computationally hard in the NSP setting.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Identifying from observation data the governing differential equations of a physical dynamics is a key challenge in machine learning. Although approaches based on SINDy have shown great promise in this area, they still fail to address a whole class of real world problems where the data is sparsely sampled in time. In this article, we introduce Unrolled-SINDy, a simple methodology that leverages an unrolling scheme to improve the stability of explicit methods for PDE discovery. By decorrelating the numerical time step size from the sampling rate of the available data, our approach enables the recovery of equation parameters that would not be the minimizers of the original SINDy optimization problem due to large local truncation errors. Our method can be exploited either through an iterative closed-form approach or by a gradient descent scheme. Experiments show the versatility of our method. On both traditional SINDy and state-of-the-art noise-robust iNeuralSINDy, with different numerical schemes (Euler, RK4), our proposed unrolling scheme allows to tackle problems not accessible to non-unrolled methods.

  Graph neural networks (GNNs) are the predominant architecture for learning over graphs. As with any machine learning model, and important issue is the detection of adversarial attacks, where an adversary can change the output with a small perturbation of the input. Techniques for solving the adversarial robustness problem - determining whether such an attack exists - were originally developed for image classification, but there are variants for many other machine learning architectures. In the case of graph learning, the attack model usually considers changes to the graph structure in addition to or instead of the numerical features of the input, and the state of the art techniques in the area proceed via reduction to constraint solving, working on top of powerful solvers, e.g. for mixed integer programming. We show that it is possible to improve on the state of the art in structural robustness by replacing the use of powerful solvers by calls to efficient partial solvers, which run in polynomial time but may be incomplete. We evaluate our tool RobLight on a diverse set of GNN variants and datasets.

  This study presents the multilingual e-commerce search system developed by the DILAB team, which achieved 5th place on the final leaderboard with a competitive overall score of 0.8819, demonstrating stable and high-performing results across evaluation metrics. To address challenges in multilingual query-item understanding, we designed a multi-stage pipeline integrating data refinement, lightweight preprocessing, and adaptive modeling. The data refinement stage enhanced dataset consistency and category coverage, while language tagging and noise filtering improved input quality. In the modeling phase, multiple architectures and fine-tuning strategies were explored, and hyperparameters optimized using curated validation sets to balance performance across query-category (QC) and query-item (QI) tasks.

  Reliable navigation in safety-critical environments requires both accurate hazard perception and principled uncertainty handling to strengthen downstream safety handling. Despite the effectiveness of existing approaches, they assume perfect hazard detection capabilities, while uncertainty-aware perception approaches lack finite-sample guarantees. We present COPPOL, a conformal-driven perception-to-policy learning approach that integrates distribution-free, finite-sample safety guarantees into semantic segmentation, yielding calibrated hazard maps with rigorous bounds for missed detections. These maps induce risk-aware cost fields for downstream RL planning. Across two satellite-derived benchmarks, COPPOL increases hazard coverage (up to 6x) compared to comparative baselines, achieving near-complete detection of unsafe regions while reducing hazardous violations during navigation (up to approx 50%). More importantly, our approach remains robust to distributional shift, preserving both safety and efficiency.

  Ensuring the safe exploration of reinforcement learning (RL) agents is critical for deployment in real-world systems. Yet existing approaches struggle to strike the right balance: methods that tightly enforce safety often cripple task performance, while those that prioritize reward leave safety constraints frequently violated, producing diffuse cost landscapes that flatten gradients and stall policy improvement. We introduce the Uncertain Safety Critic (USC), a novel approach that integrates uncertainty-aware modulation and refinement into critic training. By concentrating conservatism in uncertain and costly regions while preserving sharp gradients in safe areas, USC enables policies to achieve effective reward-safety trade-offs. Extensive experiments show that USC reduces safety violations by approximately 40% while maintaining competitive or higher rewards, and reduces the error between predicted and true cost gradients by approximately 83%, breaking the prevailing trade-off between safety and performance and paving the way for scalable safe RL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Graph neural networks (GNNs) are powerful tools for learning from graph-structured data but often produce biased predictions with respect to sensitive attributes. Fairness-aware GNNs have been actively studied for mitigating biased predictions. However, no prior studies have evaluated fairness-aware GNNs on knowledge graphs, which are one of the most important graphs in many applications, such as recommender systems. Therefore, we introduce a benchmarking study on knowledge graphs. We generate new graphs from three knowledge graphs, YAGO, DBpedia, and Wikidata, that are significantly larger than the existing graph datasets used in fairness studies. We benchmark inprocessing and preprocessing methods in different GNN backbones and early stopping conditions. We find several key insights: (i) knowledge graphs show different trends from existing datasets; clearer trade-offs between prediction accuracy and fairness metrics than other graphs in fairness-aware GNNs, (ii) the performance is largely affected by not only fairness-aware GNN methods but also GNN backbones and early stopping conditions, and (iii) preprocessing methods often improve fairness metrics, while inprocessing methods improve prediction accuracy.

  Heterogeneous temporal graphs (HTGs) are ubiquitous data structures in the real world. Recently, to enhance representation learning on HTGs, numerous attention-based neural networks have been proposed. Despite these successes, existing methods rely on a decoupled temporal and spatial learning paradigm, which weakens interactions of spatio-temporal information and leads to a high model complexity. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel learning paradigm for HTGs called Simple and Efficient Heterogeneous Temporal Graph N}eural Network (SE-HTGNN). Specifically, we innovatively integrate temporal modeling into spatial learning via a novel dynamic attention mechanism, which retains attention information from historical graph snapshots to guide subsequent attention computation, thereby improving the overall discriminative representations learning of HTGs. Additionally, to comprehensively and adaptively understand HTGs, we leverage large language models to prompt SE-HTGNN, enabling the model to capture the implicit properties of node types as prior knowledge. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SE-HTGNN achieves up to 10x speed-up over the state-of-the-art and latest baseline while maintaining the best forecasting accuracy.

  Efficient sampling from high-dimensional and multimodal unnormalized probability distributions is a central challenge in many areas of science and machine learning. We focus on Boltzmann generators (BGs) that aim to sample the Boltzmann distribution of physical systems, such as molecules, at a given temperature. Classical variational approaches that minimize the reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence are prone to mode collapse, while annealing-based methods, commonly using geometric schedules, can suffer from mass teleportation and rely heavily on schedule tuning. We introduce Constrained Mass Transport (CMT), a variational framework that generates intermediate distributions under constraints on both the KL divergence and the entropy decay between successive steps. These constraints enhance distributional overlap, mitigate mass teleportation, and counteract premature convergence. Across standard BG benchmarks and the here introduced ELIL tetrapeptide, the largest system studied to date without access to samples from molecular dynamics, CMT consistently surpasses state-of-the-art variational methods, achieving more than 2.5x higher effective sample size while avoiding mode collapse.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Weakly supervised learning often operates with coarse aggregate signals rather than instance labels. We study a setting where each training example is an $n$-tuple containing exactly m positives, while only the count m per tuple is observed. This NTMP (N-tuple with M positives) supervision arises in, e.g., image classification with region proposals and multi-instance measurements. We show that tuple counts admit a trainable unbiased risk estimator (URE) by linking the tuple-generation process to latent instance marginals. Starting from fixed (n,m), we derive a closed-form URE and extend it to variable tuple sizes, variable counts, and their combination. Identification holds whenever the effective mixing rate is separated from the class prior. We establish generalization bounds via Rademacher complexity and prove statistical consistency with standard rates under mild regularity assumptions. To improve finite-sample stability, we introduce simple ReLU corrections to the URE that preserve asymptotic correctness. Across benchmarks converted to NTMP tasks, the approach consistently outperforms representative weak-supervision baselines and yields favorable precision-recall and F1 trade-offs. It remains robust under class-prior imbalance and across diverse tuple configurations, demonstrating that count-only supervision can be exploited effectively through a theoretically grounded and practically stable objective.

  This paper investigates the approximation properties of shallow neural networks with activation functions that are powers of exponential functions. It focuses on the dependence of the approximation rate on the dimension and the smoothness of the function being approximated within the Barron function space. We examine the approximation rates of ReLU$^{k}$ activation functions, proving that the optimal rate cannot be achieved under $\ell^{1}$-bounded coefficients or insufficient smoothness conditions.We also establish optimal approximation rates in various norms for functions in Barron spaces and Sobolev spaces, confirming the curse of dimensionality. Our results clarify the limits of shallow neural networks' approximation capabilities and offer insights into the selection of activation functions and network structures.

  Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become essential tools for learning on relational data, yet the performance of a single GNN is often limited by the heterogeneity present in real-world graphs. Recent advances in Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) frameworks demonstrate that assembling multiple, explicitly diverse GNNs with distinct generalization patterns can significantly improve performance. In this work, we present the first systematic empirical study of expert-level diversification techniques for GNN ensembles. Evaluating 20 diversification strategies -- including random re-initialization, hyperparameter tuning, architectural variation, directionality modeling, and training data partitioning -- across 14 node classification benchmarks, we construct and analyze over 200 ensemble variants. Our comprehensive evaluation examines each technique in terms of expert diversity, complementarity, and ensemble performance. We also uncovers mechanistic insights into training maximally diverse experts. These findings provide actionable guidance for expert training and the design of effective MoE frameworks on graph data.

  _Zhen Zhang, Bingsheng He_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Unsupervised Graph Domain Adaptation has become a promising paradigm for transferring knowledge from a fully labeled source graph to an unlabeled target graph. Existing graph domain adaptation models primarily focus on the closed-set setting, where the source and target domains share the same label spaces. However, this assumption might not be practical in the real-world scenarios, as the target domain might include classes that are not present in the source domain. In this paper, we investigate the problem of unsupervised open-set graph domain adaptation, where the goal is to not only correctly classify target nodes into the known classes, but also recognize previously unseen node types into the unknown class. Towards this end, we propose a novel framework called GraphRTA, which conducts reprogramming on both the graph and model sides. Specifically, we reprogram the graph by modifying target graph structure and node features, which facilitates better separation of known and unknown classes. Meanwhile, we also perform model reprogramming by pruning domain-specific parameters to reduce bias towards the source graph while preserving parameters that capture transferable patterns across graphs. Additionally, we extend the classifier with an extra dimension for the unknown class, thus eliminating the need of manually specified threshold in open-set recognition. Comprehensive experiments on several public datasets demonstrate that our proposed model can achieve satisfied performance compared with recent state-of-the-art baselines. Our source codes and datasets are publicly available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The performance of a deep learning model on a specific task and dataset depends heavily on its neural architecture, motivating considerable efforts to rapidly and accurately identify architectures suited to the target task and dataset. To achieve this, researchers use machine learning models-typically neural architecture encoders-to predict the performance of a neural architecture. Many state-of-the-art encoders aim to capture information flow within a neural architecture, which reflects how information moves through the forward pass and backpropagation, via a specialized model structure. However, due to their complicated structures, these flow-based encoders are significantly slower to process neural architectures compared to simpler encoders, presenting a notable practical challenge. To address this, we propose FGP, a novel pre-training method for neural architecture encoding that trains an encoder to capture the information flow without requiring specialized model structures. FGP trains an encoder to reconstruct a flow surrogate, our proposed representation of the neural architecture's information flow. Our experiments show that FGP boosts encoder performance by up to 106% in Precision-1%, compared to the same encoder trained solely with supervised learning.

  Uncertainty quantification (UQ) is essential for deploying deep neural networks in safety-critical settings. Although methods like Deep Ensembles achieve strong UQ performance, their high computational and memory costs hinder scalability to large models. We introduce Hydra Ensembles, an efficient transformer-based ensemble that prunes attention heads to create diverse members and merges them via a new multi-head attention with grouped fully-connected layers. This yields a compact model with inference speed close to a single network, matching or surpassing Deep Ensembles in UQ performance without retraining from scratch. We also provide an in-depth analysis of pruning, showing that naive approaches can harm calibration, whereas Hydra Ensembles preserves robust uncertainty. Experiments on image and text classification tasks, with various architectures, show consistent gains over Deep Ensembles. Remarkably, in zero-shot classification on ImageNet-1k, our approach surpasses state of the art methods, even without requiring additional training.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The classical policy gradient method is the theoretical and conceptual foundation of modern policy-based reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms. Most rigorous analyses of such methods, particularly those establishing convergence guarantees, assume a discount factor $\gamma < 1$. In contrast, however, a recent line of work on policy-based RL for large language models uses the undiscounted total-reward setting with $\gamma = 1$, rendering much of the existing theory inapplicable. In this paper, we provide analyses of the policy gradient method for undiscounted expected total-reward infinite-horizon MDPs based on two key insights: (i) the classification of the MDP states into recurrent and transient states is invariant over the set of policies that assign strictly positive probability to every action (as is typical in deep RL models employing a softmax output layer) and (ii) the classical state visitation measure (which may be ill-defined when $\gamma = 1$) can be replaced with a new object that we call the transient visitation measure.

  We introduce Time-Conditioned Contraction Matching (TCCM), a novel method for semi-supervised anomaly detection in tabular data. TCCM is inspired by flow matching, a recent generative modeling framework that learns velocity fields between probability distributions and has shown strong performance compared to diffusion models and generative adversarial networks. Instead of directly applying flow matching as originally formulated, TCCM builds on its core idea -- learning velocity fields between distributions -- but simplifies the framework by predicting a time-conditioned contraction vector toward a fixed target (the origin) at each sampled time step. This design offers three key advantages: (1) a lightweight and scalable training objective that removes the need for solving ordinary differential equations during training and inference; (2) an efficient scoring strategy called one time-step deviation, which quantifies deviation from expected contraction behavior in a single forward pass, addressing the inference bottleneck of existing continuous-time models such as DTE (a diffusion-based model with leading anomaly detection accuracy but heavy inference cost); and (3) explainability and provable robustness, as the learned velocity field operates directly in input space, making the anomaly score inherently feature-wise attributable; moreover, the score function is Lipschitz-continuous with respect to the input, providing theoretical guarantees under small perturbations. Extensive experiments on the ADBench benchmark show that TCCM strikes a favorable balance between detection accuracy and inference cost, outperforming state-of-the-art methods -- especially on high-dimensional and large-scale datasets.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We investigate how embedding dimension affects the emergence of an internal "world model" in a transformer trained with reinforcement learning to perform bubble-sort-style adjacent swaps. Models achieve high accuracy even with very small embedding dimensions, but larger dimensions yield more faithful, consistent, and robust internal representations. In particular, higher embedding dimensions strengthen the formation of structured internal representation and lead to better interpretability. After hundreds of experiments, we observe two consistent mechanisms: (1) the last row of the attention weight matrix monotonically encodes the global ordering of tokens; and (2) the selected transposition aligns with the largest adjacent difference of these encoded values. Our results provide quantitative evidence that transformers build structured internal world models and that model size improves representation quality in addition to end performance. We release our metrics and analyses, which can be used to probe similar algorithmic tasks.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In millimeter wave (mmWave) communications, beam alignment and tracking are crucial to combat the significant path loss. As scanning the entire directional space is inefficient, designing an efficient and robust method to identify the optimal beam directions is essential. Since traditional bandit algorithms require a long time horizon to converge under large beam spaces, many existing works propose efficient bandit algorithms for beam alignment by relying on unimodality or multimodality assumptions on the reward function's structure. However, such assumptions often do not hold (or cannot be strictly satisfied) in practice, which causes such algorithms to converge to choosing suboptimal beams.In this work, we propose two physics-informed bandit algorithms \textit{pretc} and \textit{prgreedy} that exploit the sparse multipath property of mmWave channels - a generic but realistic assumption - which is connected to the Phase Retrieval Bandit problem. Our algorithms treat the parameters of each path as black boxes and maintain optimal estimates of them based on sampled historical rewards. \textit{pretc} starts with a random exploration phase and then commits to the optimal beam under the estimated reward function. \textit{prgreedy} performs such estimation in an online manner and chooses the best beam under current estimates. Our algorithms can also be easily adapted to beam tracking in the mobile setting. Through experiments using both the synthetic DeepMIMO dataset and the real-world DeepSense6G dataset, we demonstrate that both algorithms outperform existing approaches in a wide range of scenarios across diverse channel environments, showing their generalizability and robustness.

  This paper is concerned with online time series forecasting, where unknown distribution shifts occur over time, i.e., latent variables influence the mapping from historical to future observations. To develop an automated way of online time series forecasting, we propose a Theoretical framework for Online Time-series forecasting (TOT in short) with theoretical guarantees. Specifically, we prove that supplying a forecaster with latent variables tightens the Bayes risk, the benefit endures under estimation uncertainty of latent variables and grows as the latent variables achieve a more precise identifiability. To better introduce latent variables into online forecasting algorithms, we further propose to identify latent variables with minimal adjacent observations. Based on these results, we devise a model-agnostic blueprint by employing a temporal decoder to match the distribution of observed variables and two independent noise estimators to model the causal inference of latent variables and mixing procedures of observed variables, respectively. Experiment results on synthetic data support our theoretical claims. Moreover, plug-in implementations built on several baselines yield general improvement across multiple benchmarks, highlighting the effectiveness in real-world applications.

  Multi-Task Learning (MTL) enables a single model to learn multiple tasks simultaneously, leveraging knowledge transfer among tasks for enhanced generalization, and has been widely applied across various domains. However, task imbalance remains a major challenge in MTL. Although balancing the convergence speeds of different tasks is an effective approach to address this issue, it is highly challenging to accurately characterize the training dynamics and convergence speeds of multiple tasks within the complex MTL system. To this end, we attempt to analyze the training dynamics in MTL by leveraging Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) theory and propose a new MTL method, NTKMTL. Specifically, we introduce an extended NTK matrix for MTL and adopt spectral analysis to balance the convergence speeds of multiple tasks, thereby mitigating task imbalance. Based on the approximation via shared representation, we further propose NTKMTL-SR, achieving training efficiency while maintaining competitive performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our methods achieve state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of benchmarks, including both multi-task supervised learning and multi-task reinforcement learning.

  Scaling the number of parameters and the size of training data has proven to be an effective strategy for improving large language model (LLM) performance. Yet, as these models grow increasingly powerful and widely deployed, the cost of inference has become a pressing concern. Despite its importance, the trade-off between model accuracy and inference efficiency remains underexplored. In this work, we examine how key architectural factors, hidden size, the allocation of parameters between MLP and attention (mlp-to-attention ratio), and grouped-query attention (GQA), influence both inference cost and accuracy. We introduce a conditional scaling law that augments the Chinchilla framework with architectural information, along with a search framework for identifying architectures that are simultaneously inference-efficient and accurate. To validate our approach, we train more than 200 models spanning 80M to 3B parameters and 8B to 100B training tokens, and fit the proposed conditional scaling law. Our results show that the conditional scaling law reliably predicts optimal architectural choices and that the resulting models outperform existing open-source baselines. Under the same training budget, optimized architectures achieve up to 2.1% higher accuracy and 42% greater inference throughput compared to LLaMA-3.2.

  Multi-modal entity alignment (MMEA) aims to identify equivalent entities across heterogeneous multi-modal knowledge graphs (MMKGs), where each entity is described by attributes from various modalities. Existing methods typically assume that both intra-entity and inter-graph correspondences are faultless, which is often violated in real-world MMKGs due to the reliance on expert annotations. In this paper, we reveal and study a highly practical yet under-explored problem in MMEA, termed Dual-level Noisy Correspondence (DNC). DNC refers to misalignments in both intra-entity (entity-attribute) and inter-graph (entity-entity and attribute-attribute) correspondences. To address the DNC problem, we propose a robust MMEA framework termed RULE. RULE first estimates the reliability of both intra-entity and inter-graph correspondences via a dedicated two-fold principle. Leveraging the estimated reliabilities, RULE mitigates the negative impact of intra-entity noise during attribute fusion and prevents overfitting to noisy inter-graph correspondences during inter-graph discrepancy elimination. Beyond the training-time designs, RULE further incorporates a correspondence reasoning module that uncovers the underlying attribute-attribute connection across graphs, guaranteeing more accurate equivalent entity identification. Extensive experiments on five benchmarks verify the effectiveness of our method against the DNC compared with seven state-of-the-artthis http URLcode is available at \href{this https URL}{XLearning-SCU/RULE}

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) using zeroth-order (ZO) optimization has emerged as a promising alternative to traditional gradient-based methods due to its reduced memory footprint requirement. However, existing ZO methods suffer from high variance in gradient estimation, leading to slow convergence and suboptimal performance on large-scale models. In this work, we propose P-GAP, a fast LLM fine-tuning approach through zeroth-order optimization with Projected Gradient-Aligned Perturbations. Specifically, we first estimate a low-dimensional gradient space and then align perturbations in projected gradients' direction within the space. This approach enables reduced the number of perturbed parameters and decreased variance, therefore accelerated convergence for LLM fine-tuning. Experiments on LLMs show that P-GAP consistently surpasses the baselines, achieving up to 6% increase in accuracy on classification tasks and up to 12% higher accuracy on generation tasks, with up to about 81% less training iterations and 70% less GPU hours. These results demonstrate that P-GAP enables fast, scalable, and resource-efficient ZO LLM fine-tuning.

  This paper investigates underwater cooperative target detection using autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), with a focus on the critical trade-off between cooperation efficiency and communication covertness. To tackle this challenge, we first formulate a joint trajectory and power control optimization problem, and then present an innovative hierarchical action management framework to solve it. According to the hierarchical formulation, at the macro level, the master AUV models the agent selection process as a Markov decision process and deploys the proximal policy optimization algorithm for strategic task allocation. At the micro level, each selected agent's decentralized decision-making is modeled as a partially observable Markov decision process, and a multi-agent proximal policy optimization algorithm is used to dynamically adjust its trajectory and transmission power based on its local observations. Under the centralized training and decentralized execution paradigm, our target detection framework enables adaptive covert cooperation while satisfying both energy and mobility constraints. By comprehensively modeling the considered system, the involved signals and tasks, as well as energy consumption, theoretical insights and practical solutions for the efficient and secure operation of multiple AUVs are provided, offering significant implications for the execution of underwater covert communication tasks.

  Large language models (LLMs) excel at generating fluent text, but their internal reasoning remains opaque and difficult to control. Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) make hidden activations more interpretable by exposing latent features that often align with human concepts. Yet, these features are fragile and passive, offering no mechanism for systematic reasoning or model control. To address this, we introduce ActivationReasoning (AR), a framework that embeds explicit logical reasoning into the latent space of LLMs. It proceeds in three stages: (1) Finding latent representations, first latent concept representations are identified (e.g., via SAEs) and organized into a dictionary; (2) Activating propositions, at inference time AR detects activating concepts and maps them to logical propositions; and (3)Logical reasoning, applying logical rules over these propositions to infer higher-order structures, compose new concepts, and steer model behavior. We evaluate AR on multi-hop reasoning (PrOntoQA), abstraction and robustness to indirect concept cues (Rail2Country), reasoning over natural and diverse language (ProverQA), and context-sensitive safety (BeaverTails). Across all tasks, AR scales robustly with reasoning complexity, generalizes to abstract and context-sensitive tasks, and transfers across model backbones. These results demonstrate that grounding logical structure in latent activations not only improves transparency but also enables structured reasoning, reliable control, and alignment with desired behaviors, providing a path toward more reliable and auditable AI.

  _Sudarshan Babu, Phillip Lo, Xiao Zhang, Aadi Srivastava, Ali Davariashtiyani, Jason Perera, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce HyperDiffusionFields (HyDiF), a framework that models 3D molecular conformers as continuous fields rather than discrete atomic coordinates or graphs. At the core of our approach is the Molecular Directional Field (MDF), a vector field that maps any point in space to the direction of the nearest atom of a particular type. We represent MDFs using molecule-specific neural implicit fields, which we call Molecular Neural Fields (MNFs). To enable learning across molecules and facilitate generalization, we adopt an approach where a shared hypernetwork, conditioned on a molecule, generates the weights of the given molecule's MNF. To endow the model with generative capabilities, we train the hypernetwork as a denoising diffusion model, enabling sampling in the function space of molecular fields. Our design naturally extends to a masked diffusion mechanism to support structure-conditioned generation tasks, such as molecular inpainting, by selectively noising regions of the field. Beyond generation, the localized and continuous nature of MDFs enables spatially fine-grained feature extraction for molecular property prediction, something not easily achievable with graph or point cloud based methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our approach scales to larger biomolecules, illustrating a promising direction for field-based molecular modeling.

  Rectified Flows learn ODE vector fields whose trajectories are straight between source and target distributions, enabling near one-step inference. We show that this straight-path objective conceals fundamental failure modes: under deterministic training, low gradient variance drives memorization of arbitrary training pairings, even when interpolant lines between pairs intersect. To analyze this mechanism, we study Gaussian-to-Gaussian transport and use the loss gradient variance across stochastic and deterministic regimes to characterize which vector fields optimization favors in each setting. We then show that, in a setting where all interpolating lines intersect, applying Rectified Flow yields the same specific pairings at inference as during training. More generally, we prove that a memorizing vector field exists even when training interpolants intersect, and that optimizing the straight-path objective converges to this ill-defined field. At inference, deterministic integration reproduces the exact training pairings. We validate our findings empirically on the CelebA dataset, confirming that deterministic interpolants induce memorization, while the injection of small noise restores generalization.

  _Jiawei Zhang, Andrew Estornell, David D. Baek, Bo Li, Xiaojun Xu_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong but shallow alignment: they directly refuse harmful queries when a refusal is expected at the very start of an assistant turn, yet this protection collapses once a harmful continuation is underway (either through the adversarial attacks or via harmful assistant-prefill attacks). This raises a fundamental question: Can the innate shallow alignment in LLMs be unlocked to ensure safety at arbitrary generation depths? To achieve this goal, we propose Any-Depth Alignment (ADA), an effective inference-time defense with negligible overhead. ADA is built based on our observation that alignment is concentrated in the assistant header tokens through repeated use in shallow-refusal training, and these tokens possess the model's strong alignment priors. By reintroducing these tokens mid-stream, ADA induces the model to reassess harmfulness and recover refusals at any point in generation. Across diverse open-source model families (Llama, Gemma, Mistral, Qwen, DeepSeek, and gpt-oss), ADA achieves robust safety performance without requiring any changes to the base model's parameters. It secures a near-100% refusal rate against challenging adversarial prefill attacks ranging from dozens to thousands of tokens. Furthermore, ADA reduces the average success rate of prominent adversarial prompt attacks (such as GCG, AutoDAN, PAIR, and TAP) to below 3%. This is all accomplished while preserving utility on benign tasks with minimal over-refusal. ADA maintains this resilience even after the base model undergoes subsequent instruction tuning (benign or adversarial).

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Modelling the complex spatiotemporal patterns of large-scale brain dynamics is crucial for neuroscience, but traditional methods fail to capture the rich structure in modalities such as magnetoencephalography (MEG). Recent advances in deep learning have enabled significant progress in other domains, such as language and vision, by using foundation models at scale. Here, we introduce MEG-GPT, a transformer based foundation model that uses time-attention and next time-point prediction. To facilitate this, we also introduce a novel data-driven tokeniser for continuous MEG data, which preserves the high temporal resolution of continuous MEG signals without lossy transformations. We trained MEG-GPT on tokenised brain region time-courses extracted from a large-scale MEG dataset (N=612, eyes-closed rest, Cam-CAN data), and show that the learnt model can generate data with realistic spatio-spectral properties, including transient events and population variability. Critically, it performs well in downstream decoding tasks, improving downstream supervised prediction task, showing improved zero-shot generalisation across sessions (improving accuracy from 0.54 to 0.59) and subjects (improving accuracy from 0.41 to 0.49) compared to a baseline methods. Furthermore, we show the model can be efficiently fine-tuned on a smaller labelled dataset to boost performance in cross-subject decoding scenarios. This work establishes a powerful foundation model for electrophysiological data, paving the way for applications in computational neuroscience and neural decoding.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Machine learning (ML) holds great potential to advance anomaly detection (AD) in chemical processes. However, the development of ML-based methods is hindered by the lack of openly available experimental data. To address this gap, we have set up a laboratory-scale batch distillation plant and operated it to generate an extensive experimental database, covering fault-free experiments and experiments in which anomalies were intentionally induced, for training advanced ML-based AD methods. In total, 119 experiments were conducted across a wide range of operating conditions and mixtures. Most experiments containing anomalies were paired with a corresponding fault-free one. The database that we provide here includes time-series data from numerous sensors and actuators, along with estimates of measurement uncertainty. In addition, unconventional data sources -- such as concentration profiles obtained via online benchtop NMR spectroscopy and video and audio recordings -- are provided. Extensive metadata and expert annotations of all experiments are included. The anomaly annotations are based on an ontology developed in this work. The data are organized in a structured database and made freely available viathis http URL. This new database paves the way for the development of advanced ML-based AD methods. As it includes information on the causes of anomalies, it further enables the development of interpretable and explainable ML approaches, as well as methods for anomaly mitigation.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Flow-based generative models have shown remarkable success in text-to-image generation, yet fine-tuning them with intermediate feedback remains challenging, especially for continuous-time flow matching models. Most existing approaches solely learn from outcome rewards, struggling with the credit assignment problem. Alternative methods that attempt to learn a critic via direct regression on cumulative rewards often face training instabilities and model collapse in online settings. We present AC-Flow, a robust actor-critic framework that addresses these challenges through three key innovations: (1) reward shaping that provides well-normalized learning signals to enable stable intermediate value learning and gradient control, (2) a novel dual-stability mechanism that combines advantage clipping to prevent destructive policy updates with a warm-up phase that allows the critic to mature before influencing the actor, and (3) a scalable generalized critic weighting scheme that extends traditional reward-weighted methods while preserving model diversity through Wasserstein regularization. Through extensive experiments on Stable Diffusion 3, we demonstrate that AC-Flow achieves state-of-the-art performance in text-to-image alignment tasks and generalization to unseen human preference models. Our results demonstrate that even with a computationally efficient critic model, we can robustly finetune flow models without compromising generative quality, diversity, or stability.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Developing autonomous vehicles (AVs) requires not only safety and efficiency, but also realistic, human-like behaviors that are socially aware and predictable. Achieving this requires sim agent policies that are human-like, fast, and scalable in multi-agent settings. Recent progress in imitation learning with large diffusion-based or tokenized models has shown that behaviors can be captured directly from human driving data, producing realistic policies. However, these models are computationally expensive, slow during inference, and struggle to adapt in reactive, closed-loop scenarios. In contrast, self-play reinforcement learning (RL) scales efficiently and naturally captures multi-agent interactions, but it often relies on heuristics and reward shaping, and the resulting policies can diverge from human norms. We propose SPACeR, a framework that leverages a pretrained tokenized autoregressive motion model as a centralized reference policy to guide decentralized self-play. The reference model provides likelihood rewards and KL divergence, anchoring policies to the human driving distribution while preserving RL scalability. Evaluated on the Waymo Sim Agents Challenge, our method achieves competitive performance with imitation-learned policies while being up to 10x faster at inference and 50x smaller in parameter size than large generative models. In addition, we demonstrate in closed-loop ego planning evaluation tasks that our sim agents can effectively measure planner quality with fast and scalable traffic simulation, establishing a new paradigm for testing autonomous driving policies.

  _Jiajun Fan, Tong Wei, Chaoran Cheng, Yuxin Chen, Ge Liu_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Balancing exploration and exploitation during reinforcement learning fine-tuning of generative models presents a critical challenge, as existing approaches rely on fixed divergence regularization that creates an inherent dilemma: strong regularization preserves model capabilities but limits reward optimization, while weak regularization enables greater alignment but risks instability or reward hacking. We introduce Adaptive Divergence Regularized Policy Optimization (ADRPO), which automatically adjusts regularization strength based on advantage estimates-reducing regularization for high-value samples while applying stronger regularization to poor samples, enabling policies to navigate between exploration and aggressive exploitation according to data quality. Our implementation with Wasserstein-2 regularization for flow matching generative models achieves remarkable results on text-to-image generation, achieving better semantic alignment and diversity than offline methods like DPO and online methods with fixed regularization like ORW-CFM-W2. ADRPO enables a 2B parameter SD3 model to surpass much larger models with 4.8B and 12B parameters in attribute binding, semantic consistency, artistic style transfer, and compositional control while maintaining generation diversity. ADRPO generalizes to KL-regularized fine-tuning of both text-only LLMs and multi-modal reasoning models, enhancing existing online RL methods like GRPO. In LLM fine-tuning, ADRPO demonstrates an emergent ability to escape local optima through active exploration, while in multi-modal audio reasoning, it outperforms GRPO through superior step-by-step reasoning, enabling a 7B model to outperform substantially larger commercial models including Gemini 2.5 Pro and GPT-4o Audio, offering an effective plug-and-play solution to the exploration-exploitation challenge across diverse generative architectures and modalities.

  _Jay Phil Yoo, Kazuma Kobayashi, Souvik Chakraborty, Syed Bahauddin Alam_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Forecasting unobservable physical quantities from sparse, cross-domain sensor data is a central unsolved problem in scientific machine learning. Existing neural operators and large-scale forecasters rely on dense, co-located input-output fields and short temporal contexts, assumptions that fail in real-world systems where sensing and prediction occur on distinct physical manifolds and over long timescales. We introduce the Spatio-Temporal Operator Network (STONe), a non-autoregressive neural operator that learns a stable functional mapping between heterogeneous domains. By directly inferring high-altitude radiation dose fields from sparse ground-based neutron measurements, STONe demonstrates that operator learning can generalize beyond shared-domain settings. It defines a nonlinear operator between sensor and target manifolds that remains stable over long forecasting horizons without iterative recurrence. This challenges the conventional view that operator learning requires domain alignment or autoregressive propagation. Trained on 23 years of global neutron data, STONe achieves accurate 180-day forecasts with millisecond inference latency. The framework establishes a general principle for cross-domain operator inference, enabling real-time prediction of complex spatiotemporal fields in physics, climate, and energy systems.

  _Francis Ndikum Nji, Vandana Janeja, Jianwu Wang_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Deep subspace clustering models are vital for applications such as snowmelt detection, sea ice tracking, crop health monitoring, infectious disease modeling, network load prediction, and land-use planning, where multivariate spatiotemporal data exhibit complex temporal dependencies and reside on multiple nonlinear manifolds beyond the capability of traditional clustering methods. These models project data into a latent space where samples lie in linear subspaces and exploit the self-expressiveness property to uncover intrinsic relationships. Despite their success, existing methods face major limitations: they use shallow autoencoders that ignore clustering errors, emphasize global features while neglecting local structure, fail to model long-range dependencies and positional information, and are rarely applied to 4D spatiotemporal data. To address these issues, we propose A-DATSC (Attention-Guided Deep Adversarial Temporal Subspace Clustering), a model combining a deep subspace clustering generator and a quality-verifying discriminator. The generator, inspired by U-Net, preserves spatial and temporal integrity through stacked TimeDistributed ConvLSTM2D layers, reducing parameters and enhancing generalization. A graph attention transformer based self-expressive network captures local spatial relationships, global dependencies, and both short- and long-range correlations. Experiments on three real-world multivariate spatiotemporal datasets show that A-DATSC achieves substantially superior clustering performance compared to state-of-the-art deep subspace clustering models.

  _Jaihoon Kim, Rajarshi Saha, Minhyuk Sung, Youngsuk Park_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Flow Matching (FM) underpins many state-of-the-art generative models, yet recent results indicate that Transition Matching (TM) can achieve higher quality with fewer sampling steps. This work answers the question of when and why TM outperforms FM. First, when the target is a unimodal Gaussian distribution, we prove that TM attains strictly lower KL divergence than FM for finite number of steps. The improvement arises from stochastic difference latent updates in TM, which preserve target covariance that deterministic FM underestimates. We then characterize convergence rates, showing that TM achieves faster convergence than FM under a fixed compute budget, establishing its advantage in the unimodal Gaussian setting. Second, we extend the analysis to Gaussian mixtures and identify local-unimodality regimes in which the sampling dynamics approximate the unimodal case, where TM can outperform FM. The approximation error decreases as the minimal distance between component means increases, highlighting that TM is favored when the modes are well separated. However, when the target variance approaches zero, each TM update converges to the FM update, and the performance advantage of TM diminishes. In summary, we show that TM outperforms FM when the target distribution has well-separated modes and non-negligible variances. We validate our theoretical results with controlled experiments on Gaussian distributions, and extend the comparison to real-world applications in image and video generation.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Detecting regime shifts in chaotic time series is hard because observation-space signals are entangled with intrinsic variability. We propose Parameter--Space Changepoint Detection (Param--CPD), a two--stage framework that first amortizes Bayesian inference of governing parameters with a neural posterior estimator trained by simulation-based inference, and then applies a standard CPD algorithm to the resulting parameter trajectory. On Lorenz--63 with piecewise-constant parameters, Param--CPD improves F1, reduces localization error, and lowers false positives compared to observation--space baselines. We further verify identifiability and calibration of the inferred posteriors on stationary trajectories, explaining why parameter space offers a cleaner detection signal. Robustness analyses over tolerance, window length, and noise indicate consistent gains. Our results show that operating in a physically interpretable parameter space enables accurate and interpretable changepoint detection in nonlinear dynamical systems.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for advancing Large Language Models (LLMs), achieving remarkable performance in complex reasoning domains such as mathematics and code generation. However, current RL methods face a fundamental scalability bottleneck due to their heavy reliance on human-curated preference data or labeled datasets for reward modeling. To overcome this limitation, we explore RL on unlabeled data where models learn autonomously from continuous experience streams. The core challenge in this setting lies in reliable reward estimation without ground-truth supervision. Existing approaches like Test-Time RL address this through self-consistent consensus, but risk reinforcing incorrect pseudo-labels derived from majority voting. We introduce COMPASS (Composite Path and Answer Self-Scoring), a novel test-time reward mechanism that operates without external supervision. COMPASS integrates two complementary components: the Dual-Calibration Answer Reward (DCAR), which stabilizes training by establishing trustworthy pseudo-labels through confidence and credibility calibration, and the Decisive Path Reward (DPR), which directly optimizes the reasoning process quality beyond mere outcome supervision. By jointly reinforcing trustworthy consensus answers and highly decisive reasoning chains, the COMPASS systematically enhances the model's analytical capabilities. Extensive experiments show that COMPASS achieves significant and consistent performance gains across diverse reasoning tasks and model architectures, advancing a more scalable direction for LLMs to learn from continuous experience.

  _Shihao Ji, Zihui Song_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture enables the scaling of Large Language Models (LLMs) to trillions of parameters by activating a sparse subset of weights for each input, maintaining constant computational cost during inference. Concurrently, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as a dominant technique for parameter-efficiently fine-tuning LLMs on specialized tasks. In this work, we unify these two paradigms into a novel, end-to-end trainable framework named L-MoE: a Lightweight Mixture of LoRA Experts. L-MoE redefines MoE experts not as dense feed-forward networks, but as a collection of task-specialized, low-rank adapters. A lightweight gating network, trained jointly with the experts, learns to dynamically compose these LoRA adapters by computing a weighted average of their parameters for each input token. This composition is fully differentiable, allowing gradients from a standard auto-regressive language modeling objective to flow back through the entire architecture, simultaneously refining both the expert adapters and the routing strategy. This approach creates a highly parameter-efficient MoE model that is modular by design, allows for dynamic skill composition, and is trainable from end-to-end. We present the formal mathematical framework for L-MoE, detailing the differentiable routing mechanism and the joint optimization objective, thereby providing a new path toward building more efficient, scalable, and specialized language models.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success, yet their standard attention mechanism incurs quadratic computation and memory costs with respect to sequence length, posing a major bottleneck for long-context training. Prior work tackles this challenge along two directions: (1) kernel-level optimizations, which accelerate dense and sparse attention operators; and (2) module-level strategies, often referred to as distributed attention or context parallel training, which scale attention across multiple devices. However, systematic evaluation still remains limited: operator-level comparisons are often incomplete, while context parallel strategies are typically framework-specific, with unclear performance analysis across contexts. To address these gaps, we propose a unified benchmark that integrates representative attention kernels and context parallel mechanisms with a modular and extensible interface for evaluation. The benchmark evaluates methods along two critical dimensions: (1) attention mask patterns, which strongly affect efficiency, scalability, and usability, and (2) sequence length and distributed scale, which determine performance under extreme long-context training. Through comprehensive experiments on the cluster of up to 96 GPUs, our benchmark enables reproducible comparisons, highlights method-specific trade-offs, and provides practical guidance for designing and deploying attention mechanisms in long-context LLM training.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into real-world applications, raising concerns about privacy, security and the need to remove undesirable knowledge. Machine Unlearning has emerged as a promising solution, yet faces two key challenges: (1) practical unlearning needs are often continuous and heterogeneous, and (2) they involve decentralized, sensitive data with asymmetric access. These factors result in inter-domain and intra-domain interference, which further amplifies the dilemma of unbalanced forgetting and retaining performance. In response, we propose a federated unlearning approach for LLMs that is scalable and privacy preserving. Our method decouples unlearning and retention via task-specific adapter learning and employs a hierarchical merging strategy to mitigate conflicting objectives and enables robust, adaptable unlearning updates. Comprehensive experiments on benchmarks of WMDP, MUSE, and TOFU showed that our approach effectively handles heterogeneous unlearning requests while maintaining strong LLM utility compared with baseline methods.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Prognostic Health Management (PHM) systems monitor and predict equipment health. A key task is Remaining Useful Life (RUL) estimation, which predicts how long a component, such as a rolling element bearing, will operate before failure. Many RUL methods exist but often lack generalizability and robustness under changing operating conditions. This paper introduces CARLE, a hybrid AI framework that combines deep and shallow learning to address these challenges. CARLE uses Res-CNN and Res-LSTM blocks with multi-head attention and residual connections to capture spatial and temporal degradation patterns, and a Random Forest Regressor (RFR) for stable, accurate RUL prediction. A compact preprocessing pipeline applies Gaussian filtering for noise reduction and Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) for time-frequency feature extraction. We evaluate CARLE on the XJTU-SY and PRONOSTIA bearing datasets. Ablation studies measure each component's contribution, while noise and cross-domain experiments test robustness and generalization. Comparative results show CARLE outperforms several state-of-the-art methods, especially under dynamic conditions. Finally, we analyze model interpretability with LIME and SHAP to assess transparency and trustworthiness.

We prove contraction of the induced horizon dynamics under mild conditions and derive Lipschitz bounds for graph blocks, explaining the model's robustness.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Black-box Large Language Models (LLMs) provide practical and accessible alternatives to other machine learning methods, as they require minimal labeled data and machine learning expertise to develop solutions for various decision making problems. However, for applications that need operating with constraints on specific metrics (e.g., precision $\geq$ 95%), decision making with black-box LLMs remains unfavorable, due to their low numerical output cardinalities. This results in limited control over their operating points, preventing fine-grained adjustment of their decision making behavior. In this paper, we study using black-box LLMs as classifiers, focusing on efficiently improving their operational granularity without performance loss. Specifically, we first investigate the reasons behind their low-cardinality numerical outputs and show that they are biased towards generating rounded but informative verbalized probabilities. Then, we experiment with standard prompt engineering, uncertainty estimation and confidence elicitation techniques, and observe that they do not effectively improve operational granularity without sacrificing performance or increasing inference cost. Finally, we propose efficient approaches to significantly increase the number and diversity of available operating points. Our proposed approaches provide finer-grained operating points and achieve comparable to or better performance than the benchmark methods across 11 datasets and 3 LLMs.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vehicle GPS trajectories record how vehicles move over time, storing valuable travel semantics, including movement patterns and travel purposes. Learning travel semantics effectively and efficiently is crucial for real-world applications of trajectory data, which is hindered by two major challenges. First, travel purposes are tied to the functions of the roads and points-of-interest (POIs) involved in a trip. Such information is encoded in textual addresses and descriptions and introduces heavy computational burden to modeling. Second, real-world trajectories often contain redundant points, which harm both computational efficiency and trajectory embedding quality. To address these challenges, we propose TrajMamba, a novel approach for efficient and semantically rich vehicle trajectory learning. TrajMamba introduces a Traj-Mamba Encoder that captures movement patterns by jointly modeling both GPS and road perspectives of trajectories, enabling robust representations of continuous travel behaviors. It also incorporates a Travel Purpose-aware Pre-training procedure to integrate travel purposes into the learned embeddings without introducing extra overhead to embedding calculation. To reduce redundancy in trajectories, TrajMamba features a Knowledge Distillation Pre-training scheme to identify key trajectory points through a learnable mask generator and obtain effective compressed trajectory embeddings. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets and three downstream tasks show that TrajMamba outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both efficiency and accuracy.

  _Hoang-Son Nguyen, Xiao Fu_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Latent component identification from unknown nonlinear mixtures is a foundational challenge in machine learning, with applications in tasks such as disentangled representation learning and causal inference. Prior work in nonlinear independent component analysis (nICA) has shown that auxiliary signals -- such as weak supervision -- can support identifiability of conditionally independent latent components. More recent approaches explore structural assumptions, e.g., sparsity in the Jacobian of the mixing function, to relax such requirements. In this work, we introduce Diverse Influence Component Analysis (DICA), a framework that exploits the convex geometry of the mixing function's Jacobian. We propose a Jacobian Volume Maximization (J-VolMax) criterion, which enables latent component identification by encouraging diversity in their influence on the observed variables. Under reasonable conditions, this approach achieves identifiability without relying on auxiliary information, latent component independence, or Jacobian sparsity assumptions. These results extend the scope of identifiability analysis and offer a complementary perspective to existing methods.

  _Sangjoon Lee, Haris Moazam Sheikh_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Effective airfoil geometry optimization requires exploring a diverse range of designs using as few design variables as possible. This study introduces AirDbM, a Design-by-Morphing (DbM) approach specialized for airfoil optimization that systematically reduces design-space dimensionality. AirDbM selects an optimal set of 12 baseline airfoils from the UIUC airfoil database, which contains over 1,600 shapes, by sequentially adding the baseline that most increases the design capacity. With these baselines, AirDbM reconstructs 99 % of the database with a mean absolute error below 0.005, which matches the performance of a previous DbM approach that used more baselines. In multi-objective aerodynamic optimization, AirDbM demonstrates rapid convergence and achieves a Pareto front with a greater hypervolume than that of the previous larger-baseline study, where new Pareto-optimal solutions are discovered with enhanced lift-to-drag ratios at moderate stall tolerances. Furthermore, AirDbM demonstrates outstanding adaptability for reinforcement learning (RL) agents in generating airfoil geometry when compared to conventional airfoil parameterization methods, implying the broader potential of DbM in machine learning-driven design.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Sepsis is a life-threatening infectious syndrome associated with high mortality in intensive care units (ICUs). Early and accurate sepsis prediction (SP) is critical for timely intervention, yet remains challenging due to subtle early manifestations and rapidly escalating mortality. While AI has improved SP efficiency, existing methods struggle to capture weak early temporal signals. This paper introduces a Multi-Endogenous-view Representation Enhancement (MERE) mechanism to construct enriched feature views, coupled with a Cascaded Dual-convolution Time-series Attention (CDTA) module for multi-scale temporal representation learning. The proposed MEET-Sepsis framework achieves competitive prediction accuracy using only 20% of the ICU monitoring time required by SOTA methods, significantly advancing early SP. Extensive validation confirms its efficacy. Code is available at:this https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Safety is a major concern in reinforcement learning (RL): we aim at developing RL systems that not only perform optimally, but are also safe to deploy by providing formal guarantees about their safety. To this end, we introduce Probabilistic Shielding via Risk Augmentation (ProSh), a model-free algorithm for safe reinforcement learning under cost constraints. ProSh augments the Constrained MDP state space with a risk budget and enforces safety by applying a shield to the agent's policy distribution using a learned cost critic. The shield ensures that all sampled actions remain safe in expectation. We also show that optimality is preserved when the environment is deterministic. Since ProSh is model-free, safety during training depends on the knowledge we have acquired about the environment. We provide a tight upper-bound on the cost in expectation, depending only on the backup-critic accuracy, that is always satisfied during training. Under mild, practically achievable assumptions, ProSh guarantees safety even at training time, as shown in the experiments.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce the Strategic Doubly Robust (SDR) estimator, a novel framework that integrates strategic equilibrium modeling with doubly robust estimation for causal inference in strategic environments. SDR addresses endogenous treatment assignment arising from strategic agent behavior, maintaining double robustness while incorporating strategic considerations. Theoretical analysis confirms SDR's consistency and asymptotic normality under strategic unconfoundedness. Empirical evaluations demonstrate SDR's superior performance over baseline methods, achieving 7.6\%-29.3\% bias reduction across varying strategic strengths and maintaining robust scalability with agent populations. The framework provides a principled approach for reliable causal inference when agents respond strategically to interventions.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Transformer components such as non-linear activations and normalization are inherently non-injective, suggesting that different inputs could map to the same output and prevent exact recovery of the input from a model's representations. In this paper, we challenge this view. First, we prove mathematically that transformer language models mapping discrete input sequences to their corresponding sequence of continuous representations are injective and therefore lossless, a property established at initialization and preserved during training. Second, we confirm this result empirically through billions of collision tests on six state-of-the-art language models, and observe no collisions. Third, we operationalize injectivity: we introduce SipIt, the first algorithm that provably and efficiently reconstructs the exact input text from hidden activations, establishing linear-time guarantees and demonstrating exact invertibility in practice. Overall, our work establishes injectivity as a fundamental and exploitable property of language models, with direct implications for transparency, interpretability, and safe deployment.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) can elicit strong reasoning in large language models (LLMs), while their performance after RLVR varies dramatically across different base models. This raises a fundamental question: what microscopic property of pre-trained models leads to this variation? To investigate, we formalize reasoning as chains of Horn clauses ("if-then" rules) built from features extracted from the LLM's latent space via cross-layer sparse autoencoders (SAEs). We estimate the transition probabilities between its features, and further categorize each rule by its semantic soundness level (e.g., strict, plausible, noisy) with an LLM. Our key discovery is that high-potential models are inherently soundness-aware: their internal probability distributions systematically shift across rules' soundness levels, becoming highly distinct for "strict" versus "noisy" rules. In contrast, weaker models are soundness-agnostic, collapsing to one distribution regardless of soundness levels. To quantify this, we introduce the Soundness-Aware Level (SAL), a microscopic metric using the Jensen-Shannon Divergence to measure the separation between these distributions. We show that SAL's predictions of post-RLVR reasoning performance follow a precise empirical law (R^2=0.87) across diverse model families (Qwen, Mistral, Llama, DeepSeek) and scales (0.5B-14B). This reveals that a model's reasoning potential is tied to its intrinsic, pre-trained ability to distinguish sound knowledge from unsound ones. These findings underscore the critical role of model pre-training in shaping reasoning and offer a practical metric grounded in the model's internal mechanisms for selecting/designing stronger base models.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is critical for the reliable deployment of deep learning models. hile Mahalanobis distance methods are widely used, the impact of representation geometry and normalization on their performance is not fully understood, which may limit their downstream application. To address this gap, we conducted a comprehensive empirical study across diverse image foundation models, datasets, and distance normalization schemes. First, our analysis shows that Mahalanobis-based methods aren't universally reliable. Second, we define the ideal geometry for data representations and demonstrate that spectral and intrinsic-dimensionality metrics can accurately predict a model's OOD performance. Finally, we analyze how normalization impacts OOD performance. Building upon these studies, we propose radially scaled $\ell_2$ normalization, a method that generalizes the standard $\ell_2$ normalization recently applied to Mahalanobis-based OOD detection. Our approach introduces a tunable parameter to directly control the radial geometry of the feature space, systematically contracting or expanding representations to significantly improve OOD detection performance. By bridging the gap between representation geometry, normalization, and OOD performance, our findings offer new insights into the design of more effective and reliable deep learning models.

  Accurate prediction of protein-ligand binding poses is crucial for structure-based drug design, yet existing methods struggle to balance speed, accuracy, and physical plausibility. We introduce Matcha, a novel molecular docking pipeline that combines multi-stage flow matching with learned scoring and physical validity filtering. Our approach consists of three sequential stages applied consecutively to refine docking predictions, each implemented as a flow matching model operating on appropriate geometric spaces ($\mathbb{R}^3$, $\mathrm{SO}(3)$, and $\mathrm{SO}(2)$). We enhance the prediction quality through a dedicated scoring model and apply unsupervised physical validity filters to eliminate unrealistic poses. Compared to various approaches, Matcha demonstrates superior performance on Astex and PDBbind test sets in terms of docking success rate and physical plausibility. Moreover, our method works approximately 25 times faster than modern large-scale co-folding models. The model weights and inference code to reproduce our results are available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce the Deep Edge Filter, a novel approach that applies high-pass filtering to deep neural network features to improve model generalizability. Our method is motivated by our hypothesis that neural networks encode task-relevant semantic information in high-frequency components while storing domain-specific biases in low-frequency components of deep features. By subtracting low-pass filtered outputs from original features, our approach isolates generalizable representations while preserving architectural integrity. Experimental results across diverse domains such as Vision, Text, 3D, and Audio demonstrate consistent performance improvements regardless of model architecture and data modality. Analysis reveals that our method induces feature sparsification and effectively isolates high-frequency components, providing empirical validation of our core hypothesis.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Finetuning (pretrained) language models is a standard approach for updating their internal parametric knowledge and specializing them to new tasks and domains. However, the corresponding model weight changes ("weight diffs") are not generally interpretable. While inspecting the finetuning dataset can give a sense of how the model might have changed, these datasets are often not publicly available or are too large to work with directly. Towards the goal of comprehensively understanding weight diffs in natural language, we introduce Diff Interpretation Tuning (DIT), a method that trains models to describe their own finetuning-induced modifications. Our approach uses synthetic, labeled weight diffs to train a DIT-adapter, which can be applied to a compatible finetuned model to make it describe how it has changed. We demonstrate in two proof-of-concept settings (reporting hidden behaviors and summarizing finetuned knowledge) that our method enables models to describe their finetuning-induced modifications using accurate natural language descriptions.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  While deep learning has achieved impressive performance in time series forecasting, it becomes increasingly crucial to understand its decision-making process for building trust in high-stakes scenarios. Existing interpretable models often provide only local and partial explanations, lacking the capability to reveal how heterogeneous and interacting input variables jointly shape the overall temporal patterns in the forecast curve. We propose ProtoTS, a novel interpretable forecasting framework that achieves both high accuracy and transparent decision-making through modeling prototypical temporal patterns. ProtoTS computes instance-prototype similarity based on a denoised representation that preserves abundant heterogeneous information. The prototypes are organized hierarchically to capture global temporal patterns with coarse prototypes while capturing finer-grained local variations with detailed prototypes, enabling expert steering and multi-level interpretability. Experiments on multiple realistic benchmarks, including a newly released LOF dataset, show that ProtoTS not only exceeds existing methods in forecast accuracy but also delivers expert-steerable interpretations for better model understanding and decision support.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Autonomous exploration in complex multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) with sparse rewards critically depends on providing agents with effective intrinsic motivation. While artificial curiosity offers a powerful self-supervised signal, it often confuses environmental stochasticity with meaningful novelty. Moreover, existing curiosity mechanisms exhibit a uniform novelty bias, treating all unexpected observations equally. However, peer behavior novelty, which encode latent task dynamics, are often overlooked, resulting in suboptimal exploration in decentralized, communication-free MARL settings. To this end, inspired by how human children adaptively calibrate their own exploratory behaviors via observing peers, we propose a novel approach to enhance multi-agent exploration. We introduce CERMIC, a principled framework that empowers agents to robustly filter noisy surprise signals and guide exploration by dynamically calibrating their intrinsic curiosity with inferred multi-agent context. Additionally, CERMIC generates theoretically-grounded intrinsic rewards, encouraging agents to explore state transitions with high information gain. We evaluate CERMIC on benchmark suites including VMAS, Meltingpot, and SMACv2. Empirical results demonstrate that exploration with CERMIC significantly outperforms SoTA algorithms in sparse-reward environments.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The bisimulation metric (BSM) is a powerful tool for computing state similarities within a Markov decision process (MDP), revealing that states closer in BSM have more similar optimal value functions. While BSM has been successfully utilized in reinforcement learning (RL) for tasks like state representation learning and policy exploration, its application to multiple-MDP scenarios, such as policy transfer, remains challenging. Prior work has attempted to generalize BSM to pairs of MDPs, but a lack of rigorous analysis of its mathematical properties has limited further theoretical progress. In this work, we formally establish a generalized bisimulation metric (GBSM) between pairs of MDPs, which is rigorously proven with the three fundamental properties: GBSM symmetry, inter-MDP triangle inequality, and the distance bound on identical state spaces. Leveraging these properties, we theoretically analyse policy transfer, state aggregation, and sampling-based estimation in MDPs, obtaining explicit bounds that are strictly tighter than those derived from the standard BSM. Additionally, GBSM provides a closed-form sample complexity for estimation, improving upon existing asymptotic results based on BSM. Numerical results validate our theoretical findings and demonstrate the effectiveness of GBSM in multi-MDP scenarios.

  Retrieval systems rely on representations learned by increasingly powerful models. However, due to the high training cost and inconsistencies in learned representations, there is significant interest in facilitating communication between representations and ensuring compatibility across independently trained neural networks. In the literature, two primary approaches are commonly used to adapt different learned representations: affine transformations, which adapt well to specific distributions but can significantly alter the original representation, and orthogonal transformations, which preserve the original structure with strict geometric constraints but limit adaptability. A key challenge is adapting the latent spaces of updated models to align with those of previous models on downstream distributions while preserving the newly learned representation spaces. In this paper, we impose a relaxed orthogonality constraint, namely $\lambda$-Orthogonality regularization, while learning an affine transformation, to obtain distribution-specific adaptation while retaining the original learned representations. Extensive experiments across various architectures and datasets validate our approach, demonstrating that it preserves the model's zero-shot performance and ensures compatibility across model updates.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  View missing remains a significant challenge in graph-based multi-view semi-supervised learning, hindering their real-world applications. To address this issue, traditional methods introduce a missing indicator matrix and focus on mining partial structure among existing samples in each view for label propagation (LP). However, we argue that these disregarded missing samples sometimes induce discontinuous local structures, i.e., sub-clusters, breaking the fundamental smoothness assumption in LP. Consequently, such a Sub-Cluster Problem (SCP) would distort graph fusion and degrade classification performance. To alleviate SCP, we propose a novel incomplete multi-view semi-supervised learning method, termed AGF-TI. Firstly, we design an adversarial graph fusion scheme to learn a robust consensus graph against the distorted local structure through a min-max framework. By stacking all similarity matrices into a tensor, we further recover the incomplete structure from the high-order consistency information based on the low-rank tensor learning. Additionally, the anchor-based strategy is incorporated to reduce the computational complexity. An efficient alternative optimization algorithm combining a reduced gradient descent method is developed to solve the formulated objective, with theoretical convergence. Extensive experimental results on various datasets validate the superiority of our proposed AGF-TI as compared to state-of-the-art methods. Code is available atthis https URL.

  _Qi Cao, Pengtao Xie_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Training multimodal process reward models (PRMs) is hard due to (i) distribution shift between training set and test set and (ii) quality imbalance across training data samples. While domain-level reweighting (e.g., DreamPRM) aligns training with test-time objectives, it leaves a clear gap to an oracle upper bound (pass@N), even under a "sanity check" that uses test set data to probe headroom -- pointing to meta-level under-parameterization. We introduce DreamPRM-1.5, an instance-level reweighting framework that assigns an adaptive weight to every training example via bi-level optimization. To realize instance reweighting across scales, we develop two complementary regimes: Instance Table, which learns explicit per-sample weights and excels on small/medium data, and Instance Net, a lightweight neural network that generalizes better and scales to large corpora. A practical, stable training recipe -- time-scale matching between upper/lower updates, cold-start initialization, and bounded-range weights -- prevents divergence. Integrated with test-time scaling, DreamPRM-1.5 attains 84.6 accuracy on the MMMU validation set, 31.3 accuracy on R-Bench-V and, when paired with a leading backbone (e.g., GPT-5-mini), achieves first-place results on public multimodal reasoning leaderboards. Moreover, extensive experiments, including benchmark evaluations, baseline comparisons, and a sanity check, demonstrate that DreamPRM-1.5 closes the gap toward the oracle, achieves leading performance, and trains stably.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Simulation-based inference (SBI) is a statistical inference approach for estimating latent parameters of a physical system when the likelihood is intractable but simulations are available. In practice, SBI is often hindered by model misspecification--the mismatch between simulated and real-world observations caused by inherent modeling simplifications. RoPE, a recent SBI approach, addresses this challenge through a two-stage domain transfer process that combines semi-supervised calibration with optimal transport (OT)-based distribution alignment. However, RoPE operates in a fully transductive setting, requiring access to a batch of test samples at inference time, which limits scalability and generalization. We propose here a fully inductive and amortized SBI framework that integrates calibration and distributional alignment into a single, end-to-end trainable model. Our method leverages mini-batch OT with a closed-form coupling to align real and simulated observations that correspond to the same latent parameters, using both paired calibration data and unpaired samples. A conditional normalizing flow is then trained to approximate the OT-induced posterior, enabling efficient inference without simulation access at test time. Across a range of synthetic and real-world benchmarks--including complex medical biomarker estimation--our approach matches or surpasses the performance of RoPE, as well as other standard SBI and non-SBI estimators, while offering improved scalability and applicability in challenging, misspecified environments.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as an effective post-training paradigm for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language model (MLLM). However, current RL pipelines often suffer from training inefficiencies caused by two underexplored issues: Advantage Collapsing, where most advantages in a batch concentrate near zero, and Rollout Silencing, where the proportion of rollouts contributing non-zero gradients diminishes over time. These issues lead to suboptimal gradient updates and hinder long-term learning efficiency. To address these issues, we propose Shuffle-R1, a simple yet principled framework that improves RL fine-tuning efficiency by dynamically restructuring trajectory sampling and batch composition. It introduces (1) Pairwise Trajectory Sampling, which selects high-contrast trajectories with large advantages to improve gradient signal quality, and (2) Advantage-based Trajectory Shuffle, which increases exposure of valuable rollouts through informed batch reshuffling. Experiments across multiple reasoning benchmarks show that our framework consistently outperforms strong RL baselines with minimal overhead. These results highlight the importance of data-centric adaptations for more efficient RL training in MLLM.

  Reducing domestic energy demand is central to climate mitigation and fuel poverty strategies, yet the impact of energy efficiency interventions is highly heterogeneous. Using a causal machine learning model trained on nationally representative data of the English housing stock, we estimate average and conditional treatment effects of wall insulation on gas consumption, focusing on distributional effects across energy burden subgroups. While interventions reduce gas demand on average (by as much as 19 percent), low energy burden groups achieve substantial savings, whereas those experiencing high energy burdens see little to no reduction. This pattern reflects a behaviourally-driven mechanism: households constrained by high costs-to-income ratios (e.g. more than 0.1) reallocate savings toward improved thermal comfort rather than lowering consumption. Far from wasteful, such responses represent rational adjustments in contexts of prior deprivation, with potential co-benefits for health and well-being. These findings call for a broader evaluation framework that accounts for both climate impacts and the equity implications of domestic energy policy.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Coreset selection methods have shown promise in reducing the training data size while maintaining model performance for data-efficient machine learning. However, as many datasets suffer from biases that cause models to learn spurious correlations instead of causal features, it is important to understand whether and how dataset reduction methods may perpetuate, amplify, or mitigate these biases. In this work, we conduct the first comprehensive analysis of the implications of data selection on the spurious bias levels of the selected coresets and the robustness of downstream models trained on them. We use an extensive experimental setting spanning ten different spurious correlations benchmarks, five score metrics to characterize sample importance/ difficulty, and five data selection policies across a broad range of coreset sizes. Thereby, we unravel a series of nontrivial nuances in interactions between sample difficulty and bias alignment, as well as dataset bias and resultant model robustness. For example, we find that selecting coresets using embedding-based sample characterization scores runs a comparatively lower risk of inadvertently exacerbating bias than selecting using characterizations based on learning dynamics. Most importantly, our analysis reveals that although some coreset selection methods could achieve lower bias levels by prioritizing difficult samples, they do not reliably guarantee downstream robustness.

  The grand goal of AI research, and particularly Self Supervised Learning (SSL), is to produce systems that can successfully solve any possible task. In contrast, current evaluation methods available to AI researchers typically rely on a fixed collection of hand-picked downstream benchmarks. Hence, a large amount of effort is put into designing and searching for large collection of evaluation tasks that can serve as a proxy of our grand goal. We argue that such a rigid evaluation protocol creates a silent bottleneck in AI research. To remedy that, we define a probabilistic space of downstream tasks obtained by adopting a distribution of tasks and by defining Task Priors. Under this view, one can evaluate a model's performance over the set of all possible downstream tasks. Our framework is the first to provide answers to key questions such as (i) what is the average performance of my model over all possible downstream tasks weighted by the probability to encounter each task? or (ii) what is the variance of my model's performance across all downstream tasks under the defined Task Priors? Beyond establishing a new standard for evaluation, we believe that Task Priors will accelerate the pace of research in SSL - where downstream task evaluation is the sole qualitative signal that researchers have access to.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Federated Class Incremental Learning (FCIL) aims to collaboratively process continuously increasing incoming tasks across multiple clients. Among various approaches, data replay has become a promising solution, which can alleviate forgetting by reintroducing representative samples from previous tasks. However, their performance is typically limited by class imbalance, both within the replay buffer due to limited global awareness and between replayed and newly arrived classes. To address this issue, we propose a class wise balancing data replay method for FCIL (FedCBDR), which employs a global coordination mechanism for class-level memory construction and reweights the learning objective to alleviate the aforementioned imbalances. Specifically, FedCBDR has two key components: 1) the global-perspective data replay module reconstructs global representations of prior task in a privacy-preserving manner, which then guides a class-aware and importance-sensitive sampling strategy to achieve balanced replay; 2) Subsequently, to handle class imbalance across tasks, the task aware temperature scaling module adaptively adjusts the temperature of logits at both class and instance levels based on task dynamics, which reduces the model's overconfidence in majority classes while enhancing its sensitivity to minority classes. Experimental results verified that FedCBDR achieves balanced class-wise sampling under heterogeneous data distributions and improves generalization under task imbalance between earlier and recent tasks, yielding a 2%-15% Top-1 accuracy improvement over six state-of-the-art methods.

  LLM serving systems typically treat user prompts as monolithic inputs, optimizing inference through decoding tricks or inter-query batching. However, many real-world prompts contain latent semantic parallelism--decomposable structures where subtasks can be executed independently to reduce latency while preserving meaning. We introduce PARALLELPROMPT, the first benchmark for measuring intra-query parallelism in natural user prompts. Our dataset comprises over 37,000 real-world prompts from public LLM chat logs, each annotated with a structured schema capturing task templates, shared context, and iteration inputs. These schemas are extracted using LLM-assisted prompting with rule-based multilingual validation. To evaluate the benefits of decomposition, we provide an execution suite that benchmarks serial vs. parallel strategies, measuring latency, structural adherence, and semantic fidelity. Our results show that intra-query parallelism can be successfully parsed in over 75% of curated datasets, unlocking up to 5x speedups on tasks like translation, comprehension, and comparative analysis, with minimal quality degradation. By releasing this benchmark, curation pipeline, and evaluation suite, we provide the first standardized testbed for studying structure-aware execution in LLM serving pipelines.

  The comparison between discriminative and generative classifiers has intrigued researchers since Efron's seminal analysis of logistic regression versus discriminant analysis. While early theoretical work established that generative classifiers exhibit lower sample complexity but higher asymptotic error in simple linear settings, these trade-offs remain unexplored in the transformer era. We present the first comprehensive evaluation of modern generative and discriminative architectures - Auto-regressive modeling, Masked Language Modeling, Discrete Diffusion, and Encoders for text classification. Our study reveals that the classical 'two regimes' phenomenon manifests distinctly across different architectures and training paradigms. Beyond accuracy, we analyze sample efficiency, calibration, noise robustness, and ordinality across diverse scenarios. Our findings offer practical guidance for selecting the most suitable modeling approach based on real-world constraints such as latency and data limitations.

  The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has exacerbated the memory bottleneck due to the widening gap between model parameter scaling and hardware capabilities. While post-training quantization techniques effectively reduce memory overhead, existing methods predominantly rely on static quantization strategies, which struggle to adapt to dynamic workloads. To address this, we propose FlexQuant, a dynamic precision-switching framework that optimizes the trade-off between inference speed and accuracy. Leveraging model perplexity entropy and Kullback-Leibler divergence, FlexQuant enables fine-grained, layer-wise mixed-precision quantization and dynamically adjusts bit-widths during each token generation. FlexQuant provides a comprehensive analysis of quantization strategies, introduces a precision requirement model for optimal switching, and implements efficient fine-grained precision management. Evaluations demonstrate that FlexQuant achieves a 1.3x end-to-end speedup across diverse language tasks with negligible accuracy loss introduced. This framework offers a flexible and adaptive solution for efficient LLM deployment. Code is released atthis https URL.

  Inference in dynamic probabilistic models is a complex task involving expensive operations. In particular, for Hidden Markov Models, the whole state space has to be enumerated for advancing in time. Even states with negligible probabilities are considered, resulting in computational inefficiency and increased noise due to the propagation of unlikely probability mass. We propose to denoise the future and speed up inference by using only the top-p states, i.e., the most probable states with accumulated probability p. We show that the error introduced by using only the top-p states is bound by p and the so-called minimal mixing rate of the underlying model. Moreover, in our empirical evaluation, we show that we can expect speedups of at least an order of magnitude, while the error in terms of total variation distance is below 0.09.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Current parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods for adapting pre-trained language models to downstream tasks are susceptible to interference from noisy data. Conventional noise-handling approaches either rely on laborious data pre-processing or employ model architecture modifications prone to error accumulation. In contrast to existing noise-process paradigms, we propose a noise-robust adaptation method via asymmetric LoRA poisoning experts (LoPE), a novel framework that enhances model robustness to noise only with generated noisy data. Drawing inspiration from the mixture-of-experts architecture, LoPE strategically integrates a dedicated poisoning expert in an asymmetric LoRA configuration. Through a two-stage paradigm, LoPE performs noise injection on the poisoning expert during fine-tuning to enhance its noise discrimination and processing ability. During inference, we selectively mask the dedicated poisoning expert to leverage purified knowledge acquired by normal experts for noise-robust output. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LoPE achieves strong performance and robustness purely through the low-cost noise injection, which completely eliminates the requirement of data cleaning.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Sequence models such as transformers require inputs to be represented as one-dimensional sequences. In vision, this typically involves flattening images using a fixed row-major (raster-scan) order. While full self-attention is permutation-equivariant, modern long-sequence transformers increasingly rely on architectural approximations that break this invariance and introduce sensitivity to patch ordering. We show that patch order significantly affects model performance in such settings, with simple alternatives like column-major or Hilbert curves yielding notable accuracy shifts. Motivated by this, we propose REOrder, a two-stage framework for discovering task-optimal patch orderings. First, we derive an information-theoretic prior by evaluating the compressibility of various patch sequences. Then, we learn a policy over permutations by optimizing a Plackett-Luce policy using REINFORCE. This approach enables efficient learning in a combinatorial permutation space. REOrder improves top-1 accuracy over row-major ordering on ImageNet-1K by up to 3.01% and Functional Map of the World by 13.35%.

  Enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models effectively using reinforcement learning (RL) remains a crucial challenge. Existing approaches primarily adopt two contrasting advantage estimation granularities: token-level methods (e.g., PPO) aim to provide fine-grained advantage signals but suffer from inaccurate estimation due to difficulties in training an accurate critic model. On the other extreme, trajectory-level methods (e.g., GRPO) solely rely on a coarse-grained advantage signal from the final reward, leading to imprecise credit assignment. To address these limitations, we propose Segment Policy Optimization (SPO), a novel RL framework that leverages segment-level advantage estimation at an intermediate granularity, achieving a better balance by offering more precise credit assignment than trajectory-level methods and requiring fewer estimation points than token-level methods, enabling accurate advantage estimation based on Monte Carlo (MC) without a critic model. SPO features three components with novel strategies: (1) flexible segment partition; (2) accurate segment advantage estimation; and (3) policy optimization using segment advantages, including a novel probability-mask strategy. We further instantiate SPO for two specific scenarios: (1) SPO-chain for short chain-of-thought (CoT), featuring novel cutpoint-based partition and chain-based advantage estimation, achieving $6$-$12$ percentage point improvements in accuracy over PPO and GRPO on GSM8K. (2) SPO-tree for long CoT, featuring novel tree-based advantage estimation, which significantly reduces the cost of MC estimation, achieving $7$-$11$ percentage point improvements over GRPO on MATH500 under 2K and 4K context evaluation.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We study the problem of offline imitation learning in Markov decision processes (MDPs), where the goal is to learn a well-performing policy given a dataset of state-action pairs generated by an expert policy. Complementing a recent line of work on this topic that assumes the expert belongs to a tractable class of known policies, we approach this problem from a new angle and leverage a different type of structural assumption about the environment. Specifically, for the class of linear $Q^\pi$-realizable MDPs, we introduce a new algorithm called saddle-point offline imitation learning (\SPOIL), which is guaranteed to match the performance of any expert up to an additive error $\varepsilon$ with access to $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-2})$ samples. Moreover, we extend this result to possibly non-linear $Q^\pi$-realizable MDPs at the cost of a worse sample complexity of order $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-4})$. Finally, our analysis suggests a new loss function for training critic networks from expert data in deep imitation learning. Empirical evaluations on standard benchmarks demonstrate that the neural net implementation of \SPOIL is superior to behavior cloning and competitive with state-of-the-art algorithms.

  Gradient-based data attribution methods, such as influence functions, are critical for understanding the impact of individual training samples without requiring repeated model retraining. However, their scalability is often limited by the high computational and memory costs associated with per-sample gradient computation. In this work, we propose GraSS, a novel gradient compression algorithm and its variants FactGraSS for linear layers specifically, that explicitly leverage the inherent sparsity of per-sample gradients to achieve sub-linear space and time complexity. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving substantial speedups while preserving data influence fidelity. In particular, FactGraSS achieves up to 165% faster throughput on billion-scale models compared to the previous state-of-the-art baselines. Our code is publicly available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present a novel geometric perspective on the latent space of diffusion models. We first show that the standard pullback approach, utilizing the deterministic probability flow ODE decoder, is fundamentally flawed. It provably forces geodesics to decode as straight segments in data space, effectively ignoring any intrinsic data geometry beyond the ambient Euclidean space. Complementing this view, diffusion also admits a stochastic decoder via the reverse SDE, which enables an information geometric treatment with the Fisher-Rao metric. However, a choice of $x_T$ as the latent representation collapses this metric due to memorylessness. We address this by introducing a latent spacetime $z=(x_t,t)$ that indexes the family of denoising distributions $p(x_0 | x_t)$ across all noise scales, yielding a nontrivial geometric structure. We prove these distributions form an exponential family and derive simulation-free estimators for curve lengths, enabling efficient geodesic computation. The resulting structure induces a principled Diffusion Edit Distance, where geodesics trace minimal sequences of noise and denoise edits between data. We also demonstrate benefits for transition path sampling in molecular systems, including constrained variants such as low-variance transitions and region avoidance.

  Differential Transformer has recently gained significant attention for its impressive empirical performance, often attributed to its ability to perform noise canceled attention. However, precisely how differential attention achieves its empirical benefits remains poorly understood. Moreover, Differential Transformer architecture demands large-scale training from scratch, hindering utilization of open pretrained weights. In this work, we conduct an in-depth investigation of Differential Transformer, uncovering three key factors behind its success: (1) enhanced expressivity via negative attention, (2) reduced redundancy among attention heads, and (3) improved learning dynamics. Based on these findings, we propose DEX, a novel method to efficiently integrate the advantages of differential attention into pretrained language models. By reusing the softmax attention scores and adding a lightweight differential operation on the output value matrix, DEX effectively incorporates the key advantages of differential attention while remaining lightweight in both training and inference. Evaluations confirm that DEX substantially improves the pretrained LLMs across diverse benchmarks, achieving significant performance gains with minimal adaptation data (< 0.01%).

  We study the approximation capabilities, convergence speeds and on-convergence behaviors of transformers trained on in-context recall tasks -- which requires to recognize the \emph{positional} association between a pair of tokens from in-context examples. Existing theoretical results only focus on the in-context reasoning behavior of transformers after being trained for the \emph{one} gradient descent step. It remains unclear what is the on-convergence behavior of transformers being trained by gradient descent and how fast the convergence rate is. In addition, the generalization of transformers in one-step in-context reasoning has not been formally investigated. This work addresses these gaps. We first show that a class of transformers with either linear, ReLU or softmax attentions, is provably Bayes-optimal for an in-context recall task. When being trained with gradient descent, we show via a finite-sample analysis that the expected loss converges at linear rate to the Bayes risks. Moreover, we show that the trained transformers exhibit out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization, i.e., generalizing to samples outside of the population distribution. Our theoretical findings are further supported by extensive empirical validations, showing that \emph{without} proper parameterization, models with larger expressive power surprisingly \emph{fail} to generalize OOD after being trained by gradient descent.

  The Maximum Common Edge Subgraph (MCES) problem is a crucial challenge with significant implications in domains such as biology and chemistry. Traditional approaches, which include transformations into max-clique and search-based algorithms, suffer from scalability issues when dealing with larger instances. This paper introduces ``Neural Graduated Assignment'' (NGA), a simple, scalable, unsupervised-training-based method that addresses these limitations. Central to NGA is stacking of differentiable assignment optimization with neural components, enabling high-dimensional parameterization of the matching process through a learnable temperature mechanism. We further theoretically analyze the learning dynamics of NGA, showing its design leads to fast convergence, better exploration-exploitation tradeoff, and ability to escape local optima. Extensive experiments across MCES computation, graph similarity estimation, and graph retrieval tasks reveal that NGA not only significantly improves computation time and scalability on large instances but also enhances performance compared to existing methodologies. The introduction of NGA marks a significant advancement in the computation of MCES and offers insights into other assignment problems.

  Attention with bias, which extends standard attention by introducing prior knowledge as an additive bias matrix to the query-key scores, has been widely deployed in vision, language, protein-folding and other advanced scientific models, underscoring its status as a key evolution of this foundational module. However, introducing bias terms creates a severe efficiency bottleneck in attention computation. It disrupts the tightly fused memory-compute pipeline that underlies the speed of accelerators like FlashAttention, thereby stripping away most of their performance gains and leaving biased attention computationally expensive. Surprisingly, despite its common usage, targeted efficiency optimization for attention with bias remains absent, which seriously hinders its application in complex tasks. Diving into the computation of FlashAttention, we prove that its optimal efficiency is determined by the rank of the attention weight matrix. Inspired by this theoretical result, this paper presents FlashBias based on the low-rank compressed sensing theory, which can provide fast-exact computation for many widely used attention biases and a fast-accurate approximation for biases in general formalizations. FlashBias can fully take advantage of the extremely optimized matrix multiplication operation in modern GPUs, achieving 1.5$\times$ speedup for Pairformer in AlphaFold 3, and over 2$\times$ speedup for attention with bias in vision and language models without loss of accuracy.

  Physics-informed neural operators offer a powerful framework for learning solution operators of partial differential equations (PDEs) by combining data and physics losses. However, these physics losses rely on derivatives. Computing these derivatives remains challenging, with spectral and finite difference methods introducing approximation errors due to finite resolution. Here, we propose the mollified graph neural operator ($m$GNO), the first method to leverage automatic differentiation and compute exact gradients on arbitrary geometries. This enhancement enables efficient training on irregular grids and varying geometries while allowing seamless evaluation of physics losses at randomly sampled points for improved generalization. For a PDE example on regular grids, $m$GNO paired with autograd reduced the L2 relative data error by 20x compared to finite differences, although training was slower. It can also solve PDEs on unstructured point clouds seamlessly, using physics losses only, at resolutions vastly lower than those needed for finite differences to be accurate enough. On these unstructured point clouds, $m$GNO leads to errors that are consistently 2 orders of magnitude lower than machine learning baselines (Meta-PDE, which accelerates PINNs) for comparable runtimes, and also delivers speedups from 1 to 3 orders of magnitude compared to the numerical solver for similar accuracy. $m$GNOs can also be used to solve inverse design and shape optimization problems on complex geometries.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Growing data privacy demands, driven by regulations like GDPR and CCPA, require machine unlearning methods capable of swiftly removing the influence of specific training points. Although verified approaches like SISA, using data slicing and checkpointing, achieve efficient unlearning for single models by reverting to intermediate states, these methods struggle in teacher-student knowledge distillation settings. Unlearning in the teacher typically forces costly, complete student retraining due to pervasive information propagation during distillation. Our primary contribution is PURGE (Partitioned Unlearning with Retraining Guarantee for Ensembles), a novel framework integrating verified unlearning with distillation. We introduce constituent mapping and an incremental multi-teacher strategy that partitions the distillation process, confines each teacher constituent's impact to distinct student data subsets, and crucially maintains data isolation. The PURGE framework substantially reduces retraining overhead, requiring only partial student updates when teacher-side unlearning occurs. We provide both theoretical analysis, quantifying significant speed-ups in the unlearning process, and empirical validation on multiple datasets, demonstrating that PURGE achieves these efficiency gains while maintaining student accuracy comparable to standard baselines.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Structural pruning enhances hardware-agnostic inference efficiency for large language models (LLMs) yet often fails to maintain comparable performance. Local pruning performs efficient layer-by-layer compression but ignores global topology. Although global pruning aims to identify an optimal sparse model, intuitive methods typically adopt a two-stage paradigm that first evaluates substructure saliency and then applies global pruning, which ignores inter-structure dependencies and fails to achieve end-to-end optimization. To address these limitations, we propose T√Ωr-the-Pruner, an efficient end-to-end search-based global structural pruning framework. This framework constructs a supernet by repeatedly applying local pruning across a range of sparsity ratios to each layer in an LLM, with the core goal of determining the optimal sparsity distribution under a target overall sparsity ratio. Concretely, we introduce an effective local pruning and an expectation error accumulation approach to improve supernet construction. Furthermore, we employ an iterative prune-and-search strategy with coarse-to-fine sparsity granularity to ensure efficient search convergence. Experimental results show that T√Ωr-the-Pruner achieves state-of-the-art structural pruning, retaining 97% of the dense model's performance while removing a challenging 50% of Llama-3.1-70B's parameters.

  Stochastic differential equations (SDEs) describe dynamical systems where deterministic flows, governed by a drift function, are superimposed with random fluctuations, dictated by a diffusion function. The accurate estimation (or discovery) of these functions from data is a central problem in machine learning, with wide application across the natural and social sciences. Yet current solutions either rely heavily on prior knowledge of the dynamics or involve intricate training procedures. We introduce FIM-SDE (Foundation Inference Model for SDEs), a pretrained recognition model that delivers accurate in-context (or zero-shot) estimation of the drift and diffusion functions of low-dimensional SDEs, from noisy time series data, and allows rapid finetuning to target datasets. Leveraging concepts from amortized inference and neural operators, we (pre)train FIM-SDE in a supervised fashion to map a large set of noisy, discretely observed SDE paths onto the space of drift and diffusion functions. We demonstrate that FIM-SDE achieves robust in-context function estimation across a wide range of synthetic and real-world processes -- from canonical SDE systems (e.g., double-well dynamics or weakly perturbed Lorenz attractors) to stock price recordings and oil-price and wind-speed fluctuations -- while matching the performance of symbolic, Gaussian process and Neural SDE baselines trained on the target datasets. When finetuned to the target processes, we show that FIM-SDE consistently outperforms all these baselines.

  Sample selection is a prevalent approach in learning with noisy labels, aiming to identify confident samples for training. Although existing sample selection methods have achieved decent results by reducing the noise rate of the selected subset, they often overlook that not all mislabeled examples harm the model's performance equally. In this paper, we demonstrate that mislabeled examples correctly predicted by the model early in the training process are particularly harmful to model performance. We refer to these examples as Mislabeled Easy Examples (MEEs). To address this, we propose Early Cutting, which introduces a recalibration step that employs the model's later training state to re-select the confident subset identified early in training, thereby avoiding misleading confidence from early learning and effectively filtering out MEEs. Experiments on the CIFAR, WebVision, and full ImageNet-1k datasets demonstrate that our method effectively improves sample selection and model performance by reducing MEEs.

  Measuring similarity between training examples is critical for curating high-quality and diverse pretraining datasets for language models. However, similarity is typically computed with a generic off-the-shelf embedding model that has been trained for tasks such as retrieval. Whether these embedding-based similarity metrics are well-suited for pretraining data selection remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we propose a new framework to assess the suitability of a similarity metric specifically for data curation in language model pretraining applications. Our framework's first evaluation criterion captures how well distances reflect generalization in pretraining loss between different training examples. Next, we use each embedding model to guide a standard diversity-based data curation algorithm and measure its utility by pretraining a language model on the selected data and evaluating downstream task performance. Finally, we evaluate the capabilities of embeddings to distinguish between examples from different data sources. With these evaluations, we demonstrate that standard off-the-shelf embedding models are not well-suited for the pretraining data curation setting, underperforming even remarkably simple embeddings that are extracted from models trained on the same pretraining corpus. Our experiments are performed on the Pile, for pretraining a 1.7B parameter language model on 200B tokens. We believe our analysis and evaluation framework serves as a foundation for the future design of embeddings that specifically reason about similarity in pretraining datasets.

  Class imbalance poses a significant challenge in classification tasks, where traditional approaches often lead to biased models and unreliable predictions. Undersampling and oversampling techniques have been commonly employed to address this issue, yet they suffer from inherent limitations stemming from their simplistic approach such as loss of information and additional biases respectively. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that leverages learning theory and concentration inequalities to overcome the shortcomings of traditional solutions. We focus on understanding the uncertainty in a class-dependent manner, as captured by confidence bounds that we directly embed into the learning process. By incorporating class-dependent estimates, our method can effectively adapt to the varying degrees of imbalance across different classes, resulting in more robust and reliable classification outcomes. We empirically show how our framework provides a promising direction for handling imbalanced data in classification tasks, offering practitioners a valuable tool for building more accurate and trustworthy models.

  Explainability is a key component in many applications involving deep neural networks (DNNs). However, current explanation methods for DNNs commonly leave it to the human observer to distinguish relevant explanations from spurious noise. This is not feasible anymore when going from easily human-accessible data such as images to more complex data such as genome sequences. To facilitate the accessibility of DNN outputs from such complex data and to increase explainability, we present a modification of the widely used explanation method layer-wise relevance propagation. Our approach enforces sparsity directly by pruning the relevance propagation for the different layers. Thereby, we achieve sparser relevance attributions for the input features as well as for the intermediate layers. As the relevance propagation is input-specific, we aim to prune the relevance propagation rather than the underlying model architecture. This allows to prune different neurons for different inputs and hence, might be more appropriate to the local nature of explanation methods. To demonstrate the efficacy of our method, we evaluate it on two types of data: images and genome sequences. We show that our modification indeed leads to noise reduction and concentrates relevance on the most important features compared to the baseline.

  After deployment, machine learning models often experience performance degradation due to shifts in data distribution. It is challenging to assess post-deployment performance accurately when labels are missing or delayed. Existing proxy methods, such as data drift detection, fail to measure the effects of these shifts adequately. To address this, we introduce a new method for evaluating binary classification models on unlabeled tabular data that accurately estimates model performance under covariate shift and call it Probabilistic Adaptive Performance Estimation (PAPE). It can be applied to any performance metric defined with elements of the confusion matrix. Crucially, PAPE operates independently of the original model, relying only on its predictions and probability estimates, and does not need any assumptions about the nature of covariate shift, learning directly from data instead. We tested PAPE using over 900 dataset-model combinations from US census data, assessing its performance against several benchmarks through various metrics. Our findings show that PAPE outperforms other methodologies, making it a superior choice for estimating the performance of binary classification models.

  Causal structure learning (CSL), a prominent technique for encoding cause-and-effect relationships among variables, through Bayesian Networks (BNs). Although recovering causal structure solely from data is a challenge, the integration of prior knowledge, revealing partial structural truth, can markedly enhance learning quality. However, current methods based on prior knowledge exhibit limited resilience to errors in the prior, with hard constraint methods disregarding priors entirely, and soft constraints accepting priors based on a predetermined confidence level, which may require expert intervention. To address this issue, we propose a strategy resilient to edge-level prior errors for CSL, thereby minimizing human intervention. We classify prior errors into different types and provide their theoretical impact on the Structural Hamming Distance (SHD) under the presumption of sufficient data. Intriguingly, we discover and prove that the strong hazard of prior errors is associated with a unique acyclic closed structure, defined as ``quasi-circle''. Leveraging this insight, a post-hoc strategy is employed to identify the prior errors by its impact on the increment of ``quasi-circles''. Through empirical evaluation on both real and synthetic datasets, we demonstrate our strategy's robustness against prior errors. Specifically, we highlight its substantial ability to resist order-reversed errors while maintaining the majority of correct prior.

By comparing enabling and disabling the nonlinear activations in the neural network, we demonstrate their specific effects on wide neural networks: (a) better feature separation, i.e., a larger angle separation for similar data in the feature space of model gradient, and (b) better NTK conditioning, i.e., a smaller condition number of neural tangent kernel (NTK). Furthermore, we show that the network depth (i.e., with more nonlinear activation operations) further amplifies these effects; in addition, in the infinite-width-then-depth limit, all data are equally separated with a fixed angle in the model gradient feature space, regardless of how similar they are originally in the input space. Note that, without the nonlinear activation, i.e., in a linear neural network, the data separation remains the same as for the original inputs and NTK condition number is equivalent to the Gram matrix, regardless of the network depth. Due to the close connection between NTK condition number and convergence theories, our results imply that nonlinear activation helps to improve the worst-case convergence rates of gradient based methods.

  Recent surges in LLM-driven intelligent systems largely overlook decades of foundational multi-agent systems (MAS) research, resulting in frameworks with critical limitations such as centralization and inadequate trust and communication protocols. This paper introduces thethis http URLarchitecture, an industrial-strength platform designed to bridge this gap by facilitating the integration of classical MAS principles with modern AI capabilities. We present a novel, multi-layered solution built on a decentralized foundation of on-chain blockchain services for verifiable identity, discovery, and transactions. This is complemented by a comprehensive development framework for creating secure, interoperable agents, a cloud-based platform for deployment, and an intelligent orchestration layer where an agent-native LLM translates high-level human goals into complex, multi-agent workflows. We demonstrate the deployed nature of this system through a decentralized logistics use case where autonomous agents dynamically discover, negotiate, and transact with one another securely. Ultimately, thethis http URLstack provides a principled architecture for moving beyond current agent implementations towards open, collaborative, and economically sustainable multi-agent ecosystems.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This search introduces the Multimodal Socialized Learning Framework (M-S2L), designed to foster emergent social intelligence in AI agents by integrating Multimodal Large Language Models (M-LLMs) with social learning mechanisms. The framework equips agents with multimodal perception (vision and text) and structured action capabilities, enabling physical manipulation and grounded multimodal communication (e.g., text with visual pointers). M-S2L combines direct reinforcement learning with two novel social learning pathways: multimodal observational learning and communication-driven learning from feedback, augmented by an episodic memory system for long-term social context.We evaluate M-S2L in a Collaborative Assembly Environment (CAE), where agent teams must construct complex devices from ambiguous blueprints under informational asymmetry. Across tasks of increasing complexity, M-S2L agents consistently outperform Text-Only and No-Social-Learning baselines in Task Completion Rate and Time to Completion, particularly in dynamic problem-solving scenarios. Ablation studies confirm the necessity of both multimodality and socialized learning. Our analysis reveals the emergence of efficient communication protocols integrating visual pointers with concise text, alongside rapid role specialization leading to stable labor division. Qualitative case studies demonstrate agents' abilities for shared awareness, dynamic re-planning, and adaptive problem-solving, suggesting a nascent form of machine social cognition. These findings indicate that integrating multimodal perception with explicit social learning is critical for developing human-like collaborative intelligence in multi-agent systems.

  _Rui Jerry Huang, Wendy Liu, Anastasia Miin_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Inference-time computation is a critical yet challenging paradigm for enhancing the reasoning performance of large language models (LLMs). While existing strategies improve reasoning stability and consistency, they suffer from notable limitations: self-correction often reinforces the model's initial biases, and Multi-Agent Collaboration (MAC) often fails due to the lack of efficient coordination mechanisms, leading to collective errors. Although high-performing verifiers can detect reasoning errors, making them reliable requires substantial training. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel inference-time framework, Adaptive Coopetition (AdCo), in which LLM agents utilize an adaptive, UCB-based "coopetition" mechanism. At each round, agents leverage coarse verifier signals to determine whether to collaborate or compete, and iteratively refine their reasoning based on peer feedback. Without relying on high-performance verifiers, our adaptive strategy achieves significant performance gains on mathematical reasoning benchmarks, yielding a 20% relative improvement over baselines on the more challenging dataset. Our approach remains robust and consistent in terms of accuracy under different sample sizes and configurations. This adaptive, signal-guided "coopetition" framework enhances reasoning robustness by leveraging both model knowledge diversity and reasoning trace measures, while also promoting uncertainty-driven exploration, especially when participants have comparable capabilities. From this perspective, our work offers a fresh lens on inference-time computation and paves the way for more resilient multi-agent LLM systems. Our code is available at:this https URL.

  The escalating frequency and severity of disasters routinely overwhelm traditional response capabilities, exposing critical vulnerability in disaster management. Current practices are hindered by fragmented data streams, siloed technologies, resource constraints, and the erosion of institutional memory, which collectively impede timely and effective decision making. This study introduces Disaster Copilot, a vision for a multi-agent artificial intelligence system designed to overcome these systemic challenges by unifying specialized AI tools within a collaborative framework. The proposed architecture utilizes a central orchestrator to coordinate diverse sub-agents, each specializing in critical domains such as predictive risk analytics, situational awareness, and impact assessment. By integrating multi-modal data, the system delivers a holistic, real-time operational picture and serve as the essential AI backbone required to advance Disaster Digital Twins from passive models to active, intelligent environments. Furthermore, it ensures functionality in resource-limited environments through on-device orchestration and incorporates mechanisms to capture institutional knowledge, mitigating the impact of staff turnover. We detail the system architecture and propose a three-phased roadmap emphasizing the parallel growth of technology, organizational capacity, and human-AI teaming. Disaster Copilot offers a transformative vision, fostering collective human-machine intelligence to build more adaptive, data-driven and resilient communities.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  LLM-powered Multi-Agent Systems (LLM-MAS) unlock new potentials in distributed reasoning, collaboration, and task generalization but also introduce additional risks due to unguaranteed agreement, cascading uncertainty, and adversarial vulnerabilities. We argue that ensuring responsible behavior in such systems requires a paradigm shift: from local, superficial agent-level alignment to global, systemic agreement. We conceptualize responsibility not as a static constraint but as a lifecycle-wide property encompassing agreement, uncertainty, and security, each requiring the complementary integration of subjective human-centered values and objective verifiability. Furthermore, a dual-perspective governance framework that combines interdisciplinary design with human-AI collaborative oversight is essential for tracing and ensuring responsibility throughout the lifecycle of LLM-MAS. Our position views LLM-MAS not as loose collections of agents, but as unified, dynamic socio-technical systems that demand principled mechanisms to support each dimension of responsibility and enable ethically aligned, verifiably coherent, and resilient behavior for sustained, system-wide agreement.

  What if artificial agents could not just communicate, but also evolve, adapt, and reshape their worlds in ways we cannot fully predict? With llm now powering multi-agent systems and social simulations, we are witnessing new possibilities for modeling open-ended, ever-changing environments. Yet, most current simulations remain constrained within static sandboxes, characterized by predefined tasks, limited dynamics, and rigid evaluation criteria. These limitations prevent them from capturing the complexity of real-world societies. In this paper, we argue that static, task-specific benchmarks are fundamentally inadequate and must be rethought. We critically review emerging architectures that blend llm with multi-agent dynamics, highlight key hurdles such as balancing stability and diversity, evaluating unexpected behaviors, and scaling to greater complexity, and introduce a fresh taxonomy for this rapidly evolving field. Finally, we present a research roadmap centered on open-endedness, continuous co-evolution, and the development of resilient, socially aligned AI ecosystems. We call on the community to move beyond static paradigms and help shape the next generation of adaptive, socially-aware multi-agent simulations.

  We present an online semantic object mapping system for a quadruped robot operating in real indoor environments, turning sensor detections into named objects in a global map. During a run, the mapper integrates range geometry with camera detections, merges co-located detections within a frame, and associates repeated detections into persistent object instances across frames. Objects remain in the map when they are out of view, and repeated sightings update the same instance rather than creating duplicates. The output is a compact object layer that can be queried (class, pose, and confidence), is integrated with the occupancy map and readable by a planner. In on-robot tests, the layer remained stable across viewpoint changes.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  For autonomous cargo transportation, teams of mobile robots can provide more operational flexibility than a single large robot. In these scenarios, precision in both inter-vehicle distance and path tracking is key. With this motivation, we develop a distributed model-predictive controller (MPC) for multi-vehicle cargo operations that builds on the precise path-tracking of lidar teach and repeat. To carry cargo, a following vehicle must maintain a Euclidean distance offset from a lead vehicle regardless of the path curvature. Our approach uses a shared map to localize the robots relative to each other without GNSS or direct observations. We compare our approach to a centralized MPC and a baseline approach that directly measures the inter-vehicle distance. The distributed MPC shows equivalent nominal performance to the more complex centralized MPC. Using a direct measurement of the relative distance between the leader and follower shows improved tracking performance in close-range scenarios but struggles with long-range offsets. The operational flexibility provided by distributing the computation makes it well suited for real deployments. We evaluate four types of convoyed path trackers with over 10 km of driving in a coupled convoy. With convoys of two and three rovers, the proposed distributed MPC method works in real-time to allow map-based convoying to maintain maximum spacing within 20 cm of the target in various conditions.

  A fundamental aspect for building intelligent autonomous robots that can assist humans in their daily lives is the construction of rich environmental representations. While advances in semantic scene representations have enriched robotic scene understanding, current approaches lack a connection between spatial features and dynamic events; e.g., connecting the blue mug to the event washing a mug. In this work, we introduce the event-grounding graph (EGG), a framework grounding event interactions to spatial features of a scene. This representation allows robots to perceive, reason, and respond to complex spatio-temporal queries. Experiments using real robotic data demonstrate EGG's capability to retrieve relevant information and respond accurately to human inquiries concerning the environment and events within. Furthermore, the EGG framework's source code and evaluation dataset are released as open-source at:this https URL.

  Legged rovers provide enhanced mobility compared to wheeled platforms, enabling navigation on steep and irregular planetary terrains. However, traditional legged locomotion might be energetically inefficient and potentially dangerous to the rover on loose and inclined surfaces, such as crater walls and cave slopes. This paper introduces a preliminary study that compares the Cost of Transport (CoT) of walking and torso-based sliding locomotion for quadruped robots across different slopes, friction conditions and speed levels. By identifying intersections between walking and sliding CoT curves, we aim to define threshold conditions that may trigger transitions between the two strategies. The methodology combines physics-based simulations in Isaac Sim with particle interaction validation in ANSYS-Rocky. Our results represent an initial step towards adaptive locomotion strategies for planetary legged rovers.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) can provide provable safety guarantees for dynamic systems. However, finding a valid CBF for a system of interest is often non-trivial, especially if the shape of the unsafe region is complex and the CBFs are of higher order. A common solution to this problem is to make a conservative approximation of the unsafe region in the form of a line/hyperplane, and use the corresponding conservative Hyperplane-CBF when deciding on safe control actions. In this letter, we note that conservative constraints are only a problem if they prevent us from doing what we want. Thus, instead of first choosing a CBF and then choosing a safe control with respect to the CBF, we optimize over a combination of CBFs and safe controls to get as close as possible to our desired control, while still having the safety guarantee provided by the CBF. We call the corresponding CBF the least restrictive Hyperplane-CBF. Finally, we also provide a way of creating a smooth parameterization of the CBF-family for the optimization, and illustrate the approach on a double integrator dynamical system with acceleration constraints, moving through a group of arbitrarily shaped static and moving obstacles.

  Missions such as the Ingenuity helicopter have shown the advantages of using novel locomotion modes to increase the scientific return of planetary exploration missions. Legged robots can further expand the reach and capability of future planetary missions by traversing more difficult terrain than wheeled rovers, such as jumping over cracks on the ground or traversing rugged terrain with boulders. To develop and test algorithms for using quadruped robots, the AAPLE project was carried out at DFKI. As part of the project, we conducted a series of field experiments on the Volcano on the Aeolian island of Vulcano, an active stratovolcano near Sicily, Italy. The experiments focused on validating newly developed state-of-the-art adaptive optimal control algorithms for quadrupedal locomotion in a high-fidelity analog environment for Lunar and Martian surfaces. This paper presents the technical approach, test plan, software architecture, field deployment strategy, and evaluation results from the Vulcano campaign.

  The aim of this paper is to design a new type of grasping and perching unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), called Flexbee, which features a soft vector-propulsion nozzle (SVPN). Compared to previous UAVs, Flexbee integrates flight, grasping, and perching functionalities into the four SVPNs. This integration offers advantages including decoupled position and attitude control, high structural reuse, and strong adaptability strong adaptability for grasping and perching. A dynamics model of Flexbee has been developed, and the nonlinear coupling issue of the moment has been resolved through linearization of the equivalent moment model. A hierarchical control strategy was used to design controllers for the two operational modes of Flexbee. Finally, flight, grasping, and perching experiments were conducted to validate Flexbee's kinematic capabilities and the effectiveness of the control strategy.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Object-goal navigation (ObjNav) tasks an agent with navigating to the location of a specific object in an unseen environment. Embodied agents equipped with large language models (LLMs) and online constructed navigation maps can perform ObjNav in a zero-shot manner. However, existing agents heavily rely on giant LLMs on the cloud, e.g., GPT-4, while directly switching to small LLMs, e.g., LLaMA3.2-11b, suffer from significant success rate drops due to limited model capacity for understanding complex navigation maps, which prevents deploying ObjNav on local devices. At the same time, the long prompt introduced by the navigation map description will cause high planning latency on local devices. In this paper, we propose EfficientNav to enable on-device efficient LLM-based zero-shot ObjNav. To help the smaller LLMs better understand the environment, we propose semantics-aware memory retrieval to prune redundant information in navigation maps. To reduce planning latency, we propose discrete memory caching and attention-based memory clustering to efficiently save and re-use the KV cache. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that EfficientNav achieves 11.1% improvement in success rate on HM3D benchmark over GPT-4-based baselines, and demonstrates 6.7x real-time latency reduction and 4.7x end-to-end latency reduction over GPT-4 planner. Our code will be released soon.

  We present an online model-based reinforcement learning algorithm suitable for controlling complex robotic systems directly in the real world. Unlike prevailing sim-to-real pipelines that rely on extensive offline simulation and model-free policy optimization, our method builds a dynamics model from real-time interaction data and performs policy updates guided by the learned dynamics model. This efficient model-based reinforcement learning scheme significantly reduces the number of samples to train control policies, enabling direct training on real-world rollout data. This significantly reduces the influence of bias in the simulated data, and facilitates the search for high-performance control policies. We adopt online learning analysis to derive sublinear regret bounds under standard stochastic online optimization assumptions, providing formal guarantees on performance improvement as more interaction data are collected. Experimental evaluations were performed on a hydraulic excavator arm and a soft robot arm, where the algorithm demonstrates strong sample efficiency compared to model-free reinforcement learning methods, reaching comparable performance within hours. Robust adaptation to shifting dynamics was also observed when the payload condition was randomized. Our approach paves the way toward efficient and reliable on-robot learning for a broad class of challenging control tasks.

  This paper presents a novel framework for real-time human action recognition in industrial contexts, using standard 2D cameras. We introduce a complete pipeline for robust and real-time estimation of human joint kinematics, input to a temporally smoothed Transformer-based network, for action recognition. We rely on a new dataset including 11 subjects performing various actions, to evaluate our approach. Unlike most of the literature that relies on joint center positions (JCP) and is offline, ours uses biomechanical prior, eg. joint angles, for fast and robust real-time recognition. Besides, joint angles make the proposed method agnostic to sensor and subject poses as well as to anthropometric differences, and ensure robustness across environments and subjects. Our proposed learning model outperforms the best baseline model, running also in real-time, along various metrics. It achieves 88% accuracy and shows great generalization ability, for subjects not facing the cameras. Finally, we demonstrate the robustness and usefulness of our technique, through an online interaction experiment, with a simulated robot controlled in real-time via the recognized actions.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  State-of-the-art perceptive Reinforcement Learning controllers for legged robots either (i) impose oscillator or IK-based gait priors that constrain the action space, add bias to the policy optimization and reduce adaptability across robot morphologies, or (ii) operate "blind", which struggle to anticipate hind-leg terrain, and are brittle to noise. In this paper, we propose Phase-Guided Terrain Traversal (PGTT), a perception-aware deep-RL approach that overcomes these limitations by enforcing gait structure purely through reward shaping, thereby reducing inductive bias in policy learning compared to oscillator/IK-conditioned action priors. PGTT encodes per-leg phase as a cubic Hermite spline that adapts swing height to local heightmap statistics and adds a swing- phase contact penalty, while the policy acts directly in joint space supporting morphology-agnostic deployment. Trained in MuJoCo (MJX) on procedurally generated stair-like terrains with curriculum and domain randomization, PGTT achieves the highest success under push disturbances (median +7.5% vs. the next best method) and on discrete obstacles (+9%), with comparable velocity tracking, and converging to an effective policy roughly 2x faster than strong end-to-end baselines. We validate PGTT on a Unitree Go2 using a real-time LiDAR elevation-to-heightmap pipeline, and we report preliminary results on ANYmal-C obtained with the same hyperparameters. These findings indicate that terrain-adaptive, phase-guided reward shaping is a simple and general mechanism for robust perceptive locomotion across platforms.

  Integrating visual-language instructions into visuomotor policies is gaining momentum in robot learning for enhancing open-world generalization. Despite promising advances, existing approaches face two challenges: limited language steerability when no generated reasoning is used as a condition, or significant inference latency when reasoning isthis http URLthis work, we introduce MoTVLA, a mixture-of-transformers (MoT)-based vision-language-action (VLA) model that integrates fast-slow unified reasoning with behavior policy learning. MoTVLA preserves the general intelligence of pre-trained VLMs (serving as the generalist) for tasks such as perception, scene understanding, and semantic planning, while incorporating a domain expert, a second transformer that shares knowledge with the pretrained VLM, to generate domain-specific fast reasoning (e.g., robot motion decomposition), thereby improving policy execution efficiency. By conditioning the action expert on decomposed motion instructions, MoTVLA can learn diverse behaviors and substantially improve language steerability. Extensive evaluations across natural language processing benchmarks, robotic simulation environments, and real-world experiments confirm the superiority of MoTVLA in both fast-slow reasoning and manipulation task performance.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Imitation learning from large-scale, diverse human demonstrations has proven effective for training robots, but collecting such data is costly and time-consuming. This challenge is amplified for multi-step bimanual mobile manipulation, where humans must teleoperate both a mobile base and two high-degree-of-freedom arms. Prior automated data generation frameworks have addressed static bimanual manipulation by augmenting a few human demonstrations in simulation, but they fall short for mobile settings due to two key challenges: (1) determining base placement to ensure reachability, and (2) positioning the camera to provide sufficient visibility for visuomotor policies. To address these issues, we introduce MoMaGen, which formulates data generation as a constrained optimization problem that enforces hard constraints (e.g., reachability) while balancing soft constraints (e.g., visibility during navigation). This formulation generalizes prior approaches and provides a principled foundation for future methods. We evaluate MoMaGen on four multi-step bimanual mobile manipulation tasks and show that it generates significantly more diverse datasets than existing methods. Leveraging this diversity, MoMaGen can train successful imitation learning policies from a single source demonstration, and these policies can be fine-tuned with as few as 40 real-world demonstrations to achieve deployment on physical robotic hardware.

  In this paper, we investigate the utility of datasets and whether more data or the 'right' data is advantageous for robot learning. In particular, we are interested on quantifying the utility of contact-based data as contact holds significant information for robot learning. Our approach derives a contact-aware objective function for learning object dynamics and shape from pose and contact data. We show that the contact-aware Fisher-information metric can be used to rank and curate contact-data based on how informative data is for learning. In addition, we find that selecting a reduced dataset based on this ranking improves the learning task while also making learning a deterministic process. Interestingly, our results show that more data is not necessarily advantageous, and rather, less but informative data can accelerate learning, especially depending on the contact interactions. Last, we show how our metric can be used to provide initial guidance on data curation for contact-based robot learning.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Imitation Learning (IL) is a natural way for humans to teach robots, particularly when high-quality demonstrations are easy to obtain. While IL has been widely applied to single-robot settings, relatively few studies have addressed the extension of these methods to multi-agent systems, especially in settings where a single human must provide demonstrations to a team of collaborating robots. In this paper, we introduce and study Round-Robin Behavior Cloning (R2BC), a method that enables a single human operator to effectively train multi-robot systems through sequential, single-agent demonstrations. Our approach allows the human to teleoperate one agent at a time and incrementally teach multi-agent behavior to the entire system, without requiring demonstrations in the joint multi-agent action space. We show that R2BC methods match, and in some cases surpass, the performance of an oracle behavior cloning approach trained on privileged synchronized demonstrations across four multi-agent simulated tasks. Finally, we deploy R2BC on two physical robot tasks trained using real human demonstrations.

  This paper addresses the problem of multi-robot navigation where robots maneuver on a desired \(m\)-dimensional (i.e., \(m\)-D) manifold in the $n$-dimensional Euclidean space, and maintain a {\it flexible spatial ordering}. We consider $ m\geq 2$, and the multi-robot coordination is achieved via non-Euclidean metrics. However, since the $m$-D manifold can be characterized by the zero-level sets of $n$ implicit functions, the last $m$ entries of the GVF propagation term become {\it strongly coupled} with the partial derivatives of these functions if the auxiliary vectors are not appropriately chosen. These couplings not only influence the on-manifold maneuvering of robots, but also pose significant challenges to the further design of the ordering-flexible coordination via non-Euclidean metrics.To tackle this issue, we first identify a feasible solution of auxiliary vectors such that the last $m$ entries of the propagation term are effectively decoupled to be the same constant. Then, we redesign the coordinated GVF (CGVF) algorithm to {\it boost} the advantages of singularities elimination and global convergence by treating $m$ manifold parameters as additional $m$ virtual coordinates. Furthermore, we enable the on-manifold ordering-flexible motion coordination by allowing each robot to share $m$ virtual coordinates with its time-varying neighbors and a virtual target robot, which {\it circumvents} the possible complex calculation if Euclidean metrics were used instead. Finally, we showcase the proposed algorithm's flexibility, adaptability, and robustness through extensive simulations with different initial positions, higher-dimensional manifolds, and robot breakdown, respectively.

  We present a reinforcement learning framework for autonomous goalkeeping with humanoid robots in real-world scenarios. While prior work has demonstrated similar capabilities on quadrupedal platforms, humanoid goalkeeping introduces two critical challenges: (1) generating natural, human-like whole-body motions, and (2) covering a wider guarding range with an equivalent response time. Unlike existing approaches that rely on separate teleoperation or fixed motion tracking for whole-body control, our method learns a single end-to-end RL policy, enabling fully autonomous, highly dynamic, and human-like robot-object interactions. To achieve this, we integrate multiple human motion priors conditioned on perceptual inputs into the RL training via an adversarial scheme. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through real-world experiments, where the humanoid robot successfully performs agile, autonomous, and naturalistic interceptions of fast-moving balls. In addition to goalkeeping, we demonstrate the generalization of our approach through tasks such as ball escaping and grabbing. Our work presents a practical and scalable solution for enabling highly dynamic interactions between robots and moving objects, advancing the field toward more adaptive and lifelike robotic behaviors.

  Automating the manipulation of granular materials poses significant challenges due to complex contact dynamics, unpredictable material properties, and intricate system states. Existing approaches often fail to achieve efficiency and accuracy in such tasks. To fill the research gap, this paper studies the small-scale and high-precision granular material digging task with unknown physical properties. A new framework, named differentiable digging robot (DDBot), is proposed to manipulate granular materials, including sand and soil.Specifically, we equip DDBot with a differentiable physics-based simulator, tailored for granular material manipulation, powered by GPU-accelerated parallel computing and automatic differentiation. DDBot can perform efficient differentiable system identification and high-precision digging skill optimisation for unknown granular materials, which is enabled by a differentiable skill-to-action mapping, a task-oriented demonstration method, gradient clipping and line search-based gradient descent.Experimental results show that DDBot can efficiently (converge within 5 to 20 minutes) identify unknown granular material dynamics and optimise digging skills, with high-precision results in zero-shot real-world deployments, highlighting its practicality. Benchmark results against state-of-the-art baselines also confirm the robustness and efficiency of DDBot in such digging tasks.

  Conventional end-to-end (E2E) driving models are effective at generating physically plausible trajectories, but often fail to generalize to long-tail scenarios due to the lack of essential world knowledge to understand and reason about surrounding environments. In contrast, Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models leverage world knowledge to handle challenging cases, but their limited 3D reasoning capability can lead to physically infeasible actions. In this work we introduce DiffVLA++, an enhanced autonomous driving framework that explicitly bridges cognitive reasoning and E2E planning through metric-guided alignment. First, we build a VLA module directly generating semantically grounded driving trajectories. Second, we design an E2E module with a dense trajectory vocabulary that ensures physical feasibility. Third, and most critically, we introduce a metric-guided trajectory scorer that guides and aligns the outputs of the VLA and E2E modules, thereby integrating their complementary strengths. The experiment on the ICCV 2025 Autonomous Grand Challenge leaderboard shows that DiffVLA++ achieves EPDMS of 49.12.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper addresses the scarcity of affordable, fully-actuated five-fingered hands for dexterous teleoperation, which is crucial for collecting large-scale real-robot data within the "Learning from Demonstrations" paradigm. We introduce the prototype version of the RAPID Hand, the first low-cost, 20-degree-of-actuation (DoA) dexterous hand that integrates a novel anthropomorphic actuation and transmission scheme with an optimized motor layout and structural design to enhance dexterity. Specifically, the RAPID Hand features a universal phalangeal transmission scheme for the non-thumb fingers and an omnidirectional thumb actuation mechanism. Prioritizing affordability, the hand employs 3D-printed parts combined with custom gears for easier replacement and repair. We assess the RAPID Hand's performance through quantitative metrics and qualitative testing in a dexterous teleoperation system, which is evaluated on three challenging tasks: multi-finger retrieval, ladle handling, and human-like piano playing. The results indicate that the RAPID Hand's fully actuated 20-DoF design holds significant promise for dexterous teleoperation.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The evaluation of Vision-Language-Action (VLA) agents is hindered by the coarse, end-task success metric that fails to provide precise skill diagnosis or measure robustness to real-world perturbations. This challenge is exacerbated by a fragmented data landscape that impedes reproducible research and the development of generalist models. To address these limitations, we introduce NEBULA, a unified ecosystem for single-arm manipulation that enables diagnostic and reproducible evaluation. NEBULA features a novel dual-axis evaluation protocol that combines fine-grained capability tests for precise skill diagnosis with systematic stress tests that measure robustness. A standardized API and a large-scale, aggregated dataset are provided to reduce fragmentation and support cross-dataset training and fair comparison. Using NEBULA, we demonstrate that top-performing VLAs struggle with key capabilities such as spatial reasoning and dynamic adaptation, which are consistently obscured by conventional end-task success metrics. By measuring both what an agent can do and when it does so reliably, NEBULA provides a practical foundation for robust, general-purpose embodied agents.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Autonomous high-speed navigation through large, complex environments requires real-time generation of agile trajectories that are dynamically feasible, collision-free, and satisfy state or actuator constraints. Modern trajectory planning techniques primarily use numerical optimization, as they enable the systematic computation of high-quality, expressive trajectories that satisfy various constraints. However, stringent requirements on computation time and the risk of numerical instability can limit the use of optimization-based planners in safety-critical scenarios. This work presents an optimization-free planning framework called STITCHER that stitches short trajectory segments together with graph search to compute long-range, expressive, and near-optimal trajectories in real-time. STITCHER outperforms modern optimization-based planners through our innovative planning architecture and several algorithmic developments that make real-time planning possible. Extensive simulation testing is performed to analyze the algorithmic components that make up STITCHER, along with a thorough comparison with two state-of-the-art optimization planners. Simulation tests show that safe trajectories can be created within a few milliseconds for paths that span the entirety of two 50 m x 50 m environments. Hardware tests with a custom quadrotor verify that STITCHER can produce trackable paths in real-time while respecting nonconvex constraints, such as limits on tilt angle and motor forces, which are otherwise hard to include in optimization-based planners.

  _Junbin Yuan, Brady Moon, Muqing Cao, Sebastian Scherer_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Achieving persistent tracking of multiple dynamic targets over a large spatial area poses significant challenges for a single-robot system with constrained sensing capabilities. As the robot moves to track different targets, the ones outside the field of view accumulate uncertainty, making them progressively harder to track. An effective path planning algorithm must manage uncertainty over a long horizon and account for the risk of permanently losing track of targets that remain unseen for too long. However, most existing approaches rely on short planning horizons and assume small, bounded environments, resulting in poor tracking performance and target loss in large-scale scenarios. In this paper, we present a hierarchical planner for tracking multiple moving targets with an aerial vehicle. To address the challenge of tracking non-static targets, our method incorporates motion models and uncertainty propagation during path execution, allowing for more informed decision-making. We decompose the multi-target tracking task into sub-tasks of single target search and detection, and our proposed pipeline consists a novel low-level coverage planner that enables searching for a target in an evolving belief area, and an estimation method to assess the likelihood of success for each sub-task, making it possible to convert the active target tracking task to a Markov decision process (MDP) that we solve with a tree-based algorithm to determine the sequence of sub-tasks. We validate our approach in simulation, demonstrating its effectiveness compared to existing planners for active target tracking tasks, and our proposed planner outperforms existing approaches, achieving a reduction of 11-70% in final uncertainty across different environments.

  Visual navigation is a fundamental problem in embodied AI, yet practical deployments demand long-horizon planning capabilities to address multi-objective tasks. A major bottleneck is data scarcity: policies learned from limited data often overfit and fail to generalize OOD. Existing neural network-based agents typically increase architectural complexity that paradoxically become counterproductive in the small-sample regime. This paper introduce NeuRO, a integrated learning-to-optimize framework that tightly couples perception networks with downstream task-level robust optimization. Specifically, NeuRO addresses core difficulties in this integration: (i) it transforms noisy visual predictions under data scarcity into convex uncertainty sets using Partially Input Convex Neural Networks (PICNNs) with conformal calibration, which directly parameterize the optimization constraints; and (ii) it reformulates planning under partial observability as a robust optimization problem, enabling uncertainty-aware policies that transfer across environments. Extensive experiments on both unordered and sequential multi-object navigation tasks demonstrate that NeuRO establishes SoTA performance, particularly in generalization to unseen environments. Our work thus presents a significant advancement for developing robust, generalizable autonomous agents.

  Generalizing to long-horizon manipulation tasks in a zero-shot setting remains a central challenge in robotics. Current multimodal foundation based approaches, despite their capabilities, typically fail to decompose high-level commands into executable action sequences from static visual input alone. To address this challenge, we introduce Super-Mimic, a hierarchical framework that enables zero-shot robotic imitation by directly inferring procedural intent from unscripted human demonstration videos. Our framework is composed of two sequential modules. First, a Human Intent Translator (HIT) parses the input video using multimodal reasoning to produce a sequence of language-grounded subtasks. These subtasks then condition a Future Dynamics Predictor (FDP), which employs a generative model that synthesizes a physically plausible video rollout for each step. The resulting visual trajectories are dynamics-aware, explicitly modeling crucial object interactions and contact points to guide the low-level controller. We validate this approach through extensive experiments on a suite of long-horizon manipulation tasks, where Super-Mimic significantly outperforms state-of-the-art zero-shot methods by over 20%. These results establish that coupling video-driven intent parsing with prospective dynamics modeling is a highly effective strategy for developing general-purpose robotic systems.

  Humanoid table tennis (TT) demands rapid perception, proactive whole-body motion, and agile footwork under strict timing -- capabilities that remain difficult for unified controllers. We propose a reinforcement learning framework that maps ball-position observations directly to whole-body joint commands for both arm striking and leg locomotion, strengthened by predictive signals and dense, physics-guided rewards. A lightweight learned predictor, fed with recent ball positions, estimates future ball states and augments the policy's observations for proactive decision-making. During training, a physics-based predictor supplies precise future states to construct dense, informative rewards that lead to effective exploration. The resulting policy attains strong performance across varied serve ranges (hit rate $\geq$ 96% and success rate $\geq$ 92%) in simulations. Ablation studies confirm that both the learned predictor and the predictive reward design are critical for end-to-end learning. Deployed zero-shot on a physical Booster T1 humanoid with 23 revolute joints, the policy produces coordinated lateral and forward-backward footwork with accurate, fast returns, suggesting a practical path toward versatile, competitive humanoid TT.

  Reliable autonomous navigation across the unstructured terrains of distant planetary surfaces is a critical enabler for future space exploration. However, the deployment of learning-based controllers is hindered by the inherent sim-to-real gap, particularly for the complex dynamics of wheel interactions with granular media. This work presents a complete sim-to-real framework for developing and validating robust control policies for dynamic waypoint tracking on such challenging surfaces. We leverage massively parallel simulation to train reinforcement learning agents across a vast distribution of procedurally generated environments with randomized physics. These policies are then transferred zero-shot to a physical wheeled rover operating in a lunar-analogue facility. Our experiments systematically compare multiple reinforcement learning algorithms and action smoothing filters to identify the most effective combinations for real-world deployment. Crucially, we provide strong empirical evidence that agents trained with procedural diversity achieve superior zero-shot performance compared to those trained on static scenarios. We also analyze the trade-offs of fine-tuning with high-fidelity particle physics, which offers minor gains in low-speed precision at a significant computational cost. Together, these contributions establish a validated workflow for creating reliable learning-based navigation systems, marking a substantial step towards deploying autonomous robots in the final frontier.

  Recent vision-language-action (VLA) models for multi-task robotic manipulation commonly rely on static viewpoints and shared visual encoders, which limit 3D perception and cause task interference, hindering robustness and generalization. In this work, we propose Task-Aware View Planning (TAVP), a framework designed to overcome these challenges by integrating active view planning with task-specific representation learning. TAVP employs an efficient exploration policy, accelerated by a novel pseudo-environment, to actively acquire informative views. Furthermore, we introduce a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) visual encoder to disentangle features across different tasks, boosting both representation fidelity and task generalization. By learning to see the world in a task-aware way, TAVP generates more complete and discriminative visual representations, demonstrating significantly enhanced action prediction across a wide array of manipulation challenges. Extensive experiments on RLBench tasks show that our proposed TAVP model achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art fixed-view approaches.

  Generalization remains a fundamental challenge in robotic manipulation. To tackle this challenge, recent Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models build policies on top of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), seeking to transfer their open-world semantic knowledge. However, their zero-shot capability lags significantly behind the base VLMs, as the instruction-vision-action data is too limited to cover diverse scenarios, tasks, and robot embodiments. In this work, we present Goal-VLA, a zero-shot framework that leverages Image-Generative VLMs as world models to generate desired goal states, from which the target object pose is derived to enable generalizable manipulation. The key insight is that object state representation is the golden interface, naturally separating a manipulation system into high-level and low-level policies. This representation abstracts away explicit action annotations, allowing the use of highly generalizable VLMs while simultaneously providing spatial cues for training-free low-level control. To further improve robustness, we introduce a Reflection-through-Synthesis process that iteratively validates and refines the generated goal image before execution. Both simulated and real-world experiments demonstrate that our \name achieves strong performance and inspiring generalizability in manipulation tasks.

  Symmetry is pervasive in robotics and has been widely exploited to improve sample efficiency in deep reinforcement learning (DRL). However, existing approaches primarily focus on spatial symmetries, such as reflection, rotation, and translation, while largely neglecting temporal symmetries. To address this gap, we explore time reversal symmetry, a form of temporal symmetry commonly found in robotics tasks such as door opening and closing. We propose Time Reversal symmetry enhanced Deep Reinforcement Learning (TR-DRL), a framework that combines trajectory reversal augmentation and time reversal guided reward shaping to efficiently solve temporally symmetric tasks. Our method generates reversed transitions from fully reversible transitions, identified by a proposed dynamics-consistent filter, to augment the training data. For partially reversible transitions, we apply reward shaping to guide learning, according to successful trajectories from the reversed task. Extensive experiments on the Robosuite and MetaWorld benchmarks demonstrate that TR-DRL is effective in both single-task and multi-task settings, achieving higher sample efficiency and stronger final performance compared to baseline methods.

  Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have demonstrated strong multi-modal reasoning capabilities, enabling direct action generation from visual perception and language instructions in an end-to-end manner. However, their substantial computational cost poses a challenge for real-time robotic control, where rapid decision-making is essential. This paper introduces VLA-Cache, a training-free inference acceleration method that reduces computational overhead by adaptively caching and reusing static visual tokens across frames. Exploiting the temporal continuity in robotic manipulation, VLA-Cache identifies minimally changed tokens between adjacent frames and reuses their cached key-value representations, thereby circumventing redundant computations. Additionally, to maintain action precision, VLA-Cache selectively re-computes task-relevant tokens that are environmentally sensitive, ensuring the fidelity of critical visual information. To further optimize efficiency, we introduce a layer adaptive token reusing strategy that dynamically adjusts the reuse ratio based on attention concentration across decoder layers, prioritizing critical tokens for recomputation. Extensive experiments on two simulation platforms (LIBERO and SIMPLER) and a real-world robotic system demonstrate that VLA-Cache achieves up to 1.7x speedup in CUDA latency and a 15% increase in control frequency, with negligible loss on task success rate.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Enabling robots to autonomously discover emergent spatial concepts (e.g., rooms) from primitive geometric observations (e.g., planar surfaces) within 3D Scene Graphs is essential for robust indoor navigation and mapping. These graphs provide a hierarchical metric-semantic representation in which such concepts are organized. To further enhance graph-SLAM performance, Factorized 3D Scene Graphs incorporate these concepts as optimization factors that constrain relative geometry and enforce global consistency. However, both stages of this process remain largely manual: concepts are typically derived using hand-crafted, concept-specific heuristics, while factors and their covariances are likewise manually designed. This reliance on manual specification limits generalization across diverse environments and scalability to new concept classes. This paper presents, for the first time, a learning-based method to generate online spatial emergent concepts as optimizable factors within a SLAM backend, reducing the need to handcraft both concept generation and the definition of their corresponding factors and covariances. In both simulated and real indoor scenarios, our approach improves complex concept detection by 20.7% and 5.3%, trajectory estimation by 19.2%, and map reconstruction by 12.3% and 3.8%, respectively, highlighting the benefits of this integration for robust and adaptive spatial understanding.

  Information sharing is critical in time-sensitive and realistic multi-robot exploration, especially for smaller robotic teams in large-scale environments where connectivity may be sparse and intermittent. Existing methods often overlook such communication constraints by assuming unrealistic global connectivity. Other works account for communication constraints (by maintaining close proximity or line of sight during information exchange), but are often inefficient. For instance, preplanned rendezvous approaches typically involve unnecessary detours resulting from poorly timed rendezvous, while pursuit-based approaches often result in short-sighted decisions due to their greedy nature. We present IR2, a deep reinforcement learning approach to information sharing for multi-robot exploration. Leveraging attention-based neural networks trained via reinforcement and curriculum learning, IR2 allows robots to effectively reason about the longer-term trade-offs between disconnecting for solo exploration and reconnecting for information sharing. In addition, we propose a hierarchical graph formulation to maintain a sparse yet informative graph, enabling our approach to scale to large-scale environments. We present simulation results in three large-scale Gazebo environments, which show that our approach yields 6.6-34.1% shorter exploration paths when compared to state-of-the-art baselines, and lastly deploy our learned policy on hardware. Our simulation training and testing code is available atthis https URL.

  We present an efficient task and motion replanning approach for sequential multi-object manipulation in dynamic environments. Conventional Task And Motion Planning (TAMP) solvers experience an exponential increase in planning time as the planning horizon and number of objects grow, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios. To address this, we propose learning problem decompositions from demonstrations to accelerate TAMP solvers. Our approach consists of three key components: goal decomposition learning, computational distance learning, and object reduction. Goal decomposition identifies the necessary sequences of states that the system must pass through before reaching the final goal, treating them as subgoal sequences. Computational distance learning predicts the computational complexity between two states, enabling the system to identify the temporally closest subgoal from a disturbed state. Object reduction minimizes the set of active objects considered during replanning, further improving efficiency. We evaluate our approach on three benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness in improving replanning efficiency for sequential multi-object manipulation tasks in dynamic environments.

  Robot learning of manipulation skills is hindered by the scarcity of diverse, unbiased datasets. While curated datasets can help, challenges remain in generalizability and real-world transfer. Meanwhile, large-scale "in-the-wild" video datasets have driven progress in computer vision through self-supervised techniques. Translating this to robotics, recent works have explored learning manipulation skills by passively watching abundant videos sourced online. Showing promising results, such video-based learning paradigms provide scalable supervision while reducing dataset bias. This survey reviews foundations such as video feature representation learning techniques, object affordance understanding, 3D hand/body modeling, and large-scale robot resources, as well as emerging techniques for acquiring robot manipulation skills from uncontrolled video demonstrations. We discuss how learning only from observing large-scale human videos can enhance generalization and sample efficiency for robotic manipulation. The survey summarizes video-based learning approaches, analyses their benefits over standard datasets, survey metrics, and benchmarks, and discusses open challenges and future directions in this nascent domain at the intersection of computer vision, natural language processing, and robot learning.
