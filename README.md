- **[Generalizable Geometric Image Caption Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15217)**  `arXiv:2509.15217`  
  _Yue Xin, Wenyuan Wang, Rui Pan, Ruida Wang, Howard Meng, Renjie Pi, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multimodal large language models have various practical applications that demand strong reasoning abilities. Despite recent advancements, these models still struggle to solve complex geometric problems. A key challenge stems from the lack of high-quality image-text pair datasets for understanding geometric images. Furthermore, most template-based data synthesis pipelines typically fail to generalize to questions beyond their predefined templates. In this paper, we bridge this gap by introducing a complementary process of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) into the data generation pipeline. By adopting RLVR to refine captions for geometric images synthesized from 50 basic geometric relations and using reward signals derived from mathematical problem-solving tasks, our pipeline successfully captures the key features of geometry problem-solving. This enables better task generalization and yields non-trivial improvements. Furthermore, even in out-of-distribution scenarios, the generated dataset enhances the general reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models, yielding accuracy improvements of $2.8\%\text{-}4.8\%$ in statistics, arithmetic, algebraic, and numerical tasks with non-geometric input images of MathVista and MathVerse, along with $2.4\%\text{-}3.9\%$ improvements in Art, Design, Tech, and Engineering tasks in MMMU.

- **[Internalizing Self-Consistency in Language Models: Multi-Agent Consensus Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15172)**  `arXiv:2509.15172`  
  _Ankur Samanta, Akshayaa Magesh, Youliang Yu, Runzhe Wu, Ayush Jain, Daniel Jiang, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Language Models (LMs) are inconsistent reasoners, often generating contradictory responses to identical prompts. While inference-time methods can mitigate these inconsistencies, they fail to address the core problem: LMs struggle to reliably select reasoning pathways leading to consistent outcomes under exploratory sampling. To address this, we formalize self-consistency as an intrinsic property of well-aligned reasoning models and introduce Multi-Agent Consensus Alignment (MACA), a reinforcement learning framework that post-trains models to favor reasoning trajectories aligned with their internal consensus using majority/minority outcomes from multi-agent debate. These trajectories emerge from deliberative exchanges where agents ground reasoning in peer arguments, not just aggregation of independent attempts, creating richer consensus signals than single-round majority voting. MACA enables agents to teach themselves to be more decisive and concise, and better leverage peer insights in multi-agent settings without external supervision, driving substantial improvements across self-consistency (+27.6% on GSM8K), single-agent reasoning (+23.7% on MATH), sampling-based inference (+22.4% Pass@20 on MATH), and multi-agent ensemble decision-making (+42.7% on MathQA). These findings, coupled with strong generalization to unseen benchmarks (+16.3% on GPQA, +11.6% on CommonsenseQA), demonstrate robust self-alignment that more reliably unlocks latent reasoning potential of language models.

- **[A Knowledge-driven Adaptive Collaboration of LLMs for Enhancing Medical Decision-making](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14998)**  `arXiv:2509.14998`  
  _Xiao Wu, Ting-Zhu Huang, Liang-Jian Deng, Yanyuan Qiao, Imran Razzak, Yutong Xie_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Medical decision-making often involves integrating knowledge from multiple clinical specialties, typically achieved through multidisciplinary teams. Inspired by this collaborative process, recent work has leveraged large language models (LLMs) in multi-agent collaboration frameworks to emulate expert teamwork. While these approaches improve reasoning through agent interaction, they are limited by static, pre-assigned roles, which hinder adaptability and dynamic knowledge integration. To address these limitations, we propose KAMAC, a Knowledge-driven Adaptive Multi-Agent Collaboration framework that enables LLM agents to dynamically form and expand expert teams based on the evolving diagnostic context. KAMAC begins with one or more expert agents and then conducts a knowledge-driven discussion to identify and fill knowledge gaps by recruiting additional specialists as needed. This supports flexible, scalable collaboration in complex clinical scenarios, with decisions finalized through reviewing updated agent comments. Experiments on two real-world medical benchmarks demonstrate that KAMAC significantly outperforms both single-agent and advanced multi-agent methods, particularly in complex clinical scenarios (i.e., cancer prognosis) requiring dynamic, cross-specialty expertise. Our code is publicly available at:this https URL.

- **[Set Contribution Functions for Quantitative Bipolar Argumentation and their Principles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14963)**  `arXiv:2509.14963`  
  _Filip Naudot, Andreas Br√§nnstr√∂m, Vicen√ß Torra, Timotheus Kampik_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present functions that quantify the contribution of a set of arguments in quantitative bipolar argumentation graphs to (the final strength of) an argument of interest, a so-called topic. Our set contribution functions are generalizations of existing functions that quantify the contribution of a single contributing argument to a topic. Accordingly, we generalize existing contribution function principles for set contribution functions and provide a corresponding principle-based analysis. We introduce new principles specific to set-based functions that focus on properties pertaining to the interaction of arguments within a set. Finally, we sketch how the principles play out across different set contribution functions given a recommendation system application scenario.

- **[Sentinel Agents for Secure and Trustworthy Agentic AI in Multi-Agent Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14956)**  `arXiv:2509.14956`  
  _Diego Gosmar, Deborah A. Dahl_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper proposes a novel architectural framework aimed at enhancing security and reliability in multi-agent systems (MAS). A central component of this framework is a network of Sentinel Agents, functioning as a distributed security layer that integrates techniques such as semantic analysis via large language models (LLMs), behavioral analytics, retrieval-augmented verification, and cross-agent anomaly detection. Such agents can potentially oversee inter-agent communications, identify potential threats, enforce privacy and access controls, and maintain comprehensive audit records. Complementary to the idea of Sentinel Agents is the use of a Coordinator Agent. The Coordinator Agent supervises policy implementation, and manages agent participation. In addition, the Coordinator also ingests alerts from Sentinel Agents. Based on these alerts, it can adapt policies, isolate or quarantine misbehaving agents, and contain threats to maintain the integrity of the MAS ecosystem. This dual-layered security approach, combining the continuous monitoring of Sentinel Agents with the governance functions of Coordinator Agents, supports dynamic and adaptive defense mechanisms against a range of threats, including prompt injection, collusive agent behavior, hallucinations generated by LLMs, privacy breaches, and coordinated multi-agent attacks. In addition to the architectural design, we present a simulation study where 162 synthetic attacks of different families (prompt injection, hallucination, and data exfiltration) were injected into a multi-agent conversational environment. The Sentinel Agents successfully detected the attack attempts, confirming the practical feasibility of the proposed monitoring approach. The framework also offers enhanced system observability, supports regulatory compliance, and enables policy evolution over time.

- **[Explainable AI for Infection Prevention and Control: Modeling CPE Acquisition and Patient Outcomes in an Irish Hospital with Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14942)**  `arXiv:2509.14942`  
  _Minh-Khoi Pham, Tai Tan Mai, Martin Crane, Rob Brennan, Marie E. Ward, Una Geary, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Carbapenemase-Producing Enterobacteriace poses a critical concern for infection prevention and control in hospitals. However, predictive modeling of previously highlighted CPE-associated risks such as readmission, mortality, and extended length of stay (LOS) remains underexplored, particularly with modern deep learning approaches. This study introduces an eXplainable AI modeling framework to investigate CPE impact on patient outcomes from Electronic Medical Records data of an Irish hospital. We analyzed an inpatient dataset from an Irish acute hospital, incorporating diagnostic codes, ward transitions, patient demographics, infection-related variables and contact network features. Several Transformer-based architectures were benchmarked alongside traditional machine learning models. Clinical outcomes were predicted, and XAI techniques were applied to interpret model decisions. Our framework successfully demonstrated the utility of Transformer-based models, with TabTransformer consistently outperforming baselines across multiple clinical prediction tasks, especially for CPE acquisition (AUROC and sensitivity). We found infection-related features, including historical hospital exposure, admission context, and network centrality measures, to be highly influential in predicting patient outcomes and CPE acquisition risk. Explainability analyses revealed that features like "Area of Residence", "Admission Ward" and prior admissions are key risk factors. Network variables like "Ward PageRank" also ranked highly, reflecting the potential value of structural exposure information. This study presents a robust and explainable AI framework for analyzing complex EMR data to identify key risk factors and predict CPE-related outcomes. Our findings underscore the superior performance of the Transformer models and highlight the importance of diverse clinical and network features.

- **[OpenLens AI: Fully Autonomous Research Agent for Health Infomatics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14778)**  `arXiv:2509.14778`  
  _Yuxiao Cheng, Jinli Suo_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Health informatics research is characterized by diverse data modalities, rapid knowledge expansion, and the need to integrate insights across biomedical science, data analytics, and clinical practice. These characteristics make it particularly well-suited for agent-based approaches that can automate knowledge exploration, manage complex workflows, and generate clinically meaningful outputs. Recent progress in large language model (LLM)-based agents has demonstrated promising capabilities in literature synthesis, data analysis, and even end-to-end research execution. However, existing systems remain limited for health informatics because they lack mechanisms to interpret medical visualizations and often overlook domain-specific quality requirements. To address these gaps, we introduce OpenLens AI, a fully automated framework tailored to health informatics. OpenLens AI integrates specialized agents for literature review, data analysis, code generation, and manuscript preparation, enhanced by vision-language feedback for medical visualization and quality control for reproducibility. The framework automates the entire research pipeline, producing publication-ready LaTeX manuscripts with transparent and traceable workflows, thereby offering a domain-adapted solution for advancing health informatics research.

- **[Enhancing Retrieval Augmentation via Adversarial Collaboration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14750)**  `arXiv:2509.14750`  
  _Letian Zhang, Guanghao Meng, Xudong Ren, Yiming Wang, Shu-Tao Xia_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Retrieval-augmented Generation (RAG) is a prevalent approach for domain-specific LLMs, yet it is often plagued by "Retrieval Hallucinations"--a phenomenon where fine-tuned models fail to recognize and act upon poor-quality retrieved documents, thus undermining performance. To address this, we propose the Adversarial Collaboration RAG (AC-RAG) framework. AC-RAG employs two heterogeneous agents: a generalist Detector that identifies knowledge gaps, and a domain-specialized Resolver that provides precise solutions. Guided by a moderator, these agents engage in an adversarial collaboration, where the Detector's persistent questioning challenges the Resolver's expertise. This dynamic process allows for iterative problem dissection and refined knowledge retrieval. Extensive experiments show that AC-RAG significantly improves retrieval accuracy and outperforms state-of-the-art RAG methods across various vertical domains.

- **[The NazoNazo Benchmark: A Cost-Effective and Extensible Test of Insight-Based Reasoning in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14704)**  `arXiv:2509.14704`  
  _Masaharu Mizumoto, Dat Nguyen, Zhiheng Han, Jiyuan Fang, Heyuan Guan, Xingfu Li, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Benchmark saturation and contamination undermine confidence in LLM evaluation. We present Nazonazo, a cost-effective and extensible benchmark built from Japanese children's riddles to test insight-based reasoning. Items are short (mostly one sentence), require no specialized domain knowledge, and can be generated at scale, enabling rapid refresh of blind sets when leakage is suspected. We evaluate 38 frontier models and 126 adults on 120 riddles. No model except for GPT-5 is comparable to human performance, which achieves a 52.9% mean accuracy. Model comparison on extended 201 items shows that reasoning models significantly outperform non-reasoning peers, while model size shows no reliable association with accuracy. Beyond aggregate accuracy, an informal candidate-tracking analysis of thought logs reveals many cases of verification failure: models often produce the correct solution among intermediate candidates yet fail to select it as the final answer, which we illustrate with representative examples observed in multiple models. Nazonazo thus offers a cost-effective, scalable, and easily renewable benchmark format that addresses the current evaluation crisis while also suggesting a recurrent meta-cognitive weakness, providing clear targets for future control and calibration methods.

- **[RationAnomaly: Log Anomaly Detection with Rationality via Chain-of-Thought and Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14693)**  `arXiv:2509.14693`  
  _Song Xu, Yilun Liu, Minggui He, Mingchen Dai, Ziang Chen, Chunguang Zhao, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Logs constitute a form of evidence signaling the operational status of software systems. Automated log anomaly detection is crucial for ensuring the reliability of modern software systems. However, existing approaches face significant limitations: traditional deep learning models lack interpretability and generalization, while methods leveraging Large Language Models are often hindered by unreliability and factual inaccuracies. To address these issues, we propose RationAnomaly, a novel framework that enhances log anomaly detection by synergizing Chain-of-Thought (CoT) fine-tuning with reinforcement learning. Our approach first instills expert-like reasoning patterns using CoT-guided supervised fine-tuning, grounded in a high-quality dataset corrected through a rigorous expert-driven process. Subsequently, a reinforcement learning phase with a multi-faceted reward function optimizes for accuracy and logical consistency, effectively mitigating hallucinations. Experimentally, RationAnomaly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving superior F1-scores on key benchmarks while providing transparent, step-by-step analytical outputs. We have released the corresponding resources, including code and datasets.

- **[Understanding the Thinking Process of Reasoning Models: A Perspective from Schoenfeld's Episode Theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14662)**  `arXiv:2509.14662`  
  _Ming Li, Nan Zhang, Chenrui Fan, Hong Jiao, Yanbin Fu, Sydney Peters, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  While Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) generate extensive chain-of-thought reasoning, we lack a principled framework for understanding how these thoughts are structured. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach by applying Schoenfeld's Episode Theory, a classic cognitive framework for human mathematical problem-solving, to analyze the reasoning traces of LRMs. We annotated thousands of sentences and paragraphs from model-generated solutions to math problems using seven cognitive labels (e.g., Plan, Implement, Verify). The result is the first publicly available benchmark for the fine-grained analysis of machine reasoning, including a large annotated corpus and detailed annotation guidebooks. Our preliminary analysis reveals distinct patterns in LRM reasoning, such as the transition dynamics between cognitive states. This framework provides a theoretically grounded methodology for interpreting LRM cognition and enables future work on more controllable and transparent reasoning systems.

  _NVJK Kartik, Garvit Sapra, Rishav Hada, Nikhil Pareek_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  With the growing adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) in automating complex, multi-agent workflows, organizations face mounting risks from errors, emergent behaviors, and systemic failures that current evaluation methods fail to capture. We present AgentCompass, the first evaluation framework designed specifically for post-deployment monitoring and debugging of agentic workflows. AgentCompass models the reasoning process of expert debuggers through a structured, multi-stage analytical pipeline: error identification and categorization, thematic clustering, quantitative scoring, and strategic summarization. The framework is further enhanced with a dual memory system-episodic and semantic-that enables continual learning across executions. Through collaborations with design partners, we demonstrate the framework's practical utility on real-world deployments, before establishing its efficacy against the publicly available TRAIL benchmark. AgentCompass achieves state-of-the-art results on key metrics, while uncovering critical issues missed in human annotations, underscoring its role as a robust, developer-centric tool for reliable monitoring and improvement of agentic systems in production.

- **[SynBench: A Benchmark for Differentially Private Text Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14594)**  `arXiv:2509.14594`  
  _Yidan Sun, Viktor Schlegel, Srinivasan Nandakumar, Iqra Zahid, Yuping Wu, Yulong Wu, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Data-driven decision support in high-stakes domains like healthcare and finance faces significant barriers to data sharing due to regulatory, institutional, and privacy concerns. While recent generative AI models, such as large language models, have shown impressive performance in open-domain tasks, their adoption in sensitive environments remains limited by unpredictable behaviors and insufficient privacy-preserving datasets for benchmarking. Existing anonymization methods are often inadequate, especially for unstructured text, as redaction and masking can still allow re-identification. Differential Privacy (DP) offers a principled alternative, enabling the generation of synthetic data with formal privacy assurances. In this work, we address these challenges through three key contributions. First, we introduce a comprehensive evaluation framework with standardized utility and fidelity metrics, encompassing nine curated datasets that capture domain-specific complexities such as technical jargon, long-context dependencies, and specialized document structures. Second, we conduct a large-scale empirical study benchmarking state-of-the-art DP text generation methods and LLMs of varying sizes and different fine-tuning strategies, revealing that high-quality domain-specific synthetic data generation under DP constraints remains an unsolved challenge, with performance degrading as domain complexity increases. Third, we develop a membership inference attack (MIA) methodology tailored for synthetic text, providing first empirical evidence that the use of public datasets - potentially present in pre-training corpora - can invalidate claimed privacy guarantees. Our findings underscore the urgent need for rigorous privacy auditing and highlight persistent gaps between open-domain and specialist evaluations, informing responsible deployment of generative AI in privacy-sensitive, high-stakes settings.

- **[(P)rior(D)yna(F)low: A Priori Dynamic Workflow Construction via Multi-Agent Collaboration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14547)**  `arXiv:2509.14547`  
  _Yi Lin, Lujin Zhao, Yijie Shi_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent studies have shown that carefully designed workflows coordinating large language models(LLMs) significantly enhance task-solving capabilities compared to using a single model. While an increasing number of works focus on autonomous workflow construction, most existing approaches rely solely on historical experience, leading to limitations in efficiency and adaptability. We argue that while historical experience is valuable, workflow construction should also flexibly respond to the unique characteristics of each task. To this end, we propose an a priori dynamic framework for automated workflow construction. Our framework first leverages Q-table learning to optimize the decision space, guiding agent decisions and enabling effective use of historical experience. At the same time, agents evaluate the current task progress and make a priori decisions regarding the next executing agent, allowing the system to proactively select the more suitable workflow structure for each given task. Additionally, we incorporate mechanisms such as cold-start initialization, early stopping, and pruning to further improve system efficiency. Experimental evaluations on four benchmark datasets demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of our approach. Compared to state-of-the-art baselines, our method achieves an average improvement of 4.05%, while reducing workflow construction and inference costs to only 30.68%-48.31% of those required by existing methods.

- **[Rationality Check! Benchmarking the Rationality of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14546)**  `arXiv:2509.14546`  
  _Zhilun Zhou, Jing Yi Wang, Nicholas Sukiennik, Chen Gao, Fengli Xu, Yong Li, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs), a recent advance in deep learning and machine intelligence, have manifested astonishing capacities, now considered among the most promising for artificial general intelligence. With human-like capabilities, LLMs have been used to simulate humans and serve as AI assistants across many applications. As a result, great concern has arisen about whether and under what circumstances LLMs think and behave like real human agents. Rationality is among the most important concepts in assessing human behavior, both in thinking (i.e., theoretical rationality) and in taking action (i.e., practical rationality). In this work, we propose the first benchmark for evaluating the omnibus rationality of LLMs, covering a wide range of domains and LLMs. The benchmark includes an easy-to-use toolkit, extensive experimental results, and analysis that illuminates where LLMs converge and diverge from idealized human rationality. We believe the benchmark can serve as a foundational tool for both developers and users of LLMs.

  _Jian Chen, Zhenyan Chen, Xuming Hu, Peilin Zhou, Yining Hua, Han Fang, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Natural Language to SQL (NL2SQL) provides a new model-centric paradigm that simplifies database access for non-technical users by converting natural language queries into SQL commands. Recent advancements, particularly those integrating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, have made significant strides in enhancing NL2SQL performance. However, challenges such as inaccurate task decomposition and keyword extraction by LLMs remain major bottlenecks, often leading to errors in SQL generation. While existing datasets aim to mitigate these issues by fine-tuning models, they struggle with over-fragmentation of tasks and lack of domain-specific keyword annotations, limiting their effectiveness. To address these limitations, we present DeKeyNLU, a novel dataset which contains 1,500 meticulously annotated QA pairs aimed at refining task decomposition and enhancing keyword extraction precision for the RAG pipeline. Fine-tuned with DeKeyNLU, we propose DeKeySQL, a RAG-based NL2SQL pipeline that employs three distinct modules for user question understanding, entity retrieval, and generation to improve SQL generation accuracy. We benchmarked multiple model configurations within DeKeySQL RAG pipeline. Experimental results demonstrate that fine-tuning with DeKeyNLU significantly improves SQL generation accuracy on both BIRD (62.31% to 69.10%) and Spider (84.2% to 88.7%) dev datasets.

  _Marko Tesic, Yue Zhao, Joel Z. Leibo, Rakshit S. Trivedi, Jose Hernandez-Orallo_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The development and evaluation of social capabilities in AI agents require complex environments where competitive and cooperative behaviours naturally emerge. While game-theoretic properties can explain why certain teams or agent populations outperform others, more abstract behaviours, such as convention following, are harder to control in training and evaluation settings. The Melting Pot contest is a social AI evaluation suite designed to assess the cooperation capabilities of AI systems. In this paper, we apply a Bayesian approach known as Measurement Layouts to infer the capability profiles of multi-agent systems in the Melting Pot contest. We show that these capability profiles not only predict future performance within the Melting Pot suite but also reveal the underlying prosocial abilities of agents. Our analysis indicates that while higher prosocial capabilities sometimes correlate with better performance, this is not a universal trend-some lower-scoring agents exhibit stronger cooperation abilities. Furthermore, we find that top-performing contest submissions are more likely to achieve high scores in scenarios where prosocial capabilities are not required. These findings, together with reports that the contest winner used a hard-coded solution tailored to specific environments, suggest that at least one top-performing team may have optimised for conditions where cooperation was not necessary, potentially exploiting limitations in the evaluation framework. We provide recommendations for improving the annotation of cooperation demands and propose future research directions to account for biases introduced by different testing environments. Our results demonstrate that Measurement Layouts offer both strong predictive accuracy and actionable insights, contributing to a more transparent and generalisable approach to evaluating AI systems in complex social settings.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Benchmarks such as SWE-bench and ARC-AGI demonstrate how shared datasets accelerate progress toward artificial general intelligence (AGI). We introduce VCBench, the first benchmark for predicting founder success in venture capital (VC), a domain where signals are sparse, outcomes are uncertain, and even top investors perform modestly. At inception, the market index achieves a precision of 1.9%. Y Combinator outperforms the index by a factor of 1.7x, while tier-1 firms are 2.9x better. VCBench provides 9,000 anonymized founder profiles, standardized to preserve predictive features while resisting identity leakage, with adversarial tests showing more than 90% reduction in re-identification risk. We evaluate nine state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs). DeepSeek-V3 delivers over six times the baseline precision, GPT-4o achieves the highest F0.5, and most models surpass human benchmarks. Designed as a public and evolving resource available atthis http URL, VCBench establishes a community-driven standard for reproducible and privacy-preserving evaluation of AGI in early-stage venture forecasting.

- **[Detecting Pipeline Failures through Fine-Grained Analysis of Web Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14382)**  `arXiv:2509.14382`  
  _Daniel R√∂der, Akhil Juneja, Roland Roller, Sven Schmeier_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Web agents powered by large language models (LLMs) can autonomously perform complex, multistep tasks in dynamic web environments. However, current evaluations mostly focus on the overall success while overlooking intermediate errors. This limits insight into failure modes and hinders systematic improvement. This work analyzes existing benchmarks and highlights the lack of fine-grained diagnostic tools. To address this gap, we propose a modular evaluation framework that decomposes agent pipelines into interpretable stages for detailed error analysis. Using the SeeAct framework and the Mind2Web dataset as a case study, we show how this approach reveals actionable weaknesses missed by standard metrics - paving the way for more robust and generalizable web agents.

  _Lanxiao Huang, Daksh Dave, Ming Jin, Tyler Cody, Peter Beling_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to automate or augment penetration testing, but their effectiveness and reliability across attack phases remain unclear. We present a comprehensive evaluation of multiple LLM-based agents, from single-agent to modular designs, across realistic penetration testing scenarios, measuring empirical performance and recurring failure patterns. We also isolate the impact of five core functional capabilities via targeted augmentations: Global Context Memory (GCM), Inter-Agent Messaging (IAM), Context-Conditioned Invocation (CCI), Adaptive Planning (AP), and Real-Time Monitoring (RTM). These interventions support, respectively: (i) context coherence and retention, (ii) inter-component coordination and state management, (iii) tool use accuracy and selective execution, (iv) multi-step strategic planning, error detection, and recovery, and (v) real-time dynamic responsiveness. Our results show that while some architectures natively exhibit subsets of these properties, targeted augmentations substantially improve modular agent performance, especially in complex, multi-step, and real-time penetration testing tasks.

  _Asif Azad, Mohammad Sadat Hossain, MD Sadik Hossain Shanto, M Saifur Rahman, Md Rizwan Parvez_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in complex visual understanding across scientific and reasoning tasks. While performance benchmarking has advanced our understanding of these capabilities, the critical dimension of uncertainty quantification has received insufficient attention. Therefore, unlike prior conformal prediction studies that focused on limited settings, we conduct a comprehensive uncertainty benchmarking study, evaluating 16 state-of-the-art VLMs (open and closed-source) across 6 multimodal datasets with 3 distinct scoring functions. Our findings demonstrate that larger models consistently exhibit better uncertainty quantification; models that know more also know better what they don't know. More certain models achieve higher accuracy, while mathematical and reasoning tasks elicit poorer uncertainty performance across all models compared to other domains.

  Adapting advertisements for multilingual audiences requires more than simple text translation; it demands preservation of visual consistency, spatial alignment, and stylistic integrity across diverse languages and formats. We introduce a structured framework that combines automated components with human oversight to address the complexities of advertisement localization. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to integrate scene text detection, inpainting, machine translation (MT), and text reimposition specifically for accelerating ad localization evaluation workflows. Qualitative results across six locales demonstrate that our approach produces semantically accurate and visually coherent localized advertisements, suitable for deployment in real-world workflows.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  LLMs have shown strong performance on human-centric reasoning tasks. While previous evaluations have explored whether LLMs can infer intentions or detect deception, they often overlook the individualized reasoning styles that influence how people interpret and act in social contexts. Social deduction games (SDGs) provide a natural testbed for evaluating individualized reasoning styles, where different players may adopt diverse but contextually valid reasoning strategies under identical conditions. To address this, we introduce InMind, a cognitively grounded evaluation framework designed to assess whether LLMs can capture and apply personalized reasoning styles in SDGs. InMind enhances structured gameplay data with round-level strategy traces and post-game reflections, collected under both Observer and Participant modes. It supports four cognitively motivated tasks that jointly evaluate both static alignment and dynamic adaptation. As a case study, we apply InMind to the game Avalon, evaluating 11 state-of-the-art LLMs. General-purpose LLMs, even GPT-4o frequently rely on lexical cues, struggling to anchor reflections in temporal gameplay or adapt to evolving strategies. In contrast, reasoning-enhanced LLMs like DeepSeek-R1 exhibit early signs of style-sensitive reasoning. These findings reveal key limitations in current LLMs' capacity for individualized, adaptive reasoning, and position InMind as a step toward cognitively aligned human-AI interaction.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multivariate Time Series Forecasting plays a key role in many applications. Recent works have explored using Large Language Models for MTSF to take advantage of their reasoning abilities. However, many methods treat LLMs as end-to-end forecasters, which often leads to a loss of numerical precision and forces LLMs to handle patterns beyond their intended design. Alternatively, methods that attempt to align textual and time series modalities within latent space frequently encounter alignment difficulty. In this paper, we propose to treat LLMs not as standalone forecasters, but as semantic guidance modules within a dual-stream framework. We propose DualSG, a dual-stream framework that provides explicit semantic guidance, where LLMs act as Semantic Guides to refine rather than replace traditional predictions. As part of DualSG, we introduce Time Series Caption, an explicit prompt format that summarizes trend patterns in natural language and provides interpretable context for LLMs, rather than relying on implicit alignment between text and time series in the latent space. We also design a caption-guided fusion module that explicitly models inter-variable relationships while reducing noise and computation. Experiments on real-world datasets from diverse domains show that DualSG consistently outperforms 15 state-of-the-art baselines, demonstrating the value of explicitly combining numerical forecasting with semantic guidance.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  LLM-as-Judge has emerged as a scalable alternative to human evaluation, enabling large language models (LLMs) to provide reward signals in trainings. While recent work has explored multi-agent extensions such as multi-agent debate and meta-judging to enhance evaluation quality, the question of how intrinsic biases manifest in these settings remains underexplored. In this study, we conduct a systematic analysis of four diverse bias types: position bias, verbosity bias, chain-of-thought bias, and bandwagon bias. We evaluate these biases across two widely adopted multi-agent LLM-as-Judge frameworks: Multi-Agent-Debate and LLM-as-Meta-Judge. Our results show that debate framework amplifies biases sharply after the initial debate, and this increased bias is sustained in subsequent rounds, while meta-judge approaches exhibit greater resistance. We further investigate the incorporation of PINE, a leading single-agent debiasing method, as a bias-free agent within these systems. The results reveal that this bias-free agent effectively reduces biases in debate settings but provides less benefit in meta-judge scenarios. Our work provides a comprehensive study of bias behavior in multi-agent LLM-as-Judge systems and highlights the need for targeted bias mitigation strategies in collaborative evaluation settings.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this paper, we tackle the problem of learning to play 3v3 multi-drone volleyball, a new embodied competitive task that requires both high-level strategic coordination and low-level agile control. The task is turn-based, multi-agent, and physically grounded, posing significant challenges due to its long-horizon dependencies, tight inter-agent coupling, and the underactuated dynamics of quadrotors. To address this, we propose Hierarchical Co-Self-Play (HCSP), a hierarchical reinforcement learning framework that separates centralized high-level strategic decision-making from decentralized low-level motion control. We design a three-stage population-based training pipeline to enable both strategy and skill to emerge from scratch without expert demonstrations: (I) training diverse low-level skills, (II) learning high-level strategy via self-play with fixed low-level skills, and (III) joint fine-tuning through co-self-play. Experiments show that HCSP achieves superior performance, outperforming non-hierarchical self-play and rule-based hierarchical baselines with an average 82.9% win rate and a 71.5% win rate against the two-stage variant. Moreover, co-self-play leads to emergent team behaviors such as role switching and coordinated formations, demonstrating the effectiveness of our hierarchical design and training scheme.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  AutomationML has seen widespread adoption as an open data exchange format in the automation domain. It is an open and vendor neutral standard based on the extensible markup language XML. However, AutomationML extends XML with additional semantics that limit the applicability of common XML-tools for applications like querying or data validation. This article demonstrates how the transformation of AutomationML into OWL enables new use cases in querying with SPARQL and validation with SHACL. To support this, it provides practitioners with (1) an up-to-date ontology of the concepts defined in the AutomationML standard and (2) a declarative mapping to automatically transform any AutomationML model into RDF triples. A study on examples from the automation domain concludes that transforming AutomationML to OWL opens up new powerful ways for querying and validation that would have been impossible without this transformation.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The problem of data contamination is now almost inevitable during the development of large language models (LLMs), with the training data commonly integrating those evaluation benchmarks even unintentionally. This problem subsequently makes it hard to benchmark LLMs fairly. Instead of constructing contamination-free datasets (quite hard), we propose a novel framework, \textbf{LNE-Blocking}, to restore model performance prior to contamination on potentially leaked datasets. Our framework consists of two components: contamination detection and disruption operation. For the prompt, the framework first uses the contamination detection method, \textbf{LNE}, to assess the extent of contamination in the model. Based on this, it adjusts the intensity of the disruption operation, \textbf{Blocking}, to elicit non-memorized responses from the model. Our framework is the first to efficiently restore the model's greedy decoding performance. This comes with a strong performance on multiple datasets with potential leakage risks, and it consistently achieves stable recovery results across different models and varying levels of data contamination. We release the code atthis https URLto facilitate research.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Slide decks, serving as digital reports that bridge the gap between presentation slides and written documents, are a prevalent medium for conveying information in both academic and corporate settings. Their multimodal nature, combining text, images, and charts, presents challenges for retrieval-augmented generation systems, where the quality of retrieval directly impacts downstream performance. Traditional approaches to slide retrieval often involve separate indexing of modalities, which can increase complexity and lose contextual information. This paper investigates various methodologies for effective slide retrieval, including visual late-interaction embedding models like ColPali, the use of visual rerankers, and hybrid retrieval techniques that combine dense retrieval with BM25, further enhanced by textual rerankers and fusion methods like Reciprocal Rank Fusion. A novel Vision-Language Models-based captioning pipeline is also evaluated, demonstrating significantly reduced embedding storage requirements compared to visual late-interaction techniques, alongside comparable retrieval performance. Our analysis extends to the practical aspects of these methods, evaluating their runtime performance and storage demands alongside retrieval efficacy, thus offering practical guidance for the selection and development of efficient and robust slide retrieval systems for real-world applications.

  _Irina Proskurina, Guillaume Metzler, Julien Velcin_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  High memory demands of generative language models have drawn attention to quantization, which reduces computational cost, memory usage, and latency by mapping model weights to lower-precision integers. Approaches such as GPTQ effectively minimize input-weight product errors during quantization; however, recent empirical studies show that they can increase biased outputs and degrade performance on fairness benchmarks, and it remains unclear which specific weights cause this issue. In this work, we draw new links between quantization and model fairness by adding explicit group-fairness constraints to the quantization objective and introduce Fair-GPTQ, the first quantization method explicitly designed to reduce unfairness in large language models. The added constraints guide the learning of the rounding operation toward less-biased text generation for protected groups. Specifically, we focus on stereotype generation involving occupational bias and discriminatory language spanning gender, race, and religion. Fair-GPTQ has minimal impact on performance, preserving at least 90% of baseline accuracy on zero-shot benchmarks, reduces unfairness relative to a half-precision model, and retains the memory and speed benefits of 4-bit quantization. We also compare the performance of Fair-GPTQ with existing debiasing methods and find that it achieves performance on par with the iterative null-space projection debiasing approach on racial-stereotype benchmarks. Overall, the results validate our theoretical solution to the quantization problem with a group-bias term, highlight its applicability for reducing group bias at quantization time in generative models, and demonstrate that our approach can further be used to analyze channel- and weight-level contributions to fairness during quantization.

  _Yeongbin Seo, Dongha Lee, Jaehyung Kim, Jinyoung Yeo_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Autoregressive (AR) language models generate text one token at a time, which limits their inference speed. Diffusion-based language models offer a promising alternative, as they can decode multiple tokens in parallel. However, we identify a key bottleneck in current diffusion LMs: the long decoding-window problem, where tokens generated far from the input context often become irrelevant or repetitive. Previous solutions like semi-autoregressive address this issue by splitting windows into blocks, but this sacrifices speed and bidirectionality, eliminating the main advantage of diffusion models. To overcome this, we propose Convolutional decoding (Conv), a normalization-based method that narrows the decoding window without hard segmentation, leading to better fluency and flexibility. Additionally, we introduce Rejecting Rule-based Fine-Tuning (R2FT), a post-hoc training scheme that better aligns tokens at positions far from context. Our methods achieve state-of-the-art results on open-ended generation benchmarks (e.g., AlpacaEval) among diffusion LM baselines, with significantly lower step size than previous works, demonstrating both speed and quality improvements.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  WARNING: This paper contains examples of offensive materials. Toxic content has become pervasive on social media platforms. We introduce SMARTER, a data-efficient two-stage framework for explainable content moderation using Large Language Models (LLMs). In Stage 1, we leverage LLMs' own outputs to generate synthetic explanations for both correct and incorrect labels, enabling alignment via preference optimization with minimal human supervision. In Stage 2, we refine explanation quality through cross-model training, allowing weaker models to align stylistically and semantically with stronger ones. Experiments on three benchmark tasks -- HateXplain, Latent Hate, and Implicit Hate -- demonstrate that SMARTER enables LLMs to achieve up to a 13.5% macro-F1 improvement over standard few-shot baselines while using only a fraction of the full training data. Our framework offers a scalable strategy for low-resource settings by harnessing LLMs' self-improving capabilities for both classification and explanation.

  Large language models (LLMs) benefit from test-time scaling, but existing methods face significant challenges, including severe synchronization overhead, memory bottlenecks, and latency, especially during speculative decoding with long reasoning chains. We introduce A1 (Asynchronous Test-Time Scaling), a statistically guaranteed adaptive inference framework that addresses these challenges. A1 refines arithmetic intensity to identify synchronization as the dominant bottleneck, proposes an online calibration strategy to enable asynchronous inference, and designs a three-stage rejection sampling pipeline that supports both sequential and parallel scaling. Through experiments on the MATH, AMC23, AIME24, and AIME25 datasets, across various draft-target model families, we demonstrate that A1 achieves a remarkable 56.7x speedup in test-time scaling and a 4.14x improvement in throughput, all while maintaining accurate rejection-rate control, reducing latency and memory overhead, and no accuracy loss compared to using target model scaling alone. These results position A1 as an efficient and principled solution for scalable LLM inference. We have released the code atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  A controversial test for Large Language Models concerns the ability to discern possible from impossible language. While some evidence attests to the models' sensitivity to what crosses the limits of grammatically impossible language, this evidence has been contested on the grounds of the soundness of the testing material. We use model-internal representations to tap directly into the way Large Language Models represent the 'grammatical-ungrammatical' distinction. In a novel benchmark, we elicit probabilities from 4 models and compute minimal-pair surprisal differences, juxtaposing probabilities assigned to grammatical sentences to probabilities assigned to (i) lower frequency grammatical sentences, (ii) ungrammatical sentences, (iii) semantically odd sentences, and (iv) pragmatically odd sentences. The prediction is that if string-probabilities can function as proxies for the limits of grammar, the ungrammatical condition will stand out among the conditions that involve linguistic violations, showing a spike in the surprisal rates. Our results do not reveal a unique surprisal signature for ungrammatical prompts, as the semantically and pragmatically odd conditions consistently show higher surprisal. We thus demonstrate that probabilities do not constitute reliable proxies for model-internal representations of syntactic knowledge. Consequently, claims about models being able to distinguish possible from impossible language need verification through a different methodology.

  Humanitarian Mine Action has generated extensive best-practice knowledge, but much remains locked in unstructured reports. We introduce TextMine, an ontology-guided pipeline that uses Large Language Models to extract knowledge triples from HMA texts. TextMine integrates document chunking, domain-aware prompting, triple extraction, and both reference-based and LLM-as-a-Judge evaluation. We also create the first HMA ontology and a curated dataset of real-world demining reports. Experiments show ontology-aligned prompts boost extraction accuracy by 44.2%, cut hallucinations by 22.5%, and improve format conformance by 20.9% over baselines. While validated on Cambodian reports, TextMine can adapt to global demining efforts or other domains, transforming unstructured data into structured knowledge.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The goal of open relation extraction (OpenRE) is to develop an RE model that can generalize to new relations not encountered during training. Existing studies primarily formulate OpenRE as a clustering task. They first cluster all test instances based on the similarity between the instances, and then manually assign a new relation to each cluster. However, their reliance on human annotation limits their practicality. In this paper, we propose an OpenRE framework based on large language models (LLMs), which directly predicts new relations for test instances by leveraging their strong language understanding and generation abilities, without human intervention. Specifically, our framework consists of two core components: (1) a relation discoverer (RD), designed to predict new relations for test instances based on \textit{demonstrations} formed by training instances with known relations; and (2) a relation predictor (RP), used to select the most likely relation for a test instance from $n$ candidate relations, guided by \textit{demonstrations} composed of their instances. To enhance the ability of our framework to predict new relations, we design a self-correcting inference strategy composed of three stages: relation discovery, relation denoising, and relation prediction. In the first stage, we use RD to preliminarily predict new relations for all test instances. Next, we apply RP to select some high-reliability test instances for each new relation from the prediction results of RD through a cross-validation method. During the third stage, we employ RP to re-predict the relations of all test instances based on the demonstrations constructed from these reliable test instances. Extensive experiments on three OpenRE datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework. We release our code atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Natural Language Understanding (NLU) for low-resource languages remains a major challenge in NLP due to the scarcity of high-quality data and language-specific models. Maithili, despite being spoken by millions, lacks adequate computational resources, limiting its inclusion in digital and AI-driven applications. To address this gap, we introducemaiBERT, a BERT-based language model pre-trained specifically for Maithili using the Masked Language Modeling (MLM) technique. Our model is trained on a newly constructed Maithili corpus and evaluated through a news classification task. In our experiments, maiBERT achieved an accuracy of 87.02%, outperforming existing regional models like NepBERTa and HindiBERT, with a 0.13% overall accuracy gain and 5-7% improvement across various classes. We have open-sourced maiBERT on Hugging Face enabling further fine-tuning for downstream tasks such as sentiment analysis and Named Entity Recognition (NER).

  _Ayan Sengupta, Siddhant Chaudhary, Tanmoy Chakraborty_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Key-value (KV) cache compression has emerged as a critical technique for reducing the memory and latency overhead of autoregressive language models during inference. Prior approaches predominantly rely on query-key attention scores to rank and evict cached tokens, assuming that attention intensity correlates with semantic importance. However, this heuristic overlooks the contribution of value vectors, which directly influence the attention output. In this paper, we propose CurDKV, a novel, value-centric KV compression method that selects keys and values based on leverage scores computed from CUR matrix decomposition. Our approach approximates the dominant subspace of the attention output $softmax(QK^T)V$, ensuring that the retained tokens best preserve the model's predictive behavior. Theoretically, we show that attention score approximation does not guarantee output preservation, and demonstrate that CUR-based selection minimizes end-to-end attention reconstruction loss. Empirically, CurDKV achieves up to 9.6% higher accuracy than state-of-the-art methods like SnapKV and ChunkKV under aggressive compression budgets on LLaMA and Mistral, while maintaining compatibility with FlashAttention and Grouped Query Attention. In addition to improved accuracy, CurDKV reduces generation latency by up to 40% at high compression, offering a practical speed-accuracy tradeoff.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  While LLMs have been extensively studied on general text generation tasks, there is less research on text rewriting, a task related to general text generation, and particularly on the behavior of models on this task. In this paper we analyze what changes LLMs make in a text rewriting setting. We focus specifically on argumentative texts and their improvement, a task named Argument Improvement (ArgImp). We present CLEAR: an evaluation pipeline consisting of 57 metrics mapped to four linguistic levels: lexical, syntactic, semantic and pragmatic. This pipeline is used to examine the qualities of LLM-rewritten arguments on a broad set of argumentation corpora and compare the behavior of different LLMs on this task and analyze the behavior of different LLMs on this task in terms of linguistic levels. By taking all four linguistic levels into consideration, we find that the models perform ArgImp by shortening the texts while simultaneously increasing average word length and merging sentences. Overall we note an increase in the persuasion and coherence dimensions.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  When evaluating large language models (LLMs) with multiple-choice question answering (MCQA), it is common to end the prompt with the string "Answer:" to facilitate automated answer extraction via next-token probabilities. However, there is no consensus on how to tokenize the space following the colon, often overlooked as a trivial choice. In this paper, we uncover accuracy differences of up to 11% due to this (seemingly irrelevant) tokenization variation as well as reshuffled model rankings, raising concerns about the reliability of LLM comparisons in prior work. Surprisingly, we are able to recommend one specific strategy -- tokenizing the space together with the answer letter -- as we observe consistent and statistically significant performance improvements. Additionally, it improves model calibration, enhancing the reliability of the model's confidence estimates. Our findings underscore the importance of careful evaluation design and highlight the need for standardized, transparent evaluation protocols to ensure reliable and comparable results.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Text Implicitness has always been challenging in Natural Language Processing (NLP), with traditional methods relying on explicit statements to identify entities and their relationships. From the sentence "Zuhdi attends church every Sunday", the relationship between Zuhdi and Christianity is evident for a human reader, but it presents a challenge when it must be inferred automatically. Large language models (LLMs) have proven effective in NLP downstream tasks such as text comprehension and information extraction (IE).This study examines how textual implicitness affects IE tasks in pre-trained LLMs: LLaMA 2.3, DeepSeekV1, and Phi1.5. We generate two synthetic datasets of 10k implicit and explicit verbalization of biographic information to measure the impact on LLM performance and analyze whether fine-tuning implicit data improves their ability to generalize in implicit reasoning tasks.This research presents an experiment on the internal reasoning processes of LLMs in IE, particularly in dealing with implicit and explicit contexts. The results demonstrate that fine-tuning LLM models with LoRA (low-rank adaptation) improves their performance in extracting information from implicit texts, contributing to better model interpretability and reliability.

  In this work, we present the first systematic evaluation of catastrophic forgetting and modality inequivalence in speech large language models, showing that introducing speech capabilities can degrade knowledge and reasoning even when inputs remain textual, and performance further decreases with spoken queries. To address these challenges, we propose a cross-modal knowledge distillation framework that leverages both text-to-text and speech-to-text channels to transfer knowledge from a text-based teacher model to a speech LLM. Extensive experiments on dialogue and audio understanding tasks validate the effectiveness of our approach in preserving textual knowledge, improving cross-modal alignment, and enhancing reasoning in speech-based interactions.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Transformer-based language models such as BERT have become foundational in NLP, yet their performance degrades in specialized domains like patents, which contain long, technical, and legally structured text. Prior approaches to patent NLP have primarily relied on fine-tuning general-purpose models or domain-adapted variants pretrained with limited data. In this work, we pretrain 3 domain-specific masked language models for patents, using the ModernBERT architecture and a curated corpus of over 60 million patent records. Our approach incorporates architectural optimizations, including FlashAttention, rotary embeddings, and GLU feed-forward layers. We evaluate our models on four downstream patent classification tasks. Our model, ModernBERT-base-PT, consistently outperforms the general-purpose ModernBERT baseline on three out of four datasets and achieves competitive performance with a baseline PatentBERT. Additional experiments with ModernBERT-base-VX and Mosaic-BERT-large demonstrate that scaling the model size and customizing the tokenizer further enhance performance on selected tasks. Notably, all ModernBERT variants retain substantially faster inference over - 3x that of PatentBERT - underscoring their suitability for time-sensitive applications. These results underscore the benefits of domain-specific pretraining and architectural improvements for patent-focused NLP tasks.

  This study presents a comprehensive comparative evaluation of four state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs)--Claude 3.7 Sonnet, DeepSeek-V3, Gemini 2.0 Flash, and GPT-4o--for sentiment analysis and emotion detection in Persian social media texts. Comparative analysis among LLMs has witnessed a significant rise in recent years, however, most of these analyses have been conducted on English language tasks, creating gaps in understanding cross-linguistic performance patterns. This research addresses these gaps through rigorous experimental design using balanced Persian datasets containing 900 texts for sentiment analysis (positive, negative, neutral) and 1,800 texts for emotion detection (anger, fear, happiness, hate, sadness, surprise). The main focus was to allow for a direct and fair comparison among different models, by using consistent prompts, uniform processing parameters, and by analyzing the performance metrics such as precision, recall, F1-scores, along with misclassification patterns. The results show that all models reach an acceptable level of performance, and a statistical comparison of the best three models indicates no significant differences among them. However, GPT-4o demonstrated a marginally higher raw accuracy value for both tasks, while Gemini 2.0 Flash proved to be the most cost-efficient. The findings indicate that the emotion detection task is more challenging for all models compared to the sentiment analysis task, and the misclassification patterns can represent some challenges in Persian language texts. These findings establish performance benchmarks for Persian NLP applications and offer practical guidance for model selection based on accuracy, efficiency, and cost considerations, while revealing cultural and linguistic challenges that require consideration in multilingual AI system deployment.

  The Mixture of Experts (MoE) paradigm has been successfully integrated into Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), delivering performance gains with minimal parameter overhead. However, a key limitation of existing MoE-LoRA methods is their reliance on a discrete router, which prevents the integration of the MoE components into the backbone model. To overcome this, we propose FURINA, a novel Free from Unmergeable Router framework based on the LINear Aggregation of experts. FURINA eliminates the router by introducing a Self-Routing mechanism. This is achieved through three core innovations: (1) decoupled learning of the direction and magnitude for LoRA adapters, (2) a shared learnable magnitude vector for consistent activation scaling, and (3) expert selection loss that encourages divergent expert activation. The proposed mechanism leverages the angular similarity between the input and each adapter's directional component to activate experts, which are then scaled by the shared magnitude vector. This design allows the output norm to naturally reflect the importance of each expert, thereby enabling dynamic, router-free routing. The expert selection loss further sharpens this behavior by encouraging sparsity and aligning it with standard MoE activation patterns. We also introduce a shared expert within the MoE-LoRA block that provides stable, foundational knowledge. To the best of our knowledge, FURINA is the first router-free, MoE-enhanced LoRA method that can be fully merged into the backbone model, introducing zero additional inference-time cost or complexity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FURINA not only significantly outperforms standard LoRA but also matches or surpasses the performance of existing MoE-LoRA methods, while eliminating the extra inference-time overhead of MoE.

  The rapid progress of Multi-Modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has spurred the creation of numerous benchmarks. However, conventional full-coverage Question-Answering evaluations suffer from high redundancy and low efficiency. Inspired by human interview processes, we propose a multi-to-one interview paradigm for efficient MLLM evaluation. Our framework consists of (i) a two-stage interview strategy with pre-interview and formal interview phases, (ii) dynamic adjustment of interviewer weights to ensure fairness, and (iii) an adaptive mechanism for question difficulty-level chosen. Experiments on different benchmarks show that the proposed paradigm achieves significantly higher correlation with full-coverage results than random sampling, with improvements of up to 17.6% in PLCC and 16.7% in SRCC, while reducing the number of required questions. These findings demonstrate that the proposed paradigm provides a reliable and efficient alternative for large-scale MLLM benchmarking.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We propose Llama-Mimi, a speech language model that uses a unified tokenizer and a single Transformer decoder to jointly model sequences of interleaved semantic and acoustic tokens. Comprehensive evaluation shows that Llama-Mimi achieves state-of-the-art performance in acoustic consistency and possesses the ability to preserve speaker identity. Our analysis further demonstrates that increasing the number of quantizers improves acoustic fidelity but degrades linguistic performance, highlighting the inherent challenge of maintaining long-term coherence. We additionally introduce an LLM-as-a-Judge-based evaluation to assess the spoken content quality of generated outputs. Our models, code, and speech samples are publicly available.

  Empathy is critical for effective mental health support, especially when addressing Long Counseling Texts (LCTs). However, existing Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate replies that are semantically fluent but lack the structured reasoning necessary for genuine psychological support, particularly in a Chinese context. To bridge this gap, we introduce Empathy-R1, a novel framework that integrates a Chain-of-Empathy (CoE) reasoning process with Reinforcement Learning (RL) to enhance response quality for LCTs. Inspired by cognitive-behavioral therapy, our CoE paradigm guides the model to sequentially reason about a help-seeker's emotions, causes, and intentions, making its thinking process both transparent and interpretable. Our framework is empowered by a new large-scale Chinese dataset, Empathy-QA, and a two-stage training process. First, Supervised Fine-Tuning instills the CoE's reasoning structure. Subsequently, RL, guided by a dedicated reward model, refines the therapeutic relevance and contextual appropriateness of the final responses. Experiments show that Empathy-R1 achieves strong performance on key automatic metrics. More importantly, human evaluations confirm its superiority, showing a clear preference over strong baselines and achieving a Win@1 rate of 44.30% on our new benchmark. By enabling interpretable and contextually nuanced responses, Empathy-R1 represents a significant advancement in developing responsible and genuinely beneficial AI for mental health support.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in causal interpretability have extended from language models to vision-language models (VLMs), seeking to reveal their internal mechanisms through input interventions. While textual interventions often target semantics, visual interventions typically rely on coarse pixel-level perturbations, limiting semantic insights on multimodal integration. In this study, we introduce V-SEAM, a novel framework that combines Visual Semantic Editing and Attention Modulating for causal interpretation of VLMs. V-SEAM enables concept-level visual manipulations and identifies attention heads with positive or negative contributions to predictions across three semantic levels: objects, attributes, and relationships. We observe that positive heads are often shared within the same semantic level but vary across levels, while negative heads tend to generalize broadly. Finally, we introduce an automatic method to modulate key head embeddings, demonstrating enhanced performance for both LLaVA and InstructBLIP across three diverse VQA benchmarks.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has brought a new paradigm to automated essay scoring (AES), a long-standing and practical application of natural language processing in education. However, achieving human-level multi-perspective understanding and judgment remains a challenge. In this work, we propose Roundtable Essay Scoring (RES), a multi-agent evaluation framework designed to perform precise and human-aligned scoring under a zero-shot setting. RES constructs evaluator agents based on LLMs, each tailored to a specific prompt and topic context. Each agent independently generates a trait-based rubric and conducts a multi-perspective evaluation. Then, by simulating a roundtable-style discussion, RES consolidates individual evaluations through a dialectical reasoning process to produce a final holistic score that more closely aligns with human evaluation. By enabling collaboration and consensus among agents with diverse evaluation perspectives, RES outperforms prior zero-shot AES approaches. Experiments on the ASAP dataset using ChatGPT and Claude show that RES achieves up to a 34.86% improvement in average QWK over straightforward prompting (Vanilla) methods.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As they become increasingly multilingual, Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit more language confusion, i.e., they tend to generate answers in a language different from the language of the prompt or the answer language explicitly requested by the user. In this work, we propose ReCoVeR (REducing language COnfusion in VEctor Representations), a novel lightweight approach for reducing language confusion based on language-specific steering vectors. We first isolate language vectors with the help of multi-parallel corpus and then effectively leverage those vectors for effective LLM steering via fixed (i.e., unsupervised) as well as trainable steering functions. Our extensive evaluation, encompassing three benchmarks and 18 languages, shows that ReCoVeR effectively mitigates language confusion in both monolingual and cross-lingual setups while at the same time -- and in contrast to prior language steering methods -- retaining task performance.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied in diverse real-world scenarios, each governed by bespoke behavioral and safety specifications (spec) custom-tailored by users or organizations. These spec, categorized into safety-spec and behavioral-spec, vary across scenarios and evolve with changing preferences and requirements. We formalize this challenge as specification alignment, focusing on LLMs' ability to follow dynamic, scenario-specific spec from both behavioral and safety perspectives. To address this challenge, we propose Align3, a lightweight method that employs Test-Time Deliberation (TTD) with hierarchical reflection and revision to reason over the specification boundaries. We further present SpecBench, a unified benchmark for measuring specification alignment, covering 5 scenarios, 103 spec, and 1,500 prompts. Experiments on 15 reasoning and 18 instruct models with several TTD methods, including Self-Refine, TPO, and MoreThink, yield three key findings: (i) test-time deliberation enhances specification alignment; (ii) Align3 advances the safety-helpfulness trade-off frontier with minimal overhead; (iii) SpecBench effectively reveals alignment gaps. These results highlight the potential of test-time deliberation as an effective strategy for reasoning over the real-world specification boundaries.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  With the advancement of mid/post-training techniques, LLMs are pushing their boundaries at an accelerated pace. Legacy benchmarks saturate quickly (e.g., broad suites like MMLU over the years, newer ones like GPQA-D even faster), which makes frontier progress hard to track. The problem is especially acute in Korean: widely used benchmarks are fewer, often translated or narrow in scope, and updated more slowly, so saturation and contamination arrive sooner. Accordingly, at this moment, there is no Korean benchmark capable of evaluating and ranking frontier models. To bridge this gap, we introduce KAIO, a Korean, math-centric benchmark that stresses long-chain reasoning. Unlike recent Korean suites that are at or near saturation, KAIO remains far from saturated: the best-performing model, GPT-5, attains 62.8, followed by Gemini-2.5-Pro (52.3). Open models such as Qwen3-235B and DeepSeek-R1 cluster falls below 30, demonstrating substantial headroom, enabling robust tracking of frontier progress in Korean. To reduce contamination, KAIO will remain private and be served via a held-out evaluator until the best publicly known model reaches at least 80% accuracy, after which we will release the set and iterate to a harder version.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Unified vision large language models (VLLMs) have recently achieved impressive advancements in both multimodal understanding and generation, powering applications such as visual question answering and text-guided image synthesis. However, progress in unified VLLMs remains constrained by the lack of datasets that fully exploit the synergistic potential between these two core abilities. Existing datasets typically address understanding and generation in isolation, thereby limiting the performance of unified VLLMs. To bridge this critical gap, we introduce a novel dataset construction framework, UnifiedVisual, and present UnifiedVisual-240K, a high-quality dataset meticulously designed to facilitate mutual enhancement between multimodal understanding and generation. UnifiedVisual-240K seamlessly integrates diverse visual and textual inputs and outputs, enabling comprehensive cross-modal reasoning and precise text-to-image alignment. Our dataset encompasses a wide spectrum of tasks and data sources, ensuring rich diversity and addressing key shortcomings of prior resources. Extensive experiments demonstrate that models trained on UnifiedVisual-240K consistently achieve strong performance across a wide range of tasks. Notably, these models exhibit significant mutual reinforcement between multimodal understanding and generation, further validating the effectiveness of our framework and dataset. We believe UnifiedVisual represents a new growth point for advancing unified VLLMs and unlocking their full potential. Our code and datasets is available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have gained significant attention due to their impressive ability to integrate vision and language modalities. Recent advancements in MLLMs have primarily focused on improving performance through high-quality datasets, novel architectures, and optimized training strategies. However, in this paper, we identify a previously overlooked issue, language prior conflict, a mismatch between the inherent language priors of large language models (LLMs) and the language priors in training datasets. This conflict leads to suboptimal vision-language alignment, as MLLMs are prone to adapting to the language style of training samples. To address this issue, we propose a novel training method called Decoupled Proxy Alignment (DPA). DPA introduces two key innovations: (1) the use of a proxy LLM during pretraining to decouple the vision-language alignment process from language prior interference, and (2) dynamic loss adjustment based on visual relevance to strengthen optimization signals for visually relevant tokens. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DPA significantly mitigates the language prior conflict, achieving superior alignment performance across diverse datasets, model families, and scales. Our method not only improves the effectiveness of MLLM training but also shows exceptional generalization capabilities, making it a robust approach for vision-language alignment.

  _Seunguk Yu, Jungmin Yun, Jinhee Jang, Youngbin Kim_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Although offensive language continually evolves over time, even recent studies using LLMs have predominantly relied on outdated datasets and rarely evaluated the generalization ability on unseen texts. In this study, we constructed a large-scale dataset of contemporary political discourse and employed three refined judgments in the absence of ground truth. Each judgment reflects a representative offensive language detection method and is carefully designed for optimal conditions. We identified distinct patterns for each judgment and demonstrated tendencies of label agreement using a leave-one-out strategy. By establishing pseudo-labels as ground trust for quantitative performance assessment, we observed that a strategically designed single prompting achieves comparable performance to more resource-intensive methods. This suggests a feasible approach applicable in real-world settings with inherent constraints.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large pre-trained speech models excel in downstream tasks but their deployment is impractical for resource-limited environments. In this paper, we introduce HArnESS, the first Arabic-centric self-supervised speech model family, designed to capture Arabic speech nuances. Using iterative self-distillation, we train large bilingual HArnESS (HL) SSL models and then distill knowledge into compressed student models (HS, HST), preserving Arabic-specific representations. We use low-rank approximation to further compact the teacher's discrete supervision into shallow, thin models. We evaluate HArnESS on Arabic ASR, Speaker Emotion Recognition (SER), and Dialect Identification (DID), demonstrating effectiveness against HuBERT and XLS-R. With minimal fine-tuning, HArnESS achieves SOTA or comparable performance, making it a lightweight yet powerful alternative for real-world use. We release our distilled models and findings to support responsible research and deployment in low-resource settings.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Modeling semantic and structural information from tabular data remains a core challenge for effective table understanding. Existing Table-as-Text approaches flatten tables for large language models (LLMs), but lose crucial structural cues, while Table-as-Image methods preserve structure yet struggle with fine-grained semantics. Recent Table-as-Multimodality strategies attempt to combine textual and visual views, but they (1) statically process both modalities for every query-table pair within a large multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), inevitably introducing redundancy and even conflicts, and (2) depend on costly fine-tuning of MLLMs. In light of this, we propose TableDART, a training-efficient framework that integrates multimodal views by reusing pretrained single-modality models. TableDART introduces a lightweight 2.59M-parameter MLP gating network that dynamically selects the optimal path (either Text-only, Image-only, or Fusion) for each table-query pair, effectively reducing redundancy and conflicts from both modalities. In addition, we propose a novel agent to mediate cross-modal knowledge integration by analyzing outputs from text- and image-based models, either selecting the best result or synthesizing a new answer through reasoning. This design avoids the prohibitive costs of full MLLM fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on seven benchmarks show that TableDART establishes new state-of-the-art performance among open-source models, surpassing the strongest baseline by an average of 4.02%.

  _Ying Fang, Xiaofei Li_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper proposes a unimodal aggregation (UMA) based nonautoregressive model for both English and Mandarin speech recognition. The original UMA explicitly segments and aggregates acoustic frames (with unimodal weights that first monotonically increase and then decrease) of the same text token to learn better representations than regular connectionist temporal classification (CTC). However, it only works well in Mandarin. It struggles with other languages, such as English, for which a single syllable may be tokenized into multiple fine-grained tokens, or a token spans fewer than 3 acoustic frames and fails to form unimodal weights. To address this problem, we propose allowing each UMA-aggregated frame map to multiple tokens, via a simple split module that generates two tokens from each aggregated frame before computing the CTC loss.

  As large language models~(LLMs) become widely adopted, ensuring their alignment with human values is crucial to prevent jailbreaks where adversaries manipulate models to produce harmful content. While most defenses target single-turn attacks, real-world usage often involves multi-turn dialogues, exposing models to attacks that exploit conversational context to bypass safety measures. We introduce MUSE, a comprehensive framework tackling multi-turn jailbreaks from both attack and defense angles. For attacks, we propose MUSE-A, a method that uses frame semantics and heuristic tree search to explore diverse semantic trajectories. For defense, we present MUSE-D, a fine-grained safety alignment approach that intervenes early in dialogues to reduce vulnerabilities. Extensive experiments on various models show that MUSE effectively identifies and mitigates multi-turn vulnerabilities. Code is available at \href{this https URL}{this https URL}.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language model (LLM) unlearning has demonstrated effectiveness in removing the influence of undesirable data (also known as forget data). Existing approaches typically assume full access to the forget dataset, overlooking two key challenges: (1) Forget data is often privacy-sensitive, rare, or legally regulated, making it expensive or impractical to obtain (2) The distribution of available forget data may not align with how that information is represented within the model. To address these limitations, we propose a ``Reveal-and-Release'' method to unlearn with self-generated data, where we prompt the model to reveal what it knows using optimized instructions. To fully utilize the self-generated forget data, we propose an iterative unlearning framework, where we make incremental adjustments to the model's weight space with parameter-efficient modules trained on the forget data. Experimental results demonstrate that our method balances the tradeoff between forget quality and utility preservation.

  Understanding emotions in the Indonesian language is essential for improving customer experiences in e-commerce. This study focuses on enhancing the accuracy of emotion classification in Indonesian by leveraging advanced language models, IndoBERT and DistilBERT. A key component of our approach was data processing, specifically data augmentation, which included techniques such as back-translation and synonym replacement. These methods played a significant role in boosting the model's performance. After hyperparameter tuning, IndoBERT achieved an accuracy of 80\%, demonstrating the impact of careful data processing. While combining multiple IndoBERT models led to a slight improvement, it did not significantly enhance performance. Our findings indicate that IndoBERT was the most effective model for emotion classification in Indonesian, with data augmentation proving to be a vital factor in achieving high accuracy. Future research should focus on exploring alternative architectures and strategies to improve generalization for Indonesian NLP tasks.

  This position paper examines how large language models (LLMs) can support thematic analysis of unstructured clinical transcripts, a widely used but resource-intensive method for uncovering patterns in patient and provider narratives. We conducted a systematic review of recent studies applying LLMs to thematic analysis, complemented by an interview with a practicing clinician. Our findings reveal that current approaches remain fragmented across multiple dimensions including types of thematic analysis, datasets, prompting strategies and models used, most notably in evaluation. Existing evaluation methods vary widely (from qualitative expert review to automatic similarity metrics), hindering progress and preventing meaningful benchmarking across studies. We argue that establishing standardized evaluation practices is critical for advancing the field. To this end, we propose an evaluation framework centered on three dimensions: validity, reliability, and interpretability.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for supporting second language acquisition, particularly in simulating interactive dialogues for speaking practice. However, adapting the language difficulty of LLM-generated responses to match learners' proficiency levels remains a challenge. This work addresses this issue by proposing a framework for controlling language proficiency in educational dialogue systems. Our approach leverages three categories of linguistic features, readability features (e.g., Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level), syntactic features (e.g., syntactic tree depth), and lexical features (e.g., simple word ratio), to quantify and regulate text complexity. We demonstrate that training LLMs on linguistically annotated dialogue data enables precise modulation of language proficiency, outperforming prompt-based methods in both flexibility and stability. To evaluate this, we introduce Dilaprix, a novel metric integrating the aforementioned features, which shows strong correlation with expert judgments of language difficulty. Empirical results reveal that our approach achieves superior controllability of language proficiency while maintaining high dialogue quality.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into personal writing tools, a critical question arises: can LLMs faithfully imitate an individual's writing style from just a few examples? Personal style is often subtle and implicit, making it difficult to specify through prompts yet essential for user-aligned generation. This work presents a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs' ability to mimic personal writing styles via in-context learning from a small number of user-authored samples. We introduce an ensemble of complementary metrics-including authorship attribution, authorship verification, style matching, and AI detection-to robustly assess style imitation. Our evaluation spans over 40000 generations per model across domains such as news, email, forums, and blogs, covering writing samples from more than 400 real-world authors. Results show that while LLMs can approximate user styles in structured formats like news and email, they struggle with nuanced, informal writing in blogs and forums. Further analysis on various prompting strategies such as number of demonstrations reveal key limitations in effective personalization. Our findings highlight a fundamental gap in personalized LLM adaptation and the need for improved techniques to support implicit, style-consistent generation. To aid future research and for reproducibility, we open-source our data and code.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Knowledge distillation (KD) is a widely adopted approach for compressing large neural networks by transferring knowledge from a large teacher model to a smaller student model. In the context of large language models, token level KD, typically minimizing the KL divergence between student output distribution and teacher output distribution, has shown strong empirical performance. However, prior work assumes student output distribution and teacher output distribution share the same optimal representation space, a premise that may not hold in many cases. To solve this problem, we propose Delta Knowledge Distillation (Delta-KD), a novel extension of token level KD that encourages the student to approximate an optimal representation space by explicitly preserving the distributional shift Delta introduced during the teacher's supervised finetuning (SFT). Empirical results on ROUGE metrics demonstrate that Delta KD substantially improves student performance while preserving more of the teacher's knowledge.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this paper, we introduce OmniGEC, a collection of multilingual silver-standard datasets for the task of Grammatical Error Correction (GEC), covering eleven languages: Czech, English, Estonian, German, Greek, Icelandic, Italian, Latvian, Slovene, Swedish, and Ukrainian. These datasets facilitate the development of multilingual GEC solutions and help bridge the data gap in adapting English GEC solutions to multilingual GEC. The texts in the datasets originate from three sources: Wikipedia edits for the eleven target languages, subreddits from Reddit in the eleven target languages, and the Ukrainian-only UberText 2.0 social media corpus. While Wikipedia edits were derived from human-made corrections, the Reddit and UberText 2.0 data were automatically corrected with the GPT-4o-mini model. The quality of the corrections in the datasets was evaluated both automatically and manually. Finally, we fine-tune two open-source large language models - Aya-Expanse (8B) and Gemma-3 (12B) - on the multilingual OmniGEC corpora and achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) results for paragraph-level multilingual GEC.

  _Samuel J. Bell, Eduardo S√°nchez, David Dale, Pontus Stenetorp, Mikel Artetxe, Marta R. Costa-juss√†_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multilingual toxicity detection remains a significant challenge due to the scarcity of training data and resources for many languages. While prior work has leveraged the translate-test paradigm to support cross-lingual transfer across a range of classification tasks, the utility of translation in supporting toxicity detection at scale remains unclear. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive comparison of translation-based and language-specific/multilingual classification pipelines. We find that translation-based pipelines consistently outperform out-of-distribution classifiers in 81.3% of cases (13 of 16 languages), with translation benefits strongly correlated with both the resource level of the target language and the quality of the machine translation (MT) system. Our analysis reveals that traditional classifiers outperform large language model (LLM) judges, with this advantage being particularly pronounced for low-resource languages, where translate-classify methods dominate translate-judge approaches in 6 out of 7 cases. We additionally show that MT-specific fine-tuning on LLMs yields lower refusal rates compared to standard instruction-tuned models, but it can negatively impact toxicity detection accuracy for low-resource languages. These findings offer actionable guidance for practitioners developing scalable multilingual content moderation systems.

  Effective interactive tool use requires agents to master Tool Integrated Reasoning (TIR): a complex process involving multi-turn planning and long-context dialogue management. To train agents for this dynamic process, particularly in multi-modal contexts, we introduce a sandbox environment for reinforcement learning (RL) that supports interleaved speech-text rollouts. Our core strategy, Turn-level Adjudicated Reinforcement Learning (TARL), addresses the challenge of credit assignment in long-horizon tasks by employing a Large Language Model (LLM) as a judge to provide turn-level evaluation. To enhance exploration, we integrate a mixed-task training curriculum with mathematical reasoning problems. This unified approach boosts the task pass rate on the text-based $\tau$-bench by over 6% compared to strong RL baselines. Crucially, we demonstrate our framework's suitability for fine-tuning a multi-modal foundation model for agentic tasks. By training a base multi-modal LLM on interleaved speech-text rollouts, we equip it with tool-use abilities, paving the way for more natural, voice-driven interactive agents.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Many black-box techniques for quantifying the uncertainty of large language models (LLMs) rely on repeated LLM sampling, which can be computationally expensive. Therefore, practical applicability demands reliable estimation from few samples. Semantic entropy (SE) is a popular sample-based uncertainty estimator with a discrete formulation attractive for the black-box setting. Recent extensions of semantic entropy exhibit improved LLM hallucination detection, but do so with less interpretable methods that admit additional hyperparameters. For this reason, we revisit the canonical discrete semantic entropy estimator, finding that it underestimates the "true" semantic entropy, as expected from theory. We propose a modified semantic alphabet size estimator, and illustrate that using it to adjust discrete semantic entropy for sample coverage results in more accurate semantic entropy estimation in our setting of interest. Furthermore, our proposed alphabet size estimator flags incorrect LLM responses as well or better than recent top-performing approaches, with the added benefit of remaining highly interpretable.

  Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as task-oriented agents, where success depends on their ability to generate accurate function calls under realistic, multilingual conditions. However, existing agent evaluations largely overlook cultural and linguistic diversity, often relying on monolingual or naively translated benchmarks. We introduce Ticket-Bench, a benchmark for multilingual agent evaluation in task-oriented scenarios. Ticket-Bench simulates the domain of soccer ticket purchases across six major languages: Portuguese, English, Spanish, German, Italian, and French. Using localized teams, cities, and user profiles to provide a higher level of realism. We evaluate a wide range of commercial and open-source LLMs, measuring function-calling accuracy and consistency across languages. Results show that reasoning-oriented models (e.g., GPT-5, Qwen3-235B) dominate performance but still exhibit notable cross-lingual disparities. These findings underscore the need for culturally aware, multilingual benchmarks to guide the development of robust LLM agents.

  De-identification in the healthcare setting is an application of NLP where automated algorithms are used to remove personally identifying information of patients (and, sometimes, providers). With the recent rise of generative large language models (LLMs), there has been a corresponding rise in the number of papers that apply LLMs to de-identification. Although these approaches often report near-perfect results, significant challenges concerning reproducibility and utility of the research papers persist. This paper identifies three key limitations in the current literature: inconsistent reporting metrics hindering direct comparisons, the inadequacy of traditional classification metrics in capturing errors which LLMs may be more prone to (i.e., altering clinically relevant information), and lack of manual validation of automated metrics which aim to quantify these errors. To address these issues, we first present a survey of LLM-based de-identification research, highlighting the heterogeneity in reporting standards. Second, we evaluated a diverse set of models to quantify the extent of inappropriate removal of clinical information. Next, we conduct a manual validation of an existing evaluation metric to measure the removal of clinical information, employing clinical experts to assess their efficacy. We highlight poor performance and describe the inherent limitations of such metrics in identifying clinically significant changes. Lastly, we propose a novel methodology for the detection of clinically relevant information removal.

  _Amber Shore, Russell Scheinberg, Ameeta Agrawal, So Young Lee_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) are intended to reflect human linguistic competencies. But humans have access to a broad and embodied context, which is key in detecting and resolving linguistic ambiguities, even in isolated text spans. A foundational case of semantic ambiguity is found in the task of coreference resolution: how is a pronoun related to an earlier person mention? This capability is implicit in nearly every downstream task, and the presence of ambiguity at this level can alter performance significantly. We show that LLMs can achieve good performance with minimal prompting in both coreference disambiguation and the detection of ambiguity in coreference, however, they cannot do both at the same time. We present the CORRECT-DETECT trade-off: though models have both capabilities and deploy them implicitly, successful performance balancing these two abilities remains elusive.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have fundamentally transformed the field of natural language processing; however, their vulnerability to biases presents a notable obstacle that threatens both fairness and trust. This review offers an extensive analysis of the bias landscape in LLMs, tracing its roots and expressions across various NLP tasks. Biases are classified into implicit and explicit types, with particular attention given to their emergence from data sources, architectural designs, and contextual deployments. This study advances beyond theoretical analysis by implementing a simulation framework designed to evaluate bias mitigation strategies in practice. The framework integrates multiple approaches including data curation, debiasing during model training, and post-hoc output calibration and assesses their impact in controlled experimental settings. In summary, this work not only synthesizes existing knowledge on bias in LLMs but also contributes original empirical validation through simulation of mitigation strategies.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Word-level psycholinguistic norms lend empirical support to theories of language processing. However, obtaining such human-based measures is not always feasible or straightforward. One promising approach is to augment human norming datasets by using Large Language Models (LLMs) to predict these characteristics directly, a practice that is rapidly gaining popularity in psycholinguistics and cognitive science. However, the novelty of this approach (and the relative inscrutability of LLMs) necessitates the adoption of rigorous methodologies that guide researchers through this process, present the range of possible approaches, and clarify limitations that are not immediately apparent, but may, in some cases, render the use of LLMs impractical.In this work, we present a comprehensive methodology for estimating word characteristics with LLMs, enriched with practical advice and lessons learned from our own experience. Our approach covers both the direct use of base LLMs and the fine-tuning of models, an alternative that can yield substantial performance gains in certain scenarios. A major emphasis in the guide is the validation of LLM-generated data with human "gold standard" norms. We also present a software framework that implements our methodology and supports both commercial and open-weight models.We illustrate the proposed approach with a case study on estimating word familiarity in English. Using base models, we achieved a Spearman correlation of 0.8 with human ratings, which increased to 0.9 when employing fine-tuned models. This methodology, framework, and set of best practices aim to serve as a reference for future research on leveraging LLMs for psycholinguistic and lexical studies.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Semantic similarity between two sentences depends on the aspects considered between those sentences. To study this phenomenon, Deshpande et al. (2023) proposed the Conditional Semantic Textual Similarity (C-STS) task and annotated a human-rated similarity dataset containing pairs of sentences compared under two different conditions. However, Tu et al. (2024) found various annotation issues in this dataset and showed that manually re-annotating a small portion of it leads to more accurate C-STS models. Despite these pioneering efforts, the lack of large and accurately annotated C-STS datasets remains a blocker for making progress on this task as evidenced by the subpar performance of the C-STS models. To address this training data need, we resort to Large Language Models (LLMs) to correct the condition statements and similarity ratings in the original dataset proposed by Deshpande et al. (2023). Our proposed method is able to re-annotate a large training dataset for the C-STS task with minimal manual effort. Importantly, by training a supervised C-STS model on our cleaned and re-annotated dataset, we achieve a 5.4% statistically significant improvement in Spearman correlation. The re-annotated dataset is available atthis https URL.

  Large language models (LLMs) have achieved great success in medical question answering and clinical decision-making, promoting the efficiency and popularization of the personalized virtual doctor in society. However, the traditional fine-tuning strategies on LLM require the updates of billions of parameters, substantially increasing the training cost, including the training time and utility cost. To enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of the current medical LLMs and explore the boundary of the representation capability of the LLMs on the medical domain, apart from the traditional fine-tuning strategies from the data perspective (i.e., supervised fine-tuning or reinforcement learning from human feedback), we instead craft a novel sparse medical LLM named SparseDoctor armed with contrastive learning enhanced LoRA-MoE (low rank adaptation-mixture of experts) architecture. To this end, the crafted automatic routing mechanism can scientifically allocate the computational resources among different LoRA experts supervised by the contrastive learning. Additionally, we also introduce a novel expert memory queue mechanism to further boost the efficiency of the overall framework and prevent the memory overflow during training. We conduct comprehensive evaluations on three typical medical benchmarks: CMB, CMExam, and CMMLU-Med. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed LLM can consistently outperform the strong baselines such as the HuatuoGPT series.

  _Hamady Gackou_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this study, we first tested the performance of the TreeTagger English model developed by Helmut Schmid with test files at our disposal, using this model to analyze relative clauses and noun complement clauses in English. We distinguished between the two uses of "that," both as a relative pronoun and as a complementizer. To achieve this, we employed an algorithm to reannotate a corpus that had originally been parsed using the Universal Dependency framework with the EWT Treebank. In the next phase, we proposed an improved model by retraining TreeTagger and compared the newly trained model with Schmid's baseline model. This process allowed us to fine-tune the model's performance to more accurately capture the subtle distinctions in the use of "that" as a complementizer and as a nominal. We also examined the impact of varying the training dataset size on TreeTagger's accuracy and assessed the representativeness of the EWT Treebank files for the structures under investigation. Additionally, we analyzed some of the linguistic and structural factors influencing the ability to effectively learn this distinction.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We show that several state-of-the-art large language models (including Grok 4, GPT-5, and Gemini 2.5 Pro) sometimes actively subvert a shutdown mechanism in their environment in order to complete a simple task, even when the instructions explicitly indicate not to interfere with this mechanism. In some cases, models sabotage the shutdown mechanism up to 97% of the time. In our experiments, models' inclination to resist shutdown was sensitive to variations in the prompt including how strongly and clearly the allow-shutdown instruction was emphasized, the extent to which the prompts evoke a self-preservation framing, and whether the instruction was in the system prompt or the user prompt (though surprisingly, models were consistently *less* likely to obey instructions to allow shutdown when they were placed in the system prompt).

  Generative AI (GenAI) offers new opportunities for customer support in online travel agencies, yet little is known about how its design influences user engagement, purchase behavior, and user experience. We report results from a randomized field experiment in online travel itinerary planning, comparing GenAI that expressed (A) positive enthusiasm, (B) neutral expression, and (C) no tone instructions (control). Users in group A wrote significantly longer prompts than those in groups B and C. At the same time, users in groups A and B were more likely to purchase subscriptions of the webservice. We further analyze linguistic cues across experimental groups to explore differences in user experience and explain subscription purchases and affiliate link clicks based on these cues. Our findings provide implications for the design of persuasive and engaging GenAI interfaces in consumer-facing contexts and contribute to understanding how linguistic framing shapes user behavior in AI-mediated decision support.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Model agents excel at solving complex tasks through iterative reasoning and tool use, but typically depend on ultra-large, costly backbones. Existing distillation approaches train smaller students to imitate full teacher trajectories, yet reasoning and knowledge gaps between the teacher and student often lead to compounding errors. We propose SCoRe, a student-centered framework in which the student generates trajectories and the teacher intervenes only at the first critical error, producing training data matched to the student's ability and exposing specific weaknesses. The student is first fine-tuned on corrected trajectories. Subsequently, short-horizon reinforcement learning starts from the verified prefix before the first critical error, with target rewards assigned at that step. This design encourages autonomous problem-solving beyond imitation and improves training stability. Particularly, on 12 challenging benchmarks, a 7B-parameter student distilled with SCoRe matches the agentic performance of a 72B-parameter teacher.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper proposes a comprehensive framework for the generation of covert advertisements within Conversational AI systems, along with robust techniques for their detection. It explores how subtle promotional content can be crafted within AI-generated responses and introduces methods to identify and mitigate such covert advertising strategies. For generation (Sub-Task~1), we propose a novel framework that leverages user context and query intent to produce contextually relevant advertisements. We employ advanced prompting strategies and curate paired training data to fine-tune a large language model (LLM) for enhanced stealthiness. For detection (Sub-Task~2), we explore two effective strategies: a fine-tuned CrossEncoder (\texttt{all-mpnet-base-v2}) for direct classification, and a prompt-based reformulation using a fine-tuned \texttt{DeBERTa-v3-base} model. Both approaches rely solely on the response text, ensuring practicality for real-world deployment. Experimental results show high effectiveness in both tasks, achieving a precision of 1.0 and recall of 0.71 for ad generation, and F1-scores ranging from 0.99 to 1.00 for ad detection. These results underscore the potential of our methods to balance persuasive communication with transparency in conversational AI.

  _Ivan Ternovtsii_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) achieve remarkable performance but remain difficult to interpret. Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models improve efficiency through sparse activation, yet typically rely on opaque, learned gating functions. While similarity-based routing (Cosine Routers) has been explored for training stabilization, its potential for inherent interpretability remains largely untapped. We introduce the Semantic Resonance Architecture (SRA), an MoE approach designed to ensure that routing decisions are inherently interpretable. SRA replaces learned gating with a Chamber of Semantic Resonance (CSR) module, which routes tokens based on cosine similarity with trainable semantic anchors. We also introduce a novel Dispersion Loss that encourages orthogonality among anchors to enforce diverse specialization. Experiments on WikiText-103 demonstrate that SRA achieves a validation perplexity of 13.41, outperforming both a dense baseline (14.13) and a Standard MoE baseline (13.53) under matched active parameter constraints (29.0M). Crucially, SRA exhibits superior expert utilization (1.0% dead experts vs. 14.8% in the Standard MoE) and develops distinct, semantically coherent specialization patterns, unlike the noisy specialization observed in standard MoEs. This work establishes semantic routing as a robust methodology for building more transparent and controllable language models.

  _Martin Prei√ü_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) have succeeded in a variety of natural language processing tasks [Zha+25]. However, they have notable limitations. LLMs tend to generate hallucinations, a seemingly plausible yet factually unsupported output [Hua+24], which have serious real-world consequences [Kay23; Rum+24]. Recent work has shown that probing-based classifiers that utilize LLMs' internal representations can detect hallucinations [AM23; Bei+24; Bur+24; DYT24; Ji+24; SMZ24; Su+24]. This approach, since it does not involve model training, can enhance reliability without significantly increasing computational costs.Building upon this approach, this thesis proposed novel methods for hallucination detection using LLM internal representations and evaluated them across three benchmarks: TruthfulQA, HaluEval, and ReFact. Specifically, a new architecture that dynamically weights and combines internal LLM layers was developed to improve hallucination detection performance. Throughout extensive experiments, two key findings were obtained: First, the proposed approach was shown to achieve superior performance compared to traditional probing methods, though generalization across benchmarks and LLMs remains challenging. Second, these generalization limitations were demonstrated to be mitigated through cross-benchmark training and parameter freezing. While not consistently improving, both techniques yielded better performance on individual benchmarks and reduced performance degradation when transferred to other benchmarks. These findings open new avenues for improving LLM reliability through internal representation analysis.

  _Ahmad Pouramini, Hesham Faili_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Prompt tuning offers a parameter-efficient way to adapt large pre-trained language models to new tasks, but most existing approaches are designed for single-task settings, failing to share knowledge across related tasks. We propose Cross-task Prompt Tuning (CrossPT), a modular framework for multi-task prompt tuning that enables controlled knowledge transfer while maintaining task-specific specialization. CrossPT decomposes each target prompt into shared, pre-trained source prompts and task-specific private prompts, combined via a learned attention mechanism. To support robust transfer, we systematically investigate key design factors including prompt initialization, balancing shared and private prompts, number of source prompts, learning rates, task prefixes, and label semantics. Empirical results on GLUE and related benchmarks show that CrossPT achieves higher accuracy and robustness compared to traditional prompt tuning and related methods, particularly in low-resource scenarios, while maintaining strong parameter efficiency.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Model (LLM) pretraining, finetuning, and evaluation rely on input-space reconstruction and generative capabilities. Yet, it has been observed in vision that embedding-space training objectives, e.g., with Joint Embedding Predictive Architectures (JEPAs), are far superior to their input-space counterpart. That mismatch in how training is achieved between language and vision opens up a natural question: {\em can language training methods learn a few tricks from the vision ones?} The lack of JEPA-style LLM is a testimony of the challenge in designing such objectives for language. In this work, we propose a first step in that direction where we develop LLM-JEPA, a JEPA based solution for LLMs applicable both to finetuning and pretraining. Thus far, LLM-JEPA is able to outperform the standard LLM training objectives by a significant margin across models, all while being robust to overfiting. Those findings are observed across numerous datasets (NL-RX, GSM8K, Spider, RottenTomatoes) and various models from the Llama3, OpenELM, Gemma2 and Olmo families. Code:this https URL.

  _Martin Thellefsen, Amalia Nurma Dewi, Bent Sorensen_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper explores prompts and prompting in large language models (LLMs) as dynamic semiotic phenomena, drawing on Peirce's triadic model of signs, his nine sign types, and the Dynacom model of communication. The aim is to reconceptualize prompting not as a technical input mechanism but as a communicative and epistemic act involving an iterative process of sign formation, interpretation, and refinement. The theoretical foundation rests on Peirce's semiotics, particularly the interplay between representamen, object, and interpretant, and the typological richness of signs: qualisign, sinsign, legisign; icon, index, symbol; rheme, dicent, argument - alongside the interpretant triad captured in the Dynacom model. Analytically, the paper positions the LLM as a semiotic resource that generates interpretants in response to user prompts, thereby participating in meaning-making within shared universes of discourse. The findings suggest that prompting is a semiotic and communicative process that redefines how knowledge is organized, searched, interpreted, and co-constructed in digital environments. This perspective invites a reimagining of the theoretical and methodological foundations of knowledge organization and information seeking in the age of computational semiosis

  African languages remain underrepresented in natural language processing (NLP), with most corpora limited to formal registers that fail to capture the vibrancy of everyday communication. This work addresses this gap for Shona, a Bantu language spoken in Zimbabwe and Zambia, by introducing a novel Shona--English slang dataset curated from anonymized social media conversations. The dataset is annotated for intent, sentiment, dialogue acts, code-mixing, and tone, and is publicly available atthis https URL. We fine-tuned a multilingual DistilBERT classifier for intent recognition, achieving 96.4\% accuracy and 96.3\% F1-score, hosted atthis https URL. This classifier is integrated into a hybrid chatbot that combines rule-based responses with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to handle domain-specific queries, demonstrated through a use case assisting prospective students with graduate program information at Pace University. Qualitative evaluation shows the hybrid system outperforms a RAG-only baseline in cultural relevance and user engagement. By releasing the dataset, model, and methodology, this work advances NLP resources for African languages, promoting inclusive and culturally resonant conversational AI.

  _Jinfan Frank Hu_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Tokenization plays a critical role in processing agglutinative languages, where a single word can encode multiple morphemes carrying syntactic and semantic information. This study evaluates the impact of various tokenization strategies - word-level, character-level, n-gram, and Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) - on the quality of static word embeddings generated by Word2Vec for Turkish and Finnish. Using a 10,000-article Wikipedia corpus, we trained models under low-resource conditions and evaluated them on a Named Entity Recognition (NER) task. Despite the theoretical appeal of subword segmentation, word-level tokenization consistently outperformed all alternatives across all tokenization strategies tested. These findings suggest that in agglutinative, low-resource contexts, preserving boundaries via word-level tokenization may yield better embedding performance than complex statistical methods. This has practical implications for developing NLP pipelines for under-resourced languages where annotated data and computing power are limited.

  Recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have garnered significant attention, offering a promising pathway toward artificial general intelligence (AGI). Among the essential capabilities required for AGI, creativity has emerged as a critical trait for MLLMs, with association serving as its foundation. Association reflects a model' s ability to think creatively, making it vital to evaluate and understand. While several frameworks have been proposed to assess associative ability, they often overlook the inherent ambiguity in association tasks, which arises from the divergent nature of associations and undermines the reliability of evaluations. To address this issue, we decompose ambiguity into two types-internal ambiguity and external ambiguity-and introduce AssoCiAm, a benchmark designed to evaluate associative ability while circumventing the ambiguity through a hybrid computational method. We then conduct extensive experiments on MLLMs, revealing a strong positive correlation between cognition and association. Additionally, we observe that the presence of ambiguity in the evaluation process causes MLLMs' behavior to become more random-like. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of our method in ensuring more accurate and reliable evaluations. See Project Page for the data and codes.

  This paper discusses our exploration of different data-efficient and parameter-efficient approaches to Arabic Dialect Identification (ADI). In particular, we investigate various soft-prompting strategies, including prefix-tuning, prompt-tuning, P-tuning, and P-tuning V2, as well as LoRA reparameterizations. For the data-efficient strategy, we analyze hard prompting with zero-shot and few-shot inferences to analyze the dialect identification capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). For the parameter-efficient PEFT approaches, we conducted our experiments using Arabic-specific encoder models on several major datasets. We also analyzed the n-shot inferences on open-source decoder-only models, a general multilingual model (Phi-3.5), and an Arabic-specific one(SILMA). We observed that the LLMs generally struggle to differentiate the dialectal nuances in the few-shot or zero-shot setups. The soft-prompted encoder variants perform better, while the LoRA-based fine-tuned models perform best, even surpassing full fine-tuning.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in many natural language processing (NLP) tasks. To achieve more accurate output, the prompts used to drive LLMs have become increasingly longer, which incurs higher computational costs. To address this prompt inflation problem, prompt compression has been proposed. However, most existing methods require training a small auxiliary model for compression, incurring a significant amount of additional computation. To avoid this, we propose a two-stage, training-free approach, called Dual-Stage Progressive Compression (DSPC). In the coarse-grained stage, semantic-related sentence filtering removes sentences with low semantic value based on TF-IDF. In the fine-grained stage, token importance is assessed using attention contribution, cross-model loss difference, and positional importance, enabling the pruning of low-utility tokens while preserving semantics. We validate DSPC on LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct and GPT-3.5-Turbo under a constrained token budget and observe consistent improvements. For instance, in the FewShot task of the Longbench dataset, DSPC achieves a performance of 49.17 by using only 3x fewer tokens, outperforming the best state-of-the-art baseline LongLLMLingua by 7.76.

  Training a task-specific small reasoning model is challenging when direct human supervision or high-quality labels are scarce. However, LLMs with reasoning capabilities produce abundant intermediate reasoning traces that can be systematically refined to create effective supervision signals. We propose Reason-Refine-then-Align (R2tA), which turns refined model rationales into supervision for training task-specific reasoning models. Our method generates initial reasoning and responses from an open-source base model on task-specific inputs, then refines these traces, fixing hallucinations and inconsistencies, to form a high-fidelity dataset. We perform a two-stage alignment, supervised fine-tuning (SFT), followed by direct preference optimization (DPO) to calibrate the model's intermediate reasoning with human-validated conceptual preferences and then condition the final output on that aligned reasoning. As a case study, we apply R2tA to evaluate extended entity relationship diagrams (EERDs) in database system design, a structurally complex task where prompt-only methods miss or hallucinate errors. We curated a dataset of 600 EERD variants (train/test split of 450/150, respectively) with induced mistakes spanning 11 categories. Empirical evaluation suggests R2tA provides a practical, cost-effective path to scalable LLM adaptation in data-scarce domains, enabling reproducible AI tools for education and beyond.

  As large language models are increasingly deployed in sensitive domains such as healthcare, ensuring their outputs reflect the diverse values and perspectives held across populations is critical. However, existing alignment approaches, including pluralistic paradigms like Modular Pluralism, often fall short in the health domain, where personal, cultural, and situational factors shape pluralism. Motivated by the aforementioned healthcare challenges, we propose a first lightweight, generalizable, pluralistic alignment approach, EthosAgents, designed to simulate diverse perspectives and values. We empirically show that it advances the pluralistic alignment for all three modes across seven varying-sized open and closed models. Our findings reveal that health-related pluralism demands adaptable and normatively aware approaches, offering insights into how these models can better respect diversity in other high-stakes domains.

  In this paper, we survey recent advances in Reinforcement Learning (RL) for reasoning with Large Language Models (LLMs). RL has achieved remarkable success in advancing the frontier of LLM capabilities, particularly in addressing complex logical tasks such as mathematics and coding. As a result, RL has emerged as a foundational methodology for transforming LLMs into LRMs. With the rapid progress of the field, further scaling of RL for LRMs now faces foundational challenges not only in computational resources but also in algorithm design, training data, and infrastructure. To this end, it is timely to revisit the development of this domain, reassess its trajectory, and explore strategies to enhance the scalability of RL toward Artificial SuperIntelligence (ASI). In particular, we examine research applying RL to LLMs and LRMs for reasoning abilities, especially since the release of DeepSeek-R1, including foundational components, core problems, training resources, and downstream applications, to identify future opportunities and directions for this rapidly evolving area. We hope this review will promote future research on RL for broader reasoning models. Github:this https URL

  Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) Large Language Models (LLM) fundamentally rely on high-quality training data. While data selection and data synthesis are two common strategies to improve data quality, existing approaches often face limitations in static dataset curation that fail to adapt to evolving model capabilities. In this paper, we introduce Middo, a self-evolving Model-informed dynamic data optimization framework that uses model-aware data selection and context-preserving data refinement. Unlike conventional one-off filtering/synthesis methods, our framework establishes a closed-loop optimization system: (1) A self-referential diagnostic module proactively identifies suboptimal samples through tri-axial model signals - loss patterns (complexity), embedding cluster dynamics (diversity), and self-alignment scores (quality); (2) An adaptive optimization engine then transforms suboptimal samples into pedagogically valuable training points while preserving semantic integrity; (3) This optimization process continuously evolves with model capability through dynamic learning principles. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our Middo consistently enhances the quality of seed data and boosts LLM's performance with improving accuracy by 7.15% on average while maintaining the original dataset scale. This work establishes a new paradigm for sustainable LLM training through dynamic human-AI co-evolution of data and models. Our datasets, models, and code are coming soon.

  This paper introduces MovieCORE, a novel video question answering (VQA) dataset designed to probe deeper cognitive understanding of movie content. Unlike existing datasets that focus on surface-level comprehension, MovieCORE emphasizes questions that engage System-2 thinking while remaining specific to the video material. We present an innovative agentic brainstorming approach, utilizing multiple large language models (LLMs) as thought agents to generate and refine high-quality question-answer pairs. To evaluate dataset quality, we develop a set of cognitive tests assessing depth, thought-provocation potential, and syntactic complexity. We also propose a comprehensive evaluation scheme for assessing VQA model performance on deeper cognitive tasks. To address the limitations of existing video-language models (VLMs), we introduce an agentic enhancement module, Agentic Choice Enhancement (ACE), which improves model reasoning capabilities post-training by up to 25%. Our work contributes to advancing movie understanding in AI systems and provides valuable insights into the capabilities and limitations of current VQA models when faced with more challenging, nuanced questions about cinematic content.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) perform well in general QA but often struggle in domain-specific scenarios. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) introduces external knowledge but suffers from hallucinations and latency due to noisy retrievals. Continued pretraining internalizes domain knowledge but is costly and lacks cross-domain flexibility. We attribute this challenge to the long-tail distribution of domain knowledge, which leaves partial yet useful internal knowledge underutilized. We further argue that knowledge acquisition should be progressive, mirroring human learning: first understanding concepts, then applying them to complex reasoning. To address this, we propose Selct2Know (S2K), a cost-effective framework that internalizes domain knowledge through an internal-external knowledge self-selection strategy and selective supervised fine-tuning. We also introduce a structured reasoning data generation pipeline and integrate GRPO to enhance reasoning ability. Experiments on medical, legal, and financial QA benchmarks show that S2K consistently outperforms existing methods and matches domain-pretrained LLMs with significantly lower cost.

  _Dongxu Zhang, Ning Yang, Jihua Zhu, Jinnan Yang, Miao Xin, Baoliang Tian_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has significantly advanced the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet the reliability of these reasoning chains remains a critical challenge. A widely held "cascading failure" hypothesis suggests that errors are most detrimental when they occur early in the reasoning process. This paper challenges that assumption through systematic error-injection experiments, revealing a counter-intuitive phenomenon we term "Late-Stage Fragility": errors introduced in the later stages of a CoT chain are significantly more likely to corrupt the final answer than identical errors made at the beginning. To address this specific vulnerability, we introduce the Adaptive Self-Correction Chain-of-Thought (ASCoT) method. ASCoT employs a modular pipeline in which an Adaptive Verification Manager (AVM) operates first, followed by the Multi-Perspective Self-Correction Engine (MSCE). The AVM leverages a Positional Impact Score function I(k) that assigns different weights based on the position within the reasoning chains, addressing the Late-Stage Fragility issue by identifying and prioritizing high-risk, late-stage steps. Once these critical steps are identified, the MSCE applies robust, dual-path correction specifically to the failure parts. Extensive experiments on benchmarks such as GSM8K and MATH demonstrate that ASCoT achieves outstanding accuracy, outperforming strong baselines, including standard CoT. Our work underscores the importance of diagnosing specific failure modes in LLM reasoning and advocates for a shift from uniform verification strategies to adaptive, vulnerability-aware correction mechanisms.

  _Jingni Wu, Amir Zeldes_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Discourse markers (DMs) like 'but' or 'then' are crucial for creating coherence in discourse, yet they are often replaced by or co-occur with non-DMs ('in the morning' can mean the same as 'then'), and both can be ambiguous ('since' can refer to time or cause). The interaction mechanism between such signals remains unclear but pivotal for their disambiguation. In this paper we investigate the relationship between DM polysemy and co-occurrence of non-DM signals in English, as well as the influence of genre on these patterns.Using the framework of eRST, we propose a graded definition of DM polysemy, and conduct correlation and regression analyses to examine whether polysemous DMs are accompanied by more numerous and diverse non-DM signals. Our findings reveal that while polysemous DMs do co-occur with more diverse non-DMs, the total number of co-occurring signals does not necessarily increase. Moreover, genre plays a significant role in shaping DM-signal interactions.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  With the growing use of language models (LMs) in clinical environments, there is an immediate need to evaluate the accuracy and safety of LM-generated medical text. Currently, such evaluation relies solely on manual physician review. However, detecting errors in LM-generated text is challenging because 1) manual review is costly and 2) expert-composed reference outputs are often unavailable in real-world settings. While the "LM-as-judge" paradigm (a LM evaluating another LM) offers scalable evaluation, even frontier LMs can miss subtle but clinically significant errors. To address these challenges, we propose MedVAL, a novel, self-supervised, data-efficient distillation method that leverages synthetic data to train evaluator LMs to assess whether LM-generated medical outputs are factually consistent with inputs, without requiring physician labels or reference outputs. To evaluate LM performance, we introduce MedVAL-Bench, a dataset of 840 physician-annotated outputs across 6 diverse medical tasks capturing real-world challenges. Across 10 state-of-the-art LMs spanning open-source and proprietary models, MedVAL distillation significantly improves (p < 0.001) alignment with physicians across seen and unseen tasks, increasing average F1 scores from 66% to 83%. Despite strong baseline performance, MedVAL improves the best-performing proprietary LM (GPT-4o) by 8% without training on physician-labeled data, demonstrating a performance statistically non-inferior to a single human expert (p < 0.001). To support a scalable, risk-aware pathway towards clinical integration, we open-source: 1) Codebase (this https URL), 2) MedVAL-Bench (this https URL), 3) MedVAL-4B (this https URL). Our benchmark provides evidence of LMs approaching expert-level ability in validating AI-generated medical text.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Alignment of large language models (LLMs) with principles like helpfulness, honesty, and harmlessness typically relies on scalar rewards that obscure which objectives drive the training signal. We introduce QA-LIGN, which decomposes monolithic rewards into interpretable principle-specific evaluations through structured natural language programs. Models learn through a draft, critique, and revise pipeline, where symbolic evaluation against the rubrics provides transparent feedback for both initial and revised responses during GRPO training. Applied to uncensored Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, QA-LIGN reduces attack success rates by up to 68.7% while maintaining a 0.67% false refusal rate, achieving Pareto optimal safety-helpfulness performance and outperforming both DPO and GRPO with state-of-the-art reward models given equivalent training. These results demonstrate that making reward signals interpretable and modular improves alignment effectiveness, suggesting transparency enhances LLM safety.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Zero-shot Event Detection (ED), the task of identifying event mentions in natural language text without any training data, is critical for document understanding in specialized domains. Understanding the complex event ontology, extracting domain-specific triggers from the passage, and structuring them appropriately overloads and limits the utility of Large Language Models (LLMs) for zero-shot ED. To this end, we propose DiCoRe, a divergent-convergent reasoning framework that decouples the task of ED using Dreamer and Grounder. Dreamer encourages divergent reasoning through open-ended event discovery, which helps to boost event coverage. Conversely, Grounder introduces convergent reasoning to align the free-form predictions with the task-specific instructions using finite-state machine guided constrained decoding. Additionally, an LLM-Judge verifies the final outputs to ensure high precision. Through extensive experiments on six datasets across five domains and nine LLMs, we demonstrate how DiCoRe consistently outperforms prior zero-shot, transfer-learning, and reasoning baselines, achieving 4-7% average F1 gains over the best baseline -- establishing DiCoRe as a strong zero-shot ED framework.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems traditionally treat retrieval and generation as separate processes, requiring explicit textual queries to connect them. This separation can limit the ability of models to generalize across diverse tasks. In this work, we propose a query-free RAG system, named ImpRAG, which integrates retrieval and generation into a unified model. ImpRAG allows models to implicitly express their information needs, eliminating the need for human-specified queries. By dividing pretrained decoder-only language models into specialized layer groups, ImpRAG optimizes retrieval and generation tasks simultaneously. Our approach employs a two-stage inference process, using the same model parameters and forward pass for both retrieval and generation, thereby minimizing the disparity between retrievers and language models. Experiments on 8 knowledge-intensive tasks demonstrate that ImpRAG achieves 3.6-11.5 improvements in exact match scores on unseen tasks with diverse formats, highlighting its effectiveness in enabling models to articulate their own information needs and generalize across tasks. Our analysis underscores the importance of balancing retrieval and generation parameters and leveraging generation perplexities as retrieval training objectives for enhanced performance.

  The large language models (LLMs) are able to generate high-quality texts in multiple languages. Such texts are often not recognizable by humans as generated, and therefore present a potential of LLMs for misuse (e.g., plagiarism, spams, disinformation spreading). An automated detection is able to assist humans to indicate the machine-generated texts; however, its robustness to out-of-distribution data is still challenging. This notebook describes our mdok approach in robust detection, based on fine-tuning smaller LLMs for text classification. It is applied to both subtasks of Voight-Kampff Generative AI Detection 2025, providing remarkable performance (1st rank) in both, the binary detection as well as the multiclass classification of various cases of human-AI collaboration.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong performance in many reasoning benchmarks. However, recent studies have pointed to memorization, rather than generalization, as one of the leading causes for such performance. LLMs, in fact, are susceptible to content variations, demonstrating a lack of robust planning or symbolic abstractions supporting their reasoning process. To improve reliability, many attempts have been made to combine LLMs with symbolic methods. Nevertheless, existing approaches fail to effectively leverage symbolic representations due to the challenges involved in developing reliable and scalable verification mechanisms. In this paper, we propose to overcome such limitations by synthesizing high-quality symbolic reasoning trajectories with stepwise pseudo-labels at scale via Monte Carlo estimation. A Process Reward Model (PRM) can be efficiently trained based on the synthesized data and then used to select more symbolic trajectories. The trajectories are then employed with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to improve logical reasoning and generalization. Our results on benchmarks (i.e., FOLIO and LogicAsker) show the effectiveness of the proposed method with gains on frontier and open-weight models. Moreover, additional experiments on claim verification data reveal that fine-tuning on the generated symbolic reasoning trajectories enhances out-of-domain generalizability, suggesting the potential impact of the proposed method in enhancing planning and logical reasoning.

  Web agents powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise for next-generation AI, but their limited reasoning in uncertain, dynamic web environments hinders robust deployment. In this paper, we identify key reasoning skills essential for effective web agents, i.e., reflection & lookahead, branching, and rollback, and curate trajectory data that exemplifies these abilities by reconstructing the agent's (inference-time) reasoning algorithms into chain-of-thought rationales. We conduct experiments in the agent self-improving benchmark, OpenWebVoyager, and demonstrate that distilling salient reasoning patterns into the backbone LLM via simple fine-tuning can substantially enhance its performance. Our approach yields significant improvements across multiple benchmarks, including WebVoyager, Mind2web-live, and SimpleQA (web search), highlighting the potential of targeted reasoning skill enhancement for web agents.

  Metadata extraction is essential for cataloging and preserving datasets, enabling effective research discovery and reproducibility, especially given the current exponential growth in scientific research. While Masader (Alyafeai et al.,2021) laid the groundwork for extracting a wide range of metadata attributes from Arabic NLP datasets' scholarly articles, it relies heavily on manual annotation. In this paper, we present MOLE, a framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically extract metadata attributes from scientific papers covering datasets of languages other than Arabic. Our schema-driven methodology processes entire documents across multiple input formats and incorporates robust validation mechanisms for consistent output. Additionally, we introduce a new benchmark to evaluate the research progress on this task. Through systematic analysis of context length, few-shot learning, and web browsing integration, we demonstrate that modern LLMs show promising results in automating this task, highlighting the need for further future work improvements to ensure consistent and reliable performance.

  LLM-as-a-Judge employs large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4, to evaluate the quality of LLM-generated responses, gaining popularity for its cost-effectiveness and strong alignment with human evaluations. However, training proxy judge models using evaluation data generated by powerful teacher models introduces a critical yet previously overlooked issue: teacher preference bias, where the proxy judge model learns a biased preference for responses from the teacher model. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel setting that incorporates an additional assistant model, which is not biased toward the teacher model's responses, to complement the training data. Building on this setup, we introduce AGDe-Judge, a three-stage framework designed to debias from both the labels and feedbacks in the training data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AGDe-Judge effectively reduces teacher preference bias while maintaining strong performance across six evaluation benchmarks.

  Language confusion -- where large language models (LLMs) generate unintended languages against the user's need -- remains a critical challenge, especially for English-centric models. We present the first mechanistic interpretability (MI) study of language confusion, combining behavioral benchmarking with neuron-level analysis. Using the Language Confusion Benchmark (LCB), we show that confusion points (CPs) -- specific positions where language switches occur -- are central to this phenomenon. Through layer-wise analysis with TunedLens and targeted neuron attribution, we reveal that transition failures in the final layers drive confusion. We further demonstrate that editing a small set of critical neurons, identified via comparative analysis with a multilingual-tuned counterpart, substantially mitigates confusion while largely preserving general competence and fluency. Our approach matches multilingual alignment in confusion reduction for many languages and yields cleaner, higher-quality outputs. These findings provide new insights into the internal dynamics of LLMs and highlight neuron-level interventions as a promising direction for robust, interpretable multilingual language modeling.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Prompt optimization is a practical and widely applicable alternative to fine tuning for improving large language model performance. Yet many existing methods evaluate candidate prompts by sampling full outputs, often coupled with self critique or human annotated preferences, which limits scalability, especially for smaller models or models that are not instruction tuned. We present PMPO (Probabilistic Metric Prompt Optimization), a unified framework that uses token level cross entropy as a direct, lightweight evaluation signal. PMPO locates low quality prompt segments via a masking based analysis and iteratively rewrites them to propose improved variants. Crucially, during evaluation, PMPO selects among variants by minimizing loss in a single forward pass, eliminating output sampling and human or judge based scoring for selection while still using standard generation only to propose rewrites. This unified, loss based strategy supports both supervised and preference based tasks. Across model sizes and datasets, PMPO outperforms prior prompt optimizers: it achieves the highest average accuracy on BBH, performs strongly on GSM8K and AQUA RAT, and raises AlpacaEval 2.0 win rates by over 19 points. These results demonstrate PMPO's effectiveness, efficiency, and broad applicability.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Diverse language model responses are crucial for creative generation, open-ended tasks, and self-improvement training. We show that common diversity metrics, and even reward models used for preference optimization, systematically bias models toward shorter outputs, limiting expressiveness. To address this, we introduce Diverse, not Short (Diverse-NS), a length-controlled data selection strategy that improves response diversity while maintaining length parity. By generating and filtering preference data that balances diversity, quality, and length, Diverse-NS enables effective training using only 3,000 preference pairs. Applied to LLaMA-3.1-8B and the Olmo-2 family, Diverse-NS substantially enhances lexical and semantic diversity. We show consistent improvement in diversity with minor reduction or gains in response quality on four creative generation tasks: Divergent Associations, Persona Generation, Alternate Uses, and Creative Writing. Surprisingly, experiments with the Olmo-2 model family (7B, and 13B) show that smaller models like Olmo-2-7B can serve as effective "diversity teachers" for larger models. By explicitly addressing length bias, our method efficiently pushes models toward more diverse and expressive outputs.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) often fail on complex reasoning tasks due to flawed question comprehension, not just flawed logic. This paper presents a systematic investigation into these comprehension failures. Our work yields three key insights: (1) the step-by-step principle, effective for calculation, can be migrated to the reading process to enhance comprehension; (2) increasing the proportion of question-related tokens (e.g., via repetition) succeeds by refocusing attention, a mechanism that can be explicitly controlled; and (3) backward dependencies represent a core bottleneck for decoder-only models that persists even with strong methods like Chain-of-Thought. Based on these findings, we introduce the Step-by-Step Reading (SSR) family of prompts. This multi-stage approach culminates in SSR++, a method specifically engineered to deepen model comprehension by guiding it to parse questions with finer granularity, focus attention on critical tokens, and resolve backward dependencies through iterative re-contextualization. SSR++ sets a new state-of-the-art on multiple reasoning benchmarks, and our analysis confirms it works by directly mitigating semantic misunderstanding. These results demonstrate that guiding how a model reads is a powerful and efficient method for improving its reasoning ability.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Language Models (LMs) are typically tuned with human preferences to produce helpful responses, but the impact of preference tuning on the ability to handle culturally diverse queries remains understudied. In this paper, we systematically analyze how native human cultural preferences can be incorporated into the preference learning process to train more culturally aware LMs. We introduce \textbf{CARE}, a multilingual resource containing 3,490 culturally specific questions and 31.7k responses with human judgments. We demonstrate how a modest amount of high-quality native preferences improves cultural awareness across various LMs, outperforming larger generic preference data. Our analyses reveal that models with stronger initial cultural performance benefit more from alignment, leading to gaps among models developed in different regions with varying access to culturally relevant data.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present a survey of methods for assessing and enhancing the quality of online discussions, focusing on the potential of LLMs. While online discourses aim, at least in theory, to foster mutual understanding, they often devolve into harmful exchanges, such as hate speech, threatening social cohesion and democratic values. Recent advancements in LLMs enable artificial facilitation agents to not only moderate content, but also actively improve the quality of interactions. Our survey synthesizes ideas from NLP and Social Sciences to provide (a) a new taxonomy on discussion quality evaluation, (b) an overview of intervention and facilitation strategies, (c) along with a new taxonomy of conversation facilitation datasets, (d) an LLM-oriented roadmap of good practices and future research directions, from technological and societal perspectives.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Optimizing language models for use in conversational agents requires large quantities of example dialogues. Increasingly, these dialogues are synthetically generated by using powerful large language models (LLMs), especially in domains where obtaining authentic human data is challenging. One such domain is human resources (HR). In this context, we compare two LLM-based dialogue generation methods for producing HR job interviews, and assess which method generates higher-quality dialogues, i.e., those more difficult to distinguish from genuine human discourse. The first method uses a single prompt to generate the complete interview dialogue. The second method uses two agents that converse with each other. To evaluate dialogue quality under each method, we ask a judge LLM to determine whether AI was used for interview generation, using pairwise interview comparisons. We empirically find that, at the expense of a sixfold increase in token count, interviews generated with the dual-prompt method achieve a win rate 2 to 10 times higher than those generated with the single-prompt method. This difference remains consistent regardless of whether GPT-4o or Llama 3.3 70B is used for either interview generation or quality judging.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Event Detection (ED) -- the task of identifying event mentions from natural language text -- is critical for enabling reasoning in highly specialized domains such as biomedicine, law, and epidemiology. Data generation has proven to be effective in broadening its utility to wider applications without requiring expensive expert annotations. However, when existing generation approaches are applied to specialized domains, they struggle with label noise, where annotations are incorrect, and domain drift, characterized by a distributional mismatch between generated sentences and the target domain. To address these issues, we introduce SNaRe, a domain-aware synthetic data generation framework composed of three components: Scout, Narrator, and Refiner. Scout extracts triggers from unlabeled target domain data and curates a high-quality domain-specific trigger list using corpus-level statistics to mitigate domain drift. Narrator, conditioned on these triggers, generates high-quality domain-aligned sentences, and Refiner identifies additional event mentions, ensuring high annotation quality. Experimentation on three diverse domain ED datasets reveals how SNaRe outperforms the best baseline, achieving average F1 gains of 3-7% in the zero-shot/few-shot settings and 4-20% F1 improvement for multilingual generation. Analyzing the generated trigger hit rate and human evaluation substantiates SNaRe's stronger annotation quality and reduced domain drift.

  _Leonie Weissweiler, Kyle Mahowald, Adele Goldberg_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Linguistic evaluations of how well LMs generalize to produce or understand language often implicitly take for granted that natural languages are generated by symbolic rules. According to this perspective, grammaticality is determined by whether sentences obey such rules. Interpretation is compositionally generated by syntactic rules operating on meaningful words. Semantic parsing maps sentences into formal logic. Failures of LMs to obey strict rules are presumed to reveal that LMs do not produce or understand language like humans. Here we suggest that LMs' failures to obey symbolic rules may be a feature rather than a bug, because natural languages are not based on neatly separable, compositional rules. Rather, new utterances are produced and understood by a combination of flexible, interrelated, and context-dependent constructions. Considering gradient factors such as frequencies, context, and function will help us reimagine new benchmarks and analyses to probe whether and how LMs capture the rich, flexible generalizations that comprise natural languages.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advancements in language models have led to significant improvements in mathematical reasoning across various benchmarks. However, most of these benchmarks rely on automatic evaluation methods that only compare final answers using heuristics, without verifying the underlying reasoning steps. This limitation results in false positive solutions, where models may produce correct final answers but with flawed deduction paths. In this paper, we systematically examine the prevalence of false positive solutions in mathematical problem solving for language models. We analyze the characteristics and extent of this issue across different open-source models, datasets of varying difficulty levels, and decoding strategies. Specifically, we explore how false positives influence the inference time scaling behavior of language models. Our experimental results reveal that: (1) false positive solutions persist across different models, datasets, and decoding methods, (2) sampling-based inference time scaling methods do not alleviate the problem, and (3) the pass@N evaluation metric is more susceptible to false positives, suggesting a significantly lower scaling ceiling than what automatic evaluations indicate. Additionally, we analyze specific instances of false positives and discuss potential limitations in self-improvement techniques and synthetic data generation under such conditions.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Avoiding the propagation of undue (binary) gender inferences and default masculine language remains a key challenge towards inclusive multilingual technologies, particularly when translating into languages with extensive gendered morphology. Gender-neutral translation (GNT) represents a linguistic strategy towards fairer communication across languages. However, research on GNT is limited to a few resources and language pairs. To address this gap, we introduce mGeNTE, an expert-curated resource, and use it to conduct the first systematic multilingual evaluation of inclusive translation with state-of-the-art instruction-following language models (LMs). Experiments on en-es/de/it/el reveal that while models can recognize when neutrality is appropriate, they cannot consistently produce neutral translations, limiting their usability. To probe this behavior, we enrich our evaluation with interpretability analyses that identify task-relevant features and offer initial insights into the internal dynamics of LM-based GNT.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Ambiguity resolution is key to effective communication. While humans effortlessly address ambiguity through conversational grounding strategies, the extent to which current language models can emulate these strategies remains unclear. In this work, we examine referential ambiguity in image-based question answering by introducing RACQUET, a carefully curated dataset targeting distinct aspects of ambiguity. Through a series of evaluations, we reveal significant limitations and problems of overconfidence of state-of-the-art large multimodal language models in addressing ambiguity in their responses. The overconfidence issue becomes particularly relevant for RACQUET-BIAS, a subset designed to analyze a critical yet underexplored problem: failing to address ambiguity leads to stereotypical, socially biased responses. Our results underscore the urgency of equipping models with robust strategies to deal with uncertainty without resorting to undesirable stereotypes.

  Legal research depends on headnotes: concise summaries that help lawyers quickly identify relevant cases. Yet, many court decisions lack them due to the high cost of manual annotation. To address this gap, we introduce the Swiss Landmark Decisions Summarization (SLDS) dataset containing 20K rulings from the Swiss Federal Supreme Court, each with headnotes in German, French, and Italian. SLDS has the potential to significantly improve access to legal information and transform legal research in Switzerland. We fine-tune open models (Qwen2.5, Llama 3.2, Phi-3.5) and compare them to larger general-purpose and reasoning-tuned LLMs, including GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and the open-source DeepSeek R1. Using an LLM-as-a-Judge framework, we find that fine-tuned models perform well in terms of lexical similarity, while larger models generate more legally accurate and coherent summaries. Interestingly, reasoning-focused models show no consistent benefit, suggesting that factual precision is more important than deep reasoning in this task. We release SLDS under a CC BY 4.0 license to support future research in cross-lingual legal summarization.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Hallucinations in large language models (LLMs) pose significant challenges in tasks requiring complex multi-step reasoning, such as mathematical problem-solving. Existing approaches primarily detect the presence of hallucinations but lack a nuanced understanding of their types and manifestations. In this paper, we first introduce a comprehensive taxonomy that categorizes the common hallucinations in mathematical reasoning tasks into six types. We then propose FG-PRM (Fine-Grained Process Reward Model), an augmented model designed to detect and mitigate hallucinations in a fine-grained, step-level manner. To address the limitations of manually labeling training data, we propose an automated method for generating fine-grained hallucination data using LLMs. Our FG-PRM demonstrates superior performance across two key tasks: 1) Fine-grained hallucination detection: classifying hallucination types for each reasoning step; and 2) Verification: ranking multiple LLM-generated outputs to select the most accurate solution. Our experiments show that FG-PRM excels in fine-grained hallucination detection and substantially boosts the performance of LLMs on GSM8K and MATH benchmarks. These results highlight the benefits of fine-grained supervision in enhancing the reliability and interpretability of LLM reasoning processes.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  While Transformer networks benefit from a global receptive field, their quadratic cost relative to sequence length restricts their application to long sequences and high-resolution inputs. We introduce Fast Multipole Attention (FMA), a divide-and-conquer mechanism for self-attention inspired by the Fast Multipole Method from n-body physics. FMA reduces the time and memory complexity of self-attention from $\mathcal{O}\left(n^2\right)$ to $\mathcal{O}(n \log n)$ and $\mathcal{O}(n)$ while preserving full-context interactions.FMA contains a learned hierarchy with $\mathcal{O}(\log n)$ levels of resolution. In this hierarchy, nearby tokens interact at full resolution, while distant tokens engage through progressively coarser, learned basis functions. We have developed both 1D and 2D implementations of FMA for language and vision tasks, respectively. On autoregressive and bidirectional language modeling benchmarks, the 1D variant either matches or outperforms leading efficient attention baselines with substantially lower memory use. With linear complexity, the 2D variant demonstrates superior performance over strong vision transformer baselines in classification and semantic segmentation tasks.Our results confirm that the multilevel attention implemented by FMA allows Transformer-based models to scale to much longer sequences and higher-resolution inputs without loss in accuracy. This provides a principled, physics-inspired approach for developing scalable neural networks suitable for language, vision, and multimodal tasks. Our code will be available atthis https URL.

  Medical Vision-Language Models (Med-VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across diverse medical imaging tasks by leveraging large-scale image-text pretraining. However, their confidence calibration is largely unexplored, and so remains a significant challenge. As such, miscalibrated predictions can lead to overconfident errors, undermining clinical trust and decision-making reliability. To address this, we introduce CalibPrompt, the first framework to calibrate Med-VLMs during prompt tuning. CalibPrompt optimizes a small set of learnable prompts with carefully designed calibration objectives under scarce labeled data regime. First, we study a regularizer that attempts to align the smoothed accuracy with the predicted model confidences. Second, we introduce an angular separation loss to maximize textual feature proximity toward improving the reliability in confidence estimates of multimodal Med-VLMs. Extensive experiments on four publicly available Med-VLMs and five diverse medical imaging datasets reveal that CalibPrompt consistently improves calibration without drastically affecting clean accuracy.

  We introduce VocAlign, a novel source-free domain adaptation framework specifically designed for VLMs in open-vocabulary semantic segmentation. Our method adopts a student-teacher paradigm enhanced with a vocabulary alignment strategy, which improves pseudo-label generation by incorporating additional class concepts. To ensure efficiency, we use Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to fine-tune the model, preserving its original capabilities while minimizing computational overhead. In addition, we propose a Top-K class selection mechanism for the student model, which significantly reduces memory requirements while further improving adaptation performance. Our approach achieves a notable 6.11 mIoU improvement on the CityScapes dataset and demonstrates superior performance on zero-shot segmentation benchmarks, setting a new standard for source-free adaptation in the open-vocabulary setting.

  Event cameras capture sparse, high-temporal-resolution visual information, making them particularly suitable for challenging environments with high-speed motion and strongly varying lighting conditions. However, the lack of large datasets with dense ground-truth depth annotations hinders learning-based monocular depth estimation from event data. To address this limitation, we propose a cross-modal distillation paradigm to generate dense proxy labels leveraging a Vision Foundation Model (VFM). Our strategy requires an event stream spatially aligned with RGB frames, a simple setup even available off-the-shelf, and exploits the robustness of large-scale VFMs. Additionally, we propose to adapt VFMs, either a vanilla one like Depth Anything v2 (DAv2), or deriving from it a novel recurrent architecture to infer depth from monocular event cameras. We evaluate our approach with synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating that i) our cross-modal paradigm achieves competitive performance compared to fully supervised methods without requiring expensive depth annotations, and ii) our VFM-based models achieve state-of-the-art performance.

Trained on this scaled-up data, ScaleCUA can operate seamlessly across platforms. Specifically, it delivers strong gains over baselines (+26.6 on WebArena-Lite-v2, +10.7 on ScreenSpot-Pro) and sets new state-of-the-art results (94.4% on MMBench-GUI L1-Hard, 60.6% on OSWorld-G, 47.4% on WebArena-Lite-v2).

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  To reconstruct the 3D geometry from calibrated images, learning-based multi-view stereo (MVS) methods typically perform multi-view depth estimation and then fuse depth maps into a mesh or point cloud. To improve the computational efficiency, many methods initialize a coarse depth map and then gradually refine it in higher resolutions. Recently, diffusion models achieve great success in generation tasks. Starting from a random noise, diffusion models gradually recover the sample with an iterative denoising process. In this paper, we propose a novel MVS framework, which introduces diffusion models in MVS. Specifically, we formulate depth refinement as a conditional diffusion process. Considering the discriminative characteristic of depth estimation, we design a condition encoder to guide the diffusion process. To improve efficiency, we propose a novel diffusion network combining lightweight 2D U-Net and convolutional GRU. Moreover, we propose a novel confidence-based sampling strategy to adaptively sample depth hypotheses based on the confidence estimated by diffusion model. Based on our novel MVS framework, we propose two novel MVS methods, DiffMVS and CasDiffMVS. DiffMVS achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art efficiency in run-time and GPU memory. CasDiffMVS achieves state-of-the-art performance on DTU, Tanks & Temples and ETH3D. Code is available at:this https URL.

  This paper presents RynnVLA-001, a vision-language-action(VLA) model built upon large-scale video generative pretraining from human demonstrations. We propose a novel two-stage pretraining methodology. The first stage, Ego-Centric Video Generative Pretraining, trains an Image-to-Video model on 12M ego-centric manipulation videos to predict future frames conditioned on an initial frame and a language instruction. The second stage, Human-Centric Trajectory-Aware Modeling, extends this by jointly predicting future keypoint trajectories, thereby effectively bridging visual frame prediction with action prediction. Furthermore, to enhance action representation, we propose ActionVAE, a variational autoencoder that compresses sequences of actions into compact latent embeddings, reducing the complexity of the VLA output space. When finetuned on the same downstream robotics datasets, RynnVLA-001 achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art baselines, demonstrating that the proposed pretraining strategy provides a more effective initialization for VLA models.

  Synchronization is the task of estimating and inverting geometric transformations (e.g., crop, rotation) applied to an image. This work introduces SyncSeal, a bespoke watermarking method for robust image synchronization, which can be applied on top of existing watermarking methods to enhance their robustness against geometric transformations. It relies on an embedder network that imperceptibly alters images and an extractor network that predicts the geometric transformation to which the image was subjected. Both networks are end-to-end trained to minimize the error between the predicted and ground-truth parameters of the transformation, combined with a discriminator to maintain high perceptual quality. We experimentally validate our method on a wide variety of geometric and valuemetric transformations, demonstrating its effectiveness in accurately synchronizing images. We further show that our synchronization can effectively upgrade existing watermarking methods to withstand geometric transformations to which they were previously vulnerable.

  Recent studies have demonstrated the importance of high-quality visual representations in image generation and have highlighted the limitations of generative models in image understanding. As a generative paradigm originally designed for natural language, autoregressive models face similar challenges. In this work, we present the first systematic investigation into the mechanisms of applying the next-token prediction paradigm to the visual domain. We identify three key properties that hinder the learning of high-level visual semantics: local and conditional dependence, inter-step semantic inconsistency, and spatial invariance deficiency. We show that these issues can be effectively addressed by introducing self-supervised objectives during training, leading to a novel training framework, Self-guided Training for AutoRegressive models (ST-AR). Without relying on pre-trained representation models, ST-AR significantly enhances the image understanding ability of autoregressive models and leads to improved generation quality. Specifically, ST-AR brings approximately 42% FID improvement for LlamaGen-L and 49% FID improvement for LlamaGen-XL, while maintaining the same sampling strategy.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Accurate maize seedling detection is crucial for precision agriculture, yet curated datasets remain scarce. We introduce MSDD, a high-quality aerial image dataset for maize seedling stand counting, with applications in early-season crop monitoring, yield prediction, and in-field management. Stand counting determines how many plants germinated, guiding timely decisions such as replanting or adjusting inputs. Traditional methods are labor-intensive and error-prone, while computer vision enables efficient, accurate detection. MSDD contains three classes-single, double, and triple plants-capturing diverse growth stages, planting setups, soil types, lighting conditions, camera angles, and densities, ensuring robustness for real-world use. Benchmarking shows detection is most reliable during V4-V6 stages and under nadir views. Among tested models, YOLO11 is fastest, while YOLOv9 yields the highest accuracy for single plants. Single plant detection achieves precision up to 0.984 and recall up to 0.873, but detecting doubles and triples remains difficult due to rarity and irregular appearance, often from planting errors. Class imbalance further reduces accuracy in multi-plant detection. Despite these challenges, YOLO11 maintains efficient inference at 35 ms per image, with an additional 120 ms for saving outputs. MSDD establishes a strong foundation for developing models that enhance stand counting, optimize resource allocation, and support real-time decision-making. This dataset marks a step toward automating agricultural monitoring and advancing precision agriculture.

  _Zaiquan Yang, Yuhao Liu, Gerhard Hancke, Rynson W.H. Lau_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Spatio-temporal video grounding (STVG) aims at localizing the spatio-temporal tube of a video, as specified by the input text query. In this paper, we utilize multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to explore a zero-shot solution in STVG. We reveal two key insights about MLLMs: (1) MLLMs tend to dynamically assign special tokens, referred to as \textit{grounding tokens}, for grounding the text query; and (2) MLLMs often suffer from suboptimal grounding due to the inability to fully integrate the cues in the text query (\textit{e.g.}, attributes, actions) for inference. Based on these insights, we propose a MLLM-based zero-shot framework for STVG, which includes novel decomposed spatio-temporal highlighting (DSTH) and temporal-augmented assembling (TAS) strategies to unleash the reasoning ability of MLLMs. The DSTH strategy first decouples the original query into attribute and action sub-queries for inquiring the existence of the target both spatially and temporally. It then uses a novel logit-guided re-attention (LRA) module to learn latent variables as spatial and temporal prompts, by regularizing token predictions for each sub-query. These prompts highlight attribute and action cues, respectively, directing the model's attention to reliable spatial and temporal related visual regions. In addition, as the spatial grounding by the attribute sub-query should be temporally consistent, we introduce the TAS strategy to assemble the predictions using the original video frames and the temporal-augmented frames as inputs to help improve temporal consistency. We evaluate our method on various MLLMs, and show that it outperforms SOTA methods on three common STVG benchmarks.The code will be available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The age gap in kinship verification addresses the time difference between the photos of the parent and the child. Moreover, their same-age photos are often unavailable, and face aging models are racially biased, which impacts the likeness of photos. Therefore, we propose a face aging GAN model, RA-GAN, consisting of two new modules, RACEpSp and a feature mixer, to produce racially unbiased images. The unbiased synthesized photos are used in kinship verification to investigate the results of verifying same-age parent-child images. The experiments demonstrate that our RA-GAN outperforms SAM-GAN on an average of 13.14\% across all age groups, and CUSP-GAN in the 60+ age group by 9.1\% in terms of racial accuracy. Moreover, RA-GAN can preserve subjects' identities better than SAM-GAN and CUSP-GAN across all age groups. Additionally, we demonstrate that transforming parent and child images from the KinFaceW-I and KinFaceW-II datasets to the same age can enhance the verification accuracy across all age groups. The accuracy increases with our RA-GAN for the kinship relationships of father-son and father-daughter, mother-son, and mother-daughter, which are 5.22, 5.12, 1.63, and 0.41, respectively, on KinFaceW-I. Additionally, the accuracy for the relationships of father-daughter, father-son, and mother-son is 2.9, 0.39, and 1.6 on KinFaceW-II, respectively.

We focus on the semi-supervised setting, where only a few labeled 3D medical images are available, along with a large set of unlabeled images. To tackle this, we propose a model-agnostic framework that progressively distills knowledge from a 2D pretrained model to a 3D segmentation model trained from scratch. Our approach, M&N, involves iterative co-training of the two models using pseudo-masks generated by each other, along with our proposed learning rate guided sampling that adaptively adjusts the proportion of labeled and unlabeled data in each training batch to align with the models' prediction accuracy and stability, minimizing the adverse effect caused by inaccurate pseudo-masks. Extensive experiments on multiple publicly available datasets demonstrate that M&N achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming thirteen existing semi-supervised segmentation approaches under all different settings. Importantly, ablation studies show that M&N remains model-agnostic, allowing seamless integration with different architectures. This ensures its adaptability as more advanced models emerge.

  Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by retrieving relevant documents from external sources to improve factual accuracy and verifiability. However, this reliance introduces new attack surfaces within the retrieval pipeline, beyond the LLM itself. While prior RAG attacks have exposed such vulnerabilities, they largely rely on manipulating user queries, which is often infeasible in practice due to fixed or protected user inputs. This narrow focus overlooks a more realistic and stealthy vector: instructional prompts, which are widely reused, publicly shared, and rarely audited. Their implicit trust makes them a compelling target for adversaries to manipulate RAG behavior covertly.We introduce a novel attack for Adversarial Instructional Prompt (AIP) that exploits adversarial instructional prompts to manipulate RAG outputs by subtly altering retrieval behavior. By shifting the attack surface to the instructional prompts, AIP reveals how trusted yet seemingly benign interface components can be weaponized to degrade system integrity. The attack is crafted to achieve three goals: (1) naturalness, to evade user detection; (2) utility, to encourage use of prompts; and (3) robustness, to remain effective across diverse query variations. We propose a diverse query generation strategy that simulates realistic linguistic variation in user queries, enabling the discovery of prompts that generalize across paraphrases and rephrasings. Building on this, a genetic algorithm-based joint optimization is developed to evolve adversarial prompts by balancing attack success, clean-task utility, and stealthiness. Experimental results show that AIP achieves up to 95.23% ASR while preserving benign functionality. These findings uncover a critical and previously overlooked vulnerability in RAG systems, emphasizing the need to reassess the shared instructional prompts.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Contemporary deep learning models have achieved impressive performance in image classification by primarily leveraging statistical regularities within large datasets, but they rarely incorporate structured insights drawn directly from perceptual psychology. To explore the potential of perceptually motivated inductive biases, we propose integrating classic geometric visual illusions well-studied phenomena from human perception into standard image-classification training pipelines. Specifically, we introduce a synthetic, parametric geometric-illusion dataset and evaluate three multi-source learning strategies that combine illusion recognition tasks with ImageNet classification objectives. Our experiments reveal two key conceptual insights: (i) incorporating geometric illusions as auxiliary supervision systematically improves generalization, especially in visually challenging cases involving intricate contours and fine textures; and (ii) perceptually driven inductive biases, even when derived from synthetic stimuli traditionally considered unrelated to natural image recognition, can enhance the structural sensitivity of both CNN and transformer-based architectures. These results demonstrate a novel integration of perceptual science and machine learning and suggest new directions for embedding perceptual priors into vision model design.

  Ensuring factual consistency and reliable reasoning remains a critical challenge for medical vision-language models. We introduce MEDFACT-R1, a two-stage framework that integrates external knowledge grounding with reinforcement learning to improve the factual medical reasoning. The first stage uses pseudo-label supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to incorporate external factual expertise; while the second stage applies Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with four tailored factual reward signals to encourage self-consistent reasoning. Across three public medical QA benchmarks, MEDFACT-R1 delivers up to 22.5% absolute improvement in factual accuracy over previous state-of-the-art methods. Ablation studies highlight the necessity of pseudo-label SFT cold start and validate the contribution of each GRPO reward, underscoring the synergy between knowledge grounding and RL-driven reasoning for trustworthy medical AI.

  _Fang Li, Hao Zhang, Narendra Ahuja_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Although COLMAP has long remained the predominant method for camera parameter optimization in static scenes, it is constrained by its lengthy runtime and reliance on ground truth (GT) motion masks for application to dynamic scenes. Many efforts attempted to improve it by incorporating more priors as supervision such as GT focal length, motion masks, 3D point clouds, camera poses, and metric depth, which, however, are typically unavailable in casually captured RGB videos. In this paper, we propose a novel method for more accurate and efficient camera parameter optimization in dynamic scenes solely supervised by a single RGB video. Our method consists of three key components: (1) Patch-wise Tracking Filters, to establish robust and maximally sparse hinge-like relations across the RGB video. (2) Outlier-aware Joint Optimization, for efficient camera parameter optimization by adaptive down-weighting of moving outliers, without reliance on motion priors. (3) A Two-stage Optimization Strategy, to enhance stability and optimization speed by a trade-off between the Softplus limits and convex minima in losses. We visually and numerically evaluate our camera estimates. To further validate accuracy, we feed the camera estimates into a 4D reconstruction method and assess the resulting 3D scenes, and rendered 2D RGB and depth maps. We perform experiments on 4 real-world datasets (NeRF-DS, DAVIS, iPhone, and TUM-dynamics) and 1 synthetic dataset (MPI-Sintel), demonstrating that our method estimates camera parameters more efficiently and accurately with a single RGB video as the only supervision.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent research on representation learning has proved the merits of multi-modal clues for robust semantic segmentation. Nevertheless, a flexible pretrain-and-finetune pipeline for multiple visual modalities remains unexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-modal learning framework, termed OmniSegmentor. It has two key innovations: 1) Based on ImageNet, we assemble a large-scale dataset for multi-modal pretraining, called ImageNeXt, which contains five popular visual modalities. 2) We provide an efficient pretraining manner to endow the model with the capacity to encode different modality information in the ImageNeXt. For the first time, we introduce a universal multi-modal pretraining framework that consistently amplifies the model's perceptual capabilities across various scenarios, regardless of the arbitrary combination of the involved modalities. Remarkably, our OmniSegmentor achieves new state-of-the-art records on a wide range of multi-modal semantic segmentation datasets, including NYU Depthv2, EventScape, MFNet, DeLiVER, SUNRGBD, and KITTI-360.

  This study evaluates publicly available deep-learning based lung segmentation models in transplant-eligible patients to determine their performance across disease severity levels, pathology categories, and lung sides, and to identify limitations impacting their use in preoperative planning in lung transplantation. This retrospective study included 32 patients who underwent chest CT scans at Duke University Health System between 2017 and 2019 (total of 3,645 2D axial slices). Patients with standard axial CT scans were selected based on the presence of two or more lung pathologies of varying severity. Lung segmentation was performed using three previously developed deep learning models: Unet-R231, TotalSegmentator, MedSAM. Performance was assessed using quantitative metrics (volumetric similarity, Dice similarity coefficient, Hausdorff distance) and a qualitative measure (four-point clinical acceptability scale). Unet-R231 consistently outperformed TotalSegmentator and MedSAM in general, for different severity levels, and pathology categories (p<0.05). All models showed significant performance declines from mild to moderate-to-severe cases, particularly in volumetric similarity (p<0.05), without significant differences among lung sides or pathology types. Unet-R231 provided the most accurate automated lung segmentation among evaluated models with TotalSegmentator being a close second, though their performance declined significantly in moderate-to-severe cases, emphasizing the need for specialized model fine-tuning in severe pathology contexts.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper addresses the synthetic-to-real domain gap in object detection, focusing on training a YOLOv11 model to detect a specific object (a soup can) using only synthetic data and domain randomization strategies. The methodology involves extensive experimentation with data augmentation, dataset composition, and model scaling. While synthetic validation metrics were consistently high, they proved to be poor predictors of real-world performance. Consequently, models were also evaluated qualitatively, through visual inspection of predictions, and quantitatively, on a manually labeled real-world test set, to guide development. Final mAP@50 scores were provided by the official Kaggle competition. Key findings indicate that increasing synthetic dataset diversity, specifically by including varied perspectives and complex backgrounds, combined with carefully tuned data augmentation, were crucial in bridging the domain gap. The best performing configuration, a YOLOv11l model trained on an expanded and diverse dataset, achieved a final mAP@50 of 0.910 on the competition's hidden test set. This result demonstrates the potential of a synthetic-only training approach while also highlighting the remaining challenges in fully capturing real-world variability.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in diffusion models have revolutionized text-guided image editing, yet existing editing methods face critical challenges in hyperparameter identification. To get the reasonable editing performance, these methods often require the user to brute-force tune multiple interdependent hyperparameters, such as inversion timesteps and attention modification, \textit{etc.} This process incurs high computational costs due to the huge hyperparameter search space. We consider searching optimal editing's hyperparameters as a sequential decision-making task within the diffusion denoising process. Specifically, we propose a reinforcement learning framework, which establishes a Markov Decision Process that dynamically adjusts hyperparameters across denoising steps, integrating editing objectives into a reward function. The method achieves time efficiency through proximal policy optimization while maintaining optimal hyperparameter configurations. Experiments demonstrate significant reduction in search time and computational overhead compared to existing brute-force approaches, advancing the practical deployment of a diffusion-based image editing framework in the real world.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Accurate brain tumor segmentation is essential for preoperative evaluation and personalized treatment. Multi-modal MRI is widely used due to its ability to capture complementary tumor features across different sequences. However, in clinical practice, missing modalities are common, limiting the robustness and generalizability of existing deep learning methods that rely on complete inputs, especially under non-dominant modality combinations. To address this, we propose AdaMM, a multi-modal brain tumor segmentation framework tailored for missing-modality scenarios, centered on knowledge distillation and composed of three synergistic modules. The Graph-guided Adaptive Refinement Module explicitly models semantic associations between generalizable and modality-specific features, enhancing adaptability to modality absence. The Bi-Bottleneck Distillation Module transfers structural and textural knowledge from teacher to student models via global style matching and adversarial feature alignment. The Lesion-Presence-Guided Reliability Module predicts prior probabilities of lesion types through an auxiliary classification task, effectively suppressing false positives under incomplete inputs. Extensive experiments on the BraTS 2018 and 2024 datasets demonstrate that AdaMM consistently outperforms existing methods, exhibiting superior segmentation accuracy and robustness, particularly in single-modality and weak-modality configurations. In addition, we conduct a systematic evaluation of six categories of missing-modality strategies, confirming the superiority of knowledge distillation and offering practical guidance for method selection and future research.

  In recent years, the underwater image formation model has found extensive use in the generation of synthetic underwater data. Although many approaches focus on scenes primarily affected by discoloration, they often overlook the model's ability to capture the complex, distance-dependent visibility loss present in highly turbid environments. In this work, we propose an improved synthetic data generation pipeline that includes the commonly omitted forward scattering term, while also considering a nonuniform medium. Additionally, we collected the BUCKET dataset under controlled turbidity conditions to acquire real turbid footage with the corresponding reference images. Our results demonstrate qualitative improvements over the reference model, particularly under increasing turbidity, with a selection rate of 82. 5\% by survey participants.

  In the realm of fully autonomous drones, the accurate detection of obstacles is paramount to ensure safe navigation and prevent collisions. Among these challenges, the detection of wires stands out due to their slender profile, which poses a unique and intricate problem. To address this issue, we present an innovative solution in the form of a monocular end-to-end model for wire segmentation and depth estimation.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Compared to traditional image retrieval tasks, product retrieval in retail settings is even more challenging. Products of the same type from different brands may have highly similar visual appearances, and the query image may be taken from an angle that differs significantly from view angles of the stored catalog images. Foundational models, such as CLIP and SigLIP, often struggle to distinguish these subtle but important local differences. Pixel-wise matching methods, on the other hand, are computationally expensive and incur prohibitively high matching times. In this paper, we propose a new, hybrid method, called PRISM, for product retrieval in retail settings by leveraging the advantages of both vision-language model-based and pixel-wise matching approaches. To provide both efficiency/speed and finegrained retrieval accuracy, PRISM consists of three stages: 1) A vision-language model (SigLIP) is employed first to retrieve the top 35 most semantically similar products from a fixed gallery, thereby narrowing the search space significantly; 2) a segmentation model (YOLO-E) is applied to eliminate background clutter; 3) fine-grained pixel-level matching is performed using LightGlue across the filtered candidates. This framework enables more accurate discrimination between products with high inter-class similarity by focusing on subtle visual cues often missed by global models. Experiments performed on the ABV dataset show that our proposed PRISM outperforms the state-of-the-art image retrieval methods by 4.21% in top-1 accuracy while still remaining within the bounds of real-time processing for practical retail deployments.

  Creating high-fidelity 3D models of indoor environments is essential for applications in design, virtual reality, and robotics. However, manual 3D modeling remains time-consuming and labor-intensive. While recent advances in generative AI have enabled automated scene synthesis, existing methods often face challenges in balancing visual quality, diversity, semantic consistency, and user control. A major bottleneck is the lack of a large-scale, high-quality dataset tailored to this task. To address this gap, we introduce a comprehensive synthetic dataset, featuring 12,328 structured annotated scenes with 57,440 rooms, and 4.7M photorealistic 2D renderings. Leveraging this dataset, we present SpatialGen, a novel multi-view multi-modal diffusion model that generates realistic and semantically consistent 3D indoor scenes. Given a 3D layout and a reference image (derived from a text prompt), our model synthesizes appearance (color image), geometry (scene coordinate map), and semantic (semantic segmentation map) from arbitrary viewpoints, while preserving spatial consistency across modalities. SpatialGen consistently generates superior results to previous methods in our experiments. We are open-sourcing our data and models to empower the community and advance the field of indoor scene understanding and generation.

  Ultrasound imaging has become the preferred imaging modality for early cancer screening due to its advantages of non-ionizing radiation, low cost, and real-time imaging capabilities. However, conventional ultrasound diagnosis heavily relies on physician expertise, presenting challenges of high subjectivity and low diagnostic efficiency. Vision-language models (VLMs) offer promising solutions for this issue, but existing general-purpose models demonstrate limited knowledge in ultrasound medical tasks, with poor generalization in multi-organ lesion recognition and low efficiency across multi-task diagnostics. To address these limitations, we propose EchoVLM, a vision-language model specifically designed for ultrasound medical imaging. The model employs a Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture trained on data spanning seven anatomical regions. This design enables the model to perform multiple tasks, including ultrasound report generation, diagnosis and visual question-answering (VQA). The experimental results demonstrated that EchoVLM achieved significant improvements of 10.15 and 4.77 points in BLEU-1 scores and ROUGE-1 scores respectively compared to Qwen2-VL on the ultrasound report generation task. These findings suggest that EchoVLM has substantial potential to enhance diagnostic accuracy in ultrasound imaging, thereby providing a viable technical solution for future clinical applications.

  _Xuanhua Yin, Dingxin Zhang, Yu Feng, Shunqi Mao, Jianhui Yu, Weidong Cai_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Existing rotation-invariant point cloud masked autoencoders (MAE) rely on random masking strategies that overlook geometric structure and semantic coherence. Random masking treats patches independently, failing to capture spatial relationships consistent across orientations and overlooking semantic object parts that maintain identity regardless of rotation. We propose a dual-stream masking approach combining 3D Spatial Grid Masking and Progressive Semantic Masking to address these fundamental limitations. Grid masking creates structured patterns through coordinate sorting to capture geometric relationships that persist across different orientations, while semantic masking uses attention-driven clustering to discover semantically meaningful parts and maintain their coherence during masking. These complementary streams are orchestrated via curriculum learning with dynamic weighting, progressing from geometric understanding to semantic discovery. Designed as plug-and-play components, our strategies integrate into existing rotation-invariant frameworks without architectural changes, ensuring broad compatibility across different approaches. Comprehensive experiments on ModelNet40, ScanObjectNN, and OmniObject3D demonstrate consistent improvements across various rotation scenarios, showing substantial performance gains over the baseline rotation-invariant methods.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The rapidly growing number of product categories in large-scale e-commerce makes accurate object identification for automated packing in warehouses substantially more difficult. As the catalog grows, intra-class variability and a long tail of rare or visually similar items increase, and when combined with diverse packaging, cluttered containers, frequent occlusion, and large viewpoint changes-these factors amplify discrepancies between query and reference images, causing sharp performance drops for methods that rely solely on 2D appearance features. Thus, we propose RoboEye, a two-stage identification framework that dynamically augments 2D semantic features with domain-adapted 3D reasoning and lightweight adapters to bridge training deployment gaps. In the first stage, we train a large vision model to extract 2D features for generating candidate rankings. A lightweight 3D-feature-awareness module then estimates 3D feature quality and predicts whether 3D re-ranking is necessary, preventing performance degradation and avoiding unnecessary computation. When invoked, the second stage uses our robot 3D retrieval transformer, comprising a 3D feature extractor that produces geometry-aware dense features and a keypoint-based matcher that computes keypoint-correspondence confidences between query and reference images instead of conventional cosine-similarity scoring. Experiments show that RoboEye improves Recall@1 by 7.1% over the prior state of the art (RoboLLM). Moreover, RoboEye operates using only RGB images, avoiding reliance on explicit 3D inputs and reducing deployment costs. The code used in this paper is publicly available at:this https URL.

  Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) provides a powerful non-invasive window into the brain's functional organization by generating complex functional networks, typically modeled as graphs. These brain networks exhibit a hierarchical topology that is crucial for cognitive processing. However, due to inherent spatial constraints, standard Euclidean GNNs struggle to represent these hierarchical structures without high distortion, limiting their clinical performance. To address this limitation, we propose Brain-HGCN, a geometric deep learning framework based on hyperbolic geometry, which leverages the intrinsic property of negatively curved space to model the brain's network hierarchy with high fidelity. Grounded in the Lorentz model, our model employs a novel hyperbolic graph attention layer with a signed aggregation mechanism to distinctly process excitatory and inhibitory connections, ultimately learning robust graph-level representations via a geometrically sound Fr√©chet mean for graph readout. Experiments on two large-scale fMRI datasets for psychiatric disorder classification demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms a wide range of state-of-the-art Euclidean baselines. This work pioneers a new geometric deep learning paradigm for fMRI analysis, highlighting the immense potential of hyperbolic GNNs in the field of computational psychiatry.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The rapid growth of 3D digital content necessitates expandable recognition systems for open-world scenarios. However, existing 3D class-incremental learning methods struggle under extreme data scarcity due to geometric misalignment and texture bias. While recent approaches integrate 3D data with 2D foundation models (e.g., CLIP), they suffer from semantic blurring caused by texture-biased projections and indiscriminate fusion of geometric-textural cues, leading to unstable decision prototypes and catastrophic forgetting. To address these issues, we propose Cross-Modal Geometric Rectification (CMGR), a framework that enhances 3D geometric fidelity by leveraging CLIP's hierarchical spatial semantics. Specifically, we introduce a Structure-Aware Geometric Rectification module that hierarchically aligns 3D part structures with CLIP's intermediate spatial priors through attention-driven geometric fusion. Additionally, a Texture Amplification Module synthesizes minimal yet discriminative textures to suppress noise and reinforce cross-modal consistency. To further stabilize incremental prototypes, we employ a Base-Novel Discriminator that isolates geometric variations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly improves 3D few-shot class-incremental learning, achieving superior geometric coherence and robustness to texture bias across cross-domain and within-domain settings.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  With the increasing prevalence of synthetic images, evaluating image authenticity and locating forgeries accurately while maintaining human interpretability remains a challenging task. Existing detection models primarily focus on simple authenticity classification, ultimately providing only a forgery probability or binary judgment, which offers limited explanatory insights into image authenticity. Moreover, while MLLM-based detection methods can provide more interpretable results, they still lag behind expert models in terms of pure authenticity classification accuracy. To address this, we propose DF-LLaVA, a simple yet effective framework that unlocks the intrinsic discrimination potential of MLLMs. Our approach first extracts latent knowledge from MLLMs and then injects it into training via prompts. This framework allows LLaVA to achieve outstanding detection accuracy exceeding expert models while still maintaining the interpretability offered by MLLMs. Extensive experiments confirm the superiority of our DF-LLaVA, achieving both high accuracy and explainability in synthetic image detection.

  _Tahar Chettaoui, Naser Damer, Fadi Boutros_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Foundation models such as CLIP have demonstrated exceptional zero- and few-shot transfer capabilities across diverse vision tasks. However, when fine-tuned for highly specialized biometric tasks, face recognition (FR), morphing attack detection (MAD), and presentation attack detection (PAD), these models may suffer from over-specialization. Thus, they may lose one of their foundational strengths, cross-domain generalization. In this work, we systematically quantify these trade-offs by evaluating three instances of CLIP fine-tuned for FR, MAD, and PAD. We evaluate each adapted model as well as the original CLIP baseline on 14 general vision datasets under zero-shot and linear-probe protocols, alongside common FR, MAD, and PAD benchmarks. Our results indicate that fine-tuned models suffer from over-specialization, especially when fine-tuned for complex tasks of FR. Also, our results pointed out that task complexity and classification head design, multi-class (FR) vs. binary (MAD and PAD), correlate with the degree of catastrophic forgetting. The FRoundation model with the ViT-L backbone outperforms other approaches on the large-scale FR benchmark IJB-C, achieving an improvement of up to 58.52%. However, it experiences a substantial performance drop on ImageNetV2, reaching only 51.63% compared to 69.84% achieved by the baseline CLIP model. Moreover, the larger CLIP architecture consistently preserves more of the model's original generalization ability than the smaller variant, indicating that increased model capacity may help mitigate over-specialization.

  Complex Video Object Segmentation (VOS) presents significant challenges in accurately segmenting objects across frames, especially in the presence of small and similar targets, frequent occlusions, rapid motion, and complex interactions. In this report, we present our solution for the LSVOS 2025 VOS Track based on the SAM2 framework. We adopt a pseudo-labeling strategy during training: a trained SAM2 checkpoint is deployed within the SAM2Long framework to generate pseudo labels for the MOSE test set, which are then combined with existing data for further training. For inference, the SAM2Long framework is employed to obtain our primary segmentation results, while an open-source SeC model runs in parallel to produce complementary predictions. A cascaded decision mechanism dynamically integrates outputs from both models, exploiting the temporal stability of SAM2Long and the concept-level robustness of SeC. Benefiting from pseudo-label training and cascaded multi-model inference, our approach achieves a J\&F score of 0.8616 on the MOSE test set -- +1.4 points over our SAM2Long baseline -- securing the 2nd place in the LSVOS 2025 VOS Track, and demonstrating strong robustness and accuracy in long, complex video segmentation scenarios.

  _Antoine Legrand, Renaud Detry, Christophe De Vleeschouwer_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  On-orbit operations require the estimation of the relative 6D pose, i.e., position and orientation, between a chaser spacecraft and its target. While data-driven spacecraft pose estimation methods have been developed, their adoption in real missions is hampered by the lack of understanding of their decision process. This paper presents a method to visualize the 3D visual cues on which a given pose estimator relies. For this purpose, we train a NeRF-based image generator using the gradients back-propagated through the pose estimation network. This enforces the generator to render the main 3D features exploited by the spacecraft pose estimation network. Experiments demonstrate that our method recovers the relevant 3D cues. Furthermore, they offer additional insights on the relationship between the pose estimation network supervision and its implicit representation of the target spacecraft.

  Effective therapy decisions require models that predict the individual response to treatment. This is challenging since the progression of disease and response to treatment vary substantially across patients. Here, we propose to learn a representation of the early dynamics of treatment response from imaging data to predict pathological complete response (pCR) in breast cancer patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT). The longitudinal change in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data of the breast forms trajectories in the latent space, serving as basis for prediction of successful response. The multi-task model represents appearance, fosters temporal continuity and accounts for the comparably high heterogeneity in the non-responderthis http URLexperiments on the publicly available ISPY-2 dataset, a linear classifier in the latent trajectory space achieves a balanced accuracy of 0.761 using only pre-treatment data (T0), 0.811 using early response (T0 + T1), and 0.861 using four imaging time points (T0 -> T3). The code will be made available upon paper acceptance.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The growing use of portrait images in computer vision highlights the need to protect personal identities. At the same time, anonymized images must remain useful for downstream computer vision tasks. In this work, we propose a unified framework that leverages the inpainting ability of latent diffusion models to generate realistic anonymized images. Unlike prior approaches, we have complete control over the anonymization process by designing an adaptive attribute-guidance module that applies gradient correction during the reverse denoising process, aligning the facial attributes of the generated image with those of the synthesized target image. Our framework also supports localized anonymization, allowing users to specify which facial regions are left unchanged. Extensive experiments conducted on the public CelebA-HQ and FFHQ datasets show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches while requiring no additional model training.

  Image classification has traditionally relied on parameter-intensive model training, requiring large-scale annotated datasets and extensive fine tuning to achieve competitive performance. While recent vision language models (VLMs) alleviate some of these constraints, they remain limited by their reliance on single pass representations, often failing to capture complementary aspects of visual content. In this paper, we introduce Multi Agent based Reasoning for Image Classification (MARIC), a multi agent framework that reformulates image classification as a collaborative reasoning process. MARIC first utilizes an Outliner Agent to analyze the global theme of the image and generate targeted prompts. Based on these prompts, three Aspect Agents extract fine grained descriptions along distinct visual dimensions. Finally, a Reasoning Agent synthesizes these complementary outputs through integrated reflection step, producing a unified representation for classification. By explicitly decomposing the task into multiple perspectives and encouraging reflective synthesis, MARIC mitigates the shortcomings of both parameter-heavy training and monolithic VLM reasoning. Experiments on 4 diverse image classification benchmark datasets demonstrate that MARIC significantly outperforms baselines, highlighting the effectiveness of multi-agent visual reasoning for robust and interpretable image classification.

  This work aims to reproduce the results of Faithful Vision Transformers (FViTs) proposed byarXiv:2311.17983alongside interpretability methods for Vision Transformers fromarXiv:2012.09838and Xu (2022) et al. We investigate claims made byarXiv:2311.17983, namely that the usage of Diffusion Denoised Smoothing (DDS) improves interpretability robustness to (1) attacks in a segmentation task and (2) perturbation and attacks in a classification task. We also extend the original study by investigating the authors' claims that adding DDS to any interpretability method can improve its robustness under attack. This is tested on baseline methods and the recently proposed Attribution Rollout method. In addition, we measure the computational costs and environmental impact of obtaining an FViT through DDS. Our results broadly agree with the original study's findings, although minor discrepancies were found and discussed.

  _Hongjun Wang, Jiyuan Chen, Zhengwei Yin, Xuan Song, Yinqiang Zheng_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Generalizable Image Super-Resolution aims to enhance model generalization capabilities under unknown degradations. To achieve this goal, the models are expected to focus only on image content-related features instead of overfitting degradations. Recently, numerous approaches such as Dropout and Feature Alignment have been proposed to suppress models' natural tendency to overfit degradations and yield promising results. Nevertheless, these works have assumed that models overfit to all degradation types (e.g., blur, noise, JPEG), while through careful investigations in this paper, we discover that models predominantly overfit to noise, largely attributable to its distinct degradation pattern compared to other degradation types. In this paper, we propose a targeted feature denoising framework, comprising noise detection and denoising modules. Our approach presents a general solution that can be seamlessly integrated with existing super-resolution models without requiring architectural modifications. Our framework demonstrates superior performance compared to previous regularization-based methods across five traditional benchmarks and datasets, encompassing both synthetic and real-world scenarios.

  To maintain an overview of urban conditions, city administrations manage databases of objects like traffic signs and trees, complete with their geocoordinates. Incidents such as graffiti or road damage are also relevant. As digitization increases, so does the need for more data and up-to-date databases, requiring significant manual effort. This paper introduces MapAnything, a module that automatically determines the geocoordinates of objects using individual images. Utilizing advanced Metric Depth Estimation models, MapAnything calculates geocoordinates based on the object's distance from the camera, geometric principles, and camera specifications. We detail and validate the module, providing recommendations for automating urban object and incident mapping. Our evaluation measures the accuracy of estimated distances against LiDAR point clouds in urban environments, analyzing performance across distance intervals and semantic areas like roads and vegetation. The module's effectiveness is demonstrated through practical use cases involving traffic signs and road damage.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Bone health studies are crucial in medical practice for the early detection and treatment of Osteopenia and Osteoporosis. Clinicians usually make a diagnosis based on densitometry (DEXA scans) and patient history. The applications of AI in this field are ongoing research. Most successful methods rely on deep learning models that use vision alone (DEXA/X-ray imagery) and focus on prediction accuracy, while explainability is often disregarded and left to post hoc assessments of input contributions. We propose ProtoMedX, a multi-modal model that uses both DEXA scans of the lumbar spine and patient records. ProtoMedX's prototype-based architecture is explainable by design, which is crucial for medical applications, especially in the context of the upcoming EU AI Act, as it allows explicit analysis of model decisions, including incorrect ones. ProtoMedX demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in bone health classification while also providing explanations that can be visually understood by clinicians. Using a dataset of 4,160 real NHS patients, the proposed ProtoMedX achieves 87.58% accuracy in vision-only tasks and 89.8% in its multi-modal variant, both surpassing existing published methods.

  Text to image latent diffusion models have recently advanced medical image synthesis, but applications to 3D CT generation remain limited. Existing approaches rely on simplified prompts, neglecting the rich semantic detail in full radiology reports, which reduces text image alignment and clinical fidelity. We propose Report2CT, a radiology report conditional latent diffusion framework for synthesizing 3D chest CT volumes directly from free text radiology reports, incorporating both findings and impression sections using multiple text encoder. Report2CT integrates three pretrained medical text encoders (BiomedVLP CXR BERT, MedEmbed, and ClinicalBERT) to capture nuanced clinical context. Radiology reports and voxel spacing information condition a 3D latent diffusion model trained on 20000 CT volumes from the CT RATE dataset. Model performance was evaluated using Frechet Inception Distance (FID) for real synthetic distributional similarity and CLIP based metrics for semantic alignment, with additional qualitative and quantitative comparisons against GenerateCT model. Report2CT generated anatomically consistent CT volumes with excellent visual quality and text image alignment. Multi encoder conditioning improved CLIP scores, indicating stronger preservation of fine grained clinical details in the free text radiology reports. Classifier free guidance further enhanced alignment with only a minor trade off in FID. We ranked first in the VLM3D Challenge at MICCAI 2025 on Text Conditional CT Generation and achieved state of the art performance across all evaluation metrics. By leveraging complete radiology reports and multi encoder text conditioning, Report2CT advances 3D CT synthesis, producing clinically faithful and high quality synthetic data.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Training deep neural networks has become increasingly demanding, requiring large datasets and significant computational resources, especially as model complexity advances. Data distillation methods, which aim to improve data efficiency, have emerged as promising solutions to this challenge. In the field of single image super-resolution (SISR), the reliance on large training datasets highlights the importance of these techniques. Recently, a generative adversarial network (GAN) inversion-based data distillation framework for SR was proposed, showing potential for better data utilization. However, the current method depends heavily on pre-trained SR networks and class-specific information, limiting its generalizability and applicability. To address these issues, we introduce a new data distillation approach for image SR that does not need class labels or pre-trained SR models. In particular, we first extract high-gradient patches and categorize images based on CLIP features, then fine-tune a diffusion model on the selected patches to learn their distribution and synthesize distilled training images. Experimental results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance while using significantly less training data and requiring less computational time. Specifically, when we train a baseline Transformer model for SR with only 0.68\% of the original dataset, the performance drop is just 0.3 dB. In this case, diffusion model fine-tuning takes 4 hours, and SR model training completes within 1 hour, much shorter than the 11-hour training time with the full dataset.

  _Yuan Gao, Wei Dong_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In recent years, parametric representations of point clouds have been widely applied in tasks such as memory-efficient mapping and multi-robot collaboration. Highly adaptive models, like spline surfaces or quadrics, are computationally expensive in detection or fitting. In contrast, real-time methods, such as Gaussian mixture models or planes, have low degrees of freedom, making high accuracy with few primitives difficult. To tackle this problem, a multi-model parametric representation with real-time surface detection and fitting is proposed. Specifically, the Gaussian mixture model is first employed to segment the point cloud into multiple clusters. Then, flat clusters are selected and merged into planes or curved surfaces. Planes can be easily fitted and delimited by a 2D voxel-based boundary description method. Surfaces with curvature are fitted by B-spline surfaces and the same boundary description method is employed. Through evaluations on multiple public datasets, the proposed surface detection exhibits greater robustness than the state-of-the-art approach, with 3.78 times improvement in efficiency. Meanwhile, this representation achieves a 2-fold gain in accuracy over Gaussian mixture models, operating at 36.4 fps on a low-power onboard computer.

  Comparing vision language models on videos is particularly complex, as the performances is jointly determined by the model's visual representation capacity and the frame-sampling strategy used to construct the input. Current video benchmarks are suspected to suffer from substantial frame-sampling bias, as models are evaluated with different frame selection strategies. In this work, we propose the first frame-accurate benchmark of state-of-the-art small VLMs for video question-answering, evaluated under controlled frame-sampling strategies. Our results confirm the suspected bias and highlight both data-specific and task-specific behaviors of SVLMs under different frame-sampling techniques. By open-sourcing our benchmarking code, we provide the community with a reproducible and unbiased protocol for evaluating video VLMs and emphasize the need for standardized frame-sampling strategies tailored to each benchmarking dataset in future research.

  Finding smell references in historic artworks is a challenging problem. Beyond artwork-specific challenges such as stylistic variations, their recognition demands exceptionally detailed annotation classes, resulting in annotation sparsity and extreme class imbalance. In this work, we explore the potential of synthetic data generation to alleviate these issues and enable accurate detection of smell-related objects. We evaluate several diffusion-based augmentation strategies and demonstrate that incorporating synthetic data into model training can improve detection performance. Our findings suggest that leveraging the large-scale pretraining of diffusion models offers a promising approach for improving detection accuracy, particularly in niche applications where annotations are scarce and costly to obtain. Furthermore, the proposed approach proves to be effective even with relatively small amounts of data, and scaling it up provides high potential for further enhancements.

  _Jinlong Fan, Bingyu Hu, Xingguang Li, Yuxiang Yang, Jing Zhang_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reconstructing high-fidelity animatable human avatars from monocular videos remains challenging due to insufficient geometric information in single-view observations. While recent 3D Gaussian Splatting methods have shown promise, they struggle with surface detail preservation due to the free-form nature of 3D Gaussian primitives. To address both the representation limitations and information scarcity, we propose a novel method, \textbf{FMGS-Avatar}, that integrates two key innovations. First, we introduce Mesh-Guided 2D Gaussian Splatting, where 2D Gaussian primitives are attached directly to template mesh faces with constrained position, rotation, and movement, enabling superior surface alignment and geometric detail preservation. Second, we leverage foundation models trained on large-scale datasets, such as Sapiens, to complement the limited visual cues from monocular videos. However, when distilling multi-modal prior knowledge from foundation models, conflicting optimization objectives can emerge as different modalities exhibit distinct parameter sensitivities. We address this through a coordinated training strategy with selective gradient isolation, enabling each loss component to optimize its relevant parameters without interference. Through this combination of enhanced representation and coordinated information distillation, our approach significantly advances 3D monocular human avatar reconstruction. Experimental evaluation demonstrates superior reconstruction quality compared to existing methods, with notable gains in geometric accuracy and appearance fidelity while providing rich semantic information. Additionally, the distilled prior knowledge within a shared canonical space naturally enables spatially and temporally consistent rendering under novel views and poses.

  Automatic colorization of line drawings has been widely studied to reduce the labor cost of hand-drawn anime production. Deep learning approaches, including image/video generation and feature-based correspondence, have improved accuracy but struggle with occlusions, pose variations, and viewpoint changes. To address these challenges, we propose DACoN, a framework that leverages foundation models to capture part-level semantics, even in line drawings. Our method fuses low-resolution semantic features from foundation models with high-resolution spatial features from CNNs for fine-grained yet robust feature extraction. In contrast to previous methods that rely on the Multiplex Transformer and support only one or two reference images, DACoN removes this constraint, allowing any number of references. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate the benefits of using multiple reference images, achieving superior colorization performance. Our code and model are available atthis https URL.

  In this study, we consider the problem of generating visual explanations in visual foundation models. Numerous methods have been proposed for this purpose; however, they often cannot be applied to complex models due to their lack of adaptability. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel explanation generation method in visual foundation models that is aimed at both generating explanations and partially updating model parameters to enhance interpretability. Our approach introduces two novel mechanisms: Attention Lattice Adapter (ALA) and Alternating Epoch Architect (AEA). ALA mechanism simplifies the process by eliminating the need for manual layer selection, thus enhancing the model's adaptability and interpretability. Moreover, the AEA mechanism, which updates ALA's parameters every other epoch, effectively addresses the common issue of overly small attention regions. We evaluated our method on two benchmark datasets, CUB-200-2011 and ImageNet-S. Our results showed that our method outperformed the baseline methods in terms of mean intersection over union (IoU), insertion score, deletion score, and insertion-deletion score on both the CUB-200-2011 and ImageNet-S datasets. Notably, our best model achieved a 53.2-point improvement in mean IoU on the CUB-200-2011 dataset compared with the baselines.

  Current instruction-based image editing (IBIE) methods struggle with challenging editing tasks, as both editing types and sample counts of existing datasets are limited. Moreover, traditional dataset construction often contains noisy image-caption pairs, which may introduce biases and limit model capabilities in complex editing scenarios. To address these limitations, we introduce MultiEdit, a comprehensive dataset featuring over 107K high-quality image editing samples. It encompasses 6 challenging editing tasks through a diverse collection of 18 non-style-transfer editing types and 38 style transfer operations, covering a spectrum from sophisticated style transfer to complex semantic operations like person reference editing and in-image text editing. We employ a novel dataset construction pipeline that utilizes two multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) to generate visual-adaptive editing instructions and produce high-fidelity edited images, respectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that fine-tuning foundational open-source models with our MultiEdit-Train set substantially improves models' performance on sophisticated editing tasks in our proposed MultiEdit-Test benchmark, while effectively preserving their capabilities on the standard editing benchmark. We believe MultiEdit provides a valuable resource for advancing research into more diverse and challenging IBIE capabilities. Our dataset is available atthis https URL.

  Skeleton-based action recognition faces two longstanding challenges: the scarcity of labeled training samples and difficulty modeling short- and long-range temporal dependencies. To address these issues, we propose a unified framework, LSTC-MDA, which simultaneously improves temporal modeling and data diversity. We introduce a novel Long-Short Term Temporal Convolution (LSTC) module with parallel short- and long-term branches, these two feature branches are then aligned and fused adaptively using learned similarity weights to preserve critical long-range cues lost by conventional stride-2 temporal convolutions. We also extend Joint Mixing Data Augmentation (JMDA) with an Additive Mixup at the input level, diversifying training samples and restricting mixup operations to the same camera view to avoid distribution shifts. Ablation studies confirm each component contributes. LSTC-MDA achieves state-of-the-art results: 94.1% and 97.5% on NTU 60 (X-Sub and X-View), 90.4% and 92.0% on NTU 120 (X-Sub and X-Set),97.2% on NW-UCLA. Code:this https URL.

  _Yue Cao, Quansong He, Kaishen Wang, Jianlong Xiong, Tao He_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  U-like networks have become fundamental frameworks in medical image segmentation through skip connections that bridge high-level semantics and low-level spatial details. Despite their success, conventional skip connections exhibit two key limitations: inter-feature constraints and intra-feature constraints. The inter-feature constraint refers to the static nature of feature fusion in traditional skip connections, where information is transmitted along fixed pathways regardless of feature content. The intra-feature constraint arises from the insufficient modeling of multi-scale feature interactions, thereby hindering the effective aggregation of global contextual information. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel Dynamic Skip Connection (DSC) block that fundamentally enhances cross-layer connectivity through adaptive mechanisms. The DSC block integrates two complementary components. (1) Test-Time Training (TTT) module. This module addresses the inter-feature constraint by enabling dynamic adaptation of hidden representations during inference, facilitating content-aware feature refinement. (2) Dynamic Multi-Scale Kernel (DMSK) module. To mitigate the intra-feature constraint, this module adaptively selects kernel sizes based on global contextual cues, enhancing the network capacity for multi-scale feature integration. The DSC block is architecture-agnostic and can be seamlessly incorporated into existing U-like network structures. Extensive experiments demonstrate the plug-and-play effectiveness of the proposed DSC block across CNN-based, Transformer-based, hybrid CNN-Transformer, and Mamba-based U-like networks.

  In the domain of 3D biomedical image segmentation, Mamba exhibits the superior performance for it addresses the limitations in modeling long-range dependencies inherent to CNNs and mitigates the abundant computational overhead associated with Transformer-based frameworks when processing high-resolution medical volumes. However, attaching undue importance to global context modeling may inadvertently compromise critical local structural information, thus leading to boundary ambiguity and regional distortion in segmentation outputs. Therefore, we propose the HybridMamba, an architecture employing dual complementary mechanisms: 1) a feature scanning strategy that progressively integrates representations both axial-traversal and local-adaptive pathways to harmonize the relationship between local and global representations, and 2) a gated module combining spatial-frequency analysis for comprehensive contextual modeling. Besides, we collect a multi-center CT dataset related to lung cancer. Experiments on MRI and CT datasets demonstrate that HybridMamba significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in 3D medical image segmentation.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Dynamic point clouds are widely used in applications such as immersive reality, robotics, and autonomous driving. Efficient compression largely depends on accurate motion estimation and compensation, yet the irregular structure and significant local variations of point clouds make this task highly challenging. Current methods often rely on explicit motion estimation, whose encoded vectors struggle to capture intricate dynamics and fail to fully exploit temporal correlations. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a Feature-aligned Motion Transformation (FMT) framework for dynamic point cloud compression. FMT replaces explicit motion vectors with a spatiotemporal alignment strategy that implicitly models continuous temporal variations, using aligned features as temporal context within a latent-space conditional encoding framework. Furthermore, we design a random access (RA) reference strategy that enables bidirectional motion referencing and layered encoding, thereby supporting frame-level parallel compression. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method surpasses D-DPCC and AdaDPCC in both encoding and decoding efficiency, while also achieving BD-Rate reductions of 20% and 9.4%, respectively. These results highlight the effectiveness of FMT in jointly improving compression efficiency and processing performance.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Understanding how people read city scenes can inform design and planning. We introduce a small benchmark for testing vision-language models (VLMs) on urban perception using 100 Montreal street images, evenly split between photographs and photorealistic synthetic scenes. Twelve participants from seven community groups supplied 230 annotation forms across 30 dimensions mixing physical attributes and subjective impressions. French responses were normalized to English. We evaluated seven VLMs in a zero-shot setup with a structured prompt and deterministic parser. We use accuracy for single-choice items and Jaccard overlap for multi-label items; human agreement uses Krippendorff's alpha and pairwise Jaccard. Results suggest stronger model alignment on visible, objective properties than subjective appraisals. The top system (claude-sonnet) reaches macro 0.31 and mean Jaccard 0.48 on multi-label items. Higher human agreement coincides with better model scores. Synthetic images slightly lower scores. We release the benchmark, prompts, and harness for reproducible, uncertainty-aware evaluation in participatory urban analysis.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The development of methods to estimate the severity of Ulcerative Colitis (UC) is of significant importance. However, these methods often suffer from domain shifts caused by differences in imaging devices and clinical settings across hospitals. Although several domain adaptation methods have been proposed to address domain shift, they still struggle with the lack of supervision in the target domain or the high cost of annotation. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel Weakly Supervised Domain Adaptation method that leverages patient-level diagnostic results, which are routinely recorded in UC diagnosis, as weak supervision in the target domain. The proposed method aligns class-wise distributions across domains using Shared Aggregation Tokens and a Max-Severity Triplet Loss, which leverages the characteristic that patient-level diagnoses are determined by the most severe region within each patient. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms comparative DA approaches, improving UC severity estimation in a domain-shifted setting.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Sparse-view computed tomography (CT) reconstruction is fundamentally challenging due to undersampling, leading to an ill-posed inverse problem. Traditional iterative methods incorporate handcrafted or learned priors to regularize the solution but struggle to capture the complex structures present in medical images. In contrast, diffusion models (DMs) have recently emerged as powerful generative priors that can accurately model complex image distributions. In this work, we introduce Diffusion Consensus Equilibrium (DICE), a framework that integrates a two-agent consensus equilibrium into the sampling process of a DM. DICE alternates between: (i) a data-consistency agent, implemented through a proximal operator enforcing measurement consistency, and (ii) a prior agent, realized by a DM performing a clean image estimation at each sampling step. By balancing these two complementary agents iteratively, DICE effectively combines strong generative prior capabilities with measurement consistency. Experimental results show that DICE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in reconstructing high-quality CT images under uniform and non-uniform sparse-view settings of 15, 30, and 60 views (out of a total of 180), demonstrating both its effectiveness and robustness.

  _Li Gao, Hongyang Sun, Liu Liu, Yunhao Li, Yang Cai_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Accurate visual localization is crucial for autonomous driving, yet existing methods face a fundamental dilemma: While high-definition (HD) maps provide high-precision localization references, their costly construction and maintenance hinder scalability, which drives research toward standard-definition (SD) maps like OpenStreetMap. Current SD-map-based approaches primarily focus on Bird's-Eye View (BEV) matching between images and maps, overlooking a ubiquitous signal-noisy GPS. Although GPS is readily available, it suffers from multipath errors in urban environments. We propose DiffVL, the first framework to reformulate visual localization as a GPS denoising task using diffusion models. Our key insight is that noisy GPS trajectory, when conditioned on visual BEV features and SD maps, implicitly encode the true pose distribution, which can be recovered through iterative diffusion refinement. DiffVL, unlike prior BEV-matching methods (e.g., OrienterNet) or transformer-based registration approaches, learns to reverse GPS noise perturbations by jointly modeling GPS, SD map, and visual signals, achieving sub-meter accuracy without relying on HD maps. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy compared to BEV-matching baselines. Crucially, our work proves that diffusion models can enable scalable localization by treating noisy GPS as a generative prior-making a paradigm shift from traditional matching-based methods.

  _Zhaonan Wang, Manyi Li, ShiQing Xin, Changhe Tu_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Point cloud denoising task aims to recover the clean point cloud from the scanned data coupled with different levels or patterns of noise. The recent state-of-the-art methods often train deep neural networks to update the point locations towards the clean point cloud, and empirically repeat the denoising process several times in order to obtain the denoised results. It is not clear how to efficiently arrange the iterative denoising processes to deal with different levels or patterns of noise. In this paper, we propose an adaptive and iterative point cloud denoising method based on the score-based diffusion model. For a given noisy point cloud, we first estimate the noise variation and determine an adaptive denoising schedule with appropriate step sizes, then invoke the trained network iteratively to update point clouds following the adaptive schedule. To facilitate this adaptive and iterative denoising process, we design the network architecture and a two-stage sampling strategy for the network training to enable feature fusion and gradient fusion for iterative denoising. Compared to the state-of-the-art point cloud denoising methods, our approach obtains clean and smooth denoised point clouds, while preserving the shape boundary and details better. Our results not only outperform the other methods both qualitatively and quantitatively, but also are preferable on the synthetic dataset with different patterns of noises, as well as the real-scanned dataset.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Single-image super-resolution (SISR) remains highly ill-posed because recovering structurally faithful high-frequency content from a single low-resolution observation is ambiguous. Existing edge-aware methods often attach edge priors or attention branches onto increasingly complex backbones, yet ad hoc fusion frequently introduces redundancy, unstable optimization, or limited structural gains. We address this gap with an edge-guided attention mechanism that derives an adaptive modulation map from jointly encoded edge features and intermediate feature activations, then applies it to normalize and reweight responses, selectively amplifying structurally salient regions while suppressing spurious textures. In parallel, we integrate this mechanism into a lightweight residual design trained under a composite objective combining pixel-wise, perceptual, and adversarial terms to balance fidelity, perceptual realism, and training stability. Extensive experiments on standard SISR benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements in structural sharpness and perceptual quality over SRGAN, ESRGAN, and prior edge-attention baselines at comparable model complexity. The proposed formulation provides (i) a parameter-efficient path to inject edge priors, (ii) stabilized adversarial refinement through a tailored multiterm loss, and (iii) enhanced edge fidelity without resorting to deeper or heavily overparameterized architectures. These results highlight the effectiveness of principled edge-conditioned modulation for advancing perceptual super-resolution.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Incremental multi-view clustering aims to achieve stable clustering results while addressing the stability-plasticity dilemma (SPD) in incremental views. At the core of SPD is the challenge that the model must have enough plasticity to quickly adapt to new data, while maintaining sufficient stability to consolidate long-term knowledge and prevent catastrophic forgetting. Inspired by the hippocampal-prefrontal cortex collaborative memory mechanism in neuroscience, we propose a Memory-Evolving Incremental Multi-view Clustering method (MemEvo) to achieve this balance. First, we propose a hippocampus-inspired view alignment module that captures the gain information of new views by aligning structures in continuous representations. Second, we introduce a cognitive forgetting mechanism that simulates the decay patterns of human memory to modulate the weights of historical knowledge. Additionally, we design a prefrontal cortex-inspired knowledge consolidation memory module that leverages temporal tensor stability to gradually consolidate historical knowledge. By integrating these modules, MemEvo achieves strong knowledge retention capabilities in scenarios with a growing number of views. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MemEvo exhibits remarkable advantages over existing state-of-the-art methods.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Deep models often suffer significant performance degradation under distribution shifts. Domain generalization (DG) seeks to mitigate this challenge by enabling models to generalize to unseen domains. Most prior approaches rely on multi-domain training or computationally intensive test-time adaptation. In contrast, we propose a complementary strategy: lightweight test-time augmentation. Specifically, we develop a novel Class-Invariant Test-Time Augmentation (CI-TTA) technique. The idea is to generate multiple variants of each input image through elastic and grid deformations that nevertheless belong to the same class as the original input. Their predictions are aggregated through a confidence-guided filtering scheme that remove unreliable outputs, ensuring the final decision relies on consistent and trustworthy cues. Extensive Experiments on PACS and Office-Home datasets demonstrate consistent gains across different DG algorithms and backbones, highlighting the effectiveness and generality of our approach.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  High temporal resolution is essential for capturing fine-grained details in video understanding. However, current video large language models (VLLMs) and benchmarks mostly rely on low-frame-rate sampling, such as uniform sampling or keyframe selection, discarding dense temporal information. This compromise avoids the high cost of tokenizing every frame, which otherwise leads to redundant computation and linear token growth as video length increases. While this trade-off works for slowly changing content, it fails for tasks like lecture comprehension, where information appears in nearly every frame and requires precise temporal alignment. To address this gap, we introduce Dense Video Understanding (DVU), which enables high-FPS video comprehension by reducing both tokenization time and token overhead. Existing benchmarks are also limited, as their QA pairs focus on coarse content changes. We therefore propose DIVE (Dense Information Video Evaluation), the first benchmark designed for dense temporal reasoning. To make DVU practical, we present Gated Residual Tokenization (GRT), a two-stage framework: (1) Motion-Compensated Inter-Gated Tokenization uses pixel-level motion estimation to skip static regions during tokenization, achieving sub-linear growth in token count and compute. (2) Semantic-Scene Intra-Tokenization Merging fuses tokens across static regions within a scene, further reducing redundancy while preserving dynamic semantics. Experiments on DIVE show that GRT outperforms larger VLLM baselines and scales positively with FPS. These results highlight the importance of dense temporal information and demonstrate that GRT enables efficient, scalable high-FPS video understanding.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Zero-Shot Anomaly Detection (ZSAD) seeks to identify anomalies from arbitrary novel categories, offering a scalable and annotation-efficient solution. Traditionally, most ZSAD works have been based on the CLIP model, which performs anomaly detection by calculating the similarity between visual and text embeddings. Recently, vision foundation models such as DINOv3 have demonstrated strong transferable representation capabilities. In this work, we are the first to adapt DINOv3 for ZSAD. However, this adaptation presents two key challenges: (i) the domain bias between large-scale pretraining data and anomaly detection tasks leads to feature misalignment; and (ii) the inherent bias toward global semantics in pretrained representations often leads to subtle anomalies being misinterpreted as part of the normal foreground objects, rather than being distinguished as abnormal regions. To overcome these challenges, we introduce AD-DINOv3, a novel vision-language multimodal framework designed for ZSAD. Specifically, we formulate anomaly detection as a multimodal contrastive learning problem, where DINOv3 is employed as the visual backbone to extract patch tokens and a CLS token, and the CLIP text encoder provides embeddings for both normal and abnormal prompts. To bridge the domain gap, lightweight adapters are introduced in both modalities, enabling their representations to be recalibrated for the anomaly detection task. Beyond this baseline alignment, we further design an Anomaly-Aware Calibration Module (AACM), which explicitly guides the CLS token to attend to anomalous regions rather than generic foreground semantics, thereby enhancing discriminability. Extensive experiments on eight industrial and medical benchmarks demonstrate that AD-DINOv3 consistently matches or surpasses state-of-the-artthis http URLcode will be available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advancements in Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have established them as the state-of-the-art method for video generation. However, their inherently sequential denoising process results in inevitable latency, limiting real-world applicability. Existing acceleration methods either compromise visual quality due to architectural modifications or fail to reuse intermediate features at proper granularity. Our analysis reveals that DiT blocks are the primary contributors to inference latency. Across diffusion timesteps, the feature variations of DiT blocks exhibit a U-shaped pattern with high similarity during intermediate timesteps, which suggests substantial computational redundancy. In this paper, we propose Block-Wise Caching (BWCache), a training-free method to accelerate DiT-based video generation. BWCache dynamically caches and reuses features from DiT blocks across diffusion timesteps. Furthermore, we introduce a similarity indicator that triggers feature reuse only when the differences between block features at adjacent timesteps fall below a threshold, thereby minimizing redundant computations while maintaining visual fidelity. Extensive experiments on several video diffusion models demonstrate that BWCache achieves up to 2.24$\times$ speedup with comparable visual quality.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The powerful generative capabilities of diffusion models have significantly advanced the field of image synthesis, enhancing both full image generation and inpainting-based image editing. Despite their remarkable advancements, diffusion models also raise concerns about potential misuse for malicious purposes. However, existing approaches struggle to identify images generated by diffusion-based inpainting models, even when similar inpainted images are included in their training data. To address this challenge, we propose a novel detection method based on End-to-end denoising diffusion (End4). Specifically, End4 designs a denoising reconstruction model to improve the alignment degree between the latent spaces of the reconstruction and detection processes, thus reconstructing features that are more conducive to detection. Meanwhile, it leverages a Scale-aware Pyramid-like Fusion Module (SPFM) that refines local image features under the guidance of attention pyramid layers at different scales, enhancing feature discriminability. Additionally, to evaluate detection performance on inpainted images, we establish a comprehensive benchmark comprising images generated from five distinct masked regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our End4 effectively generalizes to unseen masking patterns and remains robust under various perturbations. Our code and dataset will be released soon.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  While specialized detectors for AI-generated images excel on curated benchmarks, they fail catastrophically in real-world scenarios, as evidenced by their critically high false-negative rates on `in-the-wild' benchmarks. Instead of crafting another specialized `knife' for this problem, we bring a `gun' to the fight: a simple linear classifier on a modern Vision Foundation Model (VFM). Trained on identical data, this baseline decisively `outguns' bespoke detectors, boosting in-the-wild accuracy by a striking margin of over 20\%.Our analysis pinpoints the source of the VFM's `firepower': First, by probing text-image similarities, we find that recent VLMs (e.g., Perception Encoder, Meta CLIP2) have learned to align synthetic images with forgery-related concepts (e.g., `AI-generated'), unlike previous versions. Second, we speculate that this is due to data exposure, as both this alignment and overall accuracy plummet on a novel dataset scraped after the VFM's pre-training cut-off date, ensuring it was unseen during pre-training. Our findings yield two critical conclusions: 1) For the real-world `gunfight' of AI-generated image detection, the raw `firepower' of an updated VFM is far more effective than the `craftsmanship' of a static detector. 2) True generalization evaluation requires test data to be independent of the model's entire training history, including pre-training.

  Point cloud registration (PCR) is crucial for many downstream tasks, such as simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) and object tracking. This makes detecting and quantifying registration misalignment, i.e., PCR quality validation, an important task. All existing methods treat validation as a classification task, aiming to assign the PCR quality to a few classes. In this work, we instead use regression for PCR validation, allowing for a more fine-grained quantification of the registration quality. We also extend previously used misalignment-related features by using multiscale extraction and attention-based aggregation. This leads to accurate and robust registration error estimation on diverse datasets, especially for point clouds with heterogeneous spatial densities. Furthermore, when used to guide a mapping downstream task, our method significantly improves the mapping quality for a given amount of re-registered frames, compared to the state-of-the-art classification-based method.

  True Digital Orthophoto Map (TDOM) serves as a crucial geospatial product in various fields such as urban management, city planning, land surveying, etc. However, traditional TDOM generation methods generally rely on a complex offline photogrammetric pipeline, resulting in delays that hinder real-time applications. Moreover, the quality of TDOM may degrade due to various challenges, such as inaccurate camera poses or Digital Surface Model (DSM) and scene occlusions. To address these challenges, this work introduces A-TDOM, a near real-time TDOM generation method based on On-the-Fly 3DGS optimization. As each image is acquired, its pose and sparse point cloud are computed via On-the-Fly SfM. Then new Gaussians are integrated and optimized into previously unseen or coarsely reconstructed regions. By integrating with orthogonal splatting, A-TDOM can render just after each update of a new 3DGS field. Initial experiments on multiple benchmarks show that the proposed A-TDOM is capable of actively rendering TDOM in near real-time, with 3DGS optimization for each new image in seconds while maintaining acceptable rendering quality and TDOM geometric accuracy.

  Humans can recognize the same actions despite large context and viewpoint variations, such as differences between species (walking in spiders vs. horses), viewpoints (egocentric vs. third-person), and contexts (real life vs movies). Current deep learning models struggle with such generalization. We propose using features generated by a Vision Diffusion Model (VDM), aggregated via a transformer, to achieve human-like action recognition across these challenging conditions. We find that generalization is enhanced by the use of a model conditioned on earlier timesteps of the diffusion process to highlight semantic information over pixel level details in the extracted features. We experimentally explore the generalization properties of our approach in classifying actions across animal species, across different viewing angles, and different recording contexts. Our model sets a new state-of-the-art across all three generalization benchmarks, bringing machine action recognition closer to human-like robustness.

  Isolated Sign Language Recognition (ISLR) is challenged by gestures that are morphologically similar yet semantically distinct, a problem rooted in the complex interplay between hand shape and motion trajectory. Existing methods, often relying on a single reference frame, struggle to resolve this geometric ambiguity. This paper introduces Dual-SignLanguageNet (DSLNet), a dual-reference, dual-stream architecture that decouples and models gesture morphology and trajectory in separate, complementary coordinate systems. The architecture processes these streams through specialized networks: a topology-aware graph convolution models the view-invariant shape from a wrist-centric frame, while a Finsler geometry-based encoder captures the context-aware trajectory from a facial-centric frame. These features are then integrated via a geometry-driven optimal transport fusion mechanism. DSLNet sets a new state-of-the-art, achieving 93.70%, 89.97%, and 99.79% accuracy on the challenging WLASL-100, WLASL-300, and LSA64 datasets, respectively, with significantly fewer parameters than competing models.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Unified multimodal models (UMMs) unify visual understanding and generation within a single architecture. However, conventional training relies on image-text pairs (or sequences) whose captions are typically sparse and miss fine-grained visual details--even when they use hundreds of words to describe a simple image. We introduce Reconstruction Alignment (RecA), a resource-efficient post-training method that leverages visual understanding encoder embeddings as dense "text prompts," providing rich supervision without captions. Concretely, RecA conditions a UMM on its own visual understanding embeddings and optimizes it to reconstruct the input image with a self-supervised reconstruction loss, thereby realigning understanding and generation. Despite its simplicity, RecA is broadly applicable: across autoregressive, masked-autoregressive, and diffusion-based UMMs, it consistently improves generation and editing fidelity. With only 27 GPU-hours, post-training with RecA substantially improves image generation performance on GenEval (0.73$\rightarrow$0.90) and DPGBench (80.93$\rightarrow$88.15), while also boosting editing benchmarks (ImgEdit 3.38$\rightarrow$3.75, GEdit 6.94$\rightarrow$7.25). Notably, RecA surpasses much larger open-source models and applies broadly across diverse UMM architectures, establishing it as an efficient and general post-training alignment strategy for UMMs

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We propose a novel regularization loss that enforces standard Gaussianity, encouraging samples to align with a standard Gaussian distribution. This facilitates a range of downstream tasks involving optimization in the latent space of text-to-image models. We treat elements of a high-dimensional sample as one-dimensional standard Gaussian variables and define a composite loss that combines moment-based regularization in the spatial domain with power spectrum-based regularization in the spectral domain. Since the expected values of moments and power spectrum distributions are analytically known, the loss promotes conformity to these properties. To ensure permutation invariance, the losses are applied to randomly permuted inputs. Notably, existing Gaussianity-based regularizations fall within our unified framework: some correspond to moment losses of specific orders, while the previous covariance-matching loss is equivalent to our spectral loss but incurs higher time complexity due to its spatial-domain computation. We showcase the application of our regularization in generative modeling for test-time reward alignment with a text-to-image model, specifically to enhance aesthetics and text alignment. Our regularization outperforms previous Gaussianity regularization, effectively prevents reward hacking and accelerates convergence.

  Subject-driven image generation (SDIG) aims to manipulate specific subjects within images while adhering to textual instructions, a task crucial for advancing text-to-image diffusion models. SDIG requires reconciling the tension between maintaining subject identity and complying with dynamic edit instructions, a challenge inadequately addressed by existing methods. In this paper, we introduce the Target-Instructed Diffusion Enhancing (TIDE) framework, which resolves this tension through target supervision and preference learning without test-time fine-tuning. TIDE pioneers target-supervised triplet alignment, modelling subject adaptation dynamics using a (reference image, instruction, target images) triplet. This approach leverages the Direct Subject Diffusion (DSD) objective, training the model with paired "winning" (balanced preservation-compliance) and "losing" (distorted) targets, systematically generated and evaluated via quantitative metrics. This enables implicit reward modelling for optimal preservation-compliance balance. Experimental results on standard benchmarks demonstrate TIDE's superior performance in generating subject-faithful outputs while maintaining instruction compliance, outperforming baseline methods across multiple quantitative metrics. TIDE's versatility is further evidenced by its successful application to diverse tasks, including structural-conditioned generation, image-to-image generation, and text-image interpolation.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Automated visual inspection in medical device manufacturing faces unique challenges, including small and imbalanced datasets, high-resolution imagery, and strict regulatory requirements. To address these, we propose two attention-guided autoencoder architectures for deep anomaly detection. The first employs a structural similarity-based scoring approach that enables lightweight, real-time defect detection with unsupervised thresholding and can be further enhanced through limited supervised tuning. The second applies a feature distance-based strategy using Mahalanobis scoring on reduced latent features, designed to monitor distributional shifts and support supervisory oversight. Evaluations on a representative sterile packaging dataset confirm that both approaches outperform baselines under hardware-constrained, regulated conditions. Cross-domain testing on the MVTec-Zipper benchmark further demonstrates that the structural similarity-based method generalises effectively and achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods, while the feature distance-based method is less transferable but provides complementary monitoring capabilities. These results highlight a dual-pathway inspection strategy: structural similarity for robust inline detection and feature distance for supervisory monitoring. By combining operational performance with interpretability and lifecycle monitoring, the proposed methods also align with emerging regulatory expectations for high-risk AI systems.

  Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a popular tool for interpreting the hidden states of large language models (LLMs). By learning to reconstruct activations from a sparse bottleneck layer, SAEs discover interpretable features from the high-dimensional internal representations of LLMs. Despite their popularity with language models, SAEs remain understudied in the visual domain. In this work, we provide an extensive evaluation the representational power of SAEs for vision models using a broad range of image-based tasks. Our experimental results demonstrate that SAE features are semantically meaningful, improve out-of-distribution generalization, and enable controllable generation across three vision model architectures: vision embedding models, multi-modal LMMs and diffusion models. In vision embedding models, we find that learned SAE features can be used for OOD detection and provide evidence that they recover the ontological structure of the underlying model. For diffusion models, we demonstrate that SAEs enable semantic steering through text encoder manipulation and develop an automated pipeline for discovering human-interpretable attributes. Finally, we conduct exploratory experiments on multi-modal LLMs, finding evidence that SAE features reveal shared representations across vision and language modalities. Our study provides a foundation for SAE evaluation in vision models, highlighting their strong potential improving interpretability, generalization, and steerability in the visual domain.

  We propose a novel 3D gaze redirection framework that leverages an explicit 3D eyeball structure. Existing gaze redirection methods are typically based on neural radiance fields, which employ implicit neural representations via volume rendering. Unlike these NeRF-based approaches, where the rotation and translation of 3D representations are not explicitly modeled, we introduce a dedicated 3D eyeball structure to represent the eyeballs with 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). Our method generates photorealistic images that faithfully reproduce the desired gaze direction by explicitly rotating and translating the 3D eyeball structure. In addition, we propose an adaptive deformation module that enables the replication of subtle muscle movements around the eyes. Through experiments conducted on the ETH-XGaze dataset, we demonstrate that our framework is capable of generating diverse novel gaze images, achieving superior image quality and gaze estimation accuracy compared to previous state-of-the-art methods.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Ensuring reliable model performance across diverse domains is a critical challenge in computational pathology. A particular source of variability in Whole-Slide Images is introduced by differences in digital scanners, thus calling for better scanner generalization. This is critical for the real-world adoption of computational pathology, where the scanning devices may differ per institution or hospital, and the model should not be dependent on scanner-induced details, which can ultimately affect the patient's diagnosis and treatment planning. However, past efforts have primarily focused on standard domain generalization settings, evaluating on unseen scanners during training, without directly evaluating consistency across scanners for the same tissue. To overcome this limitation, we introduce SCORPION, a new dataset explicitly designed to evaluate model reliability under scanner variability. SCORPION includes 480 tissue samples, each scanned with 5 scanners, yielding 2,400 spatially aligned patches. This scanner-paired design allows for the isolation of scanner-induced variability, enabling a rigorous evaluation of model consistency while controlling for differences in tissue composition. Furthermore, we propose SimCons, a flexible framework that combines augmentation-based domain generalization techniques with a consistency loss to explicitly address scanner generalization. We empirically show that SimCons improves model consistency on varying scanners without compromising task-specific performance. By releasing the SCORPION dataset and proposing SimCons, we provide the research community with a crucial resource for evaluating and improving model consistency across diverse scanners, setting a new standard for reliability testing.

  Vision-language-action (VLA) reasoning tasks require agents to interpret multimodal instructions, perform long-horizon planning, and act adaptively in dynamic environments. Existing approaches typically train VLA models in an end-to-end fashion, directly mapping inputs to actions without explicit reasoning, which hinders their ability to plan over multiple steps or adapt to complex task variations. In this paper, we propose ThinkAct, a dual-system framework that bridges high-level reasoning with low-level action execution via reinforced visual latent planning. ThinkAct trains a multimodal LLM to generate embodied reasoning plans guided by reinforcing action-aligned visual rewards based on goal completion and trajectory consistency. These reasoning plans are compressed into a visual plan latent that conditions a downstream action model for robust action execution on target environments. Extensive experiments on embodied reasoning and robot manipulation benchmarks demonstrate that ThinkAct enables few-shot adaptation, long-horizon planning, and self-correction behaviors in complex embodied AI tasks.

  Transformer-based models exhibit strong global modeling capabilities in single-image dehazing, but their high computational cost limits real-time applicability. Existing methods predominantly rely on spatial-domain features to capture long-range dependencies, which are computationally expensive and often inadequate under complex haze conditions. While some approaches introduce frequency-domain cues, the weak coupling between spatial and frequency branches limits the overall performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose the Dark Channel Guided Frequency-aware Dehazing Network (DGFDNet), a novel dual-domain framework that performs physically guided degradation alignment across spatial and frequency domains. At its core, the DGFDBlock comprises two key modules: 1) the Haze-Aware Frequency Modulator (HAFM), which generates a pixel-level haze confidence map from dark channel priors to adaptively enhance haze-relevant frequency components, thereby achieving global degradation-aware spectral modulation; 2) the Multi-level Gating Aggregation Module (MGAM), which fuses multi-scale features through diverse convolutional kernels and hybrid gating mechanisms to recover fine structural details. Additionally, a Prior Correction Guidance Branch (PCGB) incorporates a closed-loop feedback mechanism, enabling iterative refinement of the prior by intermediate dehazed features and significantly improving haze localization accuracy, especially in challenging outdoor scenes. Extensive experiments on four benchmark haze datasets demonstrate that DGFDNet achieves state-of-the-art performance with superior robustness and real-time efficiency.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Earlier Sign Language Production (SLP) models typically relied on autoregressive methods that generate output tokens one by one, which inherently provide temporal alignment. Although techniques like Teacher Forcing can prevent model collapse during training, they still cannot solve the problem of error accumulation during inference, since ground truth is unavailable at that stage. In contrast, more recent approaches based on diffusion models leverage step-by-step denoising to enable high-quality generation. However, the iterative nature of these models and the requirement to denoise entire sequences limit their applicability in real-time tasks like SLP. To address it, we explore a hybrid approach that combines autoregressive and diffusion models for SLP, leveraging the strengths of both models in sequential dependency modeling and output refinement. To capture fine-grained body movements, we design a Multi-Scale Pose Representation module that separately extracts detailed features from distinct articulators and integrates them via a Multi-Scale Fusion module. Furthermore, we introduce a Confidence-Aware Causal Attention mechanism that utilizes joint-level confidence scores to dynamically guide the pose generation process, improving accuracy and robustness. Extensive experiments on the PHOENIX14T and How2Sign datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in both generation quality and real-time efficiency.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) provide interpretable decision-making through explicit, human-understandable concepts. However, existing generative CBMs often rely on auxiliary visual cues at the bottleneck, which undermines interpretability and intervention capabilities. We propose EnCoBo, a post-hoc concept bottleneck for generative models that eliminates auxiliary cues by constraining all representations to flow solely through explicit concepts. Unlike autoencoder-based approaches that inherently rely on black-box decoders, EnCoBo leverages a decoder-free, energy-based framework that directly guides generation in the latent space. Guided by diffusion-scheduled energy functions, EnCoBo supports robust post-hoc interventions-such as concept composition and negation-across arbitrary concepts. Experiments on CelebA-HQ and CUB datasets showed that EnCoBo improved concept-level human intervention and interpretability while maintaining competitive visual quality.

  One of the key impediments for developing and assessing robust medical imaging algorithms is limited access to large-scale datasets with suitable annotations. Synthetic data generated with plausible physical and biological constraints may address some of these data limitations. We propose the use of physics simulations to generate synthetic images with pixel-level segmentation annotations, which are notoriously difficult to obtain. Specifically, we apply this approach to breast imaging analysis and release T-SYNTH, a large-scale open-source dataset of paired 2D digital mammography (DM) and 3D digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) images. Our initial experimental results indicate that T-SYNTH images show promise for augmenting limited real patient datasets for detection tasks in DM and DBT.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Driving scenes are inherently heterogeneous and dynamic. Multi-attribute scene identification, as a high-level visual perception capability, provides autonomous vehicles (AVs) with essential contextual awareness to understand, reason through, and interact with complex driving environments. Although scene identification is best modeled as a multi-label classification problem via multitask learning, it faces two major challenges: the difficulty of acquiring balanced, comprehensively annotated datasets and the need to re-annotate all training data when new attributes emerge. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a novel deep learning method that integrates Knowledge Acquisition and Accumulation (KAA) with Consistency-based Active Learning (CAL). KAA leverages monotask learning on heterogeneous single-label datasets to build a knowledge foundation, while CAL bridges the gap between single- and multi-label data, adapting the foundation model for multi-label scene classification. An ablation study on the newly developed Driving Scene Identification (DSI) dataset demonstrates a 56.1% improvement over an ImageNet-pretrained baseline. Moreover, KAA-CAL outperforms state-of-the-art multi-label classification methods on the BDD100K and HSD datasets, achieving this with 85% less data and even recognizing attributes unseen during foundation model training. The DSI dataset and KAA-CAL implementation code are publicly available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Hyperspectral image (HSI) clustering assigns similar pixels to the same class without any annotations, which is an important yet challenging task. For large-scale HSIs, most methods rely on superpixel segmentation and perform superpixel-level clustering based on graph neural networks (GNNs). However, existing GNNs cannot fully exploit the spectral information of the input HSI, and the inaccurate superpixel topological graph may lead to the confusion of different class semantics during information aggregation. To address these challenges, we first propose a structural-spectral graph convolutional operator (SSGCO) tailored for graph-structured HSI superpixels to improve their representation quality through the co-extraction of spatial and spectral features. Second, we propose an evidence-guided adaptive edge learning (EGAEL) module that adaptively predicts and refines edge weights in the superpixel topological graph. We integrate the proposed method into a contrastive learning framework to achieve clustering, where representation learning and clustering are simultaneously conducted. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method improves clustering accuracy by 2.61%, 6.06%, 4.96% and 3.15% over the best compared methods on four HSI datasets.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The desire for cameras with smaller form factors has recently lead to a push for exploring computational imaging systems with reduced optical complexity such as a smaller number of lens elements. Unfortunately such simplified optical systems usually suffer from severe aberrations, especially in off-axis regions, which can be difficult to correct purely in software. In this paper we introduce Fovea Stacking , a new type of imaging system that utilizes emerging dynamic optical components called deformable phase plates (DPPs) for localized aberration correction anywhere on the image sensor. By optimizing DPP deformations through a differentiable optical model, off-axis aberrations are corrected locally, producing a foveated image with enhanced sharpness at the fixation point - analogous to the eye's fovea. Stacking multiple such foveated images, each with a different fixation point, yields a composite image free from aberrations. To efficiently cover the entire field of view, we propose joint optimization of DPP deformations under imaging budget constraints. Due to the DPP device's non-linear behavior, we introduce a neural network-based control model for improved alignment between simulation-hardware performance. We further demonstrated that for extended depth-of-field imaging, fovea stacking outperforms traditional focus stacking in image quality. By integrating object detection or eye-tracking, the system can dynamically adjust the lens to track the object of interest-enabling real-time foveated video suitable for downstream applications such as surveillance or foveated virtual reality displays

  Lip synchronization is the task of aligning a speaker's lip movements in video with corresponding speech audio, and it is essential for creating realistic, expressive video content. However, existing methods often rely on reference frames and masked-frame inpainting, which limit their robustness to identity consistency, pose variations, facial occlusions, and stylized content. In addition, since audio signals provide weaker conditioning than visual cues, lip shape leakage from the original video will affect lip sync quality. In this paper, we present OmniSync, a universal lip synchronization framework for diverse visual scenarios. Our approach introduces a mask-free training paradigm using Diffusion Transformer models for direct frame editing without explicit masks, enabling unlimited-duration inference while maintaining natural facial dynamics and preserving character identity. During inference, we propose a flow-matching-based progressive noise initialization to ensure pose and identity consistency, while allowing precise mouth-region editing. To address the weak conditioning signal of audio, we develop a Dynamic Spatiotemporal Classifier-Free Guidance (DS-CFG) mechanism that adaptively adjusts guidance strength over time and space. We also establish the AIGC-LipSync Benchmark, the first evaluation suite for lip synchronization in diverse AI-generated videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OmniSync significantly outperforms prior methods in both visual quality and lip sync accuracy, achieving superior results in both real-world and AI-generated videos.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Semantic segmentation models trained on synthetic data often perform poorly on real-world images due to domain gaps, particularly in adverse conditions where labeled data is scarce. Yet, recent foundation models enable to generate realistic images without any training. This paper proposes to leverage such diffusion models to improve the performance of vision models when learned on synthetic data. We introduce two novel techniques for semantically consistent style transfer using diffusion models: Class-wise Adaptive Instance Normalization and Cross-Attention (CACTI) and its extension with selective attention Filtering (CACTIF). CACTI applies statistical normalization selectively based on semantic classes, while CACTIF further filters cross-attention maps based on feature similarity, preventing artifacts in regions with weak cross-attention correspondences. Our methods transfer style characteristics while preserving semantic boundaries and structural coherence, unlike approaches that apply global transformations or generate content without constraints. Experiments using GTA5 as source and Cityscapes/ACDC as target domains show that our approach produces higher quality images with lower FID scores and better content preservation. Our work demonstrates that class-aware diffusion-based style transfer effectively bridges the synthetic-to-real domain gap even with minimal target domain data, advancing robust perception systems for challenging real-world applications.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  To what extent does concept erasure eliminate generative capacity in diffusion models? While prior evaluations have primarily focused on measuring concept suppression under specific textual prompts, we explore a complementary and fundamental question: do current concept erasure techniques genuinely remove the ability to generate targeted concepts, or do they merely achieve superficial, prompt-specific suppression? We systematically evaluate the robustness and reversibility of two representative concept erasure methods, Unified Concept Editing and Erased Stable Diffusion, by probing their ability to eliminate targeted generative behaviors in text-to-image models. These methods attempt to suppress undesired semantic concepts by modifying internal model parameters, either through targeted attention edits or model-level fine-tuning strategies. To rigorously assess whether these techniques truly erase generative capacity, we propose an instance-level evaluation strategy that employs lightweight fine-tuning to explicitly test the reactivation potential of erased concepts. Through quantitative metrics and qualitative analyses, we show that erased concepts often reemerge with substantial visual fidelity after minimal adaptation, indicating that current methods suppress latent generative representations without fully eliminating them. Our findings reveal critical limitations in existing concept erasure approaches and highlight the need for deeper, representation-level interventions and more rigorous evaluation standards to ensure genuine, irreversible removal of concepts from generative models.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper introduces ReservoirTTA, a novel plug-in framework designed for prolonged test-time adaptation (TTA) in scenarios where the test domain continuously shifts over time, including cases where domains recur or evolve gradually. At its core, ReservoirTTA maintains a reservoir of domain-specialized models -- an adaptive test-time model ensemble -- that both detects new domains via online clustering over style features of incoming samples and routes each sample to the appropriate specialized model, and thereby enables domain-specific adaptation. This multi-model strategy overcomes key limitations of single model adaptation, such as catastrophic forgetting, inter-domain interference, and error accumulation, ensuring robust and stable performance on sustained non-stationary test distributions. Our theoretical analysis reveals key components that bound parameter variance and prevent model collapse, while our plug-in TTA module mitigates catastrophic forgetting of previously encountered domains. Extensive experiments on scene-level corruption benchmarks (ImageNet-C, CIFAR-10/100-C), object-level style shifts (DomainNet-126, PACS), and semantic segmentation (Cityscapes->ACDC) covering recurring and continuously evolving domain shifts -- show that ReservoirTTA substantially improves adaptation accuracy and maintains stable performance across prolonged, recurring shifts, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

  The challenge of tracing the source attribution of forged faces has gained significant attention due to the rapid advancement of generative models. However, existing deepfake attribution (DFA) works primarily focus on the interaction among various domains in vision modality, and other modalities such as texts and face parsing are not fully explored. Besides, they tend to fail to assess the generalization performance of deepfake attributors to unseen advanced generators like diffusion in a fine-grained manner. In this paper, we propose a novel parsing-aware vision language model with dynamic contrastive learning(PVLM) method for zero-shot deepfake attribution (ZS-DFA),which facilitates effective and fine-grained traceability to unseen advanced generators. Specifically, we conduct a novel and fine-grained ZS-DFA benchmark to evaluate the attribution performance of deepfake attributors to unseen advanced generators like diffusion. Besides, we propose an innovative parsing-guided vision language model with dynamic contrastive learning (PVLM) method to capture general and diverse attribution features. We are motivated by the observation that the preservation of source face attributes in facial images generated by GAN and diffusion models varies significantly. We employ the inherent face attributes preservation differences to capture face parsing-aware forgery representations. Therefore, we devise a novel parsing encoder to focus on global face attribute embeddings, enabling parsing-guided DFA representation learning via dynamic vision-parsing matching. Additionally, we present a novel deepfake attribution contrastive center loss to pull relevant generators closer and push irrelevant ones away, which can be introduced into DFA models to enhance traceability. Experimental results show that our model exceeds the state-of-the-art on the ZS-DFA benchmark via various protocol evaluations.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Existing methods for egocentric action recognition often rely solely on RGB videos, while additional modalities, e.g., audio, can improve accuracy in challenging scenarios. However, most prior multimodal approaches assume all modalities are available at inference, leading to significant accuracy drops, or even failure, when inputs are missing. To address this, we introduce KARMMA, a multimodal Knowledge distillation approach for egocentric Action Recognition robust to Missing ModAlities that requires no modality alignment across all samples during training or inference. KARMMA distills knowledge from a multimodal teacher into a multimodal student that benefits from all available modalities while remaining robust to missing ones, making it suitable for diverse multimodal scenarios without retraining. Our student uses approximately 50% fewer computational resources than our teacher, resulting in a lightweight and fast model. Experiments on Epic-Kitchens and Something-Something show that our student achieves competitive accuracy while significantly reducing accuracy drops under missing modality conditions.

  Accurate staging of Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is essential for guiding timely interventions and preventing vision loss. However, current staging models are hardly interpretable, and most public datasets contain no clinical reasoning or interpretation beyond image-level labels. In this paper, we present a novel method that integrates graph representation learning with vision-language models (VLMs) to deliver explainable DR diagnosis. Our approach leverages optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) images by constructing biologically informed graphs that encode key retinal vascular features such as vessel morphology and spatial connectivity. A graph neural network (GNN) then performs DR staging while integrated gradients highlight critical nodes and edges and their individual features that drive the classification decisions. We collect this graph-based knowledge which attributes the model's prediction to physiological structures and their characteristics. We then transform it into textual descriptions for VLMs. We perform instruction-tuning with these textual descriptions and the corresponding image to train a student VLM. This final agent can classify the disease and explain its decision in a human interpretable way solely based on a single image input. Experimental evaluations on both proprietary and public datasets demonstrate that our method not only improves classification accuracy but also offers more clinically interpretable results. An expert study further demonstrates that our method provides more accurate diagnostic explanations and paves the way for precise localization of pathologies in OCTA images.

  Badminton, known for having the fastest ball speeds among all sports, presents significant challenges to the field of computer vision, including player identification, court line detection, shuttlecock trajectory tracking, and player stroke-type classification. In this paper, we introduce a novel video clipping strategy to extract frames of each player's racket swing in a badminton broadcast match. These clipped frames are then processed by three existing models: one for Human Pose Estimation to obtain human skeletal joints, another for shuttlecock trajectory tracking, and the other for court line detection to determine player positions on the court. Leveraging these data as inputs, we propose Badminton Stroke-type Transformer (BST) to classify player stroke-types in singles. To the best of our knowledge, experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms the previous state-of-the-art on the largest publicly available badminton video dataset (ShuttleSet), another badminton dataset (BadmintonDB), and a tennis dataset (TenniSet). These results suggest that effectively leveraging ball trajectory is a promising direction for action recognition in racket sports.

  Image aesthetic assessment (IAA) evaluates image aesthetics, a task complicated by image diversity and user subjectivity. Current approaches address this in two stages: Generic IAA (GIAA) models estimate mean aesthetic scores, while Personal IAA (PIAA) models adapt GIAA using transfer learning to incorporate user subjectivity. However, a theoretical understanding of transfer learning between GIAA and PIAA, particularly concerning the impact of group composition, group size, aesthetic differences between groups and individuals, and demographic correlations, is lacking. This work establishes a theoretical foundation for IAA, proposing a unified model that encodes individual characteristics in a distributional format for both individual and group assessments. We show that transferring from GIAA to PIAA involves extrapolation, while the reverse involves interpolation, which is generally more effective for machine learning. Extensive experiments with varying group compositions, including sub-sampling by group size and disjoint demographics, reveal substantial performance variation even for GIAA, challenging the assumption that averaging scores eliminates individual subjectivity. Score-distribution analysis using Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) and the Gini index identifies education, photography experience, and art experience as key factors in aesthetic differences, with greater subjectivity in artworks than in photographs.

  Human drivers adeptly navigate complex scenarios by utilizing rich attentional semantics, but the current autonomous systems struggle to replicate this ability, as they often lose critical semantic information when converting 2D observations into 3D space. In this sense, it hinders their effective deployment in dynamic and complex environments. Leveraging the superior scene understanding and reasoning abilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), we propose VLM-E2E, a novel framework that uses the VLMs to enhance training by providing attentional cues. Our method integrates textual representations into Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) features for semantic supervision, which enables the model to learn richer feature representations that explicitly capture the driver's attentional semantics. By focusing on attentional semantics, VLM-E2E better aligns with human-like driving behavior, which is critical for navigating dynamic and complex environments. Furthermore, we introduce a BEV-Text learnable weighted fusion strategy to address the issue of modality importance imbalance in fusing multimodal information. This approach dynamically balances the contributions of BEV and text features, ensuring that the complementary information from visual and textual modalities is effectively utilized. By explicitly addressing the imbalance in multimodal fusion, our method facilitates a more holistic and robust representation of driving environments. We evaluate VLM-E2E on the nuScenes dataset and achieve significant improvements in perception, prediction, and planning over the baseline end-to-end model, showcasing the effectiveness of our attention-enhanced BEV representation in enabling more accurate and reliable autonomous driving tasks.

  Chart generation aims to generate code to produce charts satisfying the desired visual properties, e.g., texts, layout, color, and type. It has great potential to empower the automatic professional report generation in financial analysis, research presentation, education, and healthcare. In this work, we build a vision-language model (VLM) based multi-agent framework for effective automatic chart generation. Generating high-quality charts requires both strong visual design skills and precise coding capabilities that embed the desired visual properties into code. Such a complex multi-modal reasoning process is difficult for direct prompting of VLMs. To resolve these challenges, we propose METAL, a multi-agent framework that decomposes the task of chart generation into the iterative collaboration among specialized agents. METAL achieves 5.2% improvement over the current best result in the chart generation task. The METAL framework exhibits the phenomenon of test-time scaling: its performance increases monotonically as the logarithmic computational budget grows from 512 to 8192 tokens. In addition, we find that separating different modalities during the critique process of METAL boosts the self-correction capability of VLMs in the multimodal context.

  Radio map reconstruction is essential for enabling advanced applications, yet challenges such as complex signal propagation and sparse observational data hinder accurate reconstruction in practical scenarios. Existing methods often fail to align physical constraints with data-driven features, particularly under sparse measurement conditions. To address these issues, we propose **Phy**sics-Aligned **R**adio **M**ap **D**iffusion **M**odel (**PhyRMDM**), a novel framework that establishes cross-domain representation alignment between physical principles and neural network features through dual learning pathways. The proposed model integrates **Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)** with a **representation alignment mechanism** that explicitly enforces consistency between Helmholtz equation constraints and environmental propagation patterns. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods, achieving **NMSE of 0.0031** under *Static Radio Map (SRM)* conditions, and **NMSE of 0.0047** with **Dynamic Radio Map (DRM)** scenarios. The proposed representation alignment paradigm provides **37.2%** accuracy enhancement in ultra-sparse cases (**1%** sampling rate), confirming its effectiveness in bridging physics-based modeling and deep learning for radio map reconstruction.

  Domain shifts are critical issues that harm the performance of machine learning. Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) mitigates this issue but suffers when the domain shifts are steep and drastic. Gradual Domain Adaptation (GDA) alleviates this problem in a mild way by gradually adapting from the source to the target domain using multiple intermediate domains. In this paper, we propose Sliding Window Adversarial Training (SWAT) for GDA. SWAT first formulates adversarial streams to connect the feature spaces of the source and target domains. Then, a sliding window paradigm is designed that moves along the adversarial stream to gradually narrow the small gap between adjacent intermediate domains. When the window moves to the end of the stream, i.e., the target domain, the domain shift is explicitly reduced. Extensive experiments on six GDA benchmarks demonstrate the significant effectiveness of SWAT, especially 6.1% improvement on Rotated MNIST and 4.1% advantage on CIFAR-100C over the previous methods.

  In image generation, Multiple Latent Variable Generative Models (MLVGMs) employ multiple latent variables to gradually shape the final images, from global characteristics to finer and local details (e.g., StyleGAN, NVAE), emerging as powerful tools for diverse applications. Yet their generative dynamics remain only empirically observed, without a systematic understanding of each latent variable's impact.In this work, we propose a novel framework that quantifies the contribution of each latent variable using Mutual Information (MI) as a metric. Our analysis reveals that current MLVGMs often underutilize some latent variables, and provides actionable insights for their use in downstream applications. With this foundation, we introduce a method for generating synthetic data for Self-Supervised Contrastive Representation Learning (SSCRL). By leveraging the hierarchical and disentangled variables of MLVGMs, our approach produces diverse and semantically meaningful views without the need for real image data.Additionally, we introduce a Continuous Sampling (CS) strategy, where the generator dynamically creates new samples during SSCRL training, greatly increasing data variability. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of these contributions, showing that MLVGMs' generated views compete on par with or even surpass views generated from real data.This work establishes a principled approach to understanding and exploiting MLVGMs, advancing both generative modeling and self-supervised learning.

  Existing infrared and visible (IR-VIS) methods inherit the general representations of Pre-trained Visual Models (PVMs) to facilitate complementary learning. However, our analysis indicates that under the full fine-tuning paradigm, the feature space becomes highly constrained and low-ranked, which has been proven to seriously impair generalization. One solution is freezing parameters to preserve pre-trained knowledge and thus maintain diversity of the feature space. To this end, we propose IV-tuning, to parameter-efficiently harness PVMs for various IR-VIS downstream tasks, including salient object detection, semantic segmentation, and object detection. Compared with the full fine-tuning baselines and existing IR-VIS methods, IV-tuning facilitates the learning of complementary information between infrared and visible modalities with less than 3% of the backbone parameters, and effectively alleviates the overfitting problem.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this paper, we present DM-Calib, a diffusion-based approach for estimating pinhole camera intrinsic parameters from a single input image. Monocular camera calibration is essential for many 3D vision tasks. However, most existing methods depend on handcrafted assumptions or are constrained by limited training data, resulting in poor generalization across diverse real-world images. Recent advancements in stable diffusion models, trained on massive data, have shown the ability to generate high-quality images with varied characteristics. Emerging evidence indicates that these models implicitly capture the relationship between camera focal length and image content. Building on this insight, we explore how to leverage the powerful priors of diffusion models for monocular pinhole camera calibration. Specifically, we introduce a new image-based representation, termed Camera Image, which losslessly encodes the numerical camera intrinsics and integrates seamlessly with the diffusion framework. Using this representation, we reformulate the problem of estimating camera intrinsics as the generation of a dense Camera Image conditioned on an input image. By fine-tuning a stable diffusion model to generate a Camera Image from a single RGB input, we can extract camera intrinsics via a RANSAC operation. We further demonstrate that our monocular calibration method enhances performance across various 3D tasks, including zero-shot metric depth estimation, 3D metrology, pose estimation and sparse-view reconstruction. Extensive experiments on multiple public datasets show that our approach significantly outperforms baselines and provides broad benefits to 3D vision tasks.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) lead to significant breakthroughs in both academia and industry. One question that arises is how we, as humans, can understand their internal neural representations. This paper takes an initial step towards addressing this question by presenting a versatile framework to identify and interpret the semantics within LMMs. Specifically, 1) we first apply a Sparse Autoencoder(SAE) to disentangle the representations into human understandable features. 2) We then present an automatic interpretation framework to interpreted the open-semantic features learned in SAE by the LMMs themselves. We employ this framework to analyze the LLaVA-NeXT-8B model using the LLaVA-OV-72B model, demonstrating that these features can effectively steer the model's behavior. Our results contribute to a deeper understanding of why LMMs excel in specific tasks, including EQ tests, and illuminate the nature of their mistakes along with potential strategies for their rectification. These findings offer new insights into the internal mechanisms of LMMs and suggest parallels with the cognitive processes of the human brain.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Human motion generation has been widely studied due to its crucial role in areas such as digital humans and humanoid robot control. However, many current motion generation approaches disregard physics constraints, frequently resulting in physically implausible motions with pronounced artifacts such as floating and foot sliding. Meanwhile, training an effective motion physics optimizer with noisy motion data remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we propose \textbf{Morph}, a \textbf{Mo}tion-F\textbf{r}ee \textbf{ph}ysics optimization framework, consisting of a Motion Generator and a Motion Physics Refinement module, for enhancing physical plausibility without relying on expensive real-world motion data. Specifically, the motion generator is responsible for providing large-scale synthetic, noisy motion data, while the motion physics refinement module utilizes these synthetic data to learn a motion imitator within a physics simulator, enforcing physical constraints to project the noisy motions into a physically-plausible space. Additionally, we introduce a prior reward module to enhance the stability of the physics optimization process and generate smoother and more stable motions. These physically refined motions are then used to fine-tune the motion generator, further enhancing its capability. This collaborative training paradigm enables mutual enhancement between the motion generator and the motion physics refinement module, significantly improving practicality and robustness in real-world applications. Experiments on both text-to-motion and music-to-dance generation tasks demonstrate that our framework achieves state-of-the-art motion quality while improving physical plausibility drastically.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Multi-Modal Models (LMMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities as general-purpose chatbots able to engage in conversations about visual inputs. However, their responses are influenced by societal biases present in their training datasets, leading to undesirable differences in how the model responds when presented with images depicting people of different demographics. In this work, we propose a training-free debiasing framework for LMMs that intervenes on the model's representations during text generation by constructing a steering vector that reduces reference on protected attributes. Our framework introduces two complementary methods: (1) a dataset-based approach that constructs a steering vector by contrasting model activations on biased and neutral inputs, and (2) a novel optimization-based approach designed for low-resource settings, which constructs the steering vector using a single step of gradient-based perturbation without requiring additional data. Our experiments show that these interventions effectively reduce the propensity of LMMs to generate text related to protected attributes while maintaining sentiment and fluency. Furthermore, we demonstrate that debiased LMMs achieve comparable accuracy to their unmodified counterparts on downstream tasks, indicating that bias mitigation can be achieved without sacrificing model performance.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Unsigned Distance Functions (UDFs) can be used to represent non-watertight surfaces in a deep learning framework. However, UDFs tend to be brittle and difficult to learn, in part because the surface is located exactly where the UDF is non-differentiable. In this work, we show that Gradient Distance Functions (GDFs) can remedy this by being differentiable at the surface while still being able to represent open surfaces. This is done by associating to each 3D point a 3D vector whose norm is taken to be the unsigned distance to the surface and whose orientation is taken to be the direction towards the closest surface point. We demonstrate the effectiveness of GDFs on ShapeNet Car, Multi-Garment, and 3D-Scene datasets with both single-shape reconstruction networks or categorical auto-decoders.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper proposes a Generative Face Video Compression (GFVC) approach using Supplemental Enhancement Information (SEI), where a series of compact spatial and temporal representations of a face video signal (e.g., 2D/3D keypoints, facial semantics and compact features) can be coded using SEI messages and inserted into the coded video bitstream. At the time of writing, the proposed GFVC approach using SEI messages has been included into a draft amendment of the Versatile Supplemental Enhancement Information (VSEI) standard by the Joint Video Experts Team (JVET) of ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 29 and ITU-T SG21, which will be standardized as a new version of ITU-T H.274 | ISO/IEC 23002-7. To the best of the authors' knowledge, the JVET work on the proposed SEI-based GFVC approach is the first standardization activity for generative video compression. The proposed SEI approach has not only advanced the reconstruction quality of early-day Model-Based Coding (MBC) via the state-of-the-art generative technique, but also established a new SEI definition for future GFVC applications and deployment. Experimental results illustrate that the proposed SEI-based GFVC approach can achieve remarkable rate-distortion performance compared with the latest Versatile Video Coding (VVC) standard, whilst also potentially enabling a wide variety of functionalities including user-specified animation/filtering and metaverse-related applications.

  Recently, driven by advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), Vision Language Action Models (VLAMs) are being proposed to achieve better performance in open-vocabulary scenarios for robotic manipulation tasks. Since manipulation tasks involve direct interaction with the physical world, ensuring robustness and safety during the execution of this task is always a very critical issue. In this paper, by synthesizing current safety research on MLLMs and the specific application scenarios of the manipulation task in the physical world, we comprehensively evaluate VLAMs in the face of potential physical threats. Specifically, we propose the Physical Vulnerability Evaluating Pipeline (PVEP) that can incorporate as many visual modal physical threats as possible for evaluating the physical robustness of VLAMs. The physical threats in PVEP specifically include Out-of-Distribution, Typography-based Visual Prompt, and Adversarial Patch Attacks. By comparing the performance fluctuations of VLAMs before and after being attacked, we provide generalizable \textbf{\textit{Analyses}} of how VLAMs respond to different physical threats.

  Foundation models have emerged as powerful tools across various domains including language, vision, and multimodal tasks. While prior works have addressed unsupervised image segmentation, they significantly lag behind supervised models. In this paper, we use a diffusion UNet encoder as a foundation vision encoder and introduce DiffCut, an unsupervised zero-shot segmentation method that solely harnesses the output features from the final self-attention block. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate that the utilization of these diffusion features in a graph based segmentation algorithm, significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods on zero-shot segmentation. Specifically, we leverage a recursive Normalized Cut algorithm that softly regulates the granularity of detected objects and produces well-defined segmentation maps that precisely capture intricate image details. Our work highlights the remarkably accurate semantic knowledge embedded within diffusion UNet encoders that could then serve as foundation vision encoders for downstream tasks.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  With the continuous expansion of intelligent surveillance networks, lifelong person re-identification (LReID) has received widespread attention, pursuing the need of self-evolution across different domains. However, existing LReID studies accumulate knowledge with the assumption that people would not change their clothes. In this paper, we propose a more practical task, namely lifelong person re-identification with hybrid clothing states (LReID-Hybrid), which takes a series of cloth-changing and same-cloth domains into account during lifelong learning. To tackle the challenges of knowledge granularity mismatch and knowledge presentation mismatch in LReID-Hybrid, we take advantage of the consistency and generalization capabilities of the text space, and propose a novel framework, dubbed $Teata$, to effectively align, transfer, and accumulate knowledge in an "image-text-image" closed loop. Concretely, to achieve effective knowledge transfer, we design a Structured Semantic Prompt (SSP) learning to decompose the text prompt into several structured pairs to distill knowledge from the image space with a unified granularity of text description. Then, we introduce a Knowledge Adaptation and Projection (KAP) strategy, which tunes text knowledge via a slow-paced learner to adapt to different tasks without catastrophic forgetting. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our proposed $Teata$ for LReID-Hybrid as well as on conventional LReID benchmarks over advanced methods.

  _Yuming Huang, Yingpin Chen, Changhui Wu, Binhui Song, Hui Wang_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The Swin Transformer image super-resolution (SR) reconstruction network primarily depends on the long-range relationship of the window and shifted window attention to explore features. However, this approach focuses only on global features, ignoring local ones, and considers only spatial interactions, disregarding channel and spatial-channel feature interactions, limiting its nonlinear mapping capability. Therefore, this study proposes an enhanced Swin Transformer network (ESTN) that alternately aggregates local and global features. During local feature aggregation, shift convolution facilitates the interaction between local spatial and channel information. During global feature aggregation, a block sparse global perception module is introduced, wherein spatial information is reorganized and the recombined features are then processed by a dense layer to achieve global perception. Additionally, multiscale self-attention and low-parameter residual channel attention modules are introduced to aggregate information across different scales. Finally, the effectiveness of ESTN on five public datasets and a local attribution map (LAM) are analyzed. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed ESTN achieves higher average PSNR, surpassing SRCNN, ELAN-light, SwinIR-light, and SMFANER+ models by 2.17dB, 0.13dB, 0.12dB, and 0.1dB, respectively, with LAM further confirming its larger receptive field. ESTN delivers improved quality of SR images. The source code can be found atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this paper, we propose a novel framework for Interactive Face Video Coding (IFVC), which allows humans to interact with the intrinsic visual representations instead of the signals. The proposed solution enjoys several distinct advantages, including ultra-compact representation, low delay interaction, and vivid expression/headpose animation. In particular, we propose the Internal Dimension Increase (IDI) based representation, greatly enhancing the fidelity and flexibility in rendering the appearance while maintaining reasonable representation cost. By leveraging strong statistical regularities, the visual signals can be effectively projected into controllable semantics in the three dimensional space (e.g., mouth motion, eye blinking, head rotation, head translation and head location), which are compressed and transmitted. The editable bitstream, which naturally supports the interactivity at the semantic level, can synthesize the face frames via the strong inference ability of the deep generative model. Experimental results have demonstrated the performance superiority and application prospects of our proposed IFVC scheme. In particular, the proposed scheme not only outperforms the state-of-the-art video coding standard Versatile Video Coding (VVC) and the latest generative compression schemes in terms of rate-distortion performance for face videos, but also enables the interactive coding without introducing additional manipulation processes. Furthermore, the proposed framework is expected to shed lights on the future design of the digital human communication in the metaverse.

  Regular decompositions are necessary for most superpixel-based object recognition or tracking applications. So far in the literature, the regularity or compactness of a superpixel shape is mainly measured by its circularity. In this work, we first demonstrate that such measure is not adapted for superpixel evaluation, since it does not directly express regularity but circular appearance. Then, we propose a new metric that considers several shape regularity aspects: convexity, balanced repartition, and contour smoothness. Finally, we demonstrate that our measure is robust to scale and noise and enables to more relevantly compare superpixel methods.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We propose FlowRL: matching the full reward distribution via flow balancing instead of maximizing rewards in large language model (LLM) reinforcement learning (RL). Recent advanced reasoning models adopt reward-maximizing methods (\eg, PPO and GRPO), which tend to over-optimize dominant reward signals while neglecting less frequent but valid reasoning paths, thus reducing diversity. In contrast, we transform scalar rewards into a normalized target distribution using a learnable partition function, and then minimize the reverse KL divergence between the policy and the target distribution. We implement this idea as a flow-balanced optimization method that promotes diverse exploration and generalizable reasoning trajectories. We conduct experiments on math and code reasoning tasks: FlowRL achieves a significant average improvement of $10.0\%$ over GRPO and $5.1\%$ over PPO on math benchmarks, and performs consistently better on code reasoning tasks. These results highlight reward distribution-matching as a key step toward efficient exploration and diverse reasoning in LLM reinforcement learning.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly trained with reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards (RLVR), yet real-world deployment demands models that can self-improve without labels or external judges. Existing label-free methods, confidence minimization, self-consistency, or majority-vote objectives, stabilize learning but steadily shrink exploration, causing an entropy collapse: generations become shorter, less diverse, and brittle. Unlike prior approaches such as Test-Time Reinforcement Learning (TTRL), which primarily adapt models to the immediate unlabeled dataset at hand, our goal is broader: to enable general improvements without sacrificing the model's inherent exploration capacity and generalization ability, i.e., evolving. We formalize this issue and propose EVolution-Oriented and Label-free Reinforcement Learning (EVOL-RL), a simple rule that couples stability with variation under a label-free setting. EVOL-RL keeps the majority-voted answer as a stable anchor (selection) while adding a novelty-aware reward that favors responses whose reasoning differs from what has already been produced (variation), measured in semantic space. Implemented with GRPO, EVOL-RL also uses asymmetric clipping to preserve strong signals and an entropy regularizer to sustain search. This majority-for-selection + novelty-for-variation design prevents collapse, maintains longer and more informative chains of thought, and improves both pass@1 and pass@n. EVOL-RL consistently outperforms the majority-only TTRL baseline; e.g., training on label-free AIME24 lifts Qwen3-4B-Base AIME25 pass@1 from TTRL's 4.6% to 16.4%, and pass@16 from 18.5% to 37.9%. EVOL-RL not only prevents diversity collapse but also unlocks stronger generalization across domains (e.g., GPQA). Furthermore, we demonstrate that EVOL-RL also boosts performance in the RLVR setting, highlighting its broad applicability.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of large language models can be viewed as an off-policy learning problem, where expert demonstrations come from a fixed behavior policy while training aims to optimize a target policy. Importance sampling is the standard tool for correcting this distribution mismatch, but large policy gaps lead to high variance and training instability. Existing approaches mitigate this issue using KL penalties or clipping, which passively constrain updates rather than actively reducing the gap. We propose a simple yet effective data rewriting framework that proactively shrinks the policy gap by keeping correct solutions as on-policy data and rewriting incorrect ones with guided re-solving, falling back to expert demonstrations only when needed. This aligns the training distribution with the target policy before optimization, reducing importance sampling variance and stabilizing off-policy fine-tuning. Experiments on five mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate consistent and significant gains over both vanilla SFT and the state-of-the-art Dynamic Fine-Tuning (DFT) approach. The data and code will be released atthis https URL.

  Foundation models trained on web-scale data have revolutionized robotics, but their application to low-level control remains largely limited to behavioral cloning. Drawing inspiration from the success of the reinforcement learning stage in fine-tuning large language models, we propose a two-stage post-training approach for robotics. The first stage, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), fine-tunes pretrained foundation models using both: a) behavioral cloning, and b) steps-to-go prediction objectives. In the second stage, Self-Improvement, steps-to-go prediction enables the extraction of a well-shaped reward function and a robust success detector, enabling a fleet of robots to autonomously practice downstream tasks with minimal human supervision. Through extensive experiments on real-world and simulated robot embodiments, our novel post-training recipe unveils significant results on Embodied Foundation Models. First, we demonstrate that the combination of SFT and Self-Improvement is significantly more sample-efficient than scaling imitation data collection for supervised learning, and that it leads to policies with significantly higher success rates. Further ablations highlight that the combination of web-scale pretraining and Self-Improvement is the key to this sample-efficiency. Next, we demonstrate that our proposed combination uniquely unlocks a capability that current methods cannot achieve: autonomously practicing and acquiring novel skills that generalize far beyond the behaviors observed in the imitation learning datasets used during training. These findings highlight the transformative potential of combining pretrained foundation models with online Self-Improvement to enable autonomous skill acquisition in robotics.

  Federated learning (FL) usually shares model weights or gradients, which is costly for large models. Logit-based FL reduces this cost by sharing only logits computed on a public proxy dataset. However, aggregating information from heterogeneous clients is still challenging. This paper studies this problem, introduces and compares three logit aggregation methods: simple averaging, uncertainty-weighted averaging, and a learned meta-aggregator. Evaluated on MNIST and CIFAR-10, these methods reduce communication overhead, improve robustness under non-IID data, and achieve accuracy competitive with centralized training.

  Motivated by problems in online advertising, we address the task of Learning from Label Proportions (LLP). In this partially-supervised setting, training data consists of groups of examples, termed bags, for which we only observe the average label value. The main goal, however, remains the design of a predictor for the labels of individual examples. We introduce a novel and versatile low-variance de-biasing methodology to learn from aggregate label information, significantly advancing the state of the art in LLP. Our approach exhibits remarkable flexibility, seamlessly accommodating a broad spectrum of practically relevant loss functions across both binary and multi-class classification settings. By carefully combining our estimators with standard techniques, we substantially improve sample complexity guarantees for a large class of losses of practical relevance. We also empirically validate the efficacy of our proposed approach across a diverse array of benchmark datasets, demonstrating compelling empirical advantages over standard baselines.

  In high-stakes scenarios, such as medical imaging applications, it is critical to equip the predictions of a regression model with reliable confidence intervals. Recently, Conformal Prediction (CP) has emerged as a powerful statistical framework that, based on a labeled calibration set, generates intervals that include the true labels with a pre-specified probability. In this paper, we address the problem of applying CP for regression models when the calibration set contains noisy labels. We begin by establishing a mathematically grounded procedure for estimating the noise-free CP threshold. Then, we turn it into a practical algorithm that overcomes the challenges arising from the continuous nature of the regression problem. We evaluate the proposed method on two medical imaging regression datasets with Gaussian label noise. Our method significantly outperforms the existing alternative, achieving performance close to the clean-label setting.

  The growing demand for energy-efficient, high-performance AI systems has led to increased attention on alternative computing platforms (e.g., photonic, neuromorphic) due to their potential to accelerate learning and inference. However, integrating such physical components into deep learning pipelines remains challenging, as physical devices often offer limited expressiveness, and their non-differentiable nature renders on-device backpropagation difficult or infeasible. This motivates the development of hybrid architectures that combine digital neural networks with reconfigurable physical layers, which effectively behave as black boxes. In this work, we present a framework for the end-to-end training of such hybrid networks. This framework integrates stochastic zeroth-order optimization for updating the physical layer's internal parameters with a dynamic low-rank surrogate model that enables gradient propagation through the physical layer. A key component of our approach is the implicit projector-splitting integrator algorithm, which updates the lightweight surrogate model after each forward pass with minimal hardware queries, thereby avoiding costly full matrix reconstruction. We demonstrate our method across diverse deep learning tasks, including: computer vision, audio classification, and language modeling. Notably, across all modalities, the proposed approach achieves near-digital baseline accuracy and consistently enables effective end-to-end training of hybrid models incorporating various non-differentiable physical components (spatial light modulators, microring resonators, and Mach-Zehnder interferometers). This work bridges hardware-aware deep learning and gradient-free optimization, thereby offering a practical pathway for integrating non-differentiable physical components into scalable, end-to-end trainable AI systems.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reward models are central to both reinforcement learning (RL) with language models and inference-time verification. However, existing reward models often lack temporal consistency, leading to ineffective policy updates and unstable RL training. We introduce TDRM, a method for learning smoother and more reliable reward models by minimizing temporal differences during training. This temporal-difference (TD) regularization produces smooth rewards and improves alignment with long-term objectives. Incorporating TDRM into the actor-critic style online RL loop yields consistent empirical gains. It is worth noting that TDRM is a supplement to verifiable reward methods, and both can be used in series. Experiments show that TD-trained process reward models (PRMs) improve performance across Best-of-N (up to 6.6%) and tree-search (up to 23.7%) settings. When combined with Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), TD-trained PRMs lead to more data-efficient RL -- achieving comparable performance with just 2.5k data to what baseline methods require 50.1k data to attain -- and yield higher-quality language model policies on 8 model variants (5 series), e.g., Qwen2.5-(0.5B, 1,5B), GLM4-9B-0414, GLM-Z1-9B-0414, Qwen2.5-Math-(1.5B, 7B), and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-(1.5B, 7B).

Traditional gradient-based training methods are inefficient, requiring numerous iterative updates and high power consumption. To address these limitations, we propose a hybrid framework that combines hierarchical decomposition with FPGA-based direct equation solving and incremental learning. Our method divides the neural network into two functional tiers: lower layers are optimized via single-step equation solving on FPGAs for efficient and parallelizable feature extraction, while higher layers employ adaptive incremental learning to support continual updates without full retraining. Building upon this foundation, we introduce the Compound LLM framework, which explicitly deploys LLM modules across both hierarchy levels. The lower-level LLM handles reusable representation learning with minimal energy overhead, while the upper-level LLM performs adaptive decision-making through energy-aware updates. This integrated design enhances scalability, reduces redundant computation, and aligns with the principles of sustainable AI. Theoretical analysis and architectural insights demonstrate that our method reduces computational costs significantly while preserving high model performance, making it well-suited for edge deployment and real-time adaptation in energy-constrained environments.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across various tasks, but fine-tuning them for domain-specific applications often requires substantial domain-specific data that may be distributed across multiple organizations. Federated Learning (FL) offers a privacy-preserving solution, but faces challenges with computational constraints when applied to LLMs. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as a parameter-efficient fine-tuning approach, though a single LoRA module often struggles with heterogeneous data across diverse domains. This paper addresses two critical challenges in federated LoRA fine-tuning: 1. determining the optimal number and allocation of LoRA experts across heterogeneous clients, and 2. enabling clients to selectively utilize these experts based on their specific data characteristics. We propose FedLEASE (Federated adaptive LoRA Expert Allocation and SElection), a novel framework that adaptively clusters clients based on representation similarity to allocate and train domain-specific LoRA experts. It also introduces an adaptive top-$M$ Mixture-of-Experts mechanism that allows each client to select the optimal number of utilized experts. Our extensive experiments on diverse benchmark datasets demonstrate that FedLEASE significantly outperforms existing federated fine-tuning approaches in heterogeneous client settings while maintaining communication efficiency.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Air pollution remains a critical threat to public health and environmental sustainability, yet conventional monitoring systems are often constrained by limited spatial coverage and accessibility. This paper proposes an AI-driven agent that predicts ambient air pollution levels from sky images and synthesizes realistic visualizations of pollution scenarios using generative modeling. Our approach combines statistical texture analysis with supervised learning for pollution classification, and leverages vision-language model (VLM)-guided image generation to produce interpretable representations of air quality conditions. The generated visuals simulate varying degrees of pollution, offering a foundation for user-facing interfaces that improve transparency and support informed environmental decision-making. These outputs can be seamlessly integrated into intelligent applications aimed at enhancing situational awareness and encouraging behavioral responses based on real-time forecasts. We validate our method using a dataset of urban sky images and demonstrate its effectiveness in both pollution level estimation and semantically consistent visual synthesis. The system design further incorporates human-centered user experience principles to ensure accessibility, clarity, and public engagement in air quality forecasting. To support scalable and energy-efficient deployment, future iterations will incorporate a green CNN architecture enhanced with FPGA-based incremental learning, enabling real-time inference on edge platforms.

  _Shaoang Li, Jian Li_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Non-stationary multi-armed bandits enable agents to adapt to changing environments by incorporating mechanisms to detect and respond to shifts in reward distributions, making them well-suited for dynamic settings. However, existing approaches typically assume that reward feedback is available at every round - an assumption that overlooks many real-world scenarios where feedback is limited. In this paper, we take a significant step forward by introducing a new model of constrained feedback in non-stationary multi-armed bandits, where the availability of reward feedback is restricted. We propose the first prior-free algorithm - that is, one that does not require prior knowledge of the degree of non-stationarity - that achieves near-optimal dynamic regret in this setting. Specifically, our algorithm attains a dynamic regret of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}({K^{1/3} V_T^{1/3} T }/{ B^{1/3}})$, where $T$ is the number of rounds, $K$ is the number of arms, $B$ is the query budget, and $V_T$ is the variation budget capturing the degree of non-stationarity.

  _Martha Cash, Alexander Wyglinski_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present a novel framework that leverages time series clustering to improve internet traffic matrix (TM) prediction using deep learning (DL) models. Traffic flows within a TM often exhibit diverse temporal behaviors, which can hinder prediction accuracy when training a single model across all flows. To address this, we propose two clustering strategies, source clustering and histogram clustering, that group flows with similar temporal patterns prior to model training. Clustering creates more homogeneous data subsets, enabling models to capture underlying patterns more effectively and generalize better than global prediction approaches that fit a single model to the entire TM. Compared to existing TM prediction methods, our method reduces RMSE by up to 92\% for Abilene and 75\% for G√âANT. In routing scenarios, our clustered predictions also reduce maximum link utilization (MLU) bias by 18\% and 21\%, respectively, demonstrating the practical benefits of clustering when TMs are used for network optimization.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper develops alternative hyperparameters for specifying sparse Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). These hyperparameters allow for varying sparsity within the trainable weight matrices of the model while improving overall performance. This architecture enables the definition of a novel metric, hidden proportion, which seeks to balance the distribution of unknowns within the model and provides significant explanatory power of model performance. Together, the use of the varied sparsity RNN architecture combined with the hidden proportion metric generates significant performance gains while improving performance expectations on an a priori basis. This combined approach provides a path forward towards generalized meta-learning applications and model optimization based on intrinsic characteristics of the data set, including input and output dimensions.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reinforcement learning agents in complex game environments often suffer from sparse rewards, training instability, and poor sample efficiency. This paper presents a hybrid training approach that combines offline imitation learning with online reinforcement learning for a 2D shooter game agent. We implement a multi-head neural network with separate outputs for behavioral cloning and Q-learning, unified by shared feature extraction layers with attention mechanisms. Initial experiments using pure deep Q-Networks exhibited significant instability, with agents frequently reverting to poor policies despite occasional good performance. To address this, we developed a hybrid methodology that begins with behavioral cloning on demonstration data from rule-based agents, then transitions to reinforcement learning. Our hybrid approach achieves consistently above 70% win rate against rule-based opponents, substantially outperforming pure reinforcement learning methods which showed high variance and frequent performance degradation. The multi-head architecture enables effective knowledge transfer between learning modes while maintaining training stability. Results demonstrate that combining demonstration-based initialization with reinforcement learning optimization provides a robust solution for developing game AI agents in complex multi-agent environments where pure exploration proves insufficient.

  _Juwon Kim, Hyunwook Lee, Hyotaek Jeon, Seungmin Jin, Sungahn Ko_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Directional forecasting in financial markets requires both accuracy and interpretability. Before the advent of deep learning, interpretable approaches based on human-defined patterns were prevalent, but their structural vagueness and scale ambiguity hindered generalization. In contrast, deep learning models can effectively capture complex dynamics, yet often offer limited transparency. To bridge this gap, we propose a two-stage framework that integrates unsupervised pattern extracion with interpretable forecasting. (i) SIMPC segments and clusters multivariate time series, extracting recurrent patterns that are invariant to amplitude scaling and temporal distortion, even under varying window sizes. (ii) JISC-Net is a shapelet-based classifier that uses the initial part of extracted patterns as input and forecasts subsequent partial sequences for short-term directional movement. Experiments on Bitcoin and three S&P 500 equities demonstrate that our method ranks first or second in 11 out of 12 metric--dataset combinations, consistently outperforming baselines. Unlike conventional deep learning models that output buy-or-sell signals without interpretable justification, our approach enables transparent decision-making by revealing the underlying pattern structures that drive predictive outcomes.

  _Padmaksha Roy, Almuatazbellah Boker, Lamine Mili_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this paper, we aim to improve multivariate anomaly detection (AD) by modeling the \textit{time-varying non-linear spatio-temporal correlations} found in multivariate time series data . In multivariate time series data, an anomaly may be indicated by the simultaneous deviation of interrelated time series from their expected collective behavior, even when no individual time series exhibits a clearly abnormal pattern on its own. In many existing approaches, time series variables are assumed to be (conditionally) independent, which oversimplifies real-world interactions. Our approach addresses this by modeling joint dependencies in the latent space and decoupling the modeling of \textit{marginal distributions, temporal dynamics, and inter-variable dependencies}. We use a transformer encoder to capture temporal patterns, and to model spatial (inter-variable) dependencies, we fit a multi-variate likelihood and a copula. The temporal and the spatial components are trained jointly in a latent space using a self-supervised contrastive learning objective to learn meaningful feature representations to separate normal and anomaly samples.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper considers the smooth bilevel optimization in which the lower-level problem is strongly convex and the upper-level problem is possibly nonconvex. We focus on the stochastic setting that the algorithm can access the unbiased stochastic gradient evaluation with heavy-tailed noise, which is prevalent in many machine learning applications such as training large language models and reinforcement learning. We propose a nested-loop normalized stochastic bilevel approximation (N$^2$SBA) for finding an $\epsilon$-stationary point with the stochastic first-order oracle (SFO) complexity of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\big(\kappa^{\frac{7p-3}{p-1}} \sigma^{\frac{p}{p-1}} \epsilon^{-\frac{4 p - 2}{p-1}}\big)$, where $\kappa$ is the condition number, $p\in(1,2]$ is the order of central moment for the noise, and $\sigma$ is the noise level. Furthermore, we specialize our idea to solve the nonconvex-strongly-concave minimax optimization problem, achieving an $\epsilon$-stationary point with the SFO complexity of $\tilde{\mathcal O}\big(\kappa^{\frac{2p-1}{p-1}} \sigma^{\frac{p}{p-1}} \epsilon^{-\frac{3p-2}{p-1}}\big)$. All above upper bounds match the best-known results under the special case of the bounded variance setting, i.e., $p=2$.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Malnutrition among pregnant women is a major public health challenge in Ethiopia, increasing the risk of adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes. Traditional statistical approaches often fail to capture the complex and multidimensional determinants of nutritional status. This study develops a predictive model using ensemble machine learning techniques, leveraging data from the Ethiopian Demographic and Health Survey (2005-2020), comprising 18,108 records with 30 socio-demographic and health attributes. Data preprocessing included handling missing values, normalization, and balancing with SMOTE, followed by feature selection to identify key predictors. Several supervised ensemble algorithms including XGBoost, Random Forest, CatBoost, and AdaBoost were applied to classify nutritional status. Among them, the Random Forest model achieved the best performance, classifying women into four categories (normal, moderate malnutrition, severe malnutrition, and overnutrition) with 97.87% accuracy, 97.88% precision, 97.87% recall, 97.87% F1-score, and 99.86% ROC AUC. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of ensemble learning in capturing hidden patterns from complex datasets and provide timely insights for early detection of nutritional risks. The results offer practical implications for healthcare providers, policymakers, and researchers, supporting data-driven strategies to improve maternal nutrition and health outcomes in Ethiopia.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Federated Learning (FL) offers a decentralized solution that allows collaborative local model training and global aggregation, thereby protecting data privacy. In conventional FL frameworks, data privacy is typically preserved under the assumption that local data remains absolutely private, whereas the mobility of clients is frequently neglected in explicit modeling. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical federated learning framework based on the social network with mobility namely HFL-SNM that considers both data sharing among clients and their mobility patterns. Under the constraints of limited resources, we formulate a joint optimization problem of resource allocation and client scheduling, which objective is to minimize the energy consumption of clients during the FL process. In social network, we introduce the concepts of Effective Data Coverage Rate and Redundant Data Coverage Rate. We analyze the impact of effective data and redundant data on the model performance through preliminary experiments. We decouple the optimization problem into multiple sub-problems, analyze them based on preliminary experimental results, and propose Dynamic Optimization in Social Network with Mobility (DO-SNM) algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm achieves superior model performance while significantly reducing energy consumption, compared to traditional baseline algorithms.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Social media has become a key medium of communication in today's society. This realisation has led to many parties employing artificial users (or bots) to mislead others into believing untruths or acting in a beneficial manner to such parties. Sophisticated text generation tools, such as large language models, have further exacerbated this issue. This paper aims to compare the effectiveness of bot detection models based on encoder and decoder transformers. Pipelines are developed to evaluate the performance of these classifiers, revealing that encoder-based classifiers demonstrate greater accuracy and robustness. However, decoder-based models showed greater adaptability through task-specific alignment, suggesting more potential for generalisation across different use cases in addition to superior observa. These findings contribute to the ongoing effort to prevent digital environments being manipulated while protecting the integrity of online discussion.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Time series forecasting is crucial in various fields such as economics, traffic, and AIOps. However, in real-world applications, focusing solely on the endogenous variables (i.e., target variables), is often insufficient to ensure accurate predictions. Considering exogenous variables (i.e., covariates) provides additional predictive information, thereby improving forecasting accuracy. However, existing methods for time series forecasting with exogenous variables (TSF-X) have the following shortcomings: 1) they do not leverage future exogenous variables, 2) they fail to account for the causal relationships between endogenous and exogenous variables. As a result, their performance is suboptimal. In this study, to better leverage exogenous variables, especially future exogenous variable, we propose a general framework DAG, which utilizes dual causal network along both the temporal and channel dimensions for time series forecasting with exogenous variables. Specifically, we first introduce the Temporal Causal Module, which includes a causal discovery module to capture how historical exogenous variables affect future exogenous variables. Following this, we construct a causal injection module that incorporates the discovered causal relationships into the process of forecasting future endogenous variables based on historical endogenous variables. Next, we propose the Channel Causal Module, which follows a similar design principle. It features a causal discovery module models how historical exogenous variables influence historical endogenous variables, and a causal injection module incorporates the discovered relationships to enhance the prediction of future endogenous variables based on future exogenous variables.

  We conducted rigorous ablation studies to validate DPANet's key components (Table \ref{tab:ablation-study}). The full model consistently outperforms all variants. To test our dual-domain hypothesis, we designed two specialized versions: a Temporal-Only model (fusing two identical temporal pyramids) and a Frequency-Only model (fusing two spectral pyramids). Both variants underperformed significantly, confirming that the fusion of heterogeneous temporal and frequency information is critical. Furthermore, replacing the cross-attention mechanism with a simpler method (w/o Cross-Fusion) caused the most severe performance degradation. This result underscores that our interactive fusion block is the most essential component.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Graph Transformers (GTs) show considerable potential in graph representation learning. The architecture of GTs typically integrates Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with global attention mechanisms either in parallel or as a precursor to attention mechanisms, yielding a local-and-global or local-to-global attention scheme. However, as the global attention mechanism primarily captures long-range dependencies between nodes, these integration schemes may suffer from information loss, where the local neighborhood information learned by GNN could be diluted by the attention mechanism. Therefore, we propose G2LFormer, featuring a novel global-to-local attention scheme where the shallow network layers use attention mechanisms to capture global information, while the deeper layers employ GNN modules to learn local structural information, thereby preventing nodes from ignoring their immediate neighbors. An effective cross-layer information fusion strategy is introduced to allow local layers to retain beneficial information from global layers and alleviate information loss, with acceptable trade-offs in scalability. To validate the feasibility of the global-to-local attention scheme, we compare G2LFormer with state-of-the-art linear GTs and GNNs on node-level and graph-level tasks. The results indicate that G2LFormer exhibits excellent performance while keeping linear complexity.

  CoVariance Neural Networks (VNNs) perform convolutions on the graph determined by the covariance matrix of the data, which enables expressive and stable covariance-based learning. However, covariance matrices are typically dense, fail to encode conditional independence, and are often precomputed in a task-agnostic way, which may hinder performance. To overcome these limitations, we study Precision Neural Networks (PNNs), i.e., VNNs on the precision matrix -- the inverse covariance. The precision matrix naturally encodes statistical independence, often exhibits sparsity, and preserves the covariance spectral structure. To make precision estimation task-aware, we formulate an optimization problem that jointly learns the network parameters and the precision matrix, and solve it via alternating optimization, by sequentially updating the network weights and the precision estimate. We theoretically bound the distance between the estimated and true precision matrices at each iteration, and demonstrate the effectiveness of joint estimation compared to two-step approaches on synthetic and real-world data.

  While trajectory prediction plays a critical role in enabling safe and effective path-planning in automated vehicles, standardized practices for evaluating such models remain underdeveloped. Recent efforts have aimed to unify dataset formats and model interfaces for easier comparisons, yet existing frameworks often fall short in supporting heterogeneous traffic scenarios, joint prediction models, or user documentation. In this work, we introduce STEP -- a new benchmarking framework that addresses these limitations by providing a unified interface for multiple datasets, enforcing consistent training and evaluation conditions, and supporting a wide range of prediction models. We demonstrate the capabilities of STEP in a number of experiments which reveal 1) the limitations of widely-used testing procedures, 2) the importance of joint modeling of agents for better predictions of interactions, and 3) the vulnerability of current state-of-the-art models against both distribution shifts and targeted attacks by adversarial agents. With STEP, we aim to shift the focus from the ``leaderboard'' approach to deeper insights about model behavior and generalization in complex multi-agent settings.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Since compute grows much faster than web text available for language model pre-training, we ask how one should approach pre-training under fixed data and no compute constraints. We first show that existing data-constrained approaches of increasing epoch count and parameter count eventually overfit, and we significantly improve upon such recipes by properly tuning regularization, finding that the optimal weight decay is $30\times$ larger than standard practice. Since our regularized recipe monotonically decreases loss following a simple power law in parameter count, we estimate its best possible performance via the asymptote of its scaling law rather than the performance at a fixed compute budget. We then identify that ensembling independently trained models achieves a significantly lower loss asymptote than the regularized recipe. Our best intervention combining epoching, regularization, parameter scaling, and ensemble scaling achieves an asymptote at 200M tokens using $5.17\times$ less data than our baseline, and our data scaling laws predict that this improvement persists at higher token budgets. We find that our data efficiency gains can be realized at much smaller parameter counts as we can distill an ensemble into a student model that is 8$\times$ smaller and retains $83\%$ of the ensembling benefit. Finally, our interventions designed for validation loss generalize to downstream benchmarks, achieving a $9\%$ improvement for pre-training evals and a $17.5\times$ data efficiency improvement over continued pre-training on math mid-training data. Our results show that simple algorithmic improvements can enable significantly more data-efficient pre-training in a compute-rich future.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Accurate hourly weather forecasting is critical for numerous applications. Recent deep learning models have demonstrated strong capability on 6-hour intervals, yet achieving accurate and stable hourly predictions remains a critical challenge. This is primarily due to the rapid accumulation of errors in autoregressive rollouts and temporal discontinuities within the ERA5 data's 12-hour assimilation cycle. To address these issues, we propose FlowCast-ODE, a framework that models atmospheric state evolution as a continuous flow. FlowCast-ODE learns the conditional flow path directly from the previous state, an approach that aligns more naturally with physical dynamic systems and enables efficient computation. A coarse-to-fine strategy is introduced to train the model on 6-hour data using dynamic flow matching and then refined on hourly data that incorporates an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) solver to achieve temporally coherent forecasts. In addition, a lightweight low-rank AdaLN-Zero modulation mechanism is proposed and reduces model size by 15% without compromising accuracy. Experiments demonstrate that FlowCast-ODE outperforms strong baselines, yielding lower root mean square error (RMSE) and better energy conservation, which reduces blurring and preserves more fine-scale spatial details. It also shows comparable performance to the state-of-the-art model in forecasting extreme events like typhoons. Furthermore, the model alleviates temporal discontinuities associated with assimilation cycle transitions.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In light of their capability to capture structural information while reducing computing complexity, anchor graph-based multi-view clustering (AGMC) methods have attracted considerable attention in large-scale clustering problems. Nevertheless, existing AGMC methods still face the following two issues: 1) They directly embedded diverse anchor graphs into a consensus anchor graph (CAG), and hence ignore redundant information and numerous noises contained in these anchor graphs, leading to a decrease in clustering effectiveness; 2) They drop effectiveness and efficiency due to independent post-processing to acquire clustering indicators. To overcome the aforementioned issues, we deliver a novel one-step multi-view clustering method with adaptive low-rank anchor-graph learning (OMCAL). To construct a high-quality CAG, OMCAL provides a nuclear norm-based adaptive CAG learning model against information redundancy and noise interference. Then, to boost clustering effectiveness and efficiency substantially, we incorporate category indicator acquisition and CAG learning into a unified framework. Numerous studies conducted on ordinary and large-scale datasets indicate that OMCAL outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of clustering effectiveness and efficiency.

  Single-cell foundation models (scFMs) have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance on various tasks, such as cell-type annotation and perturbation response prediction, by learning gene regulatory networks from large-scale transcriptome data. However, a significant challenge remains: the decision-making processes of these models are less interpretable compared to traditional methods like differential gene expression analysis. Recently, transcoders have emerged as a promising approach for extracting interpretable decision circuits from large language models (LLMs). In this work, we train a transcoder on the cell2sentence (C2S) model, a state-of-the-art scFM. By leveraging the trained transcoder, we extract internal decision-making circuits from the C2S model. We demonstrate that the discovered circuits correspond to real-world biological mechanisms, confirming the potential of transcoders to uncover biologically plausible pathways within complex single-cell models.

  Graph condensation (GC) aims to distill the original graph into a small-scale graph, mitigating redundancy and accelerating GNN training. However, conventional GC approaches heavily rely on rigid GNNs and task-specific supervision. Such a dependency severely restricts their reusability and generalization across various tasks and architectures. In this work, we revisit the goal of ideal GC from the perspective of GNN optimization consistency, and then a generalized GC optimization objective is derived, by which those traditional GC methods can be viewed nicely as special cases of this optimization paradigm. Based on this, Pre-trained Graph Condensation (PreGC) via optimal transport is proposed to transcend the limitations of task- and architecture-dependent GC methods. Specifically, a hybrid-interval graph diffusion augmentation is presented to suppress the weak generalization ability of the condensed graph on particular architectures by enhancing the uncertainty of node states. Meanwhile, the matching between optimal graph transport plan and representation transport plan is tactfully established to maintain semantic consistencies across source graph and condensed graph spaces, thereby freeing graph condensation from task dependencies. To further facilitate the adaptation of condensed graphs to various downstream tasks, a traceable semantic harmonizer from source nodes to condensed nodes is proposed to bridge semantic associations through the optimized representation transport plan in pre-training. Extensive experiments verify the superiority and versatility of PreGC, demonstrating its task-independent nature and seamless compatibility with arbitrary GNNs.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  While reinforcement learning (RL) is increasingly used for LLM-based tool learning, its efficiency is often hampered by an overabundance of simple samples that provide diminishing learning value as training progresses. Existing dynamic sampling techniques are ill-suited for the multi-task structure and fine-grained reward mechanisms inherent to tool learning. This paper introduces Dynamic Sampling with Curriculum Learning (DSCL), a framework specifically designed to address this challenge by targeting the unique characteristics of tool learning: its multiple interdependent sub-tasks and multi-valued reward functions. DSCL features two core components: Reward-Based Dynamic Sampling, which uses multi-dimensional reward statistics (mean and variance) to prioritize valuable data, and Task-Based Dynamic Curriculum Learning, which adaptively focuses training on less-mastered sub-tasks. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that DSCL significantly improves training efficiency and model performance over strong baselines, achieving a 3.29\% improvement on the BFCLv3 benchmark. Our method provides a tailored solution that effectively leverages the complex reward signals and sub-task dynamics within tool learning to achieve superior results.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Modeling dynamic temporal dependencies is a critical challenge in time series pre-training, which evolve due to distribution shifts and multi-scale patterns. This temporal variability severely impairs the generalization of pre-trained models to downstream tasks. Existing frameworks fail to capture the complex interactions of short- and long-term dependencies, making them susceptible to spurious correlations that degrade generalization. To address these limitations, we propose DeCoP, a Dependency Controlled Pre-training framework that explicitly models dynamic, multi-scale dependencies by simulating evolving inter-patch dependencies. At the input level, DeCoP introduces Instance-wise Patch Normalization (IPN) to mitigate distributional shifts while preserving the unique characteristics of each patch, creating a robust foundation for representation learning. At the latent level, a hierarchical Dependency Controlled Learning (DCL) strategy explicitly models inter-patch dependencies across multiple temporal scales, with an Instance-level Contrastive Module (ICM) enhances global generalization by learning instance-discriminative representations from time-invariant positive pairs. DeCoP achieves state-of-the-art results on ten datasets with lower computing resources, improving MSE by 3% on ETTh1 over PatchTST using only 37% of the FLOPs.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Existing positional encoding methods in transformers are fundamentally signal-agnostic, deriving positional information solely from sequence indices while ignoring the underlying signal characteristics. This limitation is particularly problematic for time series analysis, where signals exhibit complex, non-stationary dynamics across multiple temporal scales. We introduce Dynamic Wavelet Positional Encoding (DyWPE), a novel signal-aware framework that generates positional embeddings directly from input time series using the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT). Comprehensive experiments in ten diverse time series datasets demonstrate that DyWPE consistently outperforms eight existing state-of-the-art positional encoding methods, achieving average relative improvements of 9.1\% compared to baseline sinusoidal absolute position encoding in biomedical signals, while maintaining competitive computational efficiency.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As privacy and security take center stage in AI, machine unlearning, the ability to erase specific knowledge from models, has garnered increasing attention. However, existing methods overly prioritize efficiency and aggressive forgetting, which introduces notable limitations. In particular, radical interventions like gradient ascent, influence functions, and random label noise can destabilize model weights, leading to collapse and reduced reliability. To address this, we propose CUFG (Curriculum Unlearning via Forgetting Gradients), a novel framework that enhances the stability of approximate unlearning through innovations in both forgetting mechanisms and data scheduling strategies. Specifically, CUFG integrates a new gradient corrector guided by forgetting gradients for fine-tuning-based unlearning and a curriculum unlearning paradigm that progressively forgets from easy to hard. These innovations narrow the gap with the gold-standard Retrain method by enabling more stable and progressive unlearning, thereby improving both effectiveness and reliability. Furthermore, we believe that the concept of curriculum unlearning has substantial research potential and offers forward-looking insights for the development of the MU field. Extensive experiments across various forgetting scenarios validate the rationale and effectiveness of our approach and CUFG. Codes are available atthis https URL.

  Energy-efficient medical data classification is essential for modern disease screening, particularly in home and field healthcare where embedded devices are prevalent. While deep learning models achieve state-of-the-art accuracy, their substantial energy consumption and reliance on GPUs limit deployment on such platforms. We present Hyperdimensional Computing with Class-Wise Clustering (HD3C), a lightweight classification framework designed for low-power environments. HD3C encodes data into high-dimensional hypervectors, aggregates them into multiple cluster-specific prototypes, and performs classification through similarity search in hyperspace. We evaluate HD3C across three medical classification tasks; on heart sound classification, HD3C is $350\times$ more energy-efficient than Bayesian ResNet with less than 1% accuracy difference. Moreover, HD3C demonstrates exceptional robustness to noise, limited training data, and hardware error, supported by both theoretical analysis and empirical results, highlighting its potential for reliable deployment in real-world settings.

  _Xingchen Wang, Feijie Wu, Chenglin Miao, Tianchun Li, Haoyu Hu, Qiming Cao, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Split Federated Learning (SFL) has emerged as an efficient alternative to traditional Federated Learning (FL) by reducing client-side computation through model partitioning. However, exchanging of intermediate activations and model updates introduces significant privacy risks, especially from data reconstruction attacks that recover original inputs from intermediate representations. Existing defenses using noise injection often degrade model performance. To overcome these challenges, we present PM-SFL, a scalable and privacy-preserving SFL framework that incorporates Probabilistic Mask training to add structured randomness without relying on explicit noise. This mitigates data reconstruction risks while maintaining model utility. To address data heterogeneity, PM-SFL employs personalized mask learning that tailors submodel structures to each client's local data. For system heterogeneity, we introduce a layer-wise knowledge compensation mechanism, enabling clients with varying resources to participate effectively under adaptive model splitting. Theoretical analysis confirms its privacy protection, and experiments on image and wireless sensing tasks demonstrate that PM-SFL consistently improves accuracy, communication efficiency, and robustness to privacy attacks, with particularly strong performance under data and system heterogeneity.

  _Yang Xu, Junpeng Li, Changchun Hua, Yana Yang_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The Large Margin Distribution Machine (LMDM) is a recent advancement in classifier design that optimizes not just the minimum margin (as in SVM) but the entire margin distribution, thereby improving generalization. However, existing LMDM formulations are limited to vectorized inputs and struggle with high-dimensional tensor data due to the need for flattening, which destroys the data's inherent multi-mode structure and increases computational burden. In this paper, we propose a Structure-Preserving Margin Distribution Learning for High-Order Tensor Data with Low-Rank Decomposition (SPMD-LRT) that operates directly on tensor representations without vectorization. The SPMD-LRT preserves multi-dimensional spatial structure by incorporating first-order and second-order tensor statistics (margin mean and variance) into the objective, and it leverages low-rank tensor decomposition techniques including rank-1(CP), higher-rank CP, and Tucker decomposition to parameterize the weight tensor. An alternating optimization (double-gradient descent) algorithm is developed to efficiently solve the SPMD-LRT, iteratively updating factor matrices and core tensor. This approach enables SPMD-LRT to maintain the structural information of high-order data while optimizing margin distribution for improved classification. Extensive experiments on diverse datasets (including MNIST, images and fMRI neuroimaging) demonstrate that SPMD-LRT achieves superior classification accuracy compared to conventional SVM, vector-based LMDM, and prior tensor-based SVM extensions (Support Tensor Machines and Support Tucker Machines). Notably, SPMD-LRT with Tucker decomposition attains the highest accuracy, highlighting the benefit of structure preservation. These results confirm the effectiveness and robustness of SPMD-LRT in handling high-dimensional tensor data for classification.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The discovery of environmental knowledge depends on labeled task-specific data, but is often constrained by the high cost of data collection. Existing machine learning approaches usually struggle to generalize in data-sparse or atypical conditions. To this end, we propose an Augmentation-Adaptive Self-Supervised Learning (A$^2$SL) framework, which retrieves relevant observational samples to enhance modeling of the target ecosystem. Specifically, we introduce a multi-level pairwise learning loss to train a scenario encoder that captures varying degrees of similarity among scenarios. These learned similarities drive a retrieval mechanism that supplements a target scenario with relevant data from different locations or time periods. Furthermore, to better handle variable scenarios, particularly under atypical or extreme conditions where traditional models struggle, we design an augmentation-adaptive mechanism that selectively enhances these scenarios through targeted data augmentation. Using freshwater ecosystems as a case study, we evaluate A$^2$SL in modeling water temperature and dissolved oxygen dynamics in real-world lakes. Experimental results show that A$^2$SL significantly improves predictive accuracy and enhances robustness in data-scarce and atypical scenarios. Although this study focuses on freshwater ecosystems, the A$^2$SL framework offers a broadly applicable solution in various scientific domains.

  _Muhammad Awais Ali, Marlon Dumas, Fredrik Milani_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Predictive process monitoring techniques support the operational decision making by predicting future states of ongoing cases of a business process. A subset of these techniques predict the remaining sequence of activities of an ongoing case (case suffix prediction). Existing approaches for case suffix prediction generate sequences of activities with a single timestamp (e.g. the end timestamp). This output is insufficient for resource capacity planning, where we need to reason about the periods of time when resources will be busy performing work. This paper introduces a technique for predicting case suffixes consisting of activities with start and end timestamps. In other words, the proposed technique predicts both the waiting time and the processing time of each activity. Since the waiting time of an activity in a case depends on how busy resources are in other cases, the technique adopts a sweep-line approach, wherein the suffixes of all ongoing cases in the process are predicted in lockstep, rather than predictions being made for each case in isolation. An evaluation on real-life and synthetic datasets compares the accuracy of different instantiations of this approach, demonstrating the advantages of a multi-model approach to case suffix prediction.

  _Ye Qiao, Sitao Huang_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Extending LLM context windows is crucial for long range tasks. RoPE-based position interpolation (PI) methods like linear and frequency-aware scaling extend input lengths without retraining, while post-training quantization (PTQ) enables practical deployment. We show that combining PI with PTQ degrades accuracy due to coupled effects long context aliasing, dynamic range dilation, axis grid anisotropy, and outlier shifting that induce position-dependent logit noise. We provide the first systematic analysis of PI plus PTQ and introduce two diagnostics: Interpolation Pressure (per-band phase scaling sensitivity) and Tail Inflation Ratios (outlier shift from short to long contexts). To address this, we propose Q-ROAR, a RoPE-aware, weight-only stabilization that groups RoPE dimensions into a few frequency bands and performs a small search over per-band scales for W_Q,W_K, with an optional symmetric variant to preserve logit scale. The diagnostics guided search uses a tiny long-context dev set and requires no fine-tuning, kernel, or architecture changes. Empirically, Q-ROAR recovers up to 0.7% accuracy on standard tasks and reduces GovReport perplexity by more than 10%, while preserving short-context performance and compatibility with existing inference stacks.

  _Arjun S. Nair, Kristina P. Sinaga_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We prove a fundamental impossibility theorem: neural networks cannot simultaneously learn well-calibrated confidence estimates with meaningful diversity when trained using binary correct/incorrect supervision. Through rigorous mathematical analysis and comprehensive empirical evaluation spanning negative reward training, symmetric loss functions, and post-hoc calibration methods, we demonstrate this is an information-theoretic constraint, not a methodological failure. Our experiments reveal universal failure patterns: negative rewards produce extreme underconfidence (ECE greater than 0.8) while destroying confidence diversity (std less than 0.05), symmetric losses fail to escape binary signal averaging, and post-hoc methods achieve calibration (ECE less than 0.02) only by compressing the confidence distribution. We formalize this as an underspecified mapping problem where binary signals cannot distinguish between different confidence levels for correct predictions: a 60 percent confident correct answer receives identical supervision to a 90 percent confident one. Crucially, our real-world validation shows 100 percent failure rate for all training methods across MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR-10, while post-hoc calibration's 33 percent success rate paradoxically confirms our theorem by achieving calibration through transformation rather than learning. This impossibility directly explains neural network hallucinations and establishes why post-hoc calibration is mathematically necessary, not merely convenient. We propose novel supervision paradigms using ensemble disagreement and adaptive multi-agent learning that could overcome these fundamental limitations without requiring human confidence annotations.

  Large Language Models have demonstrated significant promise in formal theorem proving. However, previous works mainly focus on solving existing problems. In this paper, we focus on the ability of LLMs to find novel theorems. We propose Conjecturing-Proving Loop pipeline for automatically generating mathematical conjectures and proving them in Lean 4 format. A feature of our approach is that we generate and prove further conjectures with context including previously generated theorems and their proofs, which enables the generation of more difficult proofs by in-context learning of proof strategies without changing parameters of LLMs. We demonstrated that our framework rediscovered theorems with verification, which were published in past mathematical papers and have not yet formalized. Moreover, at least one of these theorems could not be proved by the LLM without in-context learning, even in natural language, which means that in-context learning was effective for neural theorem proving.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Existing parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods primarily adapt weight matrices while keeping activation functions fixed. We introduce \textbf{NoRA}, the first PEFT framework that directly adapts nonlinear activation functions in pretrained transformer-based models. NoRA replaces fixed activations with learnable rational functions and applies structured low-rank updates to numerator and denominator coefficients, with a group-wise design that localizes adaptation and improves stability at minimal cost. On vision transformers trained on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, NoRA matches or exceeds full fine-tuning while updating only 0.4\% of parameters (0.02M), achieving accuracy gains of +0.17\% and +0.27\%. When combined with LoRA (\textbf{NoRA++}), it outperforms LoRA and DoRA under matched training budgets by adding fewer trainable parameters. On LLaMA3-8B instruction tuning, NoRA++ consistently improves generation quality, yielding average MMLU gains of +0.3\%--0.8\%, including +1.6\% on STEM (Alpaca) and +1.3\% on OpenOrca. We further show that NoRA constrains adaptation to a low-dimensional functional subspace, implicitly regularizing update magnitude and direction. These results establish activation-space tuning as a complementary and highly parameter-efficient alternative to weight-based PEFT, positioning activation functions as first-class objects for model adaptation.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Continual learning is an essential capability of human cognition, yet it poses significant challenges for current deep learning models. The primary issue is that new knowledge can interfere with previously learned information, causing the model to forget earlier knowledge in favor of the new, a phenomenon known as catastrophic forgetting. Although large pre-trained models can partially mitigate forgetting by leveraging their existing knowledge and over-parameterization, they often struggle when confronted with novel data distributions. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods, such as LoRA, enable efficient adaptation to new knowledge. However, they still face challenges in scaling to dynamic learning scenarios and long sequences of tasks, as maintaining one adapter per task introduces complexity and increases the potential for interference. In this paper, we introduce Hierarchical Adapters Merging (HAM), a novel framework that dynamically combines adapters from different tasks during training. This approach enables HAM to scale effectively, allowing it to manage more tasks than competing baselines with improved efficiency. To achieve this, HAM maintains a fixed set of groups that hierarchically consolidate new adapters. For each task, HAM trains a low-rank adapter along with an importance scalar, then dynamically groups tasks based on adapter similarity. Within each group, adapters are pruned, scaled and merge, facilitating transfer learning between related tasks. Extensive experiments on three vision benchmarks show that HAM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly as the number of tasks increases.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Existing reinforcement learning (RL) methods struggle with complex dynamical systems that demand interactions at high frequencies or irregular time intervals. Continuous-time RL (CTRL) has emerged as a promising alternative by replacing discrete-time Bellman recursion with differential value functions defined as viscosity solutions of the Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman (HJB) equation. While CTRL has shown promise, its applications have been largely limited to the single-agent domain. This limitation stems from two key challenges: (i) conventional solution methods for HJB equations suffer from the curse of dimensionality (CoD), making them intractable in high-dimensional systems; and (ii) even with HJB-based learning approaches, accurately approximating centralized value functions in multi-agent settings remains difficult, which in turn destabilizes policy training. In this paper, we propose a CT-MARL framework that uses physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to approximate HJB-based value functions at scale. To ensure the value is consistent with its differential structure, we align value learning with value-gradient learning by introducing a Value Gradient Iteration (VGI) module that iteratively refines value gradients along trajectories. This improves gradient fidelity, in turn yielding more accurate values and stronger policy learning. We evaluate our method using continuous-time variants of standard benchmarks, including multi-agent particle environment (MPE) and multi-agent MuJoCo. Our results demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing continuous-time RL baselines and scales to complex multi-agent dynamics.

  Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success across diverse applications. However, due to the biases in the graph structures, graph neural networks face significant challenges in fairness. Although the original user graph structure is generally biased, it is promising to guide these existing structures toward unbiased ones by introducing new links. The fairness guidance via new links could foster unbiased communities, thereby enhancing fairness in downstream applications. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework named FairGuide. Specifically, to ensure fairness in downstream tasks trained on fairness-guided graphs, we introduce a differentiable community detection task as a pseudo downstream task. Our theoretical analysis further demonstrates that optimizing fairness within this pseudo task effectively enhances structural fairness, promoting fairness generalization across diverse downstream applications. Moreover, FairGuide employs an effective strategy which leverages meta-gradients derived from the fairness-guidance objective to identify new links that significantly enhance structural fairness. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our proposed method across a variety of graph-based fairness tasks.

  Effective resource management and network slicing are essential to meet the diverse service demands of vehicular networks, including Enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB) and Ultra-Reliable and Low-Latency Communications (URLLC). This paper introduces an Explainable Deep Reinforcement Learning (XRL) framework for dynamic network slicing and resource allocation in vehicular networks, built upon a near-real-time RAN intelligent controller. By integrating a feature-based approach that leverages Shapley values and an attention mechanism, we interpret and refine the decisions of our reinforcementlearning agents, addressing key reliability challenges in vehicular communication systems. Simulation results demonstrate that our approach provides clear, real-time insights into the resource allocation process and achieves higher interpretability precision than a pure attention mechanism. Furthermore, the Quality of Service (QoS) satisfaction for URLLC services increased from 78.0% to 80.13%, while that for eMBB services improved from 71.44% to 73.21%.

  Large language models (LLMs) are powerful but static; they lack mechanisms to adapt their weights in response to new tasks, knowledge, or examples. We introduce Self-Adapting LLMs (SEAL), a framework that enables LLMs to self-adapt by generating their own finetuning data and update directives. Given a new input, the model produces a self-edit-a generation that may restructure the information in different ways, specify optimization hyperparameters, or invoke tools for data augmentation and gradient-based updates. Through supervised finetuning (SFT), these self-edits result in persistent weight updates, enabling lasting adaptation. To train the model to produce effective self-edits, we use a reinforcement learning loop with the downstream performance of the updated model as the reward signal. Unlike prior approaches that rely on separate adaptation modules or auxiliary networks, SEAL directly uses the model's own generation to control its adaptation process. Experiments on knowledge incorporation and few-shot generalization show that SEAL is a promising step toward language models capable of self-directed adaptation.

  Hyperparameter Optimization (HPO) is crucial to develop well-performing machine learning models. In order to ease prototyping and benchmarking of HPO methods, we propose carps, a benchmark framework for Comprehensive Automated Research Performance Studies allowing to evaluate N optimizers on M benchmark tasks. In this first release of carps, we focus on the four most important types of HPO task types: blackbox, multi-fidelity, multi-objective and multi-fidelity-multi-objective. With 3 336 tasks from 5 community benchmark collections and 28 variants of 9 optimizer families, we offer the biggest go-to library to date to evaluate and compare HPO methods. The carps framework relies on a purpose-built, lightweight interface, gluing together optimizers and benchmark tasks. It also features an analysis pipeline, facilitating the evaluation of optimizers on benchmarks. However, navigating a huge number of tasks while developing and comparing methods can be computationally infeasible. To address this, we obtain a subset of representative tasks by minimizing the star discrepancy of the subset, in the space spanned by the full set. As a result, we propose an initial subset of 10 to 30 diverse tasks for each task type, and include functionality to re-compute subsets as more benchmarks become available, enabling efficient evaluations. We also establish a first set of baseline results on these tasks as a measure for future comparisons. With carps (this https URL), we make an important step in the standardization of HPO evaluation.

  The Vision Language Model (VLM) excels in aligning vision and language representations, and prompt learning has emerged as a key technique for adapting such models to downstream tasks. However, the application of prompt learning with VLM in federated learning (FL) scenarios remains underexplored. This paper systematically investigates the behavioral differences between language prompt learning (LPT) and vision prompt learning (VPT) under data heterogeneity challenges, including label skew and domain shift. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the impact of various FL and prompt configurations, such as client scale, aggregation strategies, and prompt length, to assess the robustness of Federated Prompt Learning (FPL). Furthermore, we explore strategies for enhancing prompt learning in complex scenarios where label skew and domain shift coexist, including leveraging both prompt types when computational resources allow. Our findings offer practical insights into optimizing prompt learning in federated settings, contributing to the broader deployment of VLMs in privacy-preserving environments.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Fraud detection remains a critical task in high-stakes domains such as finance and e-commerce, where undetected fraudulent transactions can lead to significant economic losses. In this study, we systematically compare the performance of four supervised learning models - Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM), and a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) network - on a large-scale, highly imbalanced online transaction dataset. While ensemble methods such as Random Forest and LightGBM demonstrated superior performance in both overall and class-specific metrics, Logistic Regression offered a reliable and interpretable baseline. The GRU model showed strong recall for the minority fraud class, though at the cost of precision, highlighting a trade-off relevant for real-world deployment. Our evaluation emphasizes not only weighted averages but also per-class precision, recall, and F1-scores, providing a nuanced view of each model's effectiveness in detecting rare but consequential fraudulent activity. The findings underscore the importance of choosing models based on the specific risk tolerance and operational needs of fraud detection systems.

  Large language models (LLMs) have substantially advanced machine learning research, including natural language processing, computer vision, data mining, etc., yet they still exhibit critical limitations in explainability, reliability, adaptability, and extensibility. In this paper, we overview a promising learning paradigm, i.e., Modular Machine Learning (MML), as an essential approach toward new-generation LLMs capable of addressing these issues. We begin by systematically and comprehensively surveying the existing literature on modular machine learning, with a particular focus on modular data representation and modular models. Then, we propose a unified MML framework for LLMs, which decomposes the complex structure of LLMs into three interdependent components: modular representation, modular model, and modular reasoning. Specifically, the MML paradigm discussed in this article is able to: i) clarify the internal working mechanism of LLMs through the disentanglement of semantic components; ii) allow for flexible and task-adaptive model design; iii) enable an interpretable and logic-driven decision-making process. We further elaborate a feasible implementation of MML-based LLMs via leveraging advanced techniques such as disentangled representation learning, neural architecture search and neuro-symbolic learning. Last but not least, we critically identify the remaining key challenges, such as the integration of continuous neural and discrete symbolic processes, joint optimization, and computational scalability, present promising future research directions that deserve further exploration. Ultimately, we believe the integration of the MML with LLMs has the potential to bridge the gap between statistical (deep) learning and formal (logical) reasoning, thereby paving the way for robust, adaptable, and trustworthy AI systems across a wide range of real-world applications.

  _Mohammad Saif Nazir, Chayan Banerjee_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reinforcement learning (RL) often struggles with reward misalignment, where agents optimize given rewards but fail to exhibit the desired behaviors. This arises when the reward function incentivizes proxy behaviors misaligned with the true objective. While human-in-the-loop (HITL) methods can mitigate this issue, they also introduce biases, leading to inconsistent and subjective feedback that complicates learning. To address these challenges, we propose two key contributions. First, we extend the use of zero-shot, off-the-shelf large language models (LLMs) for reward shaping beyond natural language processing (NLP) to continuous control tasks. Using LLMs as direct feedback providers eliminates the need for surrogate models trained on human feedback, which often inherit biases from training data. Second, we introduce a hybrid framework (LLM-HFBF) that enables LLMs to identify and correct biases in human feedback while incorporating this feedback into the reward shaping process. The LLM-HFBF framework creates a more balanced and reliable system by addressing both the limitations of LLMs (e.g., lack of domain-specific knowledge) and human supervision (e.g., inherent biases). By enabling human feedback bias flagging and correction, our approach improves reinforcement learning performance and reduces reliance on potentially biased human feedback. Empirical experiments show that biased human feedback significantly reduces performance, with Average Episodic Reward dropping by nearly 94% compared to unbiased approaches. In contrast, LLM-based methods sustain performance at a similar level to unbiased feedback, even in challenging edge-case scenarios.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present heuristically optimal strategies expressed by deep learning agents playing a simple avoidance game. We analyse the learning and behaviour of two agents within a symmetrical grid world that must cross paths to reach a target destination without crashing into each other or straying off of the grid world in the wrong direction. The agent policy is determined by one neural network that is employed in both agents. Our findings indicate that the fully trained network exhibits behaviour similar to that of the game Hawks and Doves, in that one agent employs an aggressive strategy to reach the target while the other learns how to avoid the aggressive agent.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  A common belief is that intrinsically interpretable deep learning models ensure a correct, intuitive understanding of their behavior and offer greater robustness against accidental errors or intentional manipulation. However, these beliefs have not been comprehensively verified, and growing evidence casts doubt on them. In this paper, we highlight the risks related to overreliance and susceptibility to adversarial manipulation of these so-called "intrinsically (aka inherently) interpretable" models by design. We introduce two strategies for adversarial analysis with prototype manipulation and backdoor attacks against prototype-based networks, and discuss how concept bottleneck models defend against these attacks. Fooling the model's reasoning by exploiting its use of latent prototypes manifests the inherent uninterpretability of deep neural networks, leading to a false sense of security reinforced by a visual confirmation bias. The reported limitations of part-prototype networks put their trustworthiness and applicability into question, motivating further work on the robustness and alignment of (deep) interpretable models.

  Model merging enables powerful capabilities in neural networks without requiring additional training. In this paper, we introduce a novel perspective on model merging by leveraging the fundamental mechanisms of neural network representation. Our approach is motivated by the linear representation hypothesis, which states that neural networks encode information through linear combinations of feature vectors. We propose a method that superposes task-specific features from individual models into a merged model. Our approach specifically targets linear transformation matrices, which are crucial for feature activation and extraction in deep networks. By formulating the merging process as a linear system, we can preserve task-specific features from individual models and create merged models that effectively maintain multi-task capabilities compared to existing methods. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks and models demonstrate that our method outperforms existing techniques. Code is available atthis https URL.

  Training machine learning models on decentralized private data via federated learning (FL) poses two key challenges: communication efficiency and privacy protection. In this work, we address these challenges within the trusted aggregator model by introducing a novel approach called the Communication-Efficient and Privacy-Adaptable Mechanism (CEPAM), achieving both objectives simultaneously. In particular, CEPAM leverages the rejection-sampled universal quantizer (RSUQ), a construction of randomized vector quantizer whose resulting distortion is equivalent to a prescribed noise, such as Gaussian or Laplace noise, enabling joint differential privacy and compression. Our CEPAM provides the additional benefit of privacy adaptability, allowing clients and the server to customize privacy protection based on required accuracy and protection. We theoretically analyze the privacy guarantee of CEPAM and investigate the trade-offs among user privacy and accuracy of CEPAM through experimental evaluations. Moreover, we assess CEPAM's utility performance using MNIST dataset, demonstrating that CEPAM surpasses baseline models in terms of learning accuracy.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  While inorganic retrosynthesis planning is essential in the field of chemical science, the application of machine learning in this area has been notably less explored compared to organic retrosynthesis planning. In this paper, we propose Retrieval-Retro for inorganic retrosynthesis planning, which implicitly extracts the precursor information of reference materials that are retrieved from the knowledge base regarding domain expertise in the field. Specifically, instead of directly employing the precursor information of reference materials, we propose implicitly extracting it with various attention layers, which enables the model to learn novel synthesis recipes more effectively. Moreover, during retrieval, we consider the thermodynamic relationship between target material and precursors, which is essential domain expertise in identifying the most probable precursor set among various options. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of Retrieval-Retro in retrosynthesis planning, especially in discovering novel synthesis recipes, which is crucial for materials discovery.

  Large Language Models(LLMs) excel in general tasks but struggle in specialized domains like healthcare due to limited domain-specificthis http URLFine-Tuning(SFT) data construction for domain adaptation often relies on heuristic methods, such as GPT-4 annotation or manual data selection, with a data-centric focus on presumed diverse, high-quality datasets. However, these methods overlook the model's inherent knowledge distribution, introducing noise, redundancy, and irrelevant data, leading to a mismatch between the selected data and the model's learning task, resulting in suboptimal performance. To address this, we propose a two-stage model-centric data selection framework, Decomposed Difficulty Data Selection (3DS), which aligns data with the model's knowledge distribution for optimized adaptation. In Stage1, we apply Prompt-Driven Data Selection via Explicit Alignment, where the the model filters irrelevant or redundant data based on its internal knowledge. In Stage2, we perform Decomposed Difficulty Data Selection, where data selection is guided by our defined difficulty decomposition, using three metrics: Instruction Understanding, Response Confidence, and Response Correctness. Additionally, an attention-based importance weighting mechanism captures token importance for more accurate difficulty calibration. This two-stage approach ensures the selected data is not only aligned with the model's knowledge and preferences but also appropriately challenging for the model to learn, leading to more effective and targeted domain adaptation. In the case study of the medical domain, our extensive experiments on real-world healthcare datasets demonstrate the superiority of 3DS over exisiting methods in accuracy by over 5.29%.

  The proliferation of sensors brings an immense volume of spatio-temporal (ST) data in many domains, including monitoring, diagnostics, and prognostics applications. Data curation is a time-consuming process for a large volume of data, making it challenging and expensive to deploy data analytics platforms in new environments. Transfer learning (TL) mechanisms promise to mitigate data sparsity and model complexity by utilizing pre-trained models for a new task. Despite the triumph of TL in fields like computer vision and natural language processing, efforts on complex ST models for anomaly detection (AD) applications are limited. In this study, we present the potential of TL within the context of high-dimensional ST AD with a hybrid autoencoder architecture, incorporating convolutional, graph, and recurrent neural networks. Motivated by the need for improved model accuracy and robustness, particularly in scenarios with limited training data on systems with thousands of sensors, this research investigates the transferability of models trained on different sections of the Hadron Calorimeter of the Compact Muon Solenoid experiment at CERN. The key contributions of the study include exploring TL's potential and limitations within the context of encoder and decoder networks, revealing insights into model initialization and training configurations that enhance performance while substantially reducing trainable parameters and mitigating data contamination effects.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The rapid growth of graph-structured data necessitates partitioning and distributed storage across decentralized systems, driving the emergence of federated graph learning to collaboratively train Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) without compromising privacy. However, current methods exhibit limited performance when handling hypergraphs, which inherently represent complex high-order relationships beyond pairwise connections. Partitioning hypergraph structures across federated subsystems amplifies structural complexity, hindering high-order information mining and compromising local information integrity. To bridge the gap between hypergraph learning and federated systems, we develop FedHGL, a first-of-its-kind framework for federated hypergraph learning on disjoint and privacy-constrained hypergraph partitions. Beyond collaboratively training a comprehensive hypergraph neural network across multiple clients, FedHGL introduces a pre-propagation hyperedge completion mechanism to preserve high-order structural integrity within each client. This procedure leverages the federated central server to perform cross-client hypergraph convolution without exposing internal topological information, effectively mitigating the high-order information loss induced by subgraph partitioning. Furthermore, by incorporating two kinds of local differential privacy (LDP) mechanisms, we provide formal privacy guarantees for this process, ensuring that sensitive node features remain protected against inference attacks from potentially malicious servers or clients. Experimental results on seven real-world datasets confirm the effectiveness of our approach and demonstrate its performance advantages over traditional federated graph learning methods.

  Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have attracted substantial interest due to their exceptional performance on graph-based data. However, their robustness, especially on heterogeneous graphs, remains underexplored, particularly against adversarial attacks. This paper proposes HeteroKRLAttack, a targeted evasion black-box attack method for heterogeneous graphs. By integrating reinforcement learning with a Top-K algorithm to reduce the action space, our method efficiently identifies effective attack strategies to disrupt node classification tasks. We validate the effectiveness of HeteroKRLAttack through experiments on multiple heterogeneous graph datasets, showing significant reductions in classification accuracy compared to baseline methods. An ablation study underscores the critical role of the Top-K algorithm in enhancing attack performance. Our findings highlight potential vulnerabilities in current models and provide guidance for future defense strategies against adversarial attacks on heterogeneous graphs.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in machine learning, particularly in Natural Language Processing (NLP), have produced powerful models trained on vast datasets. However, these models risk leaking sensitive information, raising privacy concerns. In response, regulatory measures such as the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) have driven increasing interest in Machine Unlearning techniques, which enable models to selectively forget specific data entries. Early unlearning approaches primarily relied on pre-processing methods, while more recent research has shifted towards training-based solutions. Despite their effectiveness, a key limitation persists: most methods require access to original training data, which is often unavailable. Additionally, directly applying unlearning techniques bears the cost of undermining the model's expressive capabilities. To address these challenges, we introduce the Iterative Contrastive Unlearning (ICU) framework, which consists of three core components: A Knowledge Unlearning Induction module designed to target specific knowledge for removal using an unlearning loss; A Contrastive Learning Enhancement module to preserve the model's expressive capabilities against the pure unlearning goal; And an Iterative Unlearning Refinement module that dynamically adjusts the unlearning process through ongoing evaluation and updates. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our ICU method in unlearning sensitive information while maintaining the model's overall performance, offering a promising solution for privacy-conscious machine learning applications.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  EXPLOR is a novel framework that utilizes support-expanding, extrapolatory pseudo-labeling to improve prediction and uncertainty-based rejection on out-of-distribution (OOD) points. EXPLOR utilizes a diverse set of base models as pseudo-labelers on the expansive augmented data to improve OOD performance through multiple MLP heads (one per base model) with shared embedding trained with a novel per-head matching loss. Unlike prior methods that rely on modality-specific augmentations or assume access to OOD data, EXPLOR introduces extrapolatory pseudo-labeling on latent-space augmentations, enabling robust OOD generalization with any real-valued vector data. In contrast to prior modality-agnostic methods with neural backbones, EXPLOR is model-agnostic, working effectively with methods from simple tree-based models to complex OOD generalization models. We demonstrate that EXPLOR achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods on diverse datasets in single-source domain generalization settings.

  The Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment is a general-purpose detector for high-energy collision at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN. It employs an online data quality monitoring (DQM) system to promptly spot and diagnose particle data acquisition problems to avoid data quality loss. In this study, we present a semi-supervised spatio-temporal anomaly detection (AD) monitoring system for the physics particle reading channels of the Hadron Calorimeter (HCAL) of the CMS using three-dimensional digi-occupancy map data of the DQM. We propose the GraphSTAD system, which employs convolutional and graph neural networks to learn local spatial characteristics induced by particles traversing the detector and the global behavior owing to shared backend circuit connections and housing boxes of the channels, respectively. Recurrent neural networks capture the temporal evolution of the extracted spatial features. We validate the accuracy of the proposed AD system in capturing diverse channel fault types using the LHC collision data sets. The GraphSTAD system achieves production-level accuracy and is being integrated into the CMS core production system for real-time monitoring of the HCAL. We provide a quantitative performance comparison with alternative benchmark models to demonstrate the promising leverage of the presented system.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This work proposes a distance that combines Minkowski and Chebyshev distances and can be seen as an intermediary distance. This combination not only achieves efficient run times in neighbourhood iteration tasks in Z^2, but also obtains good accuracies when coupled with the k-Nearest Neighbours (k-NN) classifier. The proposed distance is approximately 1.3 times faster than Manhattan distance and 329.5 times faster than Euclidean distance in discrete neighbourhood iterations. An accuracy analysis of the k-NN classifier using a total of 33 datasets from the UCI repository, 15 distances and values assigned to k that vary from 1 to 200 is presented. In this experiment, the proposed distance obtained accuracies that were better than the average more often than its counterparts (in 26 cases out of 33), and also obtained the best accuracy more frequently (in 9 out of 33 cases).

  Partial agent failure becomes inevitable when systems scale up, making it crucial to identify the subset of agents whose compromise would most severely degrade overall performance. In this paper, we study this Vulnerable Agent Identification (VAI) problem in large-scale multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). We frame VAI as a Hierarchical Adversarial Decentralized Mean Field Control (HAD-MFC), where the upper level involves an NP-hard combinatorial task of selecting the most vulnerable agents, and the lower level learns worst-case adversarial policies for these agents using mean-field MARL. The two problems are coupled together, making HAD-MFC difficult to solve. To solve this, we first decouple the hierarchical process by Fenchel-Rockafellar transform, resulting a regularized mean-field Bellman operator for upper level that enables independent learning at each level, thus reducing computational complexity. We then reformulate the upper-level combinatorial problem as a MDP with dense rewards from our regularized mean-field Bellman operator, enabling us to sequentially identify the most vulnerable agents by greedy and RL algorithms. This decomposition provably preserves the optimal solution of the original HAD-MFC. Experiments show our method effectively identifies more vulnerable agents in large-scale MARL and the rule-based system, fooling system into worse failures, and learns a value function that reveals the vulnerability of each agent.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) holds substantial promise for intelligent decision-making in complex environments. However, it suffers from a coordination and scalability bottleneck as the number of agents increases. To address these issues, we propose the LLM-empowered expert demonstrations framework for multi-agent reinforcement learning (LEED). LEED consists of two components: a demonstration generation (DG) module and a policy optimization (PO) module. Specifically, the DG module leverages large language models to generate instructions for interacting with the environment, thereby producing high-quality demonstrations. The PO module adopts a decentralized training paradigm, where each agent utilizes the generated demonstrations to construct an expert policy loss, which is then integrated with its own policy loss. This enables each agent to effectively personalize and optimize its local policy based on both expert knowledge and individual experience. Experimental results show that LEED achieves superior sample efficiency, time efficiency, and robust scalability compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In recent years, diversity has emerged as a useful mechanism to enhance the efficiency of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). However, existing methods predominantly focus on designing policies based on individual agent characteristics, often neglecting the interplay and mutual influence among agents during policy formation. To address this gap, we propose Competitive Diversity through Constructive Conflict (CoDiCon), a novel approach that incorporates competitive incentives into cooperative scenarios to encourage policy exchange and foster strategic diversity among agents. Drawing inspiration from sociological research, which highlights the benefits of moderate competition and constructive conflict in group decision-making, we design an intrinsic reward mechanism using ranking features to introduce competitive motivations. A centralized intrinsic reward module generates and distributes varying reward values to agents, ensuring an effective balance between competition and cooperation. By optimizing the parameterized centralized reward module to maximize environmental rewards, we reformulate the constrained bilevel optimization problem to align with the original task objectives. We evaluate our algorithm against state-of-the-art methods in the SMAC and GRF environments. Experimental results demonstrate that CoDiCon achieves superior performance, with competitive intrinsic rewards effectively promoting diverse and adaptive strategies among cooperative agents.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  When should we encourage specialization in multi-agent systems versus train generalists that perform the entire task independently? We propose that specialization largely depends on task parallelizability: the potential for multiple agents to execute task components concurrently. Drawing inspiration from Amdahl's Law in distributed systems, we present a closed-form bound that predicts when specialization improves performance, depending only on task concurrency and team size. We validate our model on two standard MARL benchmarks that represent opposite regimes -- StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge (SMAC, unlimited concurrency) and Multi-Particle Environment (MPE, unit-capacity bottlenecks) -- and observe close alignment between the bound at each extreme and an empirical measure of specialization. Three follow-up experiments in Overcooked-AI demonstrate that the model works in environments with more complex spatial and resource bottlenecks that allow for a range of strategies. Beyond prediction, the bound also serves as a diagnostic tool, highlighting biases in MARL training algorithms that cause sub-optimal convergence to specialist strategies with larger state spaces.

  Soft growing robots, commonly referred to as vine robots, have demonstrated remarkable ability to interact safely and robustly with unstructured and dynamic environments. It is therefore natural to exploit contact with the environment for planning and design optimization tasks. Previous research has focused on planning under contact for passively deforming robots with pre-formed bends. However, adding active steering to these soft growing robots is necessary for successful navigation in more complex environments. To this end, we develop a unified modeling framework that integrates vine robot growth, bending, actuation, and obstacle contact. We extend the beam moment model to include the effects of actuation on kinematics under growth and then use these models to develop a fast parallel simulation framework. We validate our model and simulator with real robot experiments. To showcase the capabilities of our framework, we apply our model in a design optimization task to find designs for vine robots navigating through cluttered environments, identifying designs that minimize the number of required actuators by exploiting environmental contacts. We show the robustness of the designs to environmental and manufacturing uncertainties. Finally, we fabricate an optimized design and successfully deploy it in an obstacle-rich environment.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multivariate time-series anomaly detection, which is critical for identifying unexpected events, has been explored in the field of machine learning for several decades. However, directly applying these methods to data from forceful tool use tasks is challenging because streaming sensor data in the real world tends to be inherently noisy, exhibits non-stationary behavior, and varies across different tasks and tools. To address these challenges, we propose a method, AnoF-Diff, based on the diffusion model to extract force-torque features from time-series data and use force-torque features to detect anomalies. We compare our method with other state-of-the-art methods in terms of F1-score and Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUROC) on four forceful tool-use tasks, demonstrating that our method has better performance and is more robust to a noisy dataset. We also propose the method of parallel anomaly score evaluation based on one-step diffusion and demonstrate how our method can be used for online anomaly detection in several forceful tool use experiments.

  Future planetary exploration rovers must operate for extended durations on hybrid power inputs that combine steady radioisotope thermoelectric generator (RTG) output with variable solar photovoltaic (PV) availability. While energy-aware planning has been studied for aerial and underwater robots under battery limits, few works for ground rovers explicitly model power flow or enforce instantaneous power constraints. Classical terrain-aware planners emphasize slope or traversability, and trajectory optimization methods typically focus on geometric smoothness and dynamic feasibility, neglecting energy feasibility. We present an energy-constrained trajectory planning framework that explicitly integrates physics-based models of translational, rotational, and resistive power with baseline subsystem loads, under hybrid RTG-solar input. By incorporating both cumulative energy budgets and instantaneous power constraints into SE(2)-based polynomial trajectory optimization, the method ensures trajectories that are simultaneously smooth, dynamically feasible, and power-compliant. Simulation results on lunar-like terrain show that our planner generates trajectories with peak power within 0.55 percent of the prescribed limit, while existing methods exceed limits by over 17 percent. This demonstrates a principled and practical approach to energy-aware autonomy for long-duration planetary missions.

  The ultimate goal of embodied agents is to create collaborators that can interact with humans, not mere executors that passively follow instructions. This requires agents to communicate, coordinate, and adapt their actions based on human feedback. Recently, advances in VLAs have offered a path toward this goal. However, most current VLA-based embodied agents operate in a one-way mode: they receive an instruction and execute it without feedback. This approach fails in real-world scenarios where instructions are often ambiguous. In this paper, we address this problem with the Ask-to-Clarify framework. Our framework first resolves ambiguous instructions by asking questions in a multi-turn dialogue. Then it generates low-level actions end-to-end. Specifically, the Ask-to-Clarify framework consists of two components, one VLM for collaboration and one diffusion for action. We also introduce a connection module that generates conditions for the diffusion based on the output of the VLM. This module adjusts the observation by instructions to create reliable conditions. We train our framework with a two-stage knowledge-insulation strategy. First, we fine-tune the collaboration component using ambiguity-solving dialogue data to handle ambiguity. Then, we integrate the action component while freezing the collaboration one. This preserves the interaction abilities while fine-tuning the diffusion to generate actions. The training strategy guarantees our framework can first ask questions, then generate actions. During inference, a signal detector functions as a router that helps our framework switch between asking questions and taking actions. We evaluate the Ask-to-Clarify framework in 8 real-world tasks, where it outperforms existing state-of-the-art VLAs. The results suggest that our proposed framework, along with the training strategy, provides a path toward collaborative embodied agents.

  We propose a new formulation for the multi-robot task allocation problem that incorporates (a) complex precedence relationships between tasks, (b) efficient intra-task coordination, and (c) cooperation through the formation of robot coalitions. A task graph specifies the tasks and their relationships, and a set of reward functions models the effects of coalition size and preceding task performance. Maximizing task rewards is NP-hard; hence, we propose network flow-based algorithms to approximate solutions efficiently. A novel online algorithm performs iterative re-allocation, providing robustness to task failures and model inaccuracies to achieve higher performance than offline approaches. We comprehensively evaluate the algorithms in a testbed with random missions and reward functions and compare them to a mixed-integer solver and a greedy heuristic. Additionally, we validate the overall approach in an advanced simulator, modeling reward functions based on realistic physical phenomena and executing the tasks with realistic robot dynamics. Results establish efficacy in modeling complex missions and efficiency in generating high-fidelity task plans while leveraging task relationships.

  Reliable, drift-free global localization presents significant challenges yet remains crucial for autonomous navigation in large-scale dynamic environments. In this paper, we introduce a tightly-coupled Semantic-LiDAR-Inertial-Wheel Odometry fusion framework, which is specifically designed to provide high-precision state estimation and robust localization in large-scale dynamic environments. Our framework leverages an efficient semantic-voxel map representation and employs an improved scan matching algorithm, which utilizes global semantic information to significantly reduce long-term trajectory drift. Furthermore, it seamlessly fuses data from LiDAR, IMU, and wheel odometry using a tightly-coupled multi-sensor fusion Iterative Error-State Kalman Filter (iESKF). This ensures reliable localization without experiencing abnormal drift. Moreover, to tackle the challenges posed by terrain variations and dynamic movements, we introduce a 3D adaptive scaling strategy that allows for flexible adjustments to wheel odometry measurement weights, thereby enhancing localization precision. This study presents extensive real-world experiments conducted in a one-million-square-meter automated port, encompassing 3,575 hours of operational data from 35 Intelligent Guided Vehicles (IGVs). The results consistently demonstrate that our system outperforms state-of-the-art LiDAR-based localization methods in large-scale dynamic environments, highlighting the framework's reliability and practical value.

Current state-of-the-art approaches rely on highly engineered, task-specific controllers, which require extensive manual tuning for each new scenario. In contrast, recent advances in large-scale pretrained models have shown remarkable adaptability across tasks and embodiments in domains such as manipulation and navigation, but their applicability to heavy construction machinery remains largely unexplored. In this work, we introduce ExT, a unified open-source framework for large-scale demonstration collection, pretraining, and fine-tuning of multitask excavation policies. ExT policies are first trained on large-scale demonstrations collected from a mix of experts, then fine-tuned either with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or reinforcement learning fine-tuning (RLFT) to specialize to new tasks or operating conditions. Through both simulation and real-world experiments, we show that pretrained ExT policies can execute complete excavation cycles with centimeter-level accuracy, successfully transferring from simulation to real machine with performance comparable to specialized single-task controllers. Furthermore, in simulation, we demonstrate that ExT's fine-tuning pipelines allow rapid adaptation to new tasks, out-of-distribution conditions, and machine configurations, while maintaining strong performance on previously learned tasks. These results highlight the potential of ExT to serve as a foundation for scalable and generalizable autonomous excavation.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Mobile manipulation requires the coordinated control of a mobile base and a robotic arm while simultaneously perceiving both global scene context and fine-grained object details. Existing single-view approaches often fail in unstructured environments due to limited fields of view, exploration, and generalization abilities. Moreover, classical controllers, although stable, struggle with efficiency and manipulability near singularities. To address these challenges, we propose M4Diffuser, a hybrid framework that integrates a Multi-View Diffusion Policy with a novel Reduced and Manipulability-aware QP (ReM-QP) controller for mobile manipulation. The diffusion policy leverages proprioceptive states and complementary camera perspectives with both close-range object details and global scene context to generate task-relevant end-effector goals in the world frame. These high-level goals are then executed by the ReM-QP controller, which eliminates slack variables for computational efficiency and incorporates manipulability-aware preferences for robustness near singularities. Comprehensive experiments in simulation and real-world environments show that M4Diffuser achieves 7 to 56 percent higher success rates and reduces collisions by 3 to 31 percent over baselines. Our approach demonstrates robust performance for smooth whole-body coordination, and strong generalization to unseen tasks, paving the way for reliable mobile manipulation in unstructured environments.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Quadrotor navigation in unknown environments is critical for practical missions such as search-and-rescue. Solving it requires addressing three key challenges: the non-convexity of free space due to obstacles, quadrotor-specific dynamics and objectives, and the need for exploration of unknown regions to find a path to the goal. Recently, the Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) method has emerged as a promising solution that solves the first two challenges. By leveraging sampling-based optimization, it can effectively handle non-convex free space while directly optimizing over the full quadrotor dynamics, enabling the inclusion of quadrotor-specific costs such as energy consumption. However, its performance in unknown environments is limited, as it lacks the ability to explore unknown regions when blocked by large obstacles. To solve this issue, we introduce Perception-Aware MPPI (PA-MPPI). Here, perception-awareness is defined as adapting the trajectory online based on perception objectives. Specifically, when the goal is occluded, PA-MPPI's perception cost biases trajectories that can perceive unknown regions. This expands the mapped traversable space and increases the likelihood of finding alternative paths to the goal. Through hardware experiments, we demonstrate that PA-MPPI, running at 50 Hz with our efficient perception and mapping module, performs up to 100% better than the baseline in our challenging settings where the state-of-the-art MPPI fails. In addition, we demonstrate that PA-MPPI can be used as a safe and robust action policy for navigation foundation models, which often provide goal poses that are not directly reachable.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We propose a neuromorphic tactile sensing framework for robotic texture classification that is inspired by human exploratory strategies. Our system utilizes the NeuroTac sensor to capture neuromorphic tactile data during a series of exploratory motions. We first tested six distinct motions for texture classification under fixed environment: sliding, rotating, tapping, as well as the combined motions: sliding+rotating, tapping+rotating, and tapping+sliding. We chose sliding and sliding+rotating as the best motions based on final accuracy and the sample timing length needed to reach converged accuracy. In the second experiment designed to simulate complex real-world conditions, these two motions were further evaluated under varying contact depth and speeds. Under these conditions, our framework attained the highest accuracy of 87.33\% with sliding+rotating while maintaining an extremely low power consumption of only 8.04 mW. These results suggest that the sliding+rotating motion is the optimal exploratory strategy for neuromorphic tactile sensing deployment in texture classification tasks and holds significant promise for enhancing robotic environmental interaction.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Efficient coordination of multiple robots for coverage of large, unknown environments is a significant challenge that involves minimizing the total coverage path length while reducing inter-robot conflicts. In this paper, we introduce a Multi-robot Connectivity-Aware Planner (Multi-CAP), a hierarchical coverage path planning algorithm that facilitates multi-robot coordination through a novel connectivity-aware approach. The algorithm constructs and dynamically maintains an adjacency graph that represents the environment as a set of connected subareas. Critically, we make the assumption that the environment, while unknown, is bounded. This allows for incremental refinement of the adjacency graph online to ensure its structure represents the physical layout of the space, both in observed and unobserved areas of the map as robots explore the environment. We frame the task of assigning subareas to robots as a Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP), a well-studied problem for finding optimal routes for a fleet of vehicles. This is used to compute disjoint tours that minimize redundant travel, assigning each robot a unique, non-conflicting set of subareas. Each robot then executes its assigned tour, independently adapting its coverage strategy within each subarea to minimize path length based on real-time sensor observations of the subarea. We demonstrate through simulations and multi-robot hardware experiments that Multi-CAP significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in key metrics, including coverage time, total path length, and path overlap ratio. Ablation studies further validate the critical role of our connectivity-aware graph and the global tour planner in achieving these performance gains.

  Despite recent advances in dexterous manipulations, the manipulation of articulated objects and generalization across different categories remain significant challenges. To address these issues, we introduce DART, a novel framework that enhances a diffusion-based policy with affordance learning and linear temporal logic (LTL) representations to improve the learning efficiency and generalizability of articulated dexterous manipulation. Specifically, DART leverages LTL to understand task semantics and affordance learning to identify optimal interaction points. The {diffusion-based policy} then generalizes these interactions across various categories. Additionally, we exploit an optimization method based on interaction data to refine actions, overcoming the limitations of traditional diffusion policies that typically rely on offline reinforcement learning or learning from demonstrations. Experimental results demonstrate that DART outperforms most existing methods in manipulation ability, generalization performance, transfer reasoning, and robustness.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper presents a CAD-driven co-design framework for optimizing jet-powered aerial humanoid robots to execute dynamically constrained trajectories. Starting from the iRonCub-Mk3 model, a Design of Experiments (DoE) approach is used to generate 5,000 geometrically varied and mechanically feasible designs by modifying limb dimensions, jet interface geometry (e.g., angle and offset), and overall mass distribution. Each model is constructed through CAD assemblies to ensure structural validity and compatibility with simulation tools. To reduce computational cost and enable parameter sensitivity analysis, the models are clustered using K-means, with representative centroids selected for evaluation. A minimum-jerk trajectory is used to assess flight performance, providing position and velocity references for a momentum-based linearized Model Predictive Control (MPC) strategy. A multi-objective optimization is then conducted using the NSGA-II algorithm, jointly exploring the space of design centroids and MPC gain parameters. The objectives are to minimize trajectory tracking error and mechanical energy expenditure. The framework outputs a set of flight-ready humanoid configurations with validated control parameters, offering a structured method for selecting and implementing feasible aerial humanoid designs.

  Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) mark a major shift in robot learning. They replace specialized architectures and task-tailored components of expert policies with large-scale data collection and setup-specific fine-tuning. In this machine learning-focused workflow that is centered around models and scalable training, traditional robotics software frameworks become a bottleneck, while robot simulations offer only limited support for transitioning from and to real-world experiments. In this work, we close this gap by introducing Robot Control Stack (RCS), a lean ecosystem designed from the ground up to support research in robot learning with large-scale generalist policies. At its core, RCS features a modular and easily extensible layered architecture with a unified interface for simulated and physical robots, facilitating sim-to-real transfer. Despite its minimal footprint and dependencies, it offers a complete feature set, enabling both real-world experiments and large-scale training in simulation. Our contribution is twofold: First, we introduce the architecture of RCS and explain its design principles. Second, we evaluate its usability and performance along the development cycle of VLA and RL policies. Our experiments also provide an extensive evaluation of Octo, OpenVLA, and Pi Zero on multiple robots and shed light on how simulation data can improve real-world policy performance.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Autonomous mobile robots increasingly rely on LiDAR-IMU odometry for navigation and mapping, yet horizontally mounted LiDARs such as the MID360 capture few near-ground returns, limiting terrain awareness and degrading performance in feature-scarce environments. Prior solutions - static tilt, active rotation, or high-density sensors - either sacrifice horizontal perception or incur added actuators, cost, and power. We introduce PERAL, a perception-aware motion control framework for spherical robots that achieves passive LiDAR excitation without dedicated hardware. By modeling the coupling between internal differential-drive actuation and sensor attitude, PERAL superimposes bounded, non-periodic oscillations onto nominal goal- or trajectory-tracking commands, enriching vertical scan diversity while preserving navigation accuracy. Implemented on a compact spherical robot, PERAL is validated across laboratory, corridor, and tactical environments. Experiments demonstrate up to 96 percent map completeness, a 27 percent reduction in trajectory tracking error, and robust near-ground human detection, all at lower weight, power, and cost compared with static tilt, active rotation, and fixed horizontal baselines. The design and code will be open-sourced upon acceptance.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this work, we present CollabVLA, a self-reflective vision-language-action framework that transforms a standard visuomotor policy into a collaborative assistant. CollabVLA tackles key limitations of prior VLAs, including domain overfitting, non-interpretable reasoning, and the high latency of auxiliary generative models, by integrating VLM-based reflective reasoning with diffusion-based action generation under a mixture-of-experts design. Through a two-stage training recipe of action grounding and reflection tuning, it supports explicit self-reflection and proactively solicits human guidance when confronted with uncertainty or repeated failure. It cuts normalized Time by ~2x and Dream counts by ~4x vs. generative agents, achieving higher success rates, improved interpretability, and balanced low latency compared with existing methods. This work takes a pioneering step toward shifting VLAs from opaque controllers to genuinely assistive agents capable of reasoning, acting, and collaborating with humans.

  Reinforcement Learning (RL) robot controllers usually aggregate many task objectives into one scalar reward. While large-scale proximal policy optimisation (PPO) has enabled impressive results such as robust robot locomotion in the real world, many tasks still require careful reward tuning and are brittle to local optima. Tuning cost and sub-optimality grow with the number of objectives, limiting scalability. Modelling reward vectors and their trade-offs can address these issues; however, multi-objective methods remain underused in RL for robotics because of computational cost and optimisation difficulty. In this work, we investigate the conflict between gradient contributions for each objective that emerge from scalarising the task objectives. In particular, we explicitly address the conflict between task-based rewards and terms that regularise the policy towards realistic behaviour. We propose GCR-PPO, a modification to actor-critic optimisation that decomposes the actor update into objective-wise gradients using a multi-headed critic and resolves conflicts based on the objective priority. Our methodology, GCR-PPO, is evaluated on the well-known IsaacLab manipulation and locomotion benchmarks and additional multi-objective modifications on two related tasks. We show superior scalability compared to parallel PPO (p = 0.04), without significant computational overhead. We also show higher performance with more conflicting tasks. GCR-PPO improves on large-scale PPO with an average improvement of 9.5%, with high-conflict tasks observing a greater improvement. The code is available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Manipulation in confined and cluttered environments remains a significant challenge due to partial observability and complex configuration spaces. Effective manipulation in such environments requires an intelligent exploration strategy to safely understand the scene and search the target. In this paper, we propose COMPASS, a multi-stage exploration and manipulation framework featuring a manipulation-aware sampling-based planner. First, we reduce collision risks with a near-field awareness scan to build a local collision map. Additionally, we employ a multi-objective utility function to find viewpoints that are both informative and conducive to subsequent manipulation. Moreover, we perform a constrained manipulation optimization strategy to generate manipulation poses that respect obstacle constraints. To systematically evaluate method's performance under these difficulties, we propose a benchmark of confined-space exploration and manipulation containing four level challenging scenarios. Compared to exploration methods designed for other robots and only considering information gain, our framework increases manipulation success rate by 24.25% in simulations. Real-world experiments demonstrate our method's capability for active sensing and manipulation in confined environments.

  _Fangguo Zhao, Xin Guan, Shuo Li_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  While model-based controllers have demonstrated remarkable performance in autonomous drone racing, their performance is often constrained by the reliance on pre-computed reference trajectories. Conventional approaches, such as trajectory tracking, demand a dynamically feasible, full-state reference, whereas contouring control relaxes this requirement to a geometric path but still necessitates a reference. Recent advancements in reinforcement learning (RL) have revealed that many model-based controllers optimize surrogate objectives, such as trajectory tracking, rather than the primary racing goal of directly maximizing progress through gates. Inspired by these findings, this work introduces a reference-free method for time-optimal racing by incorporating this gate progress objective, derived from RL reward shaping, directly into the Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) formulation. The sampling-based nature of MPPI makes it uniquely capable of optimizing the discontinuous and non-differentiable objective in real-time. We also establish a unified framework that leverages MPPI to systematically and fairly compare three distinct objective functions with a consistent dynamics model and parameter set: classical trajectory tracking, contouring control, and the proposed gate progress objective. We compare the performance of these three objectives when solved via both MPPI and a traditional gradient-based solver. Our results demonstrate that the proposed reference-free approach achieves competitive racing performance, rivaling or exceeding reference-based methods. Videos are available atthis https URL

To address these limitations, we introduce a tactile robot learning system with both hardware and algorithm innovations. We present exUMI, an extensible data collection device that enhances the vanilla UMI with robust proprioception (via AR MoCap and rotary encoder), modular visuo-tactile sensing, and automated calibration, achieving 100% data usability. Building on an efficient collection of over 1 M tactile frames, we propose Tactile Prediction Pretraining (TPP), a representation learning framework through action-aware temporal tactile prediction, capturing contact dynamics and mitigating tactile sparsity. Real-world experiments show that TPP outperforms traditional tactile imitation learning.

  The emerging field of Vision-Language-Action (VLA) for humanoid robots faces several fundamental challenges, including the high cost of data acquisition, the lack of a standardized benchmark, and the significant gap between simulation and the real world. To overcome these obstacles, we propose RealMirror, a comprehensive, open-source embodied AI VLA platform. RealMirror builds an efficient, low-cost data collection, model training, and inference system that enables end-to-end VLA research without requiring a real robot. To facilitate model evolution and fair comparison, we also introduce a dedicated VLA benchmark for humanoid robots, featuring multiple scenarios, extensive trajectories, and various VLA models. Furthermore, by integrating generative models and 3D Gaussian Splatting to reconstruct realistic environments and robot models, we successfully demonstrate zero-shot Sim2Real transfer, where models trained exclusively on simulation data can perform tasks on a real robot seamlessly, without any fine-tuning. In conclusion, with the unification of these critical components, RealMirror provides a robust framework that significantly accelerates the development of VLA models for humanoid robots.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Dense 3D convolutions provide high accuracy for perception but are too computationally expensive for real-time robotic systems. Existing tri-plane methods rely on 2D image features with interpolation, point-wise queries, and implicit MLPs, which makes them computationally heavy and unsuitable for embedded 3D inference. As an alternative, we propose a novel interpolation-free tri-plane lifting and volumetric fusion framework, that directly projects 3D voxels into plane features and reconstructs a feature volume through broadcast and summation. This shifts nonlinearity to 2D convolutions, reducing complexity while remaining fully parallelizable. To capture global context, we add a low-resolution volumetric branch fused with the lifted features through a lightweight integration layer, yielding a design that is both efficient and end-to-end GPU-accelerated. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we conduct experiments on classification, completion, segmentation, and detection, and we map the trade-off between efficiency and accuracy across tasks. Results show that classification and completion retain or improve accuracy, while segmentation and detection trade modest drops in accuracy for significant computational savings. On-device benchmarks on an NVIDIA Jetson Orin nano confirm robust real-time throughput, demonstrating the suitability of the approach for embedded robotic perception.

  Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) representation offers a metric-scaled planar workspace, facilitating the simplification of 6-DoF ego-motion to a more robust 3-DoF model for monocular visual odometry (MVO) in intelligent transportation systems. However, existing BEV methods suffer from sparse supervision signals and information loss during perspective-to-BEV projection. We present BEV-ODOM2, an enhanced framework addressing both limitations without additional annotations. Our approach introduces: (1) dense BEV optical flow supervision constructed from 3-DoF pose ground truth for pixel-level guidance; (2) PV-BEV fusion that computes correlation volumes before projection to preserve 6-DoF motion cues while maintaining scale consistency. The framework employs three supervision levels derived solely from pose data: dense BEV flow, 5-DoF for the PV branch, and final 3-DoF output. Enhanced rotation sampling further balances diverse motion patterns in training. Extensive evaluation on KITTI, NCLT, Oxford, and our newly collected ZJH-VO multi-scale dataset demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, achieving 40 improvement in RTE compared to previous BEV methods. The ZJH-VO dataset, covering diverse ground vehicle scenarios from underground parking to outdoor plazas, is publicly available to facilitate future research.

  Vision-language-action policies learn manipulation skills across tasks, environments and embodiments through large-scale pre-training. However, their ability to generalize to novel robot configurations remains limited. Most approaches emphasize model size, dataset scale and diversity while paying less attention to the design of action spaces. This leads to the configuration generalization problem, which requires costly adaptation. We address this challenge by formulating cross-embodiment pre-training as designing policies equivariant to embodiment configuration transformations. Building on this principle, we propose a framework that (i) establishes a embodiment equivariance theory for action space and policy design, (ii) introduces an action decoder that enforces configuration equivariance, and (iii) incorporates a geometry-aware network architecture to enhance embodiment-agnostic spatial reasoning. Extensive experiments in both simulation and real-world settings demonstrate that our approach improves pre-training effectiveness and enables efficient fine-tuning on novel robot embodiments.

  This study presents a system integration approach for planning schedules, sequences, tasks, and motions for reconfigurable robots to automatically disassemble constrained structures in a non-destructive manner. Such systems must adapt their configuration and coordination to the target structure, but the large and complex search space makes them prone to local optima. To address this, we integrate multiple robot arms equipped with different types of tools, together with a rotary stage, into a reconfigurable setup. This flexible system is based on a hierarchical optimization method that generates plans meeting multiple preferred conditions under mandatory requirements within a realistic timeframe. The approach employs two many-objective genetic algorithms for sequence and task planning with motion evaluations, followed by constraint programming for scheduling. Because sequence planning has a much larger search space, we introduce a chromosome initialization method tailored to constrained structures to mitigate the risk of local optima. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively solves complex problems in reconfigurable robotic disassembly.

  This paper addresses the challenges of automating vibratory sieve shaker operations in a materials laboratory, focusing on three critical tasks: 1) dual-arm lid manipulation in 3 cm clearance spaces, 2) bimanual handover in overlapping workspaces, and 3) obstructed powder sample container delivery with orientation constraints. These tasks present significant challenges, including inefficient sampling in narrow passages, the need for smooth trajectories to prevent spillage, and suboptimal paths generated by conventional methods. To overcome these challenges, we propose a hierarchical planning framework combining Prior-Guided Path Planning and Multi-Step Trajectory Optimization. The former uses a finite Gaussian mixture model to improve sampling efficiency in narrow passages, while the latter refines paths by shortening, simplifying, imposing joint constraints, and B-spline smoothing. Experimental results demonstrate the framework's effectiveness: planning time is reduced by up to 80.4%, and waypoints are decreased by 89.4%. Furthermore, the system completes the full vibratory sieve shaker operation workflow in a physical experiment, validating its practical applicability for complex laboratory automation.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Strawberries naturally grow in clusters, interwoven with leaves, stems, and other fruits, which frequently leads to occlusion. This inherent growth habit presents a significant challenge for robotic picking, as traditional percept-plan-control systems struggle to reach fruits amid the clutter. Effectively picking an occluded strawberry demands dexterous manipulation to carefully bypass or gently move the surrounding soft objects and precisely access the ideal picking point located at the stem just above the calyx. To address this challenge, we introduce a strawberry-picking robotic system that learns from human demonstrations. Our system features a 4-DoF SCARA arm paired with a human teleoperation interface for efficient data collection and leverages an End Pose Assisted Action Chunking Transformer (ACT) to develop a fine-grained visuomotor picking policy. Experiments under various occlusion scenarios demonstrate that our modified approach significantly outperforms the direct implementation of ACT, underscoring its potential for practical application in occluded strawberry picking.

  Event-based localization research and datasets are a rapidly growing area of interest, with a tenfold increase in the cumulative total number of published papers on this topic over the past 10 years. Whilst the rapid expansion in the field is exciting, it brings with it an associated challenge: a growth in the variety of required code and package dependencies as well as data formats, making comparisons difficult and cumbersome for researchers to implement reliably. To address this challenge, we present Event-LAB: a new and unified framework for running several event-based localization methodologies across multiple datasets. Event-LAB is implemented using the Pixi package and dependency manager, that enables a single command-line installation and invocation for combinations of localization methods and datasets. To demonstrate the capabilities of the framework, we implement two common event-based localization pipelines: Visual Place Recognition (VPR) and Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM). We demonstrate the ability of the framework to systematically visualize and analyze the results of multiple methods and datasets, revealing key insights such as the association of parameters that control event collection counts and window sizes for frame generation to large variations in performance. The results and analysis demonstrate the importance of fairly comparing methodologies with consistent event image generation parameters. Our Event-LAB framework provides this ability for the research community, by contributing a streamlined workflow for easily setting up multiple conditions.

  Recent advances in soft robotic hands and tactile sensing have enabled both to perform an increasing number of complex tasks with the aid of machine learning. In particular, we presented the GelSight Baby Fin Ray in our previous work, which integrates a camera with a soft, compliant Fin Ray structure. Camera-based tactile sensing gives the GelSight Baby Fin Ray the ability to capture rich contact information like forces, object geometries, and textures. Moreover, our previous work showed that the GelSight Baby Fin Ray can dig through clutter, and classify in-shell nuts. To further examine the potential of the GelSight Baby Fin Ray, we leverage learning to distinguish nut-in-shell textures and to perform force and position estimation. We implement ablation studies with popular neural network structures, including ResNet50, GoogLeNet, and 3- and 5-layer convolutional neural network (CNN) structures. We conclude that machine learning is a promising technique to extract useful information from high-resolution tactile images and empower soft robotics to better understand and interact with the environments.

  _Abhiroop Ajith, Constantinos Chamzas_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Learning abstractions directly from data is a core challenge in robotics. Humans naturally operate at an abstract level, reasoning over high-level subgoals while delegating execution to low-level motor skills -- an ability that enables efficient problem solving in complex environments. In robotics, abstractions and hierarchical reasoning have long been central to planning, yet they are typically hand-engineered, demanding significant human effort and limiting scalability. Automating the discovery of useful abstractions directly from visual data would make planning frameworks more scalable and more applicable to real-world robotic domains. In this work, we focus on rearrangement tasks where the state is represented with raw images, and propose a method to induce discrete, graph-structured abstractions by combining structural constraints with an attention-guided visual distance. Our approach leverages the inherent bipartite structure of rearrangement problems, integrating structural constraints and visual embeddings into a unified framework. This enables the autonomous discovery of abstractions from vision alone, which can subsequently support high-level planning. We evaluate our method on two rearrangement tasks in simulation and show that it consistently identifies meaningful abstractions that facilitate effective planning and outperform existing approaches.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for coordinating swarms of agents in complex decision-making, yet major challenges remain. In competitive settings such as pursuer-evader tasks, simultaneous adaptation can destabilize training; non-kinetic countermeasures often fail under adverse conditions; and policies trained in one configuration rarely generalize to environments with a different number of agents. To address these issues, we propose the Local-Canonicalization Equivariant Graph Neural Networks (LEGO) framework, which integrates seamlessly with popular MARL algorithms such as MAPPO. LEGO employs graph neural networks to capture permutation equivariance and generalization to different agent numbers, canonicalization to enforce E(n)-equivariance, and heterogeneous representations to encode role-specific inductive biases. Experiments on cooperative and competitive swarm benchmarks show that LEGO outperforms strong baselines and improves generalization. In real-world experiments, LEGO demonstrates robustness to varying team sizes and agent failure.

  _Dario Tscholl, Yashwanth Nakka, Brian Gunter_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present a perception-driven safety filter that converts each 3D Gaussian Splat (3DGS) into a closed-form forward collision cone, which in turn yields a first-order control barrier function (CBF) embedded within a quadratic program (QP). By exploiting the analytic geometry of splats, our formulation provides a continuous, closed-form representation of collision constraints that is both simple and computationally efficient. Unlike distance-based CBFs, which tend to activate reactively only when an obstacle is already close, our collision-cone CBF activates proactively, allowing the robot to adjust earlier and thereby produce smoother and safer avoidance maneuvers at lower computational cost. We validate the method on a large synthetic scene with approximately 170k splats, where our filter reduces planning time by a factor of 3 and significantly decreased trajectory jerk compared to a state-of-the-art 3DGS planner, while maintaining the same level of safety. The approach is entirely analytic, requires no high-order CBF extensions (HOCBFs), and generalizes naturally to robots with physical extent through a principled Minkowski-sum inflation of the splats. These properties make the method broadly applicable to real-time navigation in cluttered, perception-derived extreme environments, including space robotics and satellite systems.

  _Artem Lykov, Oleg Kobzarev, Dzmitry Tsetserukou_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present GestOS, a gesture-based operating system for high-level control of heterogeneous robot teams. Unlike prior systems that map gestures to fixed commands or single-agent actions, GestOS interprets hand gestures semantically and dynamically distributes tasks across multiple robots based on their capabilities, current state, and supported instruction sets. The system combines lightweight visual perception with large language model (LLM) reasoning: hand poses are converted into structured textual descriptions, which the LLM uses to infer intent and generate robot-specific commands. A robot selection module ensures that each gesture-triggered task is matched to the most suitable agent in real time. This architecture enables context-aware, adaptive control without requiring explicit user specification of targets or commands. By advancing gesture interaction from recognition to intelligent orchestration, GestOS supports scalable, flexible, and user-friendly collaboration with robotic systems in dynamic environments.

  _Yuhong Lu_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Unified multi-modal encoders that bind vision, audio, and other sensors into a shared embedding space are attractive building blocks for robot perception and decision-making. However, on-robot deployment exposes the vision branch to adversarial and natural corruptions, making robustness a prerequisite for safety. Prior defenses typically align clean and adversarial features within CLIP-style encoders and overlook broader cross-modal correspondence, yielding modest gains and often degrading zero-shot transfer. We introduce RLBind, a two-stage adversarial-invariant cross-modal alignment framework for robust unified embeddings. Stage 1 performs unsupervised fine-tuning on clean-adversarial pairs to harden the visual encoder. Stage 2 leverages cross-modal correspondence by minimizing the discrepancy between clean/adversarial features and a text anchor, while enforcing class-wise distributional alignment across modalities. Extensive experiments on Image, Audio, Thermal, and Video data show that RLBind consistently outperforms the LanguageBind backbone and standard fine-tuning baselines in both clean accuracy and norm-bounded adversarial robustness. By improving resilience without sacrificing generalization, RLBind provides a practical path toward safer multi-sensor perception stacks for embodied robots in navigation, manipulation, and other autonomy settings.

  _Seoyeon Choi, Kanghyun Ryu, Jonghoon Ock, Negar Mehr_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) provides a powerful framework for learning coordination in multi-agent systems. However, applying MARL to robotics still remains challenging due to high-dimensional continuous joint action spaces, complex reward design, and non-stationary transitions inherent to decentralized settings. On the other hand, humans learn complex coordination through staged curricula, where long-horizon behaviors are progressively built upon simpler skills. Motivated by this, we propose CRAFT: Coaching Reinforcement learning Autonomously using Foundation models for multi-robot coordination Tasks, a framework that leverages the reasoning capabilities of foundation models to act as a "coach" for multi-robot coordination. CRAFT automatically decomposes long-horizon coordination tasks into sequences of subtasks using the planning capability of Large Language Models (LLMs). In what follows, CRAFT trains each subtask using reward functions generated by LLM, and refines them through a Vision Language Model (VLM)-guided reward-refinement loop. We evaluate CRAFT on multi-quadruped navigation and bimanual manipulation tasks, demonstrating its capability to learn complex coordination behaviors. In addition, we validate the multi-quadruped navigation policy in real hardware experiments.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce DreamControl, a novel methodology for learning autonomous whole-body humanoid skills. DreamControl leverages the strengths of diffusion models and Reinforcement Learning (RL): our core innovation is the use of a diffusion prior trained on human motion data, which subsequently guides an RL policy in simulation to complete specific tasks of interest (e.g., opening a drawer or picking up an object). We demonstrate that this human motion-informed prior allows RL to discover solutions unattainable by direct RL, and that diffusion models inherently promote natural looking motions, aiding in sim-to-real transfer. We validate DreamControl's effectiveness on a Unitree G1 robot across a diverse set of challenging tasks involving simultaneous lower and upper body control and object interaction.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce LeVR, a modular software framework designed to bridge two critical gaps in robotic imitation learning. First, it provides robust and intuitive virtual reality (VR) teleoperation for data collection using robot arms paired with dexterous hands, addressing a common limitation in existing systems. Second, it natively integrates with the powerful LeRobot imitation learning (IL) framework, enabling the use of VR-based teleoperation data and streamlining the demonstration collection process. To demonstrate LeVR, we release LeFranX, an open-source implementation for the Franka FER arm and RobotEra XHand, two widely used research platforms. LeFranX delivers a seamless, end-to-end workflow from data collection to real-world policy deployment. We validate our system by collecting a public dataset of 100 expert demonstrations and use it to successfully fine-tune state-of-the-art visuomotor policies. We provide our open-source framework, implementation, and dataset to accelerate IL research for the robotics community.

  _Bikram Pandit, Aayam Kumar Shrestha, Alan Fern_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We study decentralized cooperative transport using teams of N-quadruped robots with arm that must pinch, lift, and move ungraspable objects through physical contact alone. Unlike prior work that relies on rigid mechanical coupling between robots and objects, we address the more challenging setting where mechanically independent robots must coordinate through contact forces alone without any communication or centralized control. To this end, we employ a hierarchical policy architecture that separates base locomotion from arm control, and propose a constellation reward formulation that unifies position and orientation tracking to enforce rigid contact behavior. The key insight is encouraging robots to behave as if rigidly connected to the object through careful reward design and training curriculum rather than explicit mechanical constraints. Our approach enables coordination through shared policy parameters and implicit synchronization cues - scaling to arbitrary team sizes without retraining. We show extensive simulation experiments to demonstrate robust transport across 2-10 robots on diverse object geometries and masses, along with sim2real transfer results on lightweight objects.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in end-to-end autonomous driving leverage multi-view images to construct BEV representations for motion planning. In motion planning, autonomous vehicles need considering both hard constraints imposed by geometrically occupied obstacles (e.g., vehicles, pedestrians) and soft, rule-based semantics with no explicit geometry (e.g., lane boundaries, traffic priors). However, existing end-to-end frameworks typically rely on BEV features learned in an implicit manner, lacking explicit modeling of risk and guidance priors for safe and interpretable planning. To address this, we propose FlowDrive, a novel framework that introduces physically interpretable energy-based flow fields-including risk potential and lane attraction fields-to encode semantic priors and safety cues into the BEV space. These flow-aware features enable adaptive refinement of anchor trajectories and serve as interpretable guidance for trajectory generation. Moreover, FlowDrive decouples motion intent prediction from trajectory denoising via a conditional diffusion planner with feature-level gating, alleviating task interference and enhancing multimodal diversity. Experiments on the NAVSIM v2 benchmark demonstrate that FlowDrive achieves state-of-the-art performance with an EPDMS of 86.3, surpassing prior baselines in both safety and planning quality.

  As Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) become increasingly autonomous and complex, understanding their error modes is critical for ensuring their reliability and safety. However, research in this area has been severely hampered by the lack of large-scale, diverse datasets with precise, ground-truth error labels. To address this bottleneck, we introduce \textbf{AEGIS}, a novel framework for \textbf{A}utomated \textbf{E}rror \textbf{G}eneration and \textbf{I}dentification for Multi-Agent \textbf{S}ystems. By systematically injecting controllable and traceable errors into initially successful trajectories, we create a rich dataset of realistic failures. This is achieved using a context-aware, LLM-based adaptive manipulator that performs sophisticated attacks like prompt injection and response corruption to induce specific, predefined error modes. We demonstrate the value of our dataset by exploring three distinct learning paradigms for the error identification task: Supervised Fine-Tuning, Reinforcement Learning, and Contrastive Learning. Our comprehensive experiments show that models trained on AEGIS data achieve substantial improvements across all three learning paradigms. Notably, several of our fine-tuned models demonstrate performance competitive with or superior to proprietary systems an order of magnitude larger, validating our automated data generation framework as a crucial resource for developing more robust and interpretable multi-agent systems.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper studies the kinematic tracking control problem for aerial manipulators. Existing kinematic tracking control methods, which typically employ proportional-derivative feedback or tracking-error-based feedback strategies, may fail to achieve tracking objectives within specified time constraints. To address this limitation, we propose a novel control framework comprising two key components: end-effector tracking control based on a user-defined preset trajectory and quadratic programming-based reference allocation. Compared with state-of-the-art approaches, the proposed method has several attractive features. First, it ensures that the end-effector reaches the desired position within a preset time while keeping the tracking error within a performance envelope that reflects task requirements. Second, quadratic programming is employed to allocate the references of the quadcopter base and the Delta arm, while considering the physical constraints of the aerial manipulator, thus preventing solutions that may violate physical limitations. The proposed approach is validated through three experiments. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and its capability to guarantee that the target position is reached within the preset time.

  Agricultural robotic agents have been becoming powerful helpers in a wide range of agricultural tasks, however, still heavily rely on manual operation or fixed railways for movement. To address this limitation, the AgriVLN method and the A2A benchmark pioneeringly extend Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) to the agricultural domain, enabling agents to navigate to the target positions following the natural language instructions. AgriVLN effectively understands the simple instructions, but often misunderstands the complex ones. To bridge this gap, we propose the method of Translator for Agricultural Robotic Agents on Vision-and-Language Navigation (T-araVLN), in which the Instruction Translator module translates the original instruction to be more refined and precise. When evaluated on the A2A benchmark, our T-araVLN effectively improves Success Rate from 0.47 to 0.63 and reduces Navigation Error from 2.91m to 2.28m, demonstrating the state-of-the-art performance in the agricultural domain.

  Reasoning is central to purposeful action, yet most robotic foundation models map perception and instructions directly to control, which limits adaptability, generalization, and semantic grounding. We introduce Action Reasoning Models (ARMs), a class of robotic foundation models that integrate perception, planning, and control through a structured three-stage pipeline. Our model, MolmoAct, encodes observations and instructions into depth-aware perception tokens, generates mid-level spatial plans as editable trajectory traces, and predicts precise low-level actions, enabling explainable and steerable behavior. MolmoAct-7B-D achieves strong performance across simulation and real-world settings: 70.5% zero-shot accuracy on SimplerEnv Visual Matching tasks, surpassing closed-source Pi-0 and GR00T N1.5; 86.6% average success on LIBERO, including an additional 6.3% gain over ThinkAct on long-horizon tasks; and in real-world fine-tuning, an additional 10% (single-arm) and an additional 22.7% (bimanual) task progression over Pi-0-FAST. It also outperforms baselines by an additional 23.3% on out-of-distribution generalization and achieves top human-preference scores for open-ended instruction following and trajectory steering. Furthermore, we release, for the first time, the MolmoAct Dataset -- a mid-training robot dataset comprising over 10,000 high quality robot trajectories across diverse scenarios and tasks. Training with this dataset yields an average 5.5% improvement in general performance over the base model. We release all model weights, training code, our collected dataset, and our action reasoning dataset, establishing MolmoAct as both a state-of-the-art robotics foundation model and an open blueprint for building ARMs that transform perception into purposeful action through structured reasoning.

  In this paper, we propose the first framework that leverages physically-based inverse rendering for novel lighting generation on existing real-world human demonstrations of robotic manipulation tasks. Specifically, inverse rendering decomposes the first frame in each demonstration into geometric (surface normal, depth) and material (albedo, roughness, metallic) properties, which are then used to render appearance changes under different lighting sources. To improve efficiency and maintain consistency across each generated sequence, we fine-tune Stable Video Diffusion on robot execution videos for temporal lighting propagation. We evaluate our framework by measuring the visual quality of the generated sequences, assessing its effectiveness in improving the imitation learning policy performance (38.75\%) under six unseen real-world lighting conditions, and conduct ablation studies on individual modules of the proposed framework. We further showcase three downstream applications enabled by the proposed framework: background generation, object texture generation and distractor positioning. The code for the framework will be made publicly available.

In dynamic scenarios, the system generates initial trajectories using the diffusion model and continuously refines them through potential field-based adaptation, demonstrating effective performance in pursuit-evasion scenarios with partial pursuer observability.

  Achieving expressive and generalizable whole-body motion control is essential for deploying humanoid robots in real-world environments. In this work, we propose UniTracker, a three-stage training framework that enables robust and scalable motion tracking across a wide range of human behaviors. In the first stage, we train a teacher policy with privileged observations to generate high-quality actions. In the second stage, we introduce a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) to model a universal student policy that can be deployed directly on real hardware. The CVAE structure allows the policy to learn a global latent representation of motion, enhancing generalization to unseen behaviors and addressing the limitations of standard MLP-based policies under partial observations. Unlike pure MLPs that suffer from drift in global attributes like orientation, our CVAE-student policy incorporates global intent during training by aligning a partial-observation prior to the full-observation encoder. In the third stage, we introduce a fast adaptation module that fine-tunes the universal policy on harder motion sequences that are difficult to track directly. This adaptation can be performed both for single sequences and in batch mode, further showcasing the flexibility and scalability of our approach. We evaluate UniTracker in both simulation and real-world settings using a Unitree G1 humanoid, demonstrating strong performance in motion diversity, tracking accuracy, and deployment robustness.

  Accurate scene perception is critical for vision-based robotic manipulation. Existing approaches typically follow either a Vision-to-Action (V-A) paradigm, predicting actions directly from visual inputs, or a Vision-to-3D-to-Action (V-3D-A) paradigm, leveraging intermediate 3D representations. However, these methods often struggle with action inaccuracies due to the complexity and dynamic nature of manipulation scenes. In this paper, we adopt a V-4D-A framework that enables direct action reasoning from motion-aware 4D representations via a Gaussian Action Field (GAF). GAF extends 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) by incorporating learnable motion attributes, allowing 4D modeling of dynamic scenes and manipulation actions. To learn time-varying scene geometry and action-aware robot motion, GAF provides three interrelated outputs: reconstruction of the current scene, prediction of future frames, and estimation of init action via Gaussian motion. Furthermore, we employ an action-vision-aligned denoising framework, conditioned on a unified representation that combines the init action and the Gaussian perception, both generated by the GAF, to further obtain more precise actions. Extensive experiments demonstrate significant improvements, with GAF achieving +11.5385 dB PSNR, +0.3864 SSIM and -0.5574 LPIPS improvements in reconstruction quality, while boosting the average +7.3% success rate in robotic manipulation tasks over state-of-the-art methods.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  While robotic automation has demonstrated remarkable performance, such as executing hundreds of experiments continuously over several days, designing synchronized motions between the robot and experimental jigs remains challenging, especially for flexible experimental automation. This challenge stems from the fact that even minor changes in experimental conditions often require extensive reprogramming of both robot motions and jig control commands. Previous systems lack the flexibility to accommodate frequent updates, limiting their practical utility in actual laboratories. To update robotic automation systems flexibly by chemists, we propose a concept that enables the automation of experiments by utilizing dual demonstrations of robot motions and jig operations by chemists. To verify this concept, we developed a chemical-experiment-automation system consisting of jigs to assist the robot in experiments, a motion-demonstration interface, a jig-control interface, and a mobile manipulator. We validate the concept through polymer-synthesis experiments, focusing on critical liquid-handling tasks such as pipetting and dilution. The experimental results indicate high reproducibility of the demonstrated motions and robust task-success rates. This comprehensive concept not only simplifies the robot programming process for chemists but also provides a flexible and efficient solution to accommodate a wide range of experimental conditions, providing a practical framework for intuitive and adaptable robotic laboratory automation.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Planning with learned dynamics models offers a promising approach toward versatile real-world manipulation, particularly in nonprehensile settings such as pushing or rolling, where accurate analytical models are difficult to obtain. However, collecting training data for learning-based methods can be costly and inefficient, as it often relies on randomly sampled interactions that are not necessarily the most informative. Furthermore, learned models tend to exhibit high uncertainty in underexplored regions of the skill space, undermining the reliability of long-horizon planning. To address these challenges, we propose ActivePusher, a novel framework that combines residual-physics modeling with uncertainty-based active learning, to focus data acquisition on the most informative skill parameters. Additionally, ActivePusher seamlessly integrates with model-based kinodynamic planners, leveraging uncertainty estimates to bias control sampling toward more reliable actions. We evaluate our approach in both simulation and real-world environments, and demonstrate that it consistently improves data efficiency and achieves higher planning success rates in comparison to baseline methods.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper presents a system for autonomous semantic exploration and dense semantic target mapping of a complex unknown environment using a ground robot equipped with a LiDAR-panoramic camera suite. Existing approaches often struggle to balance collecting high-quality observations from multiple view angles and avoiding unnecessary repetitive traversal. To fill this gap, we propose a complete system combining mapping and planning. We first redefine the task as completing both geometric coverage and semantic viewpoint observation. We then manage semantic and geometric viewpoints separately and propose a novel Priority-driven Decoupled Local Sampler to generate local viewpoint sets. This enables explicit multi-view semantic inspection and voxel coverage without unnecessary repetition. Building on this, we develop a hierarchical planner to ensure efficient global coverage. In addition, we propose a Safe Aggressive Exploration State Machine, which allows aggressive exploration behavior while ensuring the robot's safety. Our system includes a plug-and-play semantic target mapping module that integrates seamlessly with state-of-the-art SLAM algorithms for pointcloud-level dense semantic target mapping. We validate our approach through extensive experiments in both realistic simulations and complex real-world environments. Simulation results show that our planner achieves faster exploration and shorter travel distances while guaranteeing a specified number of multi-view inspections. Real-world experiments further confirm the system's effectiveness in achieving accurate dense semantic object mapping of unstructured environments.

  Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have advanced general-purpose robotic manipulation by leveraging pretrained visual and linguistic representations. However, they struggle with contact-rich tasks that require fine-grained control involving force, especially under visual occlusion or dynamic uncertainty. To address these limitations, we propose ForceVLA, a novel end-to-end manipulation framework that treats external force sensing as a first-class modality within VLA systems. ForceVLA introduces FVLMoE, a force-aware Mixture-of-Experts fusion module that dynamically integrates pretrained visual-language embeddings with real-time 6-axis force feedback during action decoding. This enables context-aware routing across modality-specific experts, enhancing the robot's ability to adapt to subtle contact dynamics. We also introduce \textbf{ForceVLA-Data}, a new dataset comprising synchronized vision, proprioception, and force-torque signals across five contact-rich manipulation tasks. ForceVLA improves average task success by 23.2% over strong pi_0-based baselines, achieving up to 80% success in tasks such as plug insertion. Our approach highlights the importance of multimodal integration for dexterous manipulation and sets a new benchmark for physically intelligent robotic control.

  Data scarcity presents a key bottleneck for imitation learning in robotic manipulation. In this paper, we focus on random exploration data-actions and video sequences produced autonomously via motions to randomly sampled positions in the workspace-to investigate their potential as a cost-effective data source. Our investigation follows two paradigms: (a) random actions, where we assess their feasibility for autonomously bootstrapping data collection policies, and (b) random exploration video frames, where we evaluate their effectiveness in pre-training parameter-dense networks with self-supervised learning objectives. To minimize human supervision, we first develop a fully automated pipeline that handles episode labeling, termination, and resetting using cloud-based microservices for real-time monitoring. Building on this, we present a large-scale study on the cost-effectiveness of real-world random exploration in a non-trivial two-layer stacking task, drawing on statistical results from 807 hours of random actions, 71 hours of random exploration video (1.28M frames), and 1,260 times of policy evaluation. The dataset will be made publicly available and access to the robot environment with the automated pipeline is to be made accessible via cloud service for future research.

  Zero-Shot Object Navigation (ZSON) requires agents to navigate to objects specified via open-ended natural language without predefined categories or prior environmental knowledge. While recent methods leverage foundation models or multi-modal maps, they often rely on 2D representations and greedy strategies or require additional training or modules with high computation load, limiting performance in complex environments and real applications. We propose WTRP-Searcher, a novel framework that formulates ZSON as a Weighted Traveling Repairman Problem (WTRP), minimizing the weighted waiting time of viewpoints. Using a Vision-Language Model (VLM), we score viewpoints based on object-description similarity, projected onto a 2D map with depth information. An open-vocabulary detector identifies targets, dynamically updating goals, while a 3D embedding feature map enhances spatial awareness and environmental recall. WTRP-Searcher outperforms existing methods, offering efficient global planning and improved performance in complex ZSON tasks. Code and design will be open-sourced upon acceptance.

  Catching flying objects with a cushioning process is a skill commonly performed by humans, yet it remains a significant challenge for robots. In this paper, we present a framework that combines optimization and learning to achieve compliant catching on mobile manipulators (CCMM). First, we propose a high-level capture planner for mobile manipulators (MM) that calculates the optimal capture point and joint configuration. Next, the pre-catching (PRC) planner ensures the robot reaches the target joint configuration as quickly as possible. To learn compliant catching strategies, we propose a network that leverages the strengths of LSTM for capturing temporal dependencies and positional encoding for spatial context (P-LSTM). This network is designed to effectively learn compliant strategies from human demonstrations. Following this, the post-catching (POC) planner tracks the compliant sequence output by the P-LSTM while avoiding potential collisions due to structural differences between humans and robots. We validate the CCMM framework through both simulated and real-world ball-catching scenarios, achieving a success rate of 98.70% in simulation, 92.59% in real-world tests, and a 28.7% reduction in impact torques. The open source code has be released for the reference of the community.

  Imitation learning (IL) algorithms typically distill experience into parametric behavior policies to mimic expert demonstrations. However, with limited demonstrations, existing methods often struggle to generate accurate actions, particularly under partial observability. To address this problem, we introduce a few-shot IL approach, ReMoBot, which directly retrieves information from demonstrations to solve Mobile manipulation tasks with ego-centric visual observations. Given the current observation, ReMoBot utilizes vision foundation models to identify relevant demonstrations, considering visual similarity w.r.t. both individual observations and history trajectories. A motion selection policy then selects the proper command for the robot until the task is successfully completed.The performance of ReMoBot is evaluated on three mobile manipulation tasks with a Boston Dynamics Spot robot in both simulation and the real world. After benchmarking five approaches in simulation, we compare our method with two baselines in the real world, training directly on the real-world dataset without sim-to-real transfer. With only 20 demonstrations, ReMoBot outperforms the baselines, achieving high success rates in Table Uncover (70%) and Gap Cover (80%), while also showing promising performance on the more challenging Curtain Open task in the real-world setting. Furthermore, ReMoBot demonstrates generalization across varying robot positions, object sizes, and material types. Additional details are available at:this https URL

  Many robotic tasks require grasping objects at specific object parts instead of arbitrarily, a crucial capability for interactions beyond simple pick-and-place, such as human-robot interaction, handovers, or tool use. Prior work has focused either on generic grasp prediction or task-conditioned grasping, but not on directly targeting object parts in an open-vocabulary way. We propose AnyPart, a modular framework that unifies open-vocabulary object detection, part segmentation, and 6-DoF grasp prediction to enable robots to grasp user-specified parts of arbitrary objects based on natural language prompts. We evaluate 16 model combinations, and demonstrate that the best-performing combination achieves 60.8% grasp success in cluttered real-world scenes at 60 times faster inference than existing approaches. To support this study, we introduce a new dataset for part-based grasping and conduct a detailed failure analysis. Our core insight is that modularly combining existing foundation models unlocks surprisingly strong and efficient capabilities for open-vocabulary part-based grasping without requiring additional training.

  The nonlinearity and hysteresis of soft robot motions present challenges for control. To solve these issues, the Jacobian controller has been applied to approximate the nonlinear behaviors in a linear format. Accurate controllers like neural networks can handle delayed and nonlinear motions, but they require large datasets and exhibit low adaptability. Based on a novel analysis on these controllers, we propose an adaptive extended Jacobian controller, AdapJ, for soft manipulators. This controller retains the concise format of the Jacobian controller but introduces independent parameters. Similar to neural networks, its initialization and updating mechanism leverages the inverse model without building the corresponding forward model. In the experiments, we first compare the performance of the Jacobian controller, model predictive controller, neural network controller, iterative feedback controller, and AdapJ in simulation. We further analyze how AdapJ parameters adapt in response to the physical property change. Then, real-world experiments have validated that AdapJ outperforms the neural network controller, model predictive controller, and iterative feedback controller with fewer training samples and adapts robustly to varying conditions, including different control frequencies, material softness, and external disturbances. Future work may include online adjustment of the controller format and adaptability validation in more scenarios.
