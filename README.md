- **[Cross-Cultural Transfer of Commonsense Reasoning in LLMs: Evidence from the Arab World](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19265)**  `arXiv:2509.19265`  
  _Saeed Almheiri, Rania Hossam, Mena Attia, Chenxi Wang, Preslav Nakov, Timothy Baldwin, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) often reflect Western-centric biases, limiting their effectiveness in diverse cultural contexts. Although some work has explored cultural alignment, the potential for cross-cultural transfer, using alignment in one culture to improve performance in others, remains underexplored. This paper investigates cross-cultural transfer of commonsense reasoning in the Arab world, where linguistic and historical similarities coexist with local cultural differences. Using a culturally grounded commonsense reasoning dataset covering 13 Arab countries, we evaluate lightweight alignment methods such as in-context learning and demonstration-based reinforcement (DITTO), alongside baselines like supervised fine-tuning and direct preference optimization. Our results show that merely 12 culture-specific examples from one country can improve performance in others by 10\% on average, within multilingual models. In addition, we demonstrate that out-of-culture demonstrations from Indonesia and US contexts can match or surpass in-culture alignment for MCQ reasoning, highlighting cultural commonsense transferability beyond the Arab world. These findings demonstrate that efficient cross-cultural alignment is possible and offer a promising approach to adapt LLMs to low-resource cultural settings.

- **[AgentInit: Initializing LLM-based Multi-Agent Systems via Diversity and Expertise Orchestration for Effective and Efficient Collaboration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19236)**  `arXiv:2509.19236`  
  _Chunhao Tian, Yutong Wang, Xuebo Liu, Zhexuan Wang, Liang Ding, Miao Zhang, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Proper initialization is crucial for any system, particularly in multi-agent systems (MAS), where it plays a pivotal role in determining both the system's efficiency and effectiveness. However, existing MAS initialization methods do not fully account for the collaborative needs of the generated agents in subsequent stages. Inspired by the principles of effective team composition, we propose AgentInit, which aims to optimize the structure of agent teams. Specifically, in addition to multi-round interactions and reflections between agents during agent generation, AgentInit incorporates a Natural Language to Format mechanism to ensure consistency and standardization. Balanced team selection strategies using Pareto principles are subsequently applied to jointly consider agent team diversity and task relevance to promote effective and efficient collaboration and enhance overall system performance. Experiments show that AgentInit consistently outperforms state-of-the-art initialization methods and pre-defined strategies across various frameworks and tasks, achieving an overall performance improvement of up to 1.2 and 1.6, respectively, while also significantly reducing token consumption. Further analysis confirms its strong transferability to similar tasks and verifies the effectiveness of its key components, demonstrating its capability and adaptability as a reliable MAS initialization method.

- **[Code Driven Planning with Domain-Adaptive Critic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19077)**  `arXiv:2509.19077`  
  _Zikang Tian, Shaohui Peng, Du Huang, Jiaming Guo, Ruizhi Chen, Rui Zhang, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) have been widely adopted as task planners for AI agents in sequential decision-making problems, leveraging their extensive world knowledge. However, the gap between their general knowledge and environment-specific requirements often leads to inaccurate plans. To address this, existing approaches rely on frequent LLM queries to iteratively refine plans based on immediate environmental feedback, which incurs substantial query costs. However, this refinement is typically guided by short-term environmental feedback, limiting LLMs from developing plans aligned with long-term rewards. We propose Code Driven Planning with Domain-Adaptive Critic (CoPiC). Instead of relying on frequent queries, CoPiC employs LLMs to generate a diverse set of high-level planning programs, which iteratively produce and refine candidate plans. A trained domain-adaptive critic then evaluates these candidates and selects the one most aligned with long-term rewards for execution. Using high-level planning programs as planner and domain-adaptive critic as estimator, CoPiC improves planning while significantly reducing query costs. Results in ALFWorld, NetHack, and StarCraft II Unit Building show that CoPiC outperforms advanced LLM-based baselines, AdaPlanner and Reflexion, achieving an average (1) 23.33% improvement in success rate and (2) 91.27% reduction in query costs.

- **[Towards Causal Representation Learning with Observable Sources as Auxiliaries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19058)**  `arXiv:2509.19058`  
  _Kwonho Kim, Heejeong Nam, Inwoo Hwang, Sanghack Lee_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Causal representation learning seeks to recover latent factors that generate observational data through a mixing function. Needing assumptions on latent structures or relationships to achieve identifiability in general, prior works often build upon conditional independence given known auxiliary variables. However, prior frameworks limit the scope of auxiliary variables to be external to the mixing function. Yet, in some cases, system-driving latent factors can be easily observed or extracted from data, possibly facilitating identification. In this paper, we introduce a framework of observable sources being auxiliaries, serving as effective conditioning variables. Our main results show that one can identify entire latent variables up to subspace-wise transformations and permutations using volume-preserving encoders. Moreover, when multiple known auxiliary variables are available, we offer a variable-selection scheme to choose those that maximize recoverability of the latent factors given knowledge of the latent causal graph. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework through experiments on synthetic graph and image data, thereby extending the boundaries of current approaches.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Algorithmic evaluation of procedurally generated content struggles to find metrics that align with human experience, particularly for composite artefacts. Automatic decomposition as a possible solution requires concepts that meet a range of properties. To this end, drawing on Games Studies and Game AI research, we introduce the nested concepts of \textit{Landmarks}, \textit{Monuments}, and \textit{Beacons}. These concepts are based on the artefact's perceivability, evocativeness, and Call to Action, all from a player-centric perspective. These terms are generic to games and usable across genres. We argue that these entities can be found and evaluated with techniques currently used in both research and industry, opening a path towards a fully automated decomposition of PCG, and evaluation of the salient sub-components. Although the work presented here emphasises mixed-initiative PCG and compositional PCG, we believe it applies beyond those domains. With this approach, we intend to create a connection between humanities and technical game research and allow for better computational PCG evaluation

- **[Remaining Time Prediction in Outbound Warehouse Processes: A Case Study (Short Paper)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18986)**  `arXiv:2509.18986`  
  _Erik Penther, Michael Grohs, Jana-Rebecca Rehse_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Predictive process monitoring is a sub-domain of process mining which aims to forecast the future of ongoing process executions. One common prediction target is the remaining time, meaning the time that will elapse until a process execution is completed. In this paper, we compare four different remaining time prediction approaches in a real-life outbound warehouse process of a logistics company in the aviation business. For this process, the company provided us with a novel and original event log with 169,523 traces, which we can make publicly available. Unsurprisingly, we find that deep learning models achieve the highest accuracy, but shallow methods like conventional boosting techniques achieve competitive accuracy and require significantly fewer computational resources.

- **[LLM-based Agents Suffer from Hallucinations: A Survey of Taxonomy, Methods, and Directions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18970)**  `arXiv:2509.18970`  
  _Xixun Lin, Yucheng Ning, Jingwen Zhang, Yan Dong, Yilong Liu, Yongxuan Wu, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Driven by the rapid advancements of Large Language Models (LLMs), LLM-based agents have emerged as powerful intelligent systems capable of human-like cognition, reasoning, and interaction. These agents are increasingly being deployed across diverse real-world applications, including student education, scientific research, and financial analysis. However, despite their remarkable potential, LLM-based agents remain vulnerable to hallucination issues, which can result in erroneous task execution and undermine the reliability of the overall system design. Addressing this critical challenge requires a deep understanding and a systematic consolidation of recent advances on LLM-based agents. To this end, we present the first comprehensive survey of hallucinations in LLM-based agents. By carefully analyzing the complete workflow of agents, we propose a new taxonomy that identifies different types of agent hallucinations occurring at different stages. Furthermore, we conduct an in-depth examination of eighteen triggering causes underlying the emergence of agent hallucinations. Through a detailed review of a large number of existing studies, we summarize approaches for hallucination mitigation and detection, and highlight promising directions for future research. We hope this survey will inspire further efforts toward addressing hallucinations in LLM-based agents, ultimately contributing to the development of more robust and reliable agent systems.

- **[Data Efficient Adaptation in Large Language Models via Continuous Low-Rank Fine-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18942)**  `arXiv:2509.18942`  
  _Xiao Han, Zimo Zhao, Wanyu Wang, Maolin Wang, Zitao Liu, Yi Chang, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have emphasized the critical role of fine-tuning (FT) techniques in adapting LLMs to specific tasks, especially when retraining from scratch is computationally infeasible. Fine-tuning enables LLMs to leverage task- or domain-specific data, producing models that more effectively meet the requirements of targeted applications. However, con- ventional FT approaches often suffer from catastrophic forgetting and suboptimal data efficiency, limiting their real-world applicability. To address these challenges, this paper proposes DEAL, a novel framework that integrates Low-Rank Adapta- tion (LoRA) with a continuous fine-tuning strategy. By incorporating knowledge retention and adaptive parameter update modules, the framework mitigates the lim- itations of existing FT methods while maintaining efficiency in privacy-preserving settings. Experiments on 15 diverse datasets show that DEAL consistently outper- forms baseline methods, yielding substantial gains in task accuracy and resource efficiency. These findings demonstrate the potential of our approach to advance continual adaptation in LLMs by enhancing task performance while improving resource efficiency.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Visual Spatial Reasoning (VSR) is a core human cognitive ability and a critical requirement for advancing embodied intelligence and autonomous systems. Despite recent progress in Vision-Language Models (VLMs), achieving human-level VSR remains highly challenging due to the complexity of representing and reasoning over three-dimensional space. In this paper, we present a systematic investigation of VSR in VLMs, encompassing a review of existing methodologies across input modalities, model architectures, training strategies, and reasoning mechanisms. Furthermore, we categorize spatial intelligence into three levels of capability, ie, basic perception, spatial understanding, spatial planning, and curate SIBench, a spatial intelligence benchmark encompassing nearly 20 open-source datasets across 23 task settings. Experiments with state-of-the-art VLMs reveal a pronounced gap between perception and reasoning, as models show competence in basic perceptual tasks but consistently underperform in understanding and planning tasks, particularly in numerical estimation, multi-view reasoning, temporal dynamics, and spatial imagination. These findings underscore the substantial challenges that remain in achieving spatial intelligence, while providing both a systematic roadmap and a comprehensive benchmark to drive future research in the field.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present LongCat-Flash-Thinking, an efficient 560-billion-parameter open-source Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) reasoning model. Its advanced capabilities are cultivated through a meticulously crafted training process, beginning with long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) data cold-start and culminating in large-scale Reinforcement Learning (RL). We first employ a well-designed cold-start training strategy, which significantly enhances the reasoning potential and equips the model with specialized skills in both formal and agentic reasoning. Then, a core innovation is our domain-parallel training scheme, which decouples optimization across distinct domains (e.g., STEM, Code, Agentic) and subsequently fuses the resulting expert models into a single, nearly Pareto-optimal model. This entire process is powered by our Dynamic ORchestration for Asynchronous rollout (DORA) system, a large-scale RL framework that delivers a greater than threefold training speedup over synchronous methods on tens of thousands of accelerators. As a result, LongCat-Flash-Thinking achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source models on a suite of complex reasoning tasks. The model exhibits exceptional efficiency in agentic reasoning, reducing average token consumption by 64.5% (from 19, 653 to 6, 965) on AIME-25, without degrading task accuracy. We release LongCat-Flash-Thinking to promote further advances in reasoning systems and agentic AI research.

- **[Memory in Large Language Models: Mechanisms, Evaluation and Evolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18868)**  `arXiv:2509.18868`  
  _Dianxing Zhang, Wendong Li, Kani Song, Jiaye Lu, Gang Li, Liuchun Yang, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Under a unified operational definition, we define LLM memory as a persistent state written during pretraining, finetuning, or inference that can later be addressed and that stably influences outputs. We propose a four-part taxonomy (parametric, contextual, external, procedural/episodic) and a memory quadruple (location, persistence, write/access path, controllability). We link mechanism, evaluation, and governance via the chain write -> read -> inhibit/update. To avoid distorted comparisons across heterogeneous setups, we adopt a three-setting protocol (parametric only, offline retrieval, online retrieval) that decouples capability from information availability on the same data and timeline. On this basis we build a layered evaluation: parametric (closed-book recall, edit differential, memorization/privacy), contextual (position curves and the mid-sequence drop), external (answer correctness vs snippet attribution/faithfulness), and procedural/episodic (cross-session consistency and timeline replay, E MARS+). The framework integrates temporal governance and leakage auditing (freshness hits, outdated answers, refusal slices) and uncertainty reporting via inter-rater agreement plus paired tests with multiple-comparison correction. For updating and forgetting, we present DMM Gov: coordinating DAPT/TAPT, PEFT, model editing (ROME, MEND, MEMIT, SERAC), and RAG to form an auditable loop covering admission thresholds, rollout, monitoring, rollback, and change audits, with specs for timeliness, conflict handling, and long-horizon consistency. Finally, we give four testable propositions: minimum identifiability; a minimal evaluation card; causally constrained editing with verifiable forgetting; and when retrieval with small-window replay outperforms ultra-long-context reading. This yields a reproducible, comparable, and governable coordinate system for research and deployment.

  _Yingxin Li, Jianbo Zhao, Xueyu Ren, Jie Tang, Wangjie You, Xu Chen, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  User profiling, as a core technique for user understanding, aims to infer structural attributes from user information. Large Language Models (LLMs) provide a promising avenue for user profiling, yet the progress is hindered by the lack of comprehensive benchmarks. To bridge this gap, we propose ProfileBench, an industrial benchmark derived from a real-world video platform, encompassing heterogeneous user data and a well-structured profiling taxonomy. However, the profiling task remains challenging due to the difficulty of collecting large-scale ground-truth labels, and the heterogeneous and noisy user information can compromise the reliability of LLMs. To approach label-free and reliable user profiling, we propose a Confidence-driven Profile reasoning framework Conf-Profile, featuring a two-stage paradigm. We first synthesize high-quality labels by leveraging advanced LLMs with confidence hints, followed by confidence-weighted voting for accuracy improvement and confidence calibration for a balanced distribution. The multiple profile results, rationales, and confidence scores are aggregated and distilled into a lightweight LLM. We further enhance the reasoning ability via confidence-guided unsupervised reinforcement learning, which exploits confidence for difficulty filtering, quasi-ground truth voting, and reward weighting. Experimental results demonstrate that Conf-Profile delivers substantial performance through the two-stage training, improving F1 by 13.97 on Qwen3-8B.

- **[MAPO: Mixed Advantage Policy Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18849)**  `arXiv:2509.18849`  
  _Wenke Huang, Quan Zhang, Yiyang Fang, Jian Liang, Xuankun Rong, Huanjin Yao, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in reinforcement learning for foundation models, such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), have significantly improved the performance of foundation models on reasoning tasks. Notably, the advantage function serves as a central mechanism in GRPO for ranking the trajectory importance. However, existing explorations encounter both advantage reversion and advantage mirror problems, which hinder the reasonable advantage allocation across different query samples. In this work, we propose an easy but effective GRPO strategy, Mixed Advantage Policy Optimization (MAPO). We reveal that the trajectory appears with different certainty and propose the advantage percent deviation for samples with high-certainty trajectories. Furthermore, we dynamically reweight the advantage function for samples with varying trajectory certainty, thereby adaptively configuring the advantage function to account for sample-specific characteristics. Comparison with related state-of-the-art methods, along with ablation studies on different advantage variants, validates the effectiveness of our approach.

  _Hong-Jie Dai, Zheng-Hao Li, An-Tai Lu, Bo-Tsz Shain, Ming-Ta Li, Tatheer Hussain Mir, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Accurate International Classification of Diseases (ICD) coding is critical for clinical documentation, billing, and healthcare analytics, yet it remains a labour-intensive and error-prone task. Although large language models (LLMs) show promise in automating ICD coding, their challenges in base model selection, input contextualization, and training data redundancy limit their effectiveness. We propose a modular framework for ICD-10 Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) code prediction that addresses these challenges through principled model selection, redundancy-aware data sampling, and structured input design. The framework integrates an LLM-as-judge evaluation protocol with Plackett-Luce aggregation to assess and rank open-source LLMs based on their intrinsic comprehension of ICD-10-CM code definitions. We introduced embedding-based similarity measures, a redundancy-aware sampling strategy to remove semantically duplicated discharge summaries. We leverage structured discharge summaries from Taiwanese hospitals to evaluate contextual effects and examine section-wise content inclusion under universal and section-specific modelling paradigms. Experiments across two institutional datasets demonstrate that the selected base model after fine-tuning consistently outperforms baseline LLMs in internal and external evaluations. Incorporating more clinical sections consistently improves prediction performance. This study uses open-source LLMs to establish a practical and principled approach to ICD-10-CM code prediction. The proposed framework provides a scalable, institution-ready solution for real-world deployment of automated medical coding systems by combining informed model selection, efficient data refinement, and context-aware prompting.

- **[Bounded PCTL Model Checking of Large Language Model Outputs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18836)**  `arXiv:2509.18836`  
  _Dennis Gross, Helge Spieker, Arnaud Gotlieb_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this paper, we introduce LLMCHECKER, a model-checking-based verification method to verify the probabilistic computation tree logic (PCTL) properties of an LLM text generation process. We empirically show that only a limited number of tokens are typically chosen during text generation, which are not always the same. This insight drives the creation of $\alpha$-$k$-bounded text generation, narrowing the focus to the $\alpha$ maximal cumulative probability on the top-$k$ tokens at every step of the text generation process. Our verification method considers an initial string and the subsequent top-$k$ tokens while accommodating diverse text quantification methods, such as evaluating text quality and biases. The threshold $\alpha$ further reduces the selected tokens, only choosing those that exceed or meet it in cumulative probability. LLMCHECKER then allows us to formally verify the PCTL properties of $\alpha$-$k$-bounded LLMs. We demonstrate the applicability of our method in several LLMs, including Llama, Gemma, Mistral, Genstruct, and BERT. To our knowledge, this is the first time PCTL-based model checking has been used to check the consistency of the LLM text generation process.

  _Luca Muscariello, Vijoy Pandey, Ramiz Polic_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The Agent Directory Service (ADS) is a distributed directory for the discovery of AI agent capabilities, metadata, and provenance. It leverages content-addressed storage, hierarchical taxonomies, and cryptographic signing to enable efficient, verifiable, and multi-dimensional discovery across heterogeneous Multi-Agent Systems (MAS). Built on the Open Agentic Schema Framework (OASF), ADS decouples capability indexing from content location through a two-level mapping realized over a Kademlia-based Distributed Hash Table (DHT). It reuses mature OCI / ORAS infrastructure for artifact distribution, integrates Sigstore for provenance, and supports schema-driven extensibility for emerging agent modalities (LLM prompt agents, MCP servers, A2A-enabled components). This paper formalizes the architectural model, describes storage and discovery layers, explains security and performance properties, and positions ADS within the broader landscape of emerging agent registry and interoperability initiatives.

- **[Experience Scaling: Post-Deployment Evolution For Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18771)**  `arXiv:2509.18771`  
  _Xingkun Yin, Kaibin Huang, Dong In Kim, Hongyang Du_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Scaling model size, training data, and compute power have driven advances in large language models (LLMs), but these approaches are reaching saturation as human-generated text is exhausted and further gains diminish. We propose experience scaling, a framework for continuous post-deployment evolution for LLMs through autonomous interaction with the environment and collaborative sharing of accumulated experience. The framework captures raw interactions, distills them into compact, reusable knowledge, and periodically refines stored content to preserve relevance and efficiency. We validate the framework in simulated real-world scenarios involving generalization to previously unseen but related tasks, repetitive queries, and over-saturated knowledge stores. Across all settings, experience scaling improves accuracy, sustains performance over time, and maintains gains when applied to novel situations. These results demonstrate that structured post-deployment learning can extend LLM capabilities beyond the limits of static human-generated data, offering a scalable path for continued intelligence progress.

  _Yanjie Fu, Dongjie Wang, Wangyang Ying, Xiangliang Zhang, Huan Liu, Jian Pei_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As data continues to grow in scale and complexity, preparing, transforming, and analyzing it remains labor-intensive, repetitive, and difficult to scale. Since data contains knowledge and AI learns knowledge from it, the alignment between AI and data is essential. However, data is often not structured in ways that are optimal for AI utilization. Moreover, an important question arises: how much knowledge can we pack into data through intensive data operations? Autonomous data agents (DataAgents), which integrate LLM reasoning with task decomposition, action reasoning and grounding, and tool calling, can autonomously interpret data task descriptions, decompose tasks into subtasks, reason over actions, ground actions into python code or tool calling, and execute operations. Unlike traditional data management and engineering tools, DataAgents dynamically plan workflows, call powerful tools, and adapt to diverse data tasks at scale. This report argues that DataAgents represent a paradigm shift toward autonomous data-to-knowledge systems. DataAgents are capable of handling collection, integration, preprocessing, selection, transformation, reweighing, augmentation, reprogramming, repairs, and retrieval. Through these capabilities, DataAgents transform complex and unstructured data into coherent and actionable knowledge. We first examine why the convergence of agentic AI and data-to-knowledge systems has emerged as a critical trend. We then define the concept of DataAgents and discuss their architectural design, training strategies, as well as the new skills and capabilities they enable. Finally, we call for concerted efforts to advance action workflow optimization, establish open datasets and benchmark ecosystems, safeguard privacy, balance efficiency with scalability, and develop trustworthy DataAgent guardrails to prevent malicious actions.

LLMs are increasingly making an impact across various industries, with the medical field standing out as the most prominent application area. This paper systematically reviews the up-to-date research progress of LLMs in the medical field, providing an in-depth analysis of training techniques for large medical models, their adaptation in healthcare settings, related applications, as well as their strengths and limitations. Furthermore, it innovatively categorizes medical LLMs into three distinct types based on their training methodologies and classifies their evaluation approaches into two categories. Finally, the study proposes solutions to existing challenges and outlines future research directions based on identified issues in the field of medical LLMs. By systematically reviewing previous and advanced research findings, we aim to highlight the necessity of developing medical LLMs, provide a deeper understanding of their current state of development, and offer clear guidance for subsequent research.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Machine Learning (ML) may offer new capabilities in airborne systems. However, as any piece of airborne systems, ML-based systems will be required to guarantee their safe operation. Thus, their development will have to be demonstrated to be compliant with the adequate guidance. So far, the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) has published a concept paper and an EUROCAE/SAE group is preparing ED-324. Both approaches delineate high-level objectives to confirm the ML model achieves its intended function and maintains training performance in the target environment. The paper aims to clarify the difference between an ML model and its corresponding unambiguous description, referred to as the Machine Learning Model Description (MLMD). It then refines the essential notion of semantics preservation to ensure the accurate replication of the model. We apply our contributions to several industrial use cases to build and compare several target models.

  _Qiao Xiao, Hong Ting Tsang, Jiaxin Bai_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Graph-based Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has become a widely studied approach for improving the reasoning, accuracy, and factuality of Large Language Models. However, many existing graph-based RAG systems overlook the high cost associated with LLM token usage during graph construction, hindering large-scale adoption. To address this, we propose TERAG, a simple yet effective framework designed to build informative graphs at a significantly lower cost. Inspired by HippoRAG, we incorporate Personalized PageRank (PPR) during the retrieval phase, and we achieve at least 80% of the accuracy of widely used graph-based RAG methods while consuming only 3%-11% of the output tokens.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at various tasks, including problem-solving and question-answering. However, LLMs often find Math Word Problems (MWPs) challenging because solving them requires a range of reasoning and mathematical abilities with which LLMs seem to struggle. Recent efforts have helped LLMs solve more complex MWPs with improved prompts. This study proposes a novel method that initially prompts an LLM to create equations from a decomposition of the question, followed by using an external symbolic equation solver to produce an answer. To ensure the accuracy of the obtained answer, inspired by an established recommendation of math teachers, the LLM is instructed to solve the MWP a second time, but this time with the objective of estimating the correct answer instead of solving it exactly. The estimation is then compared to the generated answer to verify. If verification fails, an iterative rectification process is employed to ensure the correct answer is eventually found. This approach achieves new state-of-the-art results on datasets used by prior published research on numeric and algebraic MWPs, improving the previous best results by nearly two percent on average. In addition, the approach obtains satisfactory results on trigonometric MWPs, a task not previously attempted to the authors' best knowledge. This study also introduces two new datasets, SVAMPClean and Trig300, to further advance the testing of LLMs' reasoning abilities.

  Compared to traditional models, agentic AI represents a highly valuable target for potential attackers as they possess privileged access to data sources and API tools, which are traditionally not incorporated into classical agents. Unlike a typical software application residing in a Demilitarized Zone (DMZ), agentic LLMs consciously rely on nondeterministic behavior of the AI (only defining a final goal, leaving the path selection to LLM). This characteristic introduces substantial security risk to both operational security and information security. Most common existing defense mechanism rely on detection of malicious intent and preventing it from reaching the LLM agent, thus protecting against jailbreak attacks such as prompt injection. In this paper, we present an alternative approach, LLMZ+, which moves beyond traditional detection-based approaches by implementing prompt whitelisting. Through this method, only contextually appropriate and safe messages are permitted to interact with the agentic LLM. By leveraging the specificity of context, LLMZ+ guarantees that all exchanges between external users and the LLM conform to predefined use cases and operational boundaries. Our approach streamlines the security framework, enhances its long-term resilience, and reduces the resources required for sustaining LLM information security. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that LLMZ+ provides strong resilience against the most common jailbreak prompts. At the same time, legitimate business communications are not disrupted, and authorized traffic flows seamlessly between users and the agentic LLM. We measure the effectiveness of approach using false positive and false negative rates, both of which can be reduced to 0 in our experimental setting.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The sport of fencing, like many other sports, faces challenges in refereeing: subjective calls, human errors, bias, and limited availability in practice environments. We present FERA (Fencing Referee Assistant), a prototype AI referee for foil fencing which integrates pose-based multi-label action recognition and rule-based reasoning. FERA extracts 2D joint positions from video, normalizes them, computes a 101-dimensional kinematic feature set, and applies a Transformer for multi-label move and blade classification. To determine priority and scoring, FERA applies a distilled language model with encoded right-of-way rules, producing both a decision and an explanation for each exchange. With limited hand-labeled data, a 5-fold cross-validation achieves an average macro-F1 score of 0.549, outperforming multiple baselines, including a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN), BiLSTM, and a vanilla Transformer. While not ready for deployment, these results demonstrate a promising path towards automated referee assistance in foil fencing and new opportunities for AI applications, such as coaching in the field of fencing.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Function calling is a core capability of large language models, essential for AI agents. Existing benchmarks such as the Berkeley Function Calling Leaderboard (BFCL), tau^2-Bench (arXiv:2506.07982), and ACEBench (arXiv:2501.12851) evaluate argument correctness but do not test adherence to format instructions embedded in parameter descriptions, such as enclosing values in double quotes or using ISO date formats.We introduce IFEval-FC, a benchmark inspired by IFEval (arXiv:2311.07911) that assesses precise instruction following in function calling. IFEval-FC encodes verifiable formats directly within JSON schema descriptions, for example specifying that a value must not contain punctuation. It includes 750 test cases, each consisting of a function with an embedded format for one of its input parameters and a corresponding user query. Evaluation is fully algorithmic, ensuring objectivity, reproducibility, and scalability.Our results show that even state-of-the-art proprietary models, including GPT-5 and Claude 4.1 Opus, frequently fail to follow basic formatting rules, highlighting a practical limitation for real-world agent systems.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Accurate classification of products under the Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) is a critical bottleneck in global trade, yet it has received little attention from the machine learning community. Misclassification can halt shipments entirely, with major postal operators suspending deliveries to the U.S. due to incomplete customs documentation. We introduce the first benchmark for HTS code classification, derived from the U.S. Customs Rulings Online Search System (CROSS). Evaluating leading LLMs, we find that our fine-tuned Atlas model (LLaMA-3.3-70B) achieves 40 percent fully correct 10-digit classifications and 57.5 percent correct 6-digit classifications, improvements of 15 points over GPT-5-Thinking and 27.5 points over Gemini-2.5-Pro-Thinking. Beyond accuracy, Atlas is roughly five times cheaper than GPT-5-Thinking and eight times cheaper than Gemini-2.5-Pro-Thinking, and can be self-hosted to guarantee data privacy in high-stakes trade and compliance workflows. While Atlas sets a strong baseline, the benchmark remains highly challenging, with only 40 percent 10-digit accuracy. By releasing both dataset and model, we aim to position HTS classification as a new community benchmark task and invite future work in retrieval, reasoning, and alignment.

  Test-time compute scaling has demonstrated the ability to improve the performance of reasoning language models by generating longer chain-of-thought (CoT) sequences. However, this increase in performance comes with a significant increase in computational cost. In this work, we investigate two compute constraint strategies: (1) reasoning length constraint and (2) model quantization, as methods to reduce the compute demand of reasoning models and study their impact on their safety performance. Specifically, we explore two approaches to apply compute constraints to reasoning models: (1) fine-tuning reasoning models using a length controlled policy optimization (LCPO) based reinforcement learning method to satisfy a user-defined CoT reasoning length, and (2) applying quantization to maximize the generation of CoT sequences within a user-defined compute constraint. Furthermore, we study the trade-off between the computational efficiency and the safety of the model.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large frontier models like GPT-5 now achieve top scores on medical benchmarks. But our stress tests tell a different story. Leading systems often guess correctly even when key inputs like images are removed, flip answers under trivial prompt changes, and fabricate convincing yet flawed reasoning. These aren't glitches; they expose how today's benchmarks reward test-taking tricks over medical understanding. We evaluate six flagship models across six widely used benchmarks and find that high leaderboard scores hide brittleness and shortcut learning. Through clinician-guided rubric evaluation, we show that benchmarks vary widely in what they truly measure yet are treated interchangeably, masking failure modes. We caution that medical benchmark scores do not directly reflect real-world readiness. If we want AI to earn trust in healthcare, we must demand more than leaderboard wins and must hold systems accountable for robustness, sound reasoning, and alignment with real medical demands.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Controlling desktop applications via software remains a fundamental yet under-served problem. Existing multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) ingest screenshots and task instructions to generate keystrokes and mouse events, but they suffer from prohibitive inference latency, poor sample efficiency on long-horizon sparse-reward tasks, and infeasible on-device deployment. We introduce a lightweight hierarchical reinforcement learning framework, ComputerAgent, that formulates OS control as a two-level option process (manager and subpolicy), employs a triple-modal state encoder (screenshot, task ID, numeric state) to handle visual and contextual diversity, integrates meta-actions with an early-stop mechanism to reduce wasted interactions, and uses a compact vision backbone plus small policy networks for on-device inference (15M parameters). On a suite of 135 real-world desktop tasks, ComputerAgent attains 92.1% success on simple tasks (<8 steps) and 58.8% on hard tasks (>=8 steps), matching or exceeding 200B-parameter MLLM baselines on simple scenarios while reducing model size by over four orders of magnitude and halving inference time. These results demonstrate that hierarchical RL offers a practical, scalable alternative to monolithic MLLM-based automation for computer control.

  _Anthony Patera, Rohan Abeyaratne_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Generative AI, and specifically GPT, can produce a remarkable solution to a mechanical engineering analysis problem - but also, on occasion, a flawed solution. For example, an elementary mechanics problem is solved flawlessly in one GPT instance and incorrectly in a subsequent GPT instance, with a success probability of only 85%. This unreliability renders "out-of-the-box" GPT unsuitable for deployment in education or engineering practice. We introduce an "N-Plus-1" GPT Agency for Initial (Low-Cost) Analysis of mechanical engineering Problem Statements. Agency first launches N instantiations of Agent Solve to yield N independent Proposed Problem Solution Realizations; Agency then invokes Agent Compare to summarize and compare the N Proposed Problem Solution Realizations and to provide a Recommended Problem Solution. We argue from Condorcet's Jury Theorem that, for a Problem Statement characterized by per-Solve success probability greater than 1/2 (and N sufficiently large), the Predominant (Agent Compare) Proposed Problem Solution will, with high probability, correspond to a Correct Proposed Problem Solution. Furthermore, Agent Compare can also incorporate aspects of Secondary (Agent Compare) Proposed Problem Solutions, in particular when the latter represent alternative Problem Statement interpretations - different Mathematical Models - or alternative Mathematical Solution Procedures. Comparisons to Grok Heavy, a commercial multi-agent model, show similarities in design and performance, but also important differences in emphasis: our Agency focuses on transparency and pedagogical value.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Personalized recipe recommendation faces challenges in handling fuzzy user intent, ensuring semantic accuracy, and providing sufficient detail coverage. We propose ChefMind, a hybrid architecture combining Chain of Exploration (CoE), Knowledge Graph (KG), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and a Large Language Model (LLM). CoE refines ambiguous queries into structured conditions, KG offers semantic reasoning and interpretability, RAG supplements contextual culinary details, and LLM integrates outputs into coherent recommendations. We evaluate ChefMind on the Xiachufang dataset and manually annotated queries, comparing it with LLM-only, KG-only, and RAG-only baselines. Results show that ChefMind achieves superior performance in accuracy, relevance, completeness, and clarity, with an average score of 8.7 versus 6.4-6.7 for ablation models. Moreover, it reduces unprocessed queries to 1.6%, demonstrating robustness in handling fuzzy demands.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  With the rising global burden of chronic diseases and the multimodal and heterogeneous clinical data (medical imaging, free-text recordings, wearable sensor streams, etc.), there is an urgent need for a unified multimodal AI framework that can proactively predict individual health risks. We propose VL-RiskFormer, a hierarchical stacked visual-language multimodal Transformer with a large language model (LLM) inference head embedded in its top layer. The system builds on the dual-stream architecture of existing visual-linguistic models (e.g., PaLM-E, LLaVA) with four key innovations: (i) pre-training with cross-modal comparison and fine-grained alignment of radiological images, fundus maps, and wearable device photos with corresponding clinical narratives using momentum update encoders and debiased InfoNCE losses; (ii) a time fusion block that integrates irregular visit sequences into the causal Transformer decoder through adaptive time interval position coding; (iii) a disease ontology map adapter that injects ICD-10 codes into visual and textual channels in layers and infers comorbid patterns with the help of a graph attention mechanism. On the MIMIC-IV longitudinal cohort, VL-RiskFormer achieved an average AUROC of 0.90 with an expected calibration error of 2.7 percent.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We posit that persisting and transforming similarity relations form the structural basis of any comprehensible dynamic system. This paper introduces Similarity Field Theory, a mathematical framework that formalizes the principles governing similarity values among entities and their evolution. We define: (1) a similarity field $S: U \times U \to [0,1]$ over a universe of entities $U$, satisfying reflexivity $S(E,E)=1$ and treated as a directed relational field (asymmetry and non-transitivity are allowed); (2) the evolution of a system through a sequence $Z_p = (X_p, S^{(p)})$ indexed by $p=0,1,2,\ldots$; (3) concepts $K$ as entities that induce fibers $F_{\alpha}(K) = { E \in U \mid S(E,K) \ge \alpha }$, i.e., superlevel sets of the unary map $S_K(E) := S(E,K)$; and (4) a generative operator $G$ that produces new entities. Within this framework, we formalize a generative definition of intelligence: an operator $G$ is intelligent with respect to a concept $K$ if, given a system containing entities belonging to the fiber of $K$, it generates new entities that also belong to that fiber. Similarity Field Theory thus offers a foundational language for characterizing, comparing, and constructing intelligent systems. We prove two theorems: (i) asymmetry blocks mutual inclusion; and (ii) stability requires either an anchor coordinate or eventual confinement within a level set of $f$. These results ensure that the evolution of similarity fields is both constrained and interpretable, culminating in an exploration of how the framework allows us to interpret large language models and use them as experimental probes into societal cognition.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As AI foundation models grow in capability, a deeper question emerges: What shapes their internal cognitive identity -- beyond fluency and output? Benchmarks measure behavior, but the soul of a model resides in its latent geometry. In this work, we propose Neural DNA (nDNA) as a semantic-genotypic representation that captures this latent identity through the intrinsic geometry of belief. At its core, nDNA is synthesized from three principled and indispensable dimensions of latent geometry: spectral curvature, which reveals the curvature of conceptual flow across layers; thermodynamic length, which quantifies the semantic effort required to traverse representational transitions through layers; and belief vector field, which delineates the semantic torsion fields that guide a model's belief directional orientations. Like biological DNA, it encodes ancestry, mutation, and semantic inheritance, found in finetuning and alignment scars, cultural imprints, and architectural drift. In naming it, we open a new field: Neural Genomics, where models are not just tools, but digital semantic organisms with traceable inner cognition.Modeling statement. We read AI foundation models as semantic fluid--dynamics: meaning is transported through layers like fluid in a shaped conduit; nDNA is the physics-grade readout of that flow -- a geometry-first measure of how meaning is bent, paid for, and pushed -- yielding a stable, coordinate-free neural DNA fingerprint tied to on-input behavior; with this fingerprint we cross into biology: tracing lineages across pretraining, fine-tuning, alignment, pruning, distillation, and merges; measuring inheritance between checkpoints; detecting drift as traits shift under new data or objectives; and, ultimately, studying the evolution of artificial cognition to compare models, diagnose risks, and govern change over time.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Autonomous systems have advanced significantly, but challenges persist in accident-prone environments where robust decision-making is crucial. A single vehicle's limited sensor range and obstructed views increase the likelihood of accidents. Multi-vehicle connected systems and multi-modal approaches, leveraging RGB images and LiDAR point clouds, have emerged as promising solutions. However, existing methods often assume the availability of all data modalities and connected vehicles during both training and testing, which is impractical due to potential sensor failures or missing connected vehicles. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel framework MMCD (Multi-Modal Collaborative Decision-making) for connected autonomy. Our framework fuses multi-modal observations from ego and collaborative vehicles to enhance decision-making under challenging conditions. To ensure robust performance when certain data modalities are unavailable during testing, we propose an approach based on cross-modal knowledge distillation with a teacher-student model structure. The teacher model is trained with multiple data modalities, while the student model is designed to operate effectively with reduced modalities. In experiments on $\textit{connected autonomous driving with ground vehicles}$ and $\textit{aerial-ground vehicles collaboration}$, our method improves driving safety by up to ${\it 20.7}\%$, surpassing the best-existing baseline in detecting potential accidents and making safe driving decisions.

  Most educational recommender systems are tuned and judged on click- or rating-based relevance, leaving their true pedagogical impact unclear. We introduce OBER-an Outcome-Based Educational Recommender that embeds learning outcomes and assessment items directly into the data schema, so any algorithm can be evaluated on the mastery it fosters. OBER uses a minimalist entity-relation model, a log-driven mastery formula, and a plug-in architecture. Integrated into an e-learning system in non-formal domain, it was evaluated trough a two-week randomized split test with over 5 700 learners across three methods: fixed expert trajectory, collaborative filtering (CF), and knowledge-based (KB) filtering. CF maximized retention, but the fixed path achieved the highest mastery. Because OBER derives business, relevance, and learning metrics from the same logs, it lets practitioners weigh relevance and engagement against outcome mastery with no extra testing overhead. The framework is method-agnostic and readily extensible to future adaptive or context-aware recommenders.

  _Mustafa Sameen, Xiaojian Zhang, Xilei Zhao_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Accurate modeling of ridesourcing mode choices is essential for designing and implementing effective traffic management policies for reducing congestion, improving mobility, and allocating resources more efficiently. Existing models for predicting ridesourcing mode choices often suffer from limited predictive accuracy due to their inability to capture key psychological factors, and are further challenged by severe class imbalance, as ridesourcing trips comprise only a small fraction of individuals' daily travel. To address these limitations, this paper introduces the Synthesizing Attitudes, Predicting Actions (SAPA) framework, a hierarchical approach that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to synthesize theory-grounded latent attitudes to predict ridesourcing choices. SAPA first uses an LLM to generate qualitative traveler personas from raw travel survey data and then trains a propensity-score model on demographic and behavioral features, enriched by those personas, to produce an individual-level score. Next, the LLM assigns quantitative scores to theory-driven latent variables (e.g., time and cost sensitivity), and a final classifier integrates the propensity score, latent-variable scores (with their interaction terms), and observable trip attributes to predict ridesourcing mode choice. Experiments on a large-scale, multi-year travel survey show that SAPA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, improving ridesourcing choice predictions by up to 75.9% in terms of PR-AUC on a held-out test set. This study provides a powerful tool for accurately predicting ridesourcing mode choices, and provides a methodology that is readily transferable to various applications.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Operations research (OR) provides fundamental methodologies for complex system decision-making, with established applications in transportation, supply chain management, and production scheduling. Traditional approaches, which depend on expert-based modeling and manual parameter adjustment, often face challenges in handling large-scale, dynamic, and multi-constraint problems. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown potential to address these limitations through semantic understanding, structured generation, and reasoning control. LLMs can translate natural language descriptions into mathematical models or executable code, generate heuristics, evolve algorithms, and directly tackle optimization tasks. This paper surveys recent progress on the integration of LLMs into OR, organizing methods into three main directions: automatic modeling, auxiliary optimization, and direct solving. It further reviews evaluation benchmarks and domain-specific applications, and summarizes key open issues such as unstable semantic-to-structure mapping, fragmented research progress, limited generalization, and insufficient evaluation systems. Finally, the survey outlines possible research avenues for advancing the role of LLMs in OR.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Semantic parsing of long documents remains challenging due to quadratic growth in pairwise composition and memory requirements. We introduce \textbf{Hierarchical Segment-Graph Memory (HSGM)}, a novel framework that decomposes an input of length $N$ into $M$ meaningful segments, constructs \emph{Local Semantic Graphs} on each segment, and extracts compact \emph{summary nodes} to form a \emph{Global Graph Memory}. HSGM supports \emph{incremental updates} -- only newly arrived segments incur local graph construction and summary-node integration -- while \emph{Hierarchical Query Processing} locates relevant segments via top-$K$ retrieval over summary nodes and then performs fine-grained reasoning within their local graphs.Theoretically, HSGM reduces worst-case complexity from $O(N^2)$ to $O\!\left(N\,k + (N/k)^2\right)$, with segment size $k \ll N$, and we derive Frobenius-norm bounds on the approximation error introduced by node summarization and sparsification thresholds. Empirically, on three benchmarks -- long-document AMR parsing, segment-level semantic role labeling (OntoNotes), and legal event extraction -- HSGM achieves \emph{2--4$\times$ inference speedup}, \emph{$>60\%$ reduction} in peak memory, and \emph{$\ge 95\%$} of baseline accuracy. Our approach unlocks scalable, accurate semantic modeling for ultra-long texts, enabling real-time and resource-constrained NLP applications.

  _Xiuyi Fan_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Uncertainty is a fundamental challenge in medical practice, but current medical AI systems fail to explicitly quantify or communicate uncertainty in a way that aligns with clinical reasoning. Existing XAI works focus on interpreting model predictions but do not capture the confidence or reliability of these predictions. Conversely, uncertainty estimation (UE) techniques provide confidence measures but lack intuitive explanations. The disconnect between these two areas limits AI adoption in medicine. To address this gap, we propose Explainable Uncertainty Estimation (XUE) that integrates explainability with uncertainty quantification to enhance trust and usability in medical AI. We systematically map medical uncertainty to AI uncertainty concepts and identify key challenges in implementing XUE. We outline technical directions for advancing XUE, including multimodal uncertainty quantification, model-agnostic visualization techniques, and uncertainty-aware decision support systems. Lastly, we propose guiding principles to ensure effective XUE realisation. Our analysis highlights the need for AI systems that not only generate reliable predictions but also articulate confidence levels in a clinically meaningful way. This work contributes to the development of trustworthy medical AI by bridging explainability and uncertainty, paving the way for AI systems that are aligned with real-world clinical complexities.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Accurate interpretation of soil moisture patterns is critical for irrigation scheduling and crop management, yet existing approaches for soil moisture time-series analysis either rely on threshold-based rules or data-hungry machine learning or deep learning models that are limited in adaptability and interpretability. In this study, we introduce SPADE (Soil moisture Pattern and Anomaly DEtection), an integrated framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to jointly detect irrigation patterns and anomalies in soil moisture time-series data. SPADE utilizes ChatGPT-4.1 for its advanced reasoning and instruction-following capabilities, enabling zero-shot analysis without requiring task-specific annotation or fine-tuning. By converting time-series data into a textual representation and designing domain-informed prompt templates, SPADE identifies irrigation events, estimates net irrigation gains, detects, classifies anomalies, and produces structured, interpretable reports. Experiments were conducted on real-world soil moisture sensor data from commercial and experimental farms cultivating multiple crops across the United States. Results demonstrate that SPADE outperforms the existing method in anomaly detection, achieving higher recall and F1 scores and accurately classifying anomaly types. Furthermore, SPADE achieved high precision and recall in detecting irrigation events, indicating its strong capability to capture irrigation patterns accurately. SPADE's reports provide interpretability and usability of soil moisture analytics. This study highlights the potential of LLMs as scalable, adaptable tools for precision agriculture, which is capable of integrating qualitative knowledge and data-driven reasoning to produce actionable insights for accurate soil moisture monitoring and improved irrigation scheduling from soil moisture time-series data.

  _Guanzhong Pan, Haibo Wang_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) are becoming increasingly widespread. Organizations that want to use AI for productivity now face an important decision. They can subscribe to commercial LLM services or deploy models on their own infrastructure. Cloud services from providers such as OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google are attractive because they provide easy access to state-of-the-art models and are easy to scale. However, concerns about data privacy, the difficulty of switching service providers, and long-term operating costs have driven interest in local deployment of open-source models. This paper presents a cost-benefit analysis framework to help organizations determine when on-premise LLM deployment becomes economically viable compared to commercial subscription services. We consider the hardware requirements, operational expenses, and performance benchmarks of the latest open-source models, including Qwen, Llama, Mistral, and etc. Then we compare the total cost of deploying these models locally with the major cloud providers subscription fee. Our findings provide an estimated breakeven point based on usage levels and performance needs. These results give organizations a practical framework for planning their LLM strategies.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Test-time scaling (TTS) has been shown to improve the performance of large language models (LLMs) by sampling and aggregating diverse reasoning paths. However, existing research has overlooked a critical issue: selection bias of reasoning strategies during scaling. Specifically, when generating reasoning processes, LLMs tend to follow certain strategies (e.g., algebraic solutions for math problems) while neglecting other valid alternatives (e.g., geometric solutions), resulting in insufficient exploration of the solution space. To further understand the impact of this bias, we present a theoretical analysis that reveals when it undermines the effectiveness of test-time scaling. Motivated by this theoretical insight, we introduce TTS-Uniform, a framework designed to mitigate the selection bias of reasoning strategies. It (i) identifies potential strategies, (ii) uniformly allocates the sampling budget across them, and (iii) filters out unstable strategies prior to aggregation. Experimental results show that TTS-Uniform significantly enhances scaling effectiveness across multiple mainstream LLMs and benchmark datasets.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In Constraint Programming, solving discrete minimization problems with hard and soft constraints can be done either using (i) soft global constraints, (ii) a reformulation into a linear program, or (iii) a reformulation into local cost functions. Approach (i) benefits from a vast catalog of constraints. Each soft constraint propagator communicates with other soft constraints only through the variable domains, resulting in weak lower bounds. Conversely, the approach (ii) provides a global view with strong bounds, but the size of the reformulation can be problematic. We focus on approach (iii) in which soft arc consistency (SAC) algorithms produce bounds of intermediate quality. Recently, the introduction of linear constraints as local cost functions increases their modeling expressiveness. We adapt an existing SAC algorithm to handle linear constraints. We show that our algorithm significantly improves the lower bounds compared to the original algorithm on several benchmarks, reducing solving time in some cases.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The increasing availability of open Earth Observation (EO) and agricultural datasets holds great potential for supporting sustainable land management. However, their high technical entry barrier limits accessibility for non-expert users. This study presents an open-source conversational assistant that integrates multimodal retrieval and large language models (LLMs) to enable natural language interaction with heterogeneous agricultural and geospatial data. The proposed architecture combines orthophotos, Sentinel-2 vegetation indices, and user-provided documents through retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), allowing the system to flexibly determine whether to rely on multimodal evidence, textual knowledge, or both in formulating an answer. To assess response quality, we adopt an LLM-as-a-judge methodology using Qwen3-32B in a zero-shot, unsupervised setting, applying direct scoring in a multi-dimensional quantitative evaluation framework. Preliminary results show that the system is capable of generating clear, relevant, and context-aware responses to agricultural queries, while remaining reproducible and scalable across geographic regions. The primary contributions of this work include an architecture for fusing multimodal EO and textual knowledge sources, a demonstration of lowering the barrier to access specialized agricultural information through natural language interaction, and an open and reproducible design.

  We introduce transductive program synthesis, a new formulation of the program synthesis task that explicitly leverages test inputs during synthesis. While prior approaches to program synthesis--whether based on natural language descriptions or input-output examples--typically aim to generalize from training examples, they often struggle with robustness, especially in real-world settings where training examples are limited and test inputs involve various edge cases. To address this, we propose a novel framework that improves robustness by treating synthesis as an active learning over a finite hypothesis class defined by programs' outputs. We use an LLM to predict outputs for selected test inputs and eliminate inconsistent hypotheses, where the inputs are chosen via a greedy maximin algorithm to minimize the number of LLM queries required. We evaluate our approach on four benchmarks: Playgol, MBPP+, 1D-ARC, and programmatic world modeling on MiniGrid. We demonstrate that our method significantly improves program synthesis in both accuracy and efficiency. We release our code atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Health informatics research is characterized by diverse data modalities, rapid knowledge expansion, and the need to integrate insights across biomedical science, data analytics, and clinical practice. These characteristics make it particularly well-suited for agent-based approaches that can automate knowledge exploration, manage complex workflows, and generate clinically meaningful outputs. Recent progress in large language model (LLM)-based agents has demonstrated promising capabilities in literature synthesis, data analysis, and even end-to-end research execution. However, existing systems remain limited for health informatics because they lack mechanisms to interpret medical visualizations and often overlook domain-specific quality requirements. To address these gaps, we introduce OpenLens AI, a fully automated framework tailored to health informatics. OpenLens AI integrates specialized agents for literature review, data analysis, code generation, and manuscript preparation, enhanced by vision-language feedback for medical visualization and quality control for reproducibility. The framework automates the entire research pipeline, producing publication-ready LaTeX manuscripts with transparent and traceable workflows, thereby offering a domain-adapted solution for advancing health informatics research.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Model (LLM)-based agentic systems have shown strong capabilities across various tasks. However, existing multi-agent frameworks often rely on static or task-level workflows, which either over-process simple queries or underperform on complex ones, while also neglecting the efficiency-performance trade-offs across heterogeneous LLMs. To address these limitations, we propose Difficulty-Aware Agentic Orchestration (DAAO), a dynamic framework that adapts workflow depth, operator selection, and LLM assignment based on the difficulty of each input query. DAAO comprises three interdependent modules: a variational autoencoder (VAE) for difficulty estimation, a modular operator allocator, and a cost- and performance-aware LLM router. By leveraging heterogeneous LLMs and dynamically tailoring workflows, DAAO enables fine-grained, query-specific reasoning strategies. DAAO outperforms prior multi-agent systems in both accuracy and inference efficiency across six benchmarks. We will release our code and implementation details upon publication.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Failure attribution in multi-agent systems -- pinpointing the exact step where a decisive error occurs -- is a critical yet unsolved challenge. Current methods treat this as a pattern recognition task over long conversation logs, leading to critically low step-level accuracy (below 17\%), which renders them impractical for debugging complex systems. Their core weakness is a fundamental inability to perform robust counterfactual reasoning: to determine if correcting a single action would have actually averted the task failure. To bridge this \emph{counterfactual inference gap}, we introduce Abduct-Act-Predict (A2P) Scaffolding, a novel agent framework that transforms failure attribution from pattern recognition into a structured causal inference task. A2P explicitly guides a large language model through a formal three-step reasoning process within a single inference pass: (1) Abduction, to infer the hidden root causes behind an agent's actions; (2) Action, to define a minimal corrective intervention; and (3) Prediction, to simulate the subsequent trajectory and verify if the intervention resolves the failure. This structured approach leverages the holistic context of the entire conversation while imposing a rigorous causal logic on the model's analysis. Our extensive experiments on the Who\&When benchmark demonstrate its efficacy. On the Algorithm-Generated dataset, A2P achieves 47.46\% step-level accuracy, a 2.85$\times$ improvement over the 16.67\% of the baseline. On the more complex Hand-Crafted dataset, it achieves 29.31\% step accuracy, a 2.43$\times$ improvement over the baseline's 12.07\%. By reframing the problem through a causal lens, A2P Scaffolding provides a robust, verifiable, and significantly more accurate solution for automated failure attribution.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Table reasoning is crucial for leveraging structured data in domains such as finance, healthcare, and scientific research. While large language models (LLMs) show promise in multi-step reasoning, purely text-based methods often struggle with the complex numerical computations and fine-grained operations inherently required in this task. Tool-integrated reasoning improves computational accuracy via explicit code execution, yet existing systems frequently rely on rigid patterns, supervised imitation, and lack true autonomous adaptability. In this paper, we present TableMind, an LLM-driven table reasoning agent that (i) autonomously performs multi-turn tool invocation, (ii) writes and executes data-analyzing code in a secure sandbox environment for data analysis and precise numerical reasoning, and (iii) exhibits high-level capabilities such as planning and self-reflection to adapt strategies. To realize these capabilities, we adopt a two-stage fine-tuning paradigm built on top of a powerful pre-trained language model: supervised fine-tuning on high-quality reasoning trajectories to establish effective tool usage patterns, followed by reinforcement fine-tuning to optimize multi-objective strategies. In particular, we propose Rank-Aware Policy Optimization (RAPO), which increases the update weight of high-quality trajectories when their output probabilities are lower than those of low-quality ones, thereby guiding the model more consistently toward better and more accurate answers. Extensive experiments on several mainstream benchmarks demonstrate that TableMind achieves superior performance compared to competitive baselines, yielding substantial gains in both reasoning accuracy and computational precision.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Generalizing to complex and temporally extended task objectives and safety constraints remains a critical challenge in reinforcement learning (RL). Linear temporal logic (LTL) offers a unified formalism to specify such requirements, yet existing methods are limited in their abilities to handle nested long-horizon tasks and safety constraints, and cannot identify situations when a subgoal is not satisfiable and an alternative should be sought. In this paper, we introduce GenZ-LTL, a method that enables zero-shot generalization to arbitrary LTL specifications. GenZ-LTL leverages the structure of B√ºchi automata to decompose an LTL task specification into sequences of reach-avoid subgoals. Contrary to the current state-of-the-art method that conditions on subgoal sequences, we show that it is more effective to achieve zero-shot generalization by solving these reach-avoid problems \textit{one subgoal at a time} through proper safe RL formulations. In addition, we introduce a novel subgoal-induced observation reduction technique that can mitigate the exponential complexity of subgoal-state combinations under realistic assumptions. Empirical results show that GenZ-LTL substantially outperforms existing methods in zero-shot generalization to unseen LTL specifications.

  Map applications are still largely point-and-click, making it difficult to ask map-centric questions or connect what a camera sees to the surrounding geospatial context with view-conditioned inputs. We introduce IMAIA, an interactive Maps AI Assistant that enables natural-language interaction with both vector (street) maps and satellite imagery, and augments camera inputs with geospatial intelligence to help users understand the world. IMAIA comprises two complementary components. Maps Plus treats the map as first-class context by parsing tiled vector/satellite views into a grid-aligned representation that a language model can query to resolve deictic references (e.g., ``the flower-shaped building next to the park in the top-right''). Places AI Smart Assistant (PAISA) performs camera-aware place understanding by fusing image--place embeddings with geospatial signals (location, heading, proximity) to ground a scene, surface salient attributes, and generate concise explanations. A lightweight multi-agent design keeps latency low and exposes interpretable intermediate decisions. Across map-centric QA and camera-to-place grounding tasks, IMAIA improves accuracy and responsiveness over strong baselines while remaining practical for user-facing deployments. By unifying language, maps, and geospatial cues, IMAIA moves beyond scripted tools toward conversational mapping that is both spatially grounded and broadly usable.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multi-agent systems (MAS) have emerged as a powerful paradigm for orchestrating large language models (LLMs) and specialized tools to collaboratively address complex tasks. However, existing MAS frameworks often require manual workflow configuration and lack native support for dynamic evolution and performance optimization. In addition, many MAS optimization algorithms are not integrated into a unified framework. In this paper, we present EvoAgentX, an open-source platform that automates the generation, execution, and evolutionary optimization of multi-agent workflows. EvoAgentX employs a modular architecture consisting of five core layers: the basic components, agent, workflow, evolving, and evaluation layers. Specifically, within the evolving layer, EvoAgentX integrates three MAS optimization algorithms, TextGrad, AFlow, and MIPRO, to iteratively refine agent prompts, tool configurations, and workflow topologies. We evaluate EvoAgentX on HotPotQA, MBPP, and MATH for multi-hop reasoning, code generation, and mathematical problem solving, respectively, and further assess it on real-world tasks using GAIA. Experimental results show that EvoAgentX consistently achieves significant performance improvements, including a 7.44% increase in HotPotQA F1, a 10.00% improvement in MBPP pass@1, a 10.00% gain in MATH solve accuracy, and an overall accuracy improvement of up to 20.00% on GAIA.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The integration of external knowledge through Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become foundational in enhancing large language models (LLMs) for knowledge-intensive tasks. However, existing RAG paradigms often overlook the cognitive step of applying knowledge, leaving a gap between retrieved facts and task-specific reasoning. In this work, we introduce RAG+, a principled and modular extension that explicitly incorporates application-aware reasoning into the RAG pipeline. RAG+ constructs a dual corpus consisting of knowledge and aligned application examples, created either manually or automatically, and retrieves both jointly during inference. This design enables LLMs not only to access relevant information but also to apply it within structured, goal-oriented reasoning processes. Experiments across mathematical, legal, and medical domains, conducted on multiple models, demonstrate that RAG+ consistently outperforms standard RAG variants, achieving average improvements of 3-5%, and peak gains up to 13.5% in complex scenarios. By bridging retrieval with actionable application, RAG+ advances a more cognitively grounded framework for knowledge integration, representing a step toward more interpretable and capable LLMs.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reward modeling is a key step in building safe foundation models when applying reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) to align Large Language Models (LLMs). However, reward modeling based on the Bradley-Terry (BT) model assumes a global reward function, failing to capture the inherently diverse and heterogeneous human preferences. Hence, such oversimplification limits LLMs from supporting personalization and pluralistic alignment. Theoretically, we show that when human preferences follow a mixture distribution of diverse subgroups, a single BT model has an irreducible error. While existing solutions, such as multi-objective learning with fine-grained annotations, help address this issue, they are costly and constrained by predefined attributes, failing to fully capture the richness of human values. In this work, we introduce MiCRo, a two-stage framework that enhances personalized preference learning by leveraging large-scale binary preference datasets without requiring explicit fine-grained annotations. In the first stage, MiCRo introduces context-aware mixture modeling approach to capture diverse human preferences. In the second stage, MiCRo integrates an online routing strategy that dynamically adapts mixture weights based on specific context to resolve ambiguity, allowing for efficient and scalable preference adaptation with minimal additional supervision. Experiments on multiple preference datasets demonstrate that MiCRo effectively captures diverse human preferences and significantly improves downstream personalization.

  Foundation models update slowly due to resource-intensive training, whereas domain-specific models evolve rapidly between releases. Model merging seeks to combine multiple expert models into a single, more capable model, reducing storage and serving costs while supporting decentralized development. Despite its potential, previous studies have primarily focused on merging visual classification models or Large Language Models (LLMs) for code and math tasks. Recently, Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) that extend LLMs through large-scale multimodal training have gained traction. However, there lacks a benchmark for model merging research that clearly divides the tasks for MLLM training and evaluation. In this paper, $\textbf{(i)}$ we introduce a model merging benchmark for MLLMs, which includes multiple tasks such as VQA, Geometry, Chart, OCR, and Grounding, studying both LoRA and full fine-tuning models. Moreover, we explore how model merging can combine different modalities (e.g., vision-language, audio-language, and video-language models), moving toward the Omni-language model. $\textbf{(ii)}$ We implement 10 model merging algorithms on the benchmark. Furthermore, we propose a novel method that removes noise from task vectors and robustly optimizes the merged vector based on a loss defined over task vector interactions, achieving an average performance gain of 2.48%. $\textbf{(iii)}$ We find that model merging offers a promising way for building improved MLLMs without requiring training data. Our results also demonstrate that the complementarity among multiple modalities outperforms individual modalities.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The proliferation of large models has intensified the need for efficient data valuation methods to quantify the contribution of individual data providers. Traditional approaches, such as game-theory-based Shapley value and influence-function-based techniques, face prohibitive computational costs or require access to full data and model training details, making them hardly achieve partial data valuation. To address this, we propose Unlearning Shapley, a novel framework that leverages machine unlearning to estimate data values efficiently. By unlearning target data from a pretrained model and measuring performance shifts on a reachable test set, our method computes Shapley values via Monte Carlo sampling, avoiding retraining and eliminating dependence on full data. Crucially, Unlearning Shapley supports both full and partial data valuation, making it scalable for large models (e.g., LLMs) and practical for data markets. Experiments on benchmark datasets and large-scale text corpora demonstrate that our approach matches the accuracy of state-of-the-art methods while reducing computational overhead by orders of magnitude. Further analysis confirms a strong correlation between estimated values and the true impact of data subsets, validating its reliability in real-world scenarios. This work bridges the gap between data valuation theory and practical deployment, offering a scalable, privacy-compliant solution for modern AI ecosystems.

  _Francesco Sovrano_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) can amplify misinformation, undermining societal goals like the UN SDGs. We study three documented drivers of misinformation (valence framing, information overload, and oversimplification) which are often shaped by one's default beliefs. Building on evidence that LLMs encode such defaults (e.g., "joy is positive," "math is complex") and can act as "bags of heuristics," we ask: can general belief-driven heuristics behind misinformative behaviour be recovered from LLMs as clear rules? A key obstacle is that global rule-extraction methods in explainable AI (XAI) are built for numerical inputs/outputs, not text. We address this by eliciting global LLM beliefs and mapping them to numerical scores via statistically reliable abstractions, thereby enabling off-the-shelf global XAI to detect belief-related heuristics in LLMs. To obtain ground truth, we hard-code bias-inducing nonlinear heuristics of increasing complexity (univariate, conjunctive, nonconvex) into popular LLMs (ChatGPT and Llama) via system instructions. This way, we find that RuleFit under-detects non-univariate biases, while global SHAP better approximates conjunctive ones but does not yield actionable rules. To bridge this gap, we propose RuleSHAP, a rule-extraction algorithm that couples global SHAP-value aggregations with rule induction to better capture non-univariate bias, improving heuristics detection over RuleFit by +94% (MRR@1) on average. Our results provide a practical pathway for revealing belief-driven biases in LLMs.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Few-shot relational learning on knowledge graph (KGs) aims to perform reasoning over relations with only a few training examples. While current methods have focused primarily on leveraging specific relational information, rich semantics inherent in KGs have been largely overlooked. To bridge this gap, we propose PromptMeta, a novel prompted meta-learning framework that seamlessly integrates meta-semantics with relational information for few-shot relational learning. PromptMeta introduces two core innovations: (1) a Meta-Semantic Prompt (MSP) pool that learns and consolidates high-level meta-semantics shared across tasks, enabling effective knowledge transfer and adaptation to newly emerging relations; and (2) a learnable fusion mechanism that dynamically combines meta-semantics with task-specific relational information tailored to different few-shot tasks. Both components are optimized jointly with model parameters within a meta-learning framework. Extensive experiments and analyses on two real-world KG benchmarks validate the effectiveness of PromptMeta in adapting to new relations with limited supervision.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Misinformation spans various domains, but detection methods trained on specific domains often perform poorly when applied to others. With the rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs), researchers have begun to utilize LLMs for cross-domain misinformation detection. However, existing LLM-based methods often fail to adequately analyze news in the target domain, limiting their detection capabilities. More importantly, these methods typically rely on manually designed decision rules, which are limited by domain knowledge and expert experience, thus limiting the generalizability of decision rules to different domains. To address these issues, we propose a MultiAgent Framework for cross-domain misinformation detection with Automated Decision Rule Optimization (MARO). Under this framework, we first employs multiple expert agents to analyze target-domain news. Subsequently, we introduce a question-reflection mechanism that guides expert agents to facilitate higherquality analysis. Furthermore, we propose a decision rule optimization approach based on carefully-designed cross-domain validation tasks to iteratively enhance the effectiveness of decision rules in different domains. Experimental results and in-depth analysis on commonlyused datasets demonstrate that MARO achieves significant improvements over existing methods.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in reasoning, exemplified by the success of OpenAI-o1 and DeepSeek-R1. However, integrating reasoning with external search processes remains challenging, especially for complex multi-hop questions requiring multiple retrieval steps. We propose ReSearch, a novel framework that trains LLMs to Reason with Search via reinforcement learning without using any supervised data on reasoning steps. Our approach treats search operations as integral components of the reasoning chain, where when and how to perform searches is guided by text-based thinking, and search results subsequently influence further reasoning. We train ReSearch on Qwen2.5-7B(-Instruct) and Qwen2.5-32B(-Instruct) models and conduct extensive experiments. Despite being trained on only one dataset, our models demonstrate strong generalizability across various benchmarks. Analysis reveals that ReSearch naturally elicits advanced reasoning capabilities such as reflection and self-correction during the reinforcement learning process.

  Supervised machine learning classifiers sometimes face challenges related to the performance, accuracy, or overfitting. This paper introduces the Artificial Liver Classifier (ALC), a novel supervised learning model inspired by the human liver's detoxification function. The ALC is characterized by its simplicity, speed, capability to reduce overfitting, and effectiveness in addressing multi-class classification problems through straightforward mathematical operations. To optimize the ALC's parameters, an improved FOX optimization algorithm (IFOX) is employed during training. We evaluate the proposed ALC on five benchmark datasets: Iris Flower, Breast Cancer Wisconsin, Wine, Voice Gender, and MNIST. The results demonstrate competitive performance, with ALC achieving up to 100\% accuracy on the Iris dataset--surpassing logistic regression, multilayer perceptron, and support vector machine--and 99.12\% accuracy on the Breast Cancer dataset, outperforming XGBoost and logistic regression. Across all datasets, ALC consistently shows smaller generalization gaps and lower loss values compared to conventional classifiers. These findings highlight the potential of biologically inspired models to develop efficient machine learning classifiers and open new avenues for innovation in the field.

  Intent classification models have made a lot of progress in recent years. However, previous studies primarily focus on high-resource languages datasets, which results in a gap for low-resource languages and for regions with a high rate of illiterate people where languages are more spoken than read or written. This is the case in Senegal, for example, where Wolof is spoken by around 90\% of the population, with an illiteracy rate of 42\% for the country. Wolof is actually spoken by more than 10 million people in West African region. To tackle such limitations, we release a Wolof Intent Classification Dataset (WolBanking77), for academic research in intent classification. WolBanking77 currently contains 9,791 text sentences in the banking domain and more than 4 hours of spoken sentences. Experiments on various baselines are conducted in this work, including text and voice state-of-the-art models. The results are very promising on this current dataset. This paper also provides detailed analyses of the contents of the data. We report baseline f1-score and word error rate metrics respectively on NLP and ASR models trained on WolBanking77 dataset and also comparisons between models. We plan to share and conduct dataset maintenance, updates and to release open-source code.

  Conceptual spaces represent entities and concepts using cognitively meaningful dimensions, typically referring to perceptual features. Such representations are widely used in cognitive science and have the potential to serve as a cornerstone for explainable AI. Unfortunately, they have proven notoriously difficult to learn, although recent LLMs appear to capture the required perceptual features to a remarkable extent. Nonetheless, practical methods for extracting the corresponding conceptual spaces are currently still lacking. While various methods exist for extracting embeddings from LLMs, extracting conceptual spaces also requires us to encode the underlying features. In this paper, we propose a strategy in which features (e.g. sweetness) are encoded by embedding the description of a corresponding prototype (e.g. a very sweet food). To improve this strategy, we fine-tune the LLM to align the prototype embeddings with the corresponding conceptual space dimensions. Our empirical analysis finds this approach to be highly effective.

  The growing disparity between the exponential scaling of computational resources and the finite growth of high-quality text data now constrains conventional scaling approaches for large language models (LLMs). To address this challenge, we introduce Reinforcement Learning on Pre-Training data (RLPT), a new training-time scaling paradigm for optimizing LLMs. In contrast to prior approaches that scale training primarily through supervised learning, RLPT enables the policy to autonomously explore meaningful trajectories to learn from pre-training data and improve its capability through reinforcement learning (RL). While existing RL strategies such as reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) and reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) rely on human annotation for reward construction, RLPT eliminates this dependency by deriving reward signals directly from pre-training data. Specifically, it adopts a next-segment reasoning objective, rewarding the policy for accurately predicting subsequent text segments conditioned on the preceding context. This formulation allows RL to be scaled on pre-training data, encouraging the exploration of richer trajectories across broader contexts and thereby fostering more generalizable reasoning skills. Extensive experiments on both general-domain and mathematical reasoning benchmarks across multiple models validate the effectiveness of RLPT. For example, when applied to Qwen3-4B-Base, RLPT yields absolute improvements of $3.0$, $5.1$, $8.1$, $6.0$, $6.6$, and $5.3$ on MMLU, MMLU-Pro, GPQA-Diamond, KOR-Bench, AIME24, and AIME25, respectively. The results further demonstrate favorable scaling behavior, suggesting strong potential for continued gains with more compute. In addition, RLPT provides a solid foundation, extending the reasoning boundaries of LLMs and enhancing RLVR performance.

  _Gabriele Berton, Jayakrishnan Unnikrishnan, Son Tran, Mubarak Shah_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) face significant computational challenges when processing long contexts due to the quadratic complexity of self-attention. While soft context compression methods, which map input text to smaller latent representations, have shown promise, their real-world adoption is limited. Existing techniques typically compress the context as a single unit, which leads to quadratic compression complexity and an inability to reuse computations across queries with overlapping contexts. In this work, we introduce CompLLM, a soft compression technique designed for practical deployment. Instead of processing the context holistically, CompLLM divides it into segments and compresses each one independently. This simple design choice yields three critical properties: efficiency, as the compression step scales linearly with the context length; scalability, enabling models trained on short sequences (e.g., 1k tokens) to generalize to contexts of 100k tokens; and reusability, allowing compressed segments to be cached and reused across different queries. Our experiments show that with a 2x compression rate, at high context lengths CompLLM speeds up Time To First Token (TTFT) by up to 4x and reduces the KV cache size by 50%. Furthermore, CompLLM achieves performance comparable to that obtained with the uncompressed context, and even surpasses it on very long sequences, demonstrating its effectiveness and practical utility.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Attention-based models have become the leading approach in modeling medical language for Natural Language Processing (NLP) in clinical notes. These models outperform traditional techniques by effectively capturing contextual rep- resentations of language. In this research a comparative analysis is done amongst pre- trained attention based models namely Bert Base, BioBert, two variations of Bio+Clinical Bert, RoBerta, and Clinical Long- former on task related to Electronic Health Record (EHR) information extraction. The tasks from Track 1 of Harvard Medical School's 2022 National Clinical NLP Challenges (n2c2) are considered for this comparison, with the Contextualized Medication Event Dataset (CMED) given for these task. CMED is a dataset of unstructured EHRs and annotated notes that contain task relevant information about the EHRs. The goal of the challenge is to develop effective solutions for extracting contextual information related to patient medication events from EHRs using data driven methods. Each pre-trained model is fine-tuned and applied on CMED to perform medication extraction, medical event detection, and multi-dimensional medication event context classification. Pro- cessing methods are also detailed for breaking down EHRs for compatibility with the applied models. Performance analysis has been carried out using a script based on constructing medical terms from the evaluation portion of CMED with metrics including recall, precision, and F1-Score. The results demonstrate that models pre-trained on clinical data are more effective in detecting medication and medication events, but Bert Base, pre- trained on general domain data showed to be the most effective for classifying the context of events related to medications.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world applications, yet their ability to make context-aware safety decisions remains limited. Existing methods often fail to balance oversensitivity (unjustified refusals of benign queries) and undersensitivity (missed detection of visually grounded risks), leaving a persistent gap in safety alignment. To address this issue, we introduce Safety-aware Contrastive Decoding (SafeCoDe), a lightweight and model-agnostic decoding framework that dynamically adjusts token generation based on multimodal context. SafeCoDe operates in two stages: (1) a contrastive decoding mechanism that highlights tokens sensitive to visual context by contrasting real and Gaussian-noised images, and (2) a global-aware token modulation strategy that integrates scene-level reasoning with token-level adjustment to adapt refusals according to the predicted safety verdict. Extensive experiments across diverse MLLM architectures and safety benchmarks, covering undersensitivity, oversensitivity, and general safety evaluations, show that SafeCoDe consistently improves context-sensitive refusal behaviors while preserving model helpfulness.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly trained with reinforcement learning (RL) as autonomous agents that reason and act over long horizons in interactive environments.However, sparse and sometimes unverifiable rewards make temporal credit assignment extremely challenging.Recent work attempts to integrate process supervision into agent learning but suffers from biased annotation, reward hacking, high-variance from overly fine-grained signals or failtures when state overlap is rare.We therefore introduce Online Process Reward Learning (OPRL), a general credit-assignment strategy for agentic RL that integrates seamlessly with standard on-policy algorithms without relying on additional rollouts or explicit step labels.In OPRL, we optimize an implicit process reward model (PRM) alternately with the agent's policy to transform trajectory preferences into implicit step rewards through a trajectory-based DPO objective.These step rewards are then used to compute step-level advantages, which are combined with episode-level advantages from outcome rewards for policy update, creating a self-reinforcing loop.Theoretical findings guarantee that the learned step rewards are consistent with trajectory preferences and act as potential-based shaping rewards, providing bounded gradients to stabilize training.Empirically, we evaluate OPRL on three distinct agent benmarks, including WebShop and VisualSokoban, as well as open-ended social interactions with unverfiable rewards in SOTOPIA.Crucially, OPRL shows superior performance over frontier LLMs and strong RL baselines across domains, achieving state-of-the-art results with higher sample-efficiency and lower variance during training.Further analysis also demonstrates the efficient exploration by OPRL using fewer actions, underscoring its potential for agentic learning in real-world scenarios.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The use of continuous instead of discrete tokens during the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) phase of reasoning LLMs has garnered attention recently, based on the intuition that a continuous mixture of discrete tokens could simulate a superposition of several reasoning paths simultaneously. Theoretical results have formally proven that continuous tokens have much greater expressivity and can solve specific problems more efficiently. However, practical use of continuous tokens has been limited by strong training difficulties: previous works either just use continuous tokens at inference time on a pre-trained discrete-token model, or must distill the continuous CoT from ground-truth discrete CoTs and face computational costs that limit the CoT to very few tokens.This is the first work introducing a scalable method to learn continuous CoTs via reinforcement learning (RL), without distilling from reference discrete CoTs. We use "soft" tokens: mixtures of tokens together with noise on the input embedding to provide RL exploration. Computational overhead is minimal, enabling us to learn continuous CoTs with hundreds of tokens. On math reasoning benchmarks with Llama and Qwen models up to 8B, training with continuous CoTs match discrete-token CoTs for pass@1 and surpass them for pass@32, showing greater CoT diversity. In systematic comparisons, the best-performing scenario is to train with continuous CoT tokens then use discrete tokens for inference, meaning the "soft" models can be deployed in a standard way. Finally, we show continuous CoT RL training better preserves the predictions of the base model on out-of-domain tasks, thus providing a softer touch to the base model.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  AI "slop" is an increasingly popular term used to describe low-quality AI-generated text, but there is currently no agreed upon definition of this term nor a means to measure its occurrence. In this work, we develop a taxonomy of "slop" through interviews with experts in NLP, writing, and philosophy, and propose a set of interpretable dimensions for its assessment in text. Through span-level annotation, we find that binary "slop" judgments are (somewhat) subjective, but such determinations nonetheless correlate with latent dimensions such as coherence and relevance. Our framework can be used to evaluate AI-generated text in both detection and binary preference tasks, potentially offering new insights into the linguistic and stylistic factors that contribute to quality judgments.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The rapid growth of scientific literature demands efficient methods to organize and synthesize research findings. Existing taxonomy construction methods, leveraging unsupervised clustering or direct prompting of large language models (LLMs), often lack coherence and granularity. We propose a novel context-aware hierarchical taxonomy generation framework that integrates LLM-guided multi-aspect encoding with dynamic clustering. Our method leverages LLMs to identify key aspects of each paper (e.g., methodology, dataset, evaluation) and generates aspect-specific paper summaries, which are then encoded and clustered along each aspect to form a coherent hierarchy. In addition, we introduce a new evaluation benchmark of 156 expert-crafted taxonomies encompassing 11.6k papers, providing the first naturally annotated dataset for this task. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms prior approaches, achieving state-of-the-art performance in taxonomy coherence, granularity, and interpretability.

  We introduce KyrgyzNER, the first manually annotated named entity recognition dataset for the Kyrgyz language. Comprising 1,499 news articles from thethis http URLnews portal, the dataset contains 10,900 sentences and 39,075 entity mentions across 27 named entity classes. We show our annotation scheme, discuss the challenges encountered in the annotation process, and present the descriptive statistics. We also evaluate several named entity recognition models, including traditional sequence labeling approaches based on conditional random fields and state-of-the-art multilingual transformer-based models fine-tuned on our dataset. While all models show difficulties with rare entity categories, models such as the multilingual RoBERTa variant pretrained on a large corpus across many languages achieve a promising balance between precision and recall. These findings emphasize both the challenges and opportunities of using multilingual pretrained models for processing languages with limited resources. Although the multilingual RoBERTa model performed best, other multilingual models yielded comparable results. This suggests that future work exploring more granular annotation schemes may offer deeper insights for Kyrgyz language processing pipelines evaluation.

  _Hiram Ring_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  A repeated claim in linguistics is that the majority of linguistic utterances are unique. For example, Pinker (1994: 10), summarizing an argument by Noam Chomsky, states that "virtually every sentence that a person utters or understands is a brand-new combination of words, appearing for the first time in the history of the universe." With the increased availability of large corpora, this is a claim that can be empirically investigated. The current paper addresses the question by using the NLTK Python library to parse corpora of different genres, providing counts of exact string matches in each. Results show that while completely unique sentences are often the majority of corpora, this is highly constrained by genre, and that duplicate sentences are not an insignificant part of any individual corpus.

  Over the past decade, Computational Linguistics (CL) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) have evolved rapidly, especially with the advent of Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs). This shift has transformed research goals and priorities, from Lexical and Semantic Resources to Language Modelling and Multimodality. In this study, we track the research trends of the Italian CL and NLP community through an analysis of the contributions to CLiC-it, arguably the leading Italian conference in the field. We compile the proceedings from the first 10 editions of the CLiC-it conference (from 2014 to 2024) into the CLiC-it Corpus, providing a comprehensive analysis of both its metadata, including author provenance, gender, affiliations, and more, as well as the content of the papers themselves, which address various topics. Our goal is to provide the Italian and international research communities with valuable insights into emerging trends and key developments over time, supporting informed decisions and future directions in the field.

  Scaling model parameters has become the de facto strategy for improving NLP systems, but it comes with substantial computational costs. Test-Time Scaling (TTS) offers an alternative by allocating more computation at inference: generating multiple candidates and selecting the best. While effective in tasks such as mathematical reasoning, TTS has not been systematically explored for machine translation (MT). In this paper, we present the first systematic study of TTS for MT, investigating a simple but practical best-of-N framework on WMT24 benchmarks. Our experiments cover six high-resource and one low-resource language pairs, five model sizes (3B-72B), and various TTS compute budget (N up to 1024). Our results show that a) For high-resource languages, TTS generally improves translation quality according to multiple neural MT evaluation metrics, and our human evaluation confirms these gains; b) Augmenting smaller models with large $N$ can match or surpass larger models at $N{=}1$ with more compute cost; c) Under fixed compute budgets, larger models are typically more efficient, and TTS can degrade quality due to metric blind spots in low-resource cases.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  End-to-End Speech Translation (E2E-ST) is the task of translating source speech directly into target text bypassing the intermediate transcription step. The representation discrepancy between the speech and text modalities has motivated research on what is known as bridging the modality gap. State-of-the-art methods addressed this by aligning speech and text representations on the word or token level. Unfortunately, this requires an alignment tool that is not available for all languages. Although this issue has been addressed by aligning speech and text embeddings using nearest-neighbor similarity search, it does not lead to accurate alignments. In this work, we adapt Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) for aligning speech and text embeddings during training. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in bridging the modality gap in E2E-ST. Compared to previous work, our method produces more accurate alignments and achieves comparable E2E-ST results while being significantly faster. Furthermore, our method outperforms previous work in low resource settings on 5 out of 6 language directions.

  Recent works in Natural Language Inference (NLI) and related tasks, such as automated fact-checking, employ atomic fact decomposition to enhance interpretability and robustness. For this, existing methods rely on resource-intensive generative large language models (LLMs) to perform decomposition. We propose JEDI, an encoder-only architecture that jointly performs extractive atomic fact decomposition and interpretable inference without requiring generative models during inference. To facilitate training, we produce a large corpus of synthetic rationales covering multiple NLI benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that JEDI achieves competitive accuracy in distribution and significantly improves robustness out of distribution and in adversarial settings over models based solely on extractive rationale supervision. Our findings show that interpretability and robust generalization in NLI can be realized using encoder-only architectures and synthetic rationales. Code and data available atthis https URL

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Detecting AI-generated text is an increasing necessity to combat misuse of LLMs in education, business compliance, journalism, and social media, where synthetic fluency can mask misinformation or deception. While prior detectors often rely on token-level likelihoods or opaque black-box classifiers, these approaches struggle against high-quality generations and offer little interpretability. In this work, we propose DivEye, a novel detection framework that captures how unpredictability fluctuates across a text using surprisal-based features. Motivated by the observation that human-authored text exhibits richer variability in lexical and structural unpredictability than LLM outputs, DivEye captures this signal through a set of interpretable statistical features. Our method outperforms existing zero-shot detectors by up to 33.2% and achieves competitive performance with fine-tuned baselines across multiple benchmarks. DivEye is robust to paraphrasing and adversarial attacks, generalizes well across domains and models, and improves the performance of existing detectors by up to 18.7% when used as an auxiliary signal. Beyond detection, DivEye provides interpretable insights into why a text is flagged, pointing to rhythmic unpredictability as a powerful and underexplored signal for LLM detection.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  With the rapid advancement of large language model technology, there is growing interest in whether multi-feature approaches can significantly improve AI text detection beyond what single neural models achieve. While intuition suggests that combining semantic, syntactic, and statistical features should provide complementary signals, this assumption has not been rigorously tested with modern LLM-generated text. This paper provides a systematic empirical investigation of multi-hierarchical feature integration for AI text detection, specifically testing whether the computational overhead of combining multiple feature types is justified by performance gains. We implement MHFD (Multi-Hierarchical Feature Detection), integrating DeBERTa-based semantic analysis, syntactic parsing, and statistical probability features through adaptive fusion. Our investigation reveals important negative results: despite theoretical expectations, multi-feature integration provides minimal benefits (0.4-0.5% improvement) while incurring substantial computational costs (4.2x overhead), suggesting that modern neural language models may already capture most relevant detection signals efficiently. Experimental results on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that the MHFD method achieves 89.7% accuracy in in-domain detection and maintains 84.2% stable performance in cross-domain detection, showing modest improvements of 0.4-2.6% over existing methods.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Keyphrase extraction is a fundamental task in natural language processing. However, existing unsupervised prompt-based methods for Large Language Models (LLMs) often rely on single-stage inference pipelines with uniform prompting, regardless of document length or LLM backbone. Such one-size-fits-all designs hinder the full exploitation of LLMs' reasoning and generation capabilities, especially given the complexity of keyphrase extraction across diverse scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose MAPEX, the first framework that introduces multi-agent collaboration into keyphrase extraction. MAPEX coordinates LLM-based agents through modules for expert recruitment, candidate extraction, topic guidance, knowledge augmentation, and post-processing. A dual-path strategy dynamically adapts to document length: knowledge-driven extraction for short texts and topic-guided extraction for long texts. Extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets across three different LLMs demonstrate its strong generalization and universality, outperforming the state-of-the-art unsupervised method by 2.44\% and standard LLM baselines by 4.01\% in F1@5 on average.

  As fine-tuning becomes the dominant paradigm for improving large language models (LLMs), understanding what changes during this process is increasingly important. Traditional benchmarking often fails to explain why one model outperforms another. In this work, we use model diffing, a mechanistic interpretability approach, to analyze the specific capability differences between Gemma-2-9b-it and a SimPO-enhanced variant. Using crosscoders, we identify and categorize latent representations that differentiate the two models. We find that SimPO acquired latent concepts predominantly enhance safety mechanisms (+32.8%), multilingual capabilities (+43.8%), and instruction-following (+151.7%), while its additional training also reduces emphasis on model self-reference (-44.1%) and hallucination management (-68.5%). Our analysis shows that model diffing can yield fine-grained insights beyond leaderboard metrics, attributing performance gaps to concrete mechanistic capabilities. This approach offers a transparent and targeted framework for comparing LLMs.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs), as a novel information technology, are seeing increasing adoption in the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) field. They have shown their potential to streamline processes throughout the building lifecycle. However, the robustness and reliability of LLMs in such a specialized and safety-critical domain remain to be evaluated. To address this challenge, this paper establishes AECBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to quantify the strengths and limitations of current LLMs in the AEC domain. The benchmark defines 23 representative tasks within a five-level cognition-oriented evaluation framework encompassing Knowledge Memorization, Understanding, Reasoning, Calculation, and Application. These tasks were derived from authentic AEC practice, with scope ranging from codes retrieval to specialized documents generation. Subsequently, a 4,800-question dataset encompassing diverse formats, including open-ended questions, was crafted primarily by engineers and validated through a two-round expert review. Furthermore, an LLM-as-a-Judge approach was introduced to provide a scalable and consistent methodology for evaluating complex, long-form responses leveraging expert-derived rubrics. Through the evaluation of nine LLMs, a clear performance decline across five cognitive levels was revealed. Despite demonstrating proficiency in foundational tasks at the Knowledge Memorization and Understanding levels, the models showed significant performance deficits, particularly in interpreting knowledge from tables in building codes, executing complex reasoning and calculation, and generating domain-specific documents. Consequently, this study lays the groundwork for future research and development aimed at the robust and reliable integration of LLMs into safety-critical engineering practices.

  A multitude of interconnected risk events -- ranging from regulatory changes to geopolitical tensions -- can trigger ripple effects across firms. Identifying inter-firm risk relations is thus crucial for applications like portfolio management and investment strategy. Traditionally, such assessments rely on expert judgment and manual analysis, which are, however, subjective, labor-intensive, and difficult to scale. To address this, we propose a systematic method for extracting inter-firm risk relations using Form 10-K filings -- authoritative, standardized financial documents -- as our data source. Leveraging recent advances in natural language processing, our approach captures implicit and abstract risk connections through unsupervised fine-tuning based on chronological and lexical patterns in the filings. This enables the development of a domain-specific financial encoder with a deeper contextual understanding and introduces a quantitative risk relation score for transparency, interpretable analysis. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms strong baselines across multiple evaluation settings.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance across natural language processing (NLP) tasks. As real-world applications increasingly demand longer context windows, continued pretraining and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on long-context data has become a common approach. While the effects of data length in continued pretraining have been extensively studied, their implications for SFT remain unclear. In this work, we systematically investigate how SFT data length influences LLM behavior on short-context tasks. Counterintuitively, we find that long-context SFT improves short-context performance, contrary to the commonly observed degradation from long-context pretraining. To uncover the underlying mechanisms of this phenomenon, we first decouple and analyze two key components, Multi-Head Attention (MHA) and Feed-Forward Network (FFN), and show that both independently benefit from long-context SFT. We further study their interaction and reveal a knowledge preference bias: long-context SFT promotes contextual knowledge, while short-context SFT favors parametric knowledge, making exclusive reliance on long-context SFT suboptimal. Finally, we demonstrate that hybrid training mitigates this bias, offering explainable guidance for fine-tuning LLMs.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Subword tokenizers trained on multilingual corpora naturally produce overlapping tokens across languages. Does token overlap facilitate cross-lingual transfer or instead introduce interference between languages? Prior work offers mixed evidence, partly due to varied setups and confounders, such as token frequency or subword segmentation granularity. To address this question, we devise a controlled experiment where we train bilingual autoregressive models on multiple language pairs under systematically varied vocabulary overlap settings. Crucially, we explore a new dimension to understanding how overlap affects transfer: the semantic similarity of tokens shared across languages. We first analyze our models' hidden representations and find that overlap of any kind creates embedding spaces that capture cross-lingual semantic relationships, while this effect is much weaker in models with disjoint vocabularies. On XNLI and XQuAD, we find that models with overlap outperform models with disjoint vocabularies, and that transfer performance generally improves as overlap increases. Overall, our findings highlight the advantages of token overlap in multilingual models and show that substantial shared vocabulary remains a beneficial design choice for multilingual tokenizers.

  Dynamic Text-Attribute Graphs (DyTAGs), characterized by time-evolving graph interactions and associated text attributes, are prevalent in real-world applications. Existing methods, such as Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Large Language Models (LLMs), mostly focus on static TAGs. Extending these existing methods to DyTAGs is challenging as they largely neglect the recent-global temporal semantics: the recent semantic dependencies among interaction texts and the global semantic evolution of nodes over time. Furthermore, applying LLMs to the abundant and evolving text in DyTAGs faces efficiency issues. To tackle these challenges, we propose Dynamic Global-Recent Adaptive Semantic Processing (DyGRASP), a novel method that leverages LLMs and temporal GNNs to efficiently and effectively reason on DyTAGs. Specifically, we first design a node-centric implicit reasoning method together with a sliding window mechanism to efficiently capture recent temporal semantics. In addition, to capture global semantic dynamics of nodes, we leverage explicit reasoning with tailored prompts and an RNN-like chain structure to infer long-term semantics. Lastly, we intricately integrate the recent and global temporal semantics as well as the dynamic graph structural information using updating and merging layers. Extensive experiments on DyTAG benchmarks demonstrate DyGRASP's superiority, achieving up to 34% improvement in Hit@10 for destination node retrieval task. Besides, DyGRASP exhibits strong generalization across different temporal GNNs and LLMs.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Model-based agents(LLM-based agents) are increasingly deployed in customer service, yet they often forget across sessions, repeat errors, and lack mechanisms for continual self-improvement. This makes them unreliable in dynamic settings where stability and consistency are critical. To better evaluate these properties, we emphasize two indicators: task success rate as a measure of overall effectiveness, and consistency metrics such as Pass$^k$ to capture reliability across multiple trials. To address the limitations of existing approaches, we propose MemOrb, a lightweight and plug-and-play verbal reinforcement memory layer that distills multi-turn interactions into compact strategy reflections. These reflections are stored in a shared memory bank and retrieved to guide decision-making, without requiring any fine-tuning. Experiments show that MemOrb significantly improves both success rate and stability, achieving up to a 63 percentage-point gain in multi-turn success rate and delivering more consistent performance across repeated trials. Our results demonstrate that structured reflection is a powerful mechanism for enhancing long-term reliability of frozen LLM agents in customer service scenarios.

  LLM-as-a-judge has become a promising paradigm for using large language models (LLMs) to evaluate natural language generation (NLG), but the uncertainty of its evaluation remains underexplored. This lack of reliability may limit its deployment in many applications. This work presents the first framework to analyze the uncertainty by offering a prediction interval of LLM-based scoring via conformal prediction. Conformal prediction constructs continuous prediction intervals from a single evaluation run, and we design an ordinal boundary adjustment for discrete rating tasks. We also suggest a midpoint-based score within the interval as a low-bias alternative to raw model score and weighted average. We perform extensive experiments and analysis, which show that conformal prediction can provide valid prediction interval with coverage guarantees. We also explore the usefulness of interval midpoint and judge reprompting for better judgment.

  Parameter-Preserving Knowledge Editing (PPKE) enables updating models with new or corrected information without retraining or parameter adjustment. Recent PPKE approaches based on knowledge graphs (KG) to extend knowledge editing (KE) capabilities to multi-hop question answering (MHQA). However, these methods often lack consistency, leading to knowledge contamination, unstable updates, and retrieval behaviors that fail to reflect the intended edits. Such inconsistencies undermine the reliability of PPKE in multi- hop reasoning. We present CAPE-KG, Consistency-Aware Parameter-Preserving Editing with Knowledge Graphs, a novel consistency-aware framework for PPKE on MHQA. CAPE-KG ensures KG construction, update, and retrieval are always aligned with the requirements of the MHQA task, maintaining coherent reasoning over both unedited and edited knowledge. Extensive experiments on the MQuAKE benchmark show accuracy improvements in PPKE performance for MHQA, demonstrating the effectiveness of addressing consistency in PPKE.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  To assist users in complex tasks, LLMs generate plans: step-by-step instructions towards a goal. While alignment methods aim to ensure LLM plans are helpful, they train (RLHF) or evaluate (ChatbotArena) on what users prefer, assuming this reflects what helps them. We test this with Planorama: an interface where 126 users answer 300 multi-step questions with LLM plans. We get 4388 plan executions and 5584 comparisons to measure plan helpfulness (QA success) and user preferences on plans, and recreate the setup in agents and reward models to see if they simulate or prefer what helps users. We expose: 1) user/model preferences and agent success do not accurately predict which plans help users, so common alignment feedback can misalign with helpfulness; 2) this gap is not due to user-specific preferences, as users are similarly successful when using plans they prefer/disprefer; 3) surface-level cues like brevity and question similarity strongly link to preferences, but such biases fail to predict helpfulness. In all, we argue aligning helpful LLMs needs feedback from real user interactions, not just preferences of what looks helpful, so we discuss the plan NLP researchers can execute to solve this problem.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent unified models such as GPT-5 have achieved encouraging progress on vision-language tasks. However, these unified models typically fail to correctly understand ECG signals and provide accurate medical diagnoses, nor can they correctly generate ECG signals. To address these limitations, we propose UniECG, the first unified model for ECG capable of concurrently performing evidence-based ECG interpretation and text-conditioned ECG generation tasks. Through a decoupled two-stage training approach, the model first learns evidence-based interpretation skills (ECG-to-Text), and then injects ECG generation capabilities (Text-to-ECG) via latent space alignment. UniECG can autonomously choose to interpret or generate an ECG based on user input, significantly extending the capability boundaries of current ECG models. Our code and checkpoints will be made publicly available atthis https URLupon acceptance.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Fine-tuning large pre-trained models for downstream tasks has become a fundamental approach in natural language processing. Fully fine-tuning all model parameters is computationally expensive and memory-intensive, especially in resource-constrained environments. Existing parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods reduce the number of trainable parameters but typically overlook the varying sensitivity of different model layers and the importance of training data. In this work, we propose TsqLoRA, a novel method that integrates data-quality-driven selection with sensitivity-aware low-rank adaptation, consisted of two main components: a quality-aware sampling mechanism for selecting the most informative training data, and a dynamic rank allocation module that adjusts the rank of each layer based on its sensitivity to parameter updates. The experimental results demonstrate that TsqLoRA improves fine-tuning efficiency while maintaining or even improving performance on a variety of NLP tasks.

  _Yeongbin Seo, Gayoung Kim, Jaehyung Kim, Jinyoung Yeo_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As large language models (LLMs) are pretrained on massive web corpora, careful selection of data becomes essential to ensure effective and efficient learning. While perplexity (PPL)-based filtering has shown strong performance, it suffers from drawbacks: substantial time costs and inherent unreliability of the model when handling noisy or out-of-distribution samples. In this work, we propose a simple yet powerful alternative: a prior-based data filtering method that estimates token priors using corpus-level term frequency statistics, inspired by linguistic insights on word roles and lexical density. Our approach filters documents based on the mean and standard deviation of token priors, serving as a fast proxy to PPL while requiring no model inference. Despite its simplicity, the prior-based filter achieves the highest average performance across 20 downstream benchmarks, while reducing time cost by over 1000x compared to PPL-based filtering. We further demonstrate its applicability to symbolic languages such as code and math, and its dynamic adaptability to multilingual corpora without supervision

  _Jin Young Kim, Ji Won Yoon_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recently, inference-time reasoning strategies have further improved the accuracy of large language models (LLMs), but their effectiveness on smaller models remains unclear. Based on the observation that conventional approaches often fail to improve performance in this context, we propose \textbf{C}ycle-\textbf{C}onsistency in \textbf{Q}uestion \textbf{A}nswering (CCQA), a novel reasoning method that can be effectively applied to SLMs. Inspired by cycle consistency, CCQA generates a question from each reasoning path and answer, evaluates each by its similarity to the original question, and then selects the candidate solution with the highest similarity score as the final response. Since conventional SLMs struggle to generate accurate questions from their own reasoning paths and answers, we employ a lightweight Flan-T5 model specialized for question generation to support this process efficiently. From the experimental results, it is verified that CCQA consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods across eight models on mathematical and commonsense reasoning benchmarks. Furthermore, our method establishes a new practical baseline for efficient reasoning in SLMs. Source code can be found atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper presents a methodology for inserting phrases in Arabic poems to conform to a specific rhythm using ByT5, a byte-level multilingual transformer-based model. Our work discusses a rule-based grapheme-to-beat transformation tailored for extracting the rhythm from fully diacritized Arabic script. Our approach employs a conditional denoising objective to fine-tune ByT5, where the model reconstructs masked words to match a target rhythm. We adopt a curriculum learning strategy, pre-training on a general Arabic dataset before fine-tuning on poetic dataset, and explore cross-lingual transfer from English to Arabic. Experimental results demonstrate that our models achieve high rhythmic alignment while maintaining semantic coherence. The proposed model has the potential to be used in co-creative applications in the process of composing classical Arabic poems.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for text-rich graph machine learning tasks such as node classification in high-impact domains like fraud detection and recommendation systems. Yet, despite a surge of interest, the field lacks a principled understanding of the capabilities of LLMs in their interaction with graph data. In this work, we conduct a large-scale, controlled evaluation across several key axes of variability to systematically assess the strengths and weaknesses of LLM-based graph reasoning methods in text-based applications. The axes include the LLM-graph interaction mode, comparing prompting, tool-use, and code generation; dataset domains, spanning citation, web-link, e-commerce, and social networks; structural regimes contrasting homophilic and heterophilic graphs; feature characteristics involving both short- and long-text node attributes; and model configurations with varying LLM sizes and reasoning capabilities. We further analyze dependencies by methodically truncating features, deleting edges, and removing labels to quantify reliance on input types. Our findings provide practical and actionable guidance. (1) LLMs as code generators achieve the strongest overall performance on graph data, with especially large gains on long-text or high-degree graphs where prompting quickly exceeds the token budget. (2) All interaction strategies remain effective on heterophilic graphs, challenging the assumption that LLM-based methods collapse under low homophily. (3) Code generation is able to flexibly adapt its reliance between structure, features, or labels to leverage the most informative input type. Together, these findings provide a comprehensive view of the strengths and limitations of current LLM-graph interaction modes and highlight key design principles for future approaches.

  _Zeyu Liu, Souvik Kundu, Lianghao Jiang, Anni Li, Srikanth Ronanki, Sravan Bodapati, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Although transformer architectures have achieved state-of-the-art performance across diverse domains, their quadratic computational complexity with respect to sequence length remains a significant bottleneck, particularly for latency-sensitive long-context applications. While recent linear-complexity alternatives are increasingly powerful, effectively training them from scratch is still resource-intensive. To overcome these limitations, we propose LAWCAT (Linear Attention with Convolution Across Time), a novel linearization framework designed to efficiently transfer the capabilities of pre-trained transformers into a performant linear attention architecture. LAWCAT integrates causal Conv1D layers to enhance local dependency modeling and employs normalized gated linear attention to improve generalization across varying context lengths. Our comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that, distilling Mistral-7B with only 1K-length sequences yields over 90\% passkey retrieval accuracy up to 22K tokens, significantly extending its effective context window. Similarly, Llama3.2-1B LAWCAT variant achieves competitive performance on S-NIAH 1\&2\&3 tasks (1K-8K context length) and BABILong benchmark (QA2\&QA3, 0K-16K context length), requiring less than 0.1\% pre-training tokens compared with pre-training models. Furthermore, LAWCAT exhibits faster prefill speeds than FlashAttention-2 for sequences exceeding 8K tokens. LAWCAT thus provides an efficient pathway to high-performance, long-context linear models suitable for edge deployment, reducing reliance on extensive long-sequence training data and computational resources.

  _Daniel Kaiser, Arnoldo Frigessi, Ali Ramezani-Kebrya, Benjamin Ricaud_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Current benchmarks for long-context reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs) often blur critical factors like intrinsic task complexity, distractor interference, and task length. To enable more precise failure analysis, we introduce CogniLoad, a novel synthetic benchmark grounded in Cognitive Load Theory (CLT). CogniLoad generates natural-language logic puzzles with independently tunable parameters that reflect CLT's core dimensions: intrinsic difficulty ($d$) controls intrinsic load; distractor-to-signal ratio ($\rho$) regulates extraneous load; and task length ($N$) serves as an operational proxy for conditions demanding germane load. Evaluating 22 SotA reasoning LLMs, CogniLoad reveals distinct performance sensitivities, identifying task length as a dominant constraint and uncovering varied tolerances to intrinsic complexity and U-shaped responses to distractor ratios. By offering systematic, factorial control over these cognitive load dimensions, CogniLoad provides a reproducible, scalable, and diagnostically rich tool for dissecting LLM reasoning limitations and guiding future model development.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Shared decision-making (SDM) is necessary to achieve patient-centred care. Currently no methodology exists to automatically measure SDM at scale. This study aimed to develop an automated approach to measure SDM by using language modelling and the conversational alignment (CA) score. A total of 157 video-recorded patient-doctor conversations from a randomized multi-centre trial evaluating SDM decision aids for anticoagulation in atrial fibrillations were transcribed and segmented into 42,559 sentences. Context-response pairs and negative sampling were employed to train deep learning (DL) models and fine-tuned BERT models via the next sentence prediction (NSP) task. Each top-performing model was used to calculate four types of CA scores. A random-effects analysis by clinician, adjusting for age, sex, race, and trial arm, assessed the association between CA scores and SDM outcomes: the Decisional Conflict Scale (DCS) and the Observing Patient Involvement in Decision-Making 12 (OPTION12) scores. p-values were corrected for multiple comparisons with the Benjamini-Hochberg method. Among 157 patients (34% female, mean age 70 SD 10.8), clinicians on average spoke more words than patients (1911 vs 773). The DL model without the stylebook strategy achieved a recall@1 of 0.227, while the fine-tuned BERTbase (110M) achieved the highest recall@1 with 0.640. The AbsMax (18.36 SE7.74 p=0.025) and Max CA (21.02 SE7.63 p=0.012) scores generated with the DL without stylebook were associated with OPTION12. The Max CA score generated with the fine-tuned BERTbase (110M) was associated with the DCS score (-27.61 SE12.63 p=0.037). BERT model sizes did not have an impact the association between CA scores and SDM. This study introduces an automated, scalable methodology to measure SDM in patient-doctor conversations through explainable CA scores, with potential to evaluate SDM strategies at scale.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated notable creative abilities in generating literary texts, including poetry and short stories. However, prior research has primarily centered on English, with limited exploration of non-English literary traditions and without standardized methods for assessing creativity. In this paper, we evaluate the capacity of LLMs to generate Persian literary text enriched with culturally relevant expressions. We build a dataset of user-generated Persian literary spanning 20 diverse topics and assess model outputs along four creativity dimensions-originality, fluency, flexibility, and elaboration-by adapting the Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking. To reduce evaluation costs, we adopt an LLM as a judge for automated scoring and validate its reliability against human judgments using intraclass correlation coefficients, observing strong agreement. In addition, we analyze the models' ability to understand and employ four core literary devices: simile, metaphor, hyperbole, and antithesis. Our results highlight both the strengths and limitations of LLMs in Persian literary text generation, underscoring the need for further refinement.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Social norms govern culturally appropriate behavior in communication, enabling dialogue systems to produce responses that are not only coherent but also socially acceptable. We present NormGenesis, a multicultural framework for generating and annotating socially grounded dialogues across English, Chinese, and Korean. To model the dynamics of social interaction beyond static norm classification, we propose a novel dialogue type, Violation-to-Resolution (V2R), which models the progression of conversations following norm violations through recognition and socially appropriate repair. To improve pragmatic consistency in underrepresented languages, we implement an exemplar-based iterative refinement early in the dialogue synthesis process. This design introduces alignment with linguistic, emotional, and sociocultural expectations before full dialogue generation begins. Using this framework, we construct a dataset of 10,800 multi-turn dialogues annotated at the turn level for norm adherence, speaker intent, and emotional response. Human and LLM-based evaluations demonstrate that NormGenesis significantly outperforms existing datasets in refinement quality, dialogue naturalness, and generalization performance. We show that models trained on our V2R-augmented data exhibit improved pragmatic competence in ethically sensitive contexts. Our work establishes a new benchmark for culturally adaptive dialogue modeling and provides a scalable methodology for norm-aware generation across linguistically and culturally diverse languages.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Most automatic speech processing systems operate in "open loop" mode without user feedback about who said what; yet, human-in-the-loop workflows can potentially enable higher accuracy. We propose an LLM-assisted speaker diarization correction system that lets users fix speaker attribution errors in real time. The pipeline performs streaming ASR and diarization, uses an LLM to deliver concise summaries to the users, and accepts brief verbal feedback that is immediately incorporated without disrupting interactions. Moreover, we develop techniques to make the workflow more effective: First, a split-when-merged (SWM) technique detects and splits multi-speaker segments that the ASR erroneously attributes to just a single speaker. Second, online speaker enrollments are collected based on users' diarization corrections, thus helping to prevent speaker diarization errors from occurring in the future. LLM-driven simulations on the AMI test set indicate that our system substantially reduces DER by 9.92% and speaker confusion error by 44.23%. We further analyze correction efficacy under different settings, including summary vs full transcript display, the number of online enrollments limitation, and correction frequency.

  _Chutong Meng, Philipp Koehn_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present Speech Vecalign, a parallel speech document alignment method that monotonically aligns speech segment embeddings and does not depend on text transcriptions. Compared to the baseline method Global Mining, a variant of speech mining, Speech Vecalign produces longer speech-to-speech alignments. It also demonstrates greater robustness than Local Mining, another speech mining variant, as it produces less noise. We applied Speech Vecalign to 3,000 hours of unlabeled parallel English-German (En-De) speech documents from VoxPopuli, yielding about 1,000 hours of high-quality alignments. We then trained En-De speech-to-speech translation models on the aligned data. Speech Vecalign improves the En-to-De and De-to-En performance over Global Mining by 0.37 and 0.18 ASR-BLEU, respectively. Moreover, our models match or outperform SpeechMatrix model performance, despite using 8 times fewer raw speech documents.

  _Pei-Shuo Wang, Jian-Jia Chen, Chun-Che Yang, Chi-Chih Chang, Ning-Chi Huang, Mohamed S. Abdelfattah, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The immense model sizes of large language models (LLMs) challenge deployment on memory-limited consumer GPUs. Although model compression and parameter offloading are common strategies to address memory limitations, compression can degrade quality, and offloading maintains quality but suffers from slow inference. Speculative decoding presents a promising avenue to accelerate parameter offloading, utilizing a fast draft model to propose multiple draft tokens, which are then verified by the target LLM in parallel with a single forward pass. This method reduces the time-consuming data transfers in forward passes that involve offloaded weight transfers. Existing methods often rely on pretrained weights of the same family, but require additional training to align with custom-trained models. Moreover, approaches that involve draft model training usually yield only modest speedups. This limitation arises from insufficient alignment with the target model, preventing higher token acceptance lengths. To address these challenges and achieve greater speedups, we propose SubSpec, a plug-and-play method to accelerate parameter offloading that is lossless and training-free. SubSpec constructs a highly aligned draft model by generating low-bit quantized substitute layers from offloaded target LLM portions. Additionally, our method shares the remaining GPU-resident layers and the KV-Cache, further reducing memory overhead and enhance alignment. SubSpec achieves a high average acceptance length, delivering 9.1x speedup for Qwen2.5 7B on MT-Bench (8GB VRAM limit) and an average of 12.5x speedup for Qwen2.5 32B on popular generation benchmarks (24GB VRAM limit).

  _Saksham Khatwani, He Cheng, Majid Afshar, Dmitriy Dligach, Yanjun Gao_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) show promise for diagnostic reasoning but often lack reliable, knowledge grounded inference. Knowledge graphs (KGs), such as the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS), offer structured biomedical knowledge that can support trustworthy reasoning. Prior approaches typically integrate KGs via retrieval augmented generation or fine tuning, inserting KG content into prompts rather than enabling structured reasoning. We explore an alternative paradigm: treating the LLM as a reward model of KG reasoning paths, where the model learns to judge whether a candidate path leads to correct diagnosis for a given patient input. This approach is inspired by recent work that leverages reward training to enhance model reasoning abilities, and grounded in computational theory, which suggests that verifying a solution is often easier than generating one from scratch. It also parallels physicians' diagnostic assessment, where they judge which sequences of findings and intermediate conditions most plausibly support a diagnosis. We first systematically evaluate five task formulation for knowledge path judging and eight training paradigm. Second, we test whether the path judging abilities generalize to downstream diagnostic tasks, including diagnosis summarization and medical question answering. Experiments with three open source instruct-tuned LLMs reveal both promise and brittleness: while specific reward optimization and distillation lead to strong path-judging performance, the transferability to downstream tasks remain weak. Our finding provides the first systematic assessment of "reward model style" reasoning over clinical KGs, offering insights into how structured, reward-based supervision influences diagnostic reasoning in GenAI systems for healthcare.

  _Hieu Tran, Zonghai Yao, Hong Yu_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reinforcement learning improves LLM reasoning, yet sparse delayed reward over long sequences makes token-level credit assignment the key bottleneck. We study the verifiable-reward setting, where the final answer is checkable and multiple responses can be drawn per prompt. Reasoning tasks in math and medical QA align with this setup, where only a few decision tokens significantly impact the outcome. PPO offers token-level advantages with a learned value model, but it is complex to train both the actor and critic models simultaneously, and it is not easily generalizable, as the token-level values from the critic model can make training prone to overfitting. GRPO is critic-free and supports verifiable rewards, but spreads a single sequence-level return across tokens and ignores branching. We introduce \textbf{Prefix-to-Tree (P2T)}, a simple procedure that converts a group of responses into a prefix tree and computes \emph{nonparametric} prefix values \(V(s)\) by aggregating descendant outcomes. Built on P2T, we propose \textbf{TEMPO} (\emph{\textbf{T}ree-\textbf{E}stimated \textbf{M}ean Prefix Value for \textbf{P}olicy \textbf{O}ptimization}), a critic-free algorithm that augments the group-relative outcome signal of GRPO with \emph{branch-gated} temporal-difference corrections derived from the tree. At non-branch tokens, the temporal-difference (TD) term is zero, so TEMPO reduces to GRPO; at branching tokens, it supplies precise token-level credit without a learned value network or extra judges/teachers. On Qwen3-1.7B/4B, TEMPO outperforms PPO and GRPO on in-distribution (MATH, MedQA) and out-of-distribution (GSM-HARD, AMC23, MedMCQA, MMLU-Medical) benchmarks, and reaches higher validation accuracy with roughly the same wall-clock time.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Emotion Recognition in Conversation has been seen to be widely applicable in call center analytics, opinion mining, finance, retail, healthcare, and other industries. In a call center scenario, the role of the call center agent is not just confined to receiving calls but to also provide good customer experience by pacifying the frustration or anger of the customers. This can be achieved by maintaining neutral and positive emotion from the agent. As in any conversation, the emotion of one speaker is usually dependent on the emotion of other speaker. Hence the positive emotion of an agent, accompanied with the right resolution will help in enhancing customer experience. This can change an unhappy customer to a happy one. Imparting the right resolution at right time becomes easier if the agent has the insight of the emotion of future utterances. To predict the emotions of the future utterances we propose a novel architecture, Emotion Recognition and Forecasting in Conversation. Our proposed ERFC architecture considers multi modalities, different attributes of emotion, context and the interdependencies of the utterances of the speakers in the conversation. Our intensive experiments on the IEMOCAP dataset have shown the feasibility of the proposed ERFC. This approach can provide a tremendous business value for the applications like call center, where the happiness of customer is utmost important.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enables large language models (LLMs) to access external knowledge sources, but the effectiveness of RAG relies on the coordination between the retriever and the generator. Since these components are developed independently, their interaction is often suboptimal: the retriever may return irrelevant or redundant documents, while the generator may fail to fully leverage retrieved evidence. In this work, we propose a process-supervised multi-agent framework to bridge the gap between retriever and generator. The framework introduces two lightweight agents: a Decision Maker, which determines when to continue retrieval or stop for answer generation, and a Knowledge Selector, which filters retrieved documents to retain only the most useful evidence. To provide fine-grained supervision, we employ an LLM-as-a-Judge that evaluates each intermediate action with process-level rewards, ensuring more accurate credit assignment than relying solely on final answer correctness. We further adopt a tree-structured rollout strategy to explore diverse reasoning paths, and train both agents with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) in an end-to-end manner. Experiments on single-hop and multi-hop question answering benchmarks show that our approach achieves higher accuracy, more stable convergence, and produces more interpretable reasoning trajectories compared with standard RAG baselines. Importantly, the proposed framework is modular and plug-and-play, requiring no modification to the retriever or generator, making it practical for real-world RAG applications.

  The capacity of Large Language Models (LLMs) to reason is fundamental to their application in complex, knowledge-intensive domains. In real-world scenarios, LLMs are often augmented with external information that can be helpful, irrelevant, or even misleading. This paper investigates the causal impact of such auxiliary information on the reasoning process of LLMs with explicit step-by-step thinking capabilities. We introduce SciAux, a new dataset derived from ScienceQA, to systematically test the robustness of the model against these types of information. Our findings reveal a critical vulnerability: the model's deliberative "thinking mode" is a double-edged sword. While helpful context improves accuracy, misleading information causes a catastrophic drop in performance, which is amplified by the thinking process. Instead of conferring robustness, thinking reinforces the degree of error when provided with misinformation. This highlights that the challenge is not merely to make models "think", but to endow them with the critical faculty to evaluate the information upon which their reasoning is based. The SciAux dataset is available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Automatic Prompt Optimization (APO) improves large language model (LLM) performance by refining prompts for specific tasks. However, prior APO methods typically focus only on user prompts, rely on unstructured feedback, and require large sample sizes and long iteration cycles-making them costly and brittle. We propose ZERA (Zero-init Instruction Evolving Refinement Agent), a novel framework that jointly optimizes both system and user prompts through principled, low-overhead refinement. ZERA scores prompts using eight generalizable criteria with automatically inferred weights, and revises prompts based on these structured critiques. This enables fast convergence to high-quality prompts using minimal examples and short iteration cycles. We evaluate ZERA across five LLMs and nine diverse datasets spanning reasoning, summarization, and code generation tasks. Experimental results demonstrate consistent improvements over strong baselines. Further ablation studies highlight the contribution of each component to more effective prompt construction. Our implementation including all prompts is publicly available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Event causality identification (ECI), a process that extracts causal relations between events from text, is crucial for distinguishing causation from correlation. Traditional approaches to ECI have primarily utilized linguistic patterns and multi-hop relational inference, risking false causality identification due to informal usage of causality and specious graphical inference. In this paper, we adopt the Rubin Causal Model to identify event causality: given two temporally ordered events, we see the first event as the treatment and the second one as the observed outcome. Determining their causality involves manipulating the treatment and estimating the resultant change in the likelihood of the outcome. Given that it is only possible to implement manipulation conceptually in the text domain, as a work-around, we try to find a twin for the protagonist from existing corpora. This twin should have identical life experiences with the protagonist before the treatment but undergoes an intervention of treatment. However, the practical difficulty of locating such a match limits its feasibility. Addressing this issue, we use the synthetic control method to generate such a twin' from relevant historical data, leveraging text embedding synthesis and inversion techniques. This approach allows us to identify causal relations more robustly than previous methods, including GPT-4, which is demonstrated on a causality benchmark, COPES-hard.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce \textbf{GAUSS} (\textbf{G}eneral \textbf{A}ssessment of \textbf{U}nderlying \textbf{S}tructured \textbf{S}kills in Mathematics), a benchmark that evaluates LLMs' mathematical abilities across twelve core skill dimensions, grouped into three domains: knowledge and understanding, problem solving and communication, and meta-skills and creativity. By categorizing problems according to cognitive skills and designing tasks that isolate specific abilities, GAUSS constructs comprehensive, fine-grained, and interpretable profiles of models' mathematical abilities. These profiles faithfully represent their underlying mathematical intelligence. To exemplify how to use the \textsc{GAUSS} benchmark, we have derived the skill profile of \textsc{GPT-5-thinking}, revealing its strengths and weaknesses as well as its differences relative to \textsc{o4-mini-high}, thereby underscoring the value of multidimensional, skill-based evaluation.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This study addresses the generalization limitations commonly observed in large language models under multi-task and cross-domain settings. Unlike prior methods such as SPoT, which depends on fixed prompt templates, our study introduces a unified multi-task learning framework with dynamic prompt scheduling mechanism. By introducing a prompt pool and a task-aware scheduling strategy, the method dynamically combines and aligns prompts for different tasks. This enhances the model's ability to capture semantic differences across tasks. During prompt fusion, the model uses task embeddings and a gating mechanism to finely control the prompt signals. This ensures alignment between prompt content and task-specific demands. At the same time, it builds flexible sharing pathways across tasks. In addition, the proposed optimization objective centers on joint multi-task learning. It incorporates an automatic learning strategy for scheduling weights, which effectively mitigates task interference and negative transfer. To evaluate the effectiveness of the method, a series of sensitivity experiments were conducted. These experiments examined the impact of prompt temperature parameters and task number variation. The results confirm the advantages of the proposed mechanism in maintaining model stability and enhancing transferability. Experimental findings show that the prompt scheduling method significantly improves performance on a range of language understanding and knowledge reasoning tasks. These results fully demonstrate its applicability and effectiveness in unified multi-task modeling and cross-domain adaptation.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Generation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) texts in important works has become a common practice that can be used to misuse and abuse AI at various levels. Traditional AI detectors often rely on document-level classification, which struggles to identify AI content in hybrid or slightly edited texts designed to avoid detection, leading to concerns about the model's efficiency, which makes it hard to distinguish between human-written and AI-generated texts. A sentence-level sequence labeling model proposed to detect transitions between human- and AI-generated text, leveraging nuanced linguistic signals overlooked by document-level classifiers. By this method, detecting and segmenting AI and human-written text within a single document at the token-level granularity is achieved. Our model combines the state-of-the-art pre-trained Transformer models, incorporating Neural Networks (NN) and Conditional Random Fields (CRFs). This approach extends the power of transformers to extract semantic and syntactic patterns, and the neural network component to capture enhanced sequence-level representations, thereby improving the boundary predictions by the CRF layer, which enhances sequence recognition and further identification of the partition between Human- and AI-generated texts. The evaluation is performed on two publicly available benchmark datasets containing collaborative human and AI-generated texts. Our experimental comparisons are with zero-shot detectors and the existing state-of-the-art models, along with rigorous ablation studies to justify that this approach, in particular, can accurately detect the spans of AI texts in a completely collaborative text. All our source code and the processed datasets are available in our GitHub repository.

  _Kavin R V, Pawan Goyal_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Standard language models employ unique, monolithic embeddings for each token, potentially limiting their ability to capture the multifaceted nature of word meanings. We investigate whether tokens can be more effectively represented through a compositional structure that accumulates diverse semantic facets. To explore this, we propose Aggregate Semantic Grouping (ASG), a novel approach leveraging Product Quantization (PQ). We apply ASG to standard transformer architectures (mBERT, XLM-R, mT5) and evaluate this representational scheme across diverse tasks (NLI, NER, QA), as well as a biomedical domain-specific benchmark (BC5CDR) using BioBERT. Our findings demonstrate that representing tokens compositionally via ASG achieves extreme compression in embedding parameters (0.4--0.5\%) while maintaining $>$95\% task performance relative to the base model, even in generative tasks and extends to both cross lingual transfer and domain-specific settings. These results validate the principle that tokens can be effectively modeled as combinations of shared semantic building blocks. ASG offers a simple yet concrete method for achieving this, showcasing how compositional representations can capture linguistic richness while enabling compact yet semantically rich models.

  _Hyesung Jeon, Seojune Lee, Beomseok Kang, Yulhwa Kim, Jae-Joon Kim_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The demand for efficient deployment of large language models (LLMs) has driven interest in quantization, which reduces inference cost, and parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), which lowers training overhead. This motivated the development of quantization-aware PEFT to produce accurate yet efficient quantized models. In this setting, reducing quantization error prior to fine-tuning is crucial for achieving high model accuracy. However, existing methods that rely on low-rank adaptation suffer from limited representational capacity. Recent Fourier-related transform (FT)-based adapters offer greater representational power than low-rank adapters, but their direct integration into quantized models often results in ineffective error reduction and increased computational overhead. To overcome these limitations, we propose QWHA, a method that integrates FT-based adapters into quantized models by employing the Walsh-Hadamard Transform (WHT) as the transform kernel, together with a novel adapter initialization scheme incorporating adaptive parameter selection and value refinement. We demonstrate that QWHA effectively mitigates quantization errors while facilitating fine-tuning, and that its design substantially reduces computational cost. Experimental results show that QWHA consistently outperforms baselines in low-bit quantization accuracy and achieves significant training speedups over existing FT-based adapters.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Continual Structured Knowledge Reasoning (CSKR) focuses on training models to handle sequential tasks, where each task involves translating natural language questions into structured queries grounded in structured knowledge. Existing general continual learning approaches face significant challenges when applied to this task, including poor generalization to heterogeneous structured knowledge and inefficient reasoning due to parameter growth as tasks increase. To address these limitations, we propose a novel CSKR framework, \textsc{K-DeCore}, which operates with a fixed number of tunable parameters. Unlike prior methods, \textsc{K-DeCore} introduces a knowledge decoupling mechanism that disentangles the reasoning process into task-specific and task-agnostic stages, effectively bridging the gaps across diverse tasks. Building on this foundation, \textsc{K-DeCore} integrates a dual-perspective memory consolidation mechanism for distinct stages and introduces a structure-guided pseudo-data synthesis strategy to further enhance the model's generalization capabilities. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of \textsc{K-DeCore} over existing continual learning methods across multiple metrics, leveraging various backbone large language models.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Existing table understanding methods face challenges due to complex table structures and intricate logical reasoning. While supervised finetuning (SFT) dominates existing research, reinforcement learning (RL), such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), has shown promise but struggled with low initial policy accuracy and coarse rewards in tabular contexts. In this paper, we introduce Table-R1, a three-stage RL framework that enhances multimodal table understanding through: (1) Warm-up that prompts initial perception and reasoning capabilities, (2) Perception Alignment GRPO (PA-GRPO), which employs continuous Tree-Edit-Distance Similarity (TEDS) rewards for recognizing table structures and contents, and (3) Hint-Completion GRPO (HC-GRPO), which utilizes fine-grained rewards of residual steps based on the hint-guided question. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Table-R1 can boost the model's table reasoning performance obviously on both held-in and held-out datasets, outperforming SFT and GRPO largely. Notably, Qwen2-VL-7B with Table-R1 surpasses larger specific table understanding models (e.g., Table-LLaVA 13B), even achieving comparable performance to the closed-source model GPT-4o on held-in datasets, demonstrating the efficacy of each stage of Table-R1 in overcoming initialization bottlenecks and reward sparsity, thereby advancing robust multimodal table understanding.

  To mitigate the hallucination problem in large language models, DoLa exploits early exit logits from the same model as a contrastive prior. However, we found that these early exit logits tend to be flat, low in magnitude, and fail to reflect meaningful contrasts. To address this, we propose PruneCD, a novel contrastive decoding method that constructs the amateur model via layer pruning rather than early exit. This design leads to more informative and well-aligned logits, enabling more effective contrastive decoding. Through qualitative and quantitative analyses, we demonstrate that PruneCD consistently improves factuality with minimal inference overhead, offering a robust and practical approach to mitigating hallucinations in LLMs.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Logic reasoning in natural language has been recognized as an important measure of human intelligence for Large Language Models (LLMs). Popular benchmarks may entangle multiple reasoning skills and thus provide unfaithful evaluations on the logic reasoning skill. Meanwhile, existing logic reasoning benchmarks are limited in language diversity and their distributions are deviated from the distribution of an ideal logic reasoning benchmark, which may lead to biased evaluation results. This paper thereby proposes a new classical logic benchmark DivLogicEval, consisting of natural sentences composed of diverse statements in a counterintuitive way. To ensure a more reliable evaluation, we also introduce a new evaluation metric that mitigates the influence of bias and randomness inherent in LLMs. Through experiments, we demonstrate the extent to which logical reasoning is required to answer the questions in DivLogicEval and compare the performance of different popular LLMs in conducting logical reasoning.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models are increasingly used in applications requiring objective assessment, which could be compromised by political bias. Many studies found preferences for left-leaning positions in LLMs, but downstream effects on tasks like fact-checking remain underexplored. In this study, we systematically investigate political bias through exchanging words with euphemisms or dysphemisms in German claims. We construct minimal pairs of factually equivalent claims that differ in political connotation, to assess the consistency of LLMs in classifying them as true or false. We evaluate six LLMs and find that, more than political leaning, the presence of judgmental words significantly influences truthfulness assessment. While a few models show tendencies of political bias, this is not mitigated by explicitly calling for objectivism in prompts. Warning: This paper contains content that may be offensive or upsetting.

  The advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has transformed natural language processing; however, their safety mechanisms remain under-explored in low-resource, multilingual settings. Here, we aim to bridge this gap. In particular, we introduce \textsf{SGToxicGuard}, a novel dataset and evaluation framework for benchmarking LLM safety in Singapore's diverse linguistic context, including Singlish, Chinese, Malay, and Tamil. SGToxicGuard adopts a red-teaming approach to systematically probe LLM vulnerabilities in three real-world scenarios: \textit{conversation}, \textit{question-answering}, and \textit{content composition}. We conduct extensive experiments with state-of-the-art multilingual LLMs, and the results uncover critical gaps in their safety guardrails. By offering actionable insights into cultural sensitivity and toxicity mitigation, we lay the foundation for safer and more inclusive AI systems in linguistically diverse environments.\footnote{Link to the dataset:this https URL.} \textcolor{red}{Disclaimer: This paper contains sensitive content that may be disturbing to some readers.}

  With the rapid advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), they have demonstrated exceptional capabilities across a variety of vision-language tasks. However, current evaluation benchmarks predominantly focus on objective visual question answering or captioning, inadequately assessing the models' ability to understand complex and subjective human emotions. To bridge this gap, we introduce EmoBench-Reddit, a novel, hierarchical benchmark for multimodal emotion understanding. The dataset comprises 350 meticulously curated samples from the social media platform Reddit, each containing an image, associated user-provided text, and an emotion category (sad, humor, sarcasm, happy) confirmed by user flairs. We designed a hierarchical task framework that progresses from basic perception to advanced cognition, with each data point featuring six multiple-choice questions and one open-ended question of increasing difficulty. Perception tasks evaluate the model's ability to identify basic visual elements (e.g., colors, objects), while cognition tasks require scene reasoning, intent understanding, and deep empathy integrating textual context. We ensured annotation quality through a combination of AI assistance (Claude 4) and manualthis http URLconducted a comprehensive evaluation of nine leading MLLMs, including GPT-5, Gemini-2.5-pro, and GPT-4o, on EmoBench-Reddit.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As large language models transition to agentic systems, current safety evaluation frameworks face critical gaps in assessing deployment-specific risks. We introduce AgentSeer, an observability-based evaluation framework that decomposes agentic executions into granular action and component graphs, enabling systematic agentic-situational assessment. Through cross-model validation on GPT-OSS-20B and Gemini-2.0-flash using HarmBench single turn and iterative refinement attacks, we demonstrate fundamental differences between model-level and agentic-level vulnerability profiles. Model-level evaluation reveals baseline differences: GPT-OSS-20B (39.47% ASR) versus Gemini-2.0-flash (50.00% ASR), with both models showing susceptibility to social engineering while maintaining logic-based attack resistance. However, agentic-level assessment exposes agent-specific risks invisible to traditional evaluation. We discover "agentic-only" vulnerabilities that emerge exclusively in agentic contexts, with tool-calling showing 24-60% higher ASR across both models. Cross-model analysis reveals universal agentic patterns, agent transfer operations as highest-risk tools, semantic rather than syntactic vulnerability mechanisms, and context-dependent attack effectiveness, alongside model-specific security profiles in absolute ASR levels and optimal injection strategies. Direct attack transfer from model-level to agentic contexts shows degraded performance (GPT-OSS-20B: 57% human injection ASR; Gemini-2.0-flash: 28%), while context-aware iterative attacks successfully compromise objectives that failed at model-level, confirming systematic evaluation gaps. These findings establish the urgent need for agentic-situation evaluation paradigms, with AgentSeer providing the standardized methodology and empirical validation.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate exceptional capabilities across various tasks, but their deployment is constrained by high computational and memory costs. Model pruning provides an effective means to alleviate these demands. However, existing methods often ignore the characteristics of prefill-decode (PD) disaggregation in practice. In this paper, we propose a novel pruning method for PD disaggregation inference, enabling more precise and efficient block and KV Cache pruning. Our approach constructs pruning and distillation sets to perform iterative block removal independently for the prefill and decode stages, obtaining better pruning solutions. Moreover, we introduce a token-aware cache pruning mechanism that retains all KV Cache in the prefill stage but selectively reuses entries for the first and last token sequences in selected layers during decode, reducing communication costs with minimal overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach consistently achieves strong performance in both PD disaggregation and PD unified settings without disaggregation. Under the same (default) settings, our method achieves improved performance and faster inference, along with a 4.95$\times$ reduction in data transmission bandwidth consumption.

  Extensive research has been conducted to explore the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in table reasoning. However, the essential task of transforming tables information into reports remains a significant challenge for industrial applications. This task is plagued by two critical issues: 1) the complexity and diversity of tables lead to suboptimal reasoning outcomes; and 2) existing table benchmarks lack the capacity to adequately assess the practical application of this task. To fill this gap, we propose the table-to-report task and construct a bilingual benchmark named T2R-bench, where the key information flow from the tables to the reports for this task. The benchmark comprises 457 industrial tables, all derived from real-world scenarios and encompassing 19 industry domains as well as 4 types of industrial tables. Furthermore, we propose an evaluation criteria to fairly measure the quality of report generation. The experiments on 25 widely-used LLMs reveal that even state-of-the-art models like Deepseek-R1 only achieves performance with 62.71 overall score, indicating that LLMs still have room for improvement on T2R-bench.

  The current Large Language Models (LLMs) face significant challenges in improving their performance on low-resource languages and urgently need data-efficient methods without costly fine-tuning. From the perspective of language-bridge, we propose a simple yet effective method, namely BridgeX-ICL, to improve the zero-shot Cross-lingual In-Context Learning (X-ICL) for low-resource languages. Unlike existing works focusing on language-specific neurons, BridgeX-ICL explores whether sharing neurons can improve cross-lingual performance in LLMs. We construct neuron probe data from the ground-truth MUSE bilingual dictionaries, and define a subset of language overlap neurons accordingly to ensure full activation of these anchored neurons. Subsequently, we propose an HSIC-based metric to quantify LLMs' internal linguistic spectrum based on overlapping neurons, guiding optimal bridge selection. The experiments conducted on 4 cross-lingual tasks and 15 language pairs from 7 diverse families, covering both high-low and moderate-low pairs, validate the effectiveness of BridgeX-ICL and offer empirical insights into the underlying multilingual mechanisms of LLMs. The code is publicly available atthis https URL.

  In machine translation (MT), health is a high-stakes domain characterised by widespread deployment and domain-specific vocabulary. However, there is a lack of MT evaluation datasets for low-resource languages in this domain. To address this gap, we introduce OpenWHO, a document-level parallel corpus of 2,978 documents and 26,824 sentences from the World Health Organization's e-learning platform. Sourced from expert-authored, professionally translated materials shielded from web-crawling, OpenWHO spans a diverse range of over 20 languages, of which nine are low-resource. Leveraging this new resource, we evaluate modern large language models (LLMs) against traditional MT models. Our findings reveal that LLMs consistently outperform traditional MT models, with Gemini 2.5 Flash achieving a +4.79 ChrF point improvement over NLLB-54B on our low-resource test set. Further, we investigate how LLM context utilisation affects accuracy, finding that the benefits of document-level translation are most pronounced in specialised domains like health. We release the OpenWHO corpus to encourage further research into low-resource MT in the health domain.

  People often ask questions with false assumptions, a type of question that does not have regular answers. Answering such questions requires first identifying the false assumptions. Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate misleading answers to these questions because of hallucinations. In this paper, we focus on identifying and answering questions with false assumptions in several domains. We first investigate whether the problem reduces to fact verification. Then, we present an approach leveraging external evidence to mitigate hallucinations. Experiments with five LLMs demonstrate that (1) incorporating retrieved evidence is beneficial and (2) generating and validating atomic assumptions yields more improvements and provides an interpretable answer by pinpointing the false assumptions.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences has become a critical step in their development. Recent research has increasingly focused on test-time alignment, where additional compute is allocated during inference to enhance LLM safety and reasoning capabilities. However, these test-time alignment techniques often incur substantial inference costs, limiting their practical application. We are inspired by the speculative sampling acceleration, which leverages a small draft model to efficiently predict future tokens, to address the efficiency bottleneck of test-time alignment. We introduce the reward-shifted speculative sampling (SSS) algorithm, in which the draft model is aligned with human preferences, while the target model remains unchanged. We theoretically demonstrate that the distributional shift between the aligned draft model and the unaligned target model can be exploited to recover the RLHF optimal solution without actually obtaining it, by modifying the acceptance criterion and bonus token distribution. Our algorithm achieves superior gold reward scores at a significantly reduced inference cost in test-time weak-to-strong alignment experiments, thereby validating both its effectiveness and efficiency.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The field of AI-generated text detection has evolved from supervised classification to zero-shot statistical analysis. However, current approaches share a fundamental limitation: they aggregate token-level measurements into scalar scores, discarding positional information about where anomalies occur. Our empirical analysis reveals that AI-generated text exhibits significant non-stationarity, statistical properties vary by 73.8\% more between text segments compared to human writing. This discovery explains why existing detectors fail against localized adversarial perturbations that exploit this overlooked characteristic. We introduce Temporal Discrepancy Tomography (TDT), a novel detection paradigm that preserves positional information by reformulating detection as a signal processing task. TDT treats token-level discrepancies as a time-series signal and applies Continuous Wavelet Transform to generate a two-dimensional time-scale representation, capturing both the location and linguistic scale of statistical anomalies. On the RAID benchmark, TDT achieves 0.855 AUROC (7.1\% improvement over the best baseline). More importantly, TDT demonstrates robust performance on adversarial tasks, with 14.1\% AUROC improvement on HART Level 2 paraphrasing attacks. Despite its sophisticated analysis, TDT maintains practical efficiency with only 13\% computational overhead. Our work establishes non-stationarity as a fundamental characteristic of AI-generated text and demonstrates that preserving temporal dynamics is essential for robust detection.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) have shown the capability to generate fluent and logical content, presenting significant challenges to machine-generated text detection, particularly text polished by adversarial perturbations such as paraphrasing. Current zero-shot detectors often employ Gaussian distributions as statistical measure for computing detection thresholds, which falters when confronted with the heavy-tailed statistical artifacts characteristic of adversarial or non-native English texts. In this paper, we introduce T-Detect, a novel detection method that fundamentally redesigns the curvature-based detectors. Our primary innovation is the replacement of standard Gaussian normalization with a heavy-tailed discrepancy score derived from the Student's t-distribution. This approach is theoretically grounded in the empirical observation that adversarial texts exhibit significant leptokurtosis, rendering traditional statistical assumptions inadequate. T-Detect computes a detection score by normalizing the log-likelihood of a passage against the expected moments of a t-distribution, providing superior resilience to statistical outliers. We validate our approach on the challenging RAID benchmark for adversarial text and the comprehensive HART dataset. Experiments show that T-Detect provides a consistent performance uplift over strong baselines, improving AUROC by up to 3.9\% in targeted domains. When integrated into a two-dimensional detection framework (CT), our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, with an AUROC of 0.926 on the Books domain of RAID. Our contributions are a new, theoretically-justified statistical foundation for text detection, an ablation-validated method that demonstrates superior robustness, and a comprehensive analysis of its performance under adversarial conditions.

Here, we describe a suite of programmatic tools for rendering allotaxonographs for rank-turbulence divergence in Matlab, Javascript, and Python, all of which have different use cases.

  _Marija ≈†akota, Robert West_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Many recent approaches to structured NLP tasks use an autoregressive language model $M$ to map unstructured input text $x$ to output text $y$ representing structured objects (such as tuples, lists, trees, code, etc.), where the desired output structure is enforced via constrained decoding. During training, these approaches do not require the model to be aware of the constraints, which are merely implicit in the training outputs $y$. This is advantageous as it allows for dynamic constraints without requiring retraining, but can lead to low-quality output during constrained decoding at test time. We overcome this problem with Boosted Constrained Decoding (BoostCD), which combines constrained and unconstrained decoding in two phases: Phase 1 decodes from the base model $M$ twice, in constrained and unconstrained mode, obtaining two weak predictions. In phase 2, a learned autoregressive boosted model combines the two weak predictions into one final prediction. The mistakes made by the base model with vs. without constraints tend to be complementary, which the boosted model learns to exploit for improved performance. We demonstrate the power of BoostCD by applying it to closed information extraction. Our model, BoostIE, outperforms prior approaches both in and out of distribution, addressing several common errors identified in those approaches.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Figure captions are crucial for helping readers understand and remember a figure's key message. Many models have been developed to generate these captions, helping authors compose better quality captions more easily. Yet, authors almost always need to revise generic AI-generated captions to match their writing style and the domain's style, highlighting the need for personalization. Despite language models' personalization (LaMP) advances, these technologies often focus on text-only settings and rarely address scenarios where both inputs and profiles are multimodal. This paper introduces LaMP-Cap, a dataset for personalized figure caption generation with multimodal figure profiles. For each target figure, LaMP-Cap provides not only the needed inputs, such as figure images, but also up to three other figures from the same document--each with its image, caption, and figure-mentioning paragraphs--as a profile to characterize the context. Experiments with four LLMs show that using profile information consistently helps generate captions closer to the original author-written ones. Ablation studies reveal that images in the profile are more helpful than figure-mentioning paragraphs, highlighting the advantage of using multimodal profiles over text-only ones.

  _Di Wu, Seth Aycock, Christof Monz_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong reasoning capabilities for many tasks, often by explicitly decomposing the task via Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. Recent work on LLM-based translation designs hand-crafted prompts to decompose translation, or trains models to incorporate intermediate steps. Translating Step-by-step (Briakou et al., 2024), for instance, introduces a multi-step prompt with decomposition and refinement of translation with LLMs, which achieved state-of-the-art results on WMT24 test data. In this work, we scrutinise this strategy's effectiveness. Empirically, we find no clear evidence that performance gains stem from explicitly decomposing the translation process via CoT, at least for the models on test; and we show prompting LLMs to 'translate again' and self-refine yields even better results than human-like step-by-step prompting. While the decomposition influences translation behaviour, faithfulness to the decomposition has both positive and negative effects on translation. Our analysis therefore suggests a divergence between the optimal translation strategies for humans and LLMs.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  There is increasing evidence of Human Label Variation (HLV) in Natural Language Inference (NLI), where annotators assign different labels to the same premise-hypothesis pair. However, within-label variation--cases where annotators agree on the same label but provide divergent reasoning--poses an additional and mostly overlooked challenge. Several NLI datasets contain highlighted words in the NLI item as explanations, but the same spans on the NLI item can be highlighted for different reasons, as evidenced by free-text explanations, which offer a window into annotators' reasoning. To systematically understand this problem and gain insight into the rationales behind NLI labels, we introduce LITEX, a linguistically-informed taxonomy for categorizing free-text explanations. Using this taxonomy, we annotate a subset of the e-SNLI dataset, validate the taxonomy's reliability, and analyze how it aligns with NLI labels, highlights, and explanations. We further assess the taxonomy's usefulness in explanation generation, demonstrating that conditioning generation on LITEX yields explanations that are linguistically closer to human explanations than those generated using only labels or highlights. Our approach thus not only captures within-label variation but also shows how taxonomy-guided generation for reasoning can bridge the gap between human and model explanations more effectively than existing strategies.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in reasoning, positioning them as promising tools for supporting human problem-solving. However, what happens when their performance is affected by misinformation, i.e., incorrect inputs introduced by users due to oversights or gaps in knowledge? Such misinformation is prevalent in real-world interactions with LLMs, yet how it propagates within LLMs' reasoning process remains underexplored. Focusing on mathematical reasoning, we present a comprehensive analysis of how misinformation affects intermediate reasoning steps and final answers. We also examine how effectively LLMs can correct misinformation when explicitly instructed to do so. Even with explicit instructions, LLMs succeed less than half the time in rectifying misinformation, despite possessing correct internal knowledge, leading to significant accuracy drops (10.02% - 72.20%), and the degradation holds with thinking models (4.30% - 19.97%). Further analysis shows that applying factual corrections early in the reasoning process most effectively reduces misinformation propagation, and fine-tuning on synthesized data with early-stage corrections significantly improves reasoning factuality. Our work offers a practical approach to mitigating misinformation propagation.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Enhancing the linguistic capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to include low-resource languages is a critical research area. Current research directions predominantly rely on synthetic data generated by translating English corpora, which, while demonstrating promising linguistic understanding and translation abilities, often results in models aligned with source language culture. These models frequently fail to represent the cultural heritage and values of local communities. This work proposes a methodology to create both synthetic and retrieval-based pre-training data tailored to a specific community, considering its (i) language, (ii) cultural heritage, and (iii) cultural values. We demonstrate our methodology using Egyptian and Moroccan dialects as testbeds, chosen for their linguistic and cultural richness and current underrepresentation in LLMs. As a proof-of-concept, we develop NileChat, a 3B parameter Egyptian and Moroccan Arabic LLM adapted for Egyptian and Moroccan communities, incorporating their language, cultural heritage, and values. Our results on various understanding, translation, and cultural and values alignment benchmarks show that NileChat outperforms existing Arabic-aware LLMs of similar size and performs on par with larger models. This work addresses Arabic dialect in LLMs with a focus on cultural and values alignment via controlled synthetic data generation and retrieval-augmented pre-training for Moroccan Darija and Egyptian Arabic, including Arabizi variants, advancing Arabic NLP for low-resource communities. We share our methods, data, and models with the community to promote the inclusion and coverage of more diverse communities in cultural LLM development:this https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multi-label classification is prevalent in real-world settings, but the behavior of Large Language Models (LLMs) in this setting is understudied. We investigate how autoregressive LLMs perform multi-label classification, focusing on subjective tasks, by analyzing the output distributions of the models at each label generation step. We find that the initial probability distribution for the first label often does not reflect the eventual final output, even in terms of relative order and find LLMs tend to suppress all but one label at each generation step. We further observe that as model scale increases, their token distributions exhibit lower entropy and higher single-label confidence, but the internal relative ranking of the labels improves. Finetuning methods such as supervised finetuning and reinforcement learning amplify this phenomenon. We introduce the task of distribution alignment for multi-label settings: aligning LLM-derived label distributions with empirical distributions estimated from annotator responses in subjective tasks. We propose both zero-shot and supervised methods which improve both alignment and predictive performance over existing approaches. We find one method -- taking the max probability over all label generation distributions instead of just using the initial probability distribution -- improves both distribution alignment and overall F1 classification without adding any additional computation.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Idioms have long posed a challenge due to their unique linguistic properties, which set them apart from other common expressions. While recent studies have leveraged large language models (LLMs) to handle idioms across various tasks, e.g., idiom-containing sentence generation and idiomatic machine translation, little is known about the underlying mechanisms of idiom processing in LLMs, particularly in multilingual settings. To this end, we introduce MIDAS, a new large-scale dataset of idioms in six languages, each paired with its corresponding meaning. Leveraging this resource, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of LLMs' idiom processing ability, identifying key factors that influence their performance. Our findings suggest that LLMs rely not only on memorization, but also adopt a hybrid approach that integrates contextual cues and reasoning, especially when processing compositional idioms. This implies that idiom understanding in LLMs emerges from an interplay between internal knowledge retrieval and reasoning-based inference.

  Text-to-SQL, which maps natural language to SQL queries, has benefited greatly from recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs). While LLMs offer various paradigms for this task, including prompting and supervised fine-tuning (SFT), SFT approaches still face challenges such as complex multi-stage pipelines and poor robustness to noisy schema information. To address these limitations, we present JOLT-SQL, a streamlined single-stage SFT framework that jointly optimizes schema linking and SQL generation via a unified loss. JOLT-SQL employs discriminative schema linking, enhanced by local bidirectional attention, alongside a confusion-aware noisy schema sampling strategy with selective attention to improve robustness under noisy schema conditions. Experiments on the Spider and BIRD benchmarks demonstrate that JOLT-SQL achieves state-of-the-art execution accuracy among comparable-size open-source models, while significantly improving both training and inference efficiency.

  Ambiguity remains a fundamental challenge in Natural Language Processing (NLP) due to the inherent complexity and flexibility of human language. With the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs), addressing ambiguity has become even more critical due to their expanded capabilities and applications. In the context of Conversational Question Answering (CQA), this paper explores the definition, forms, and implications of ambiguity for language driven systems, particularly in the context of LLMs. We define key terms and concepts, categorize various disambiguation approaches enabled by LLMs, and provide a comparative analysis of their advantages and disadvantages. We also explore publicly available datasets for benchmarking ambiguity detection and resolution techniques and highlight their relevance for ongoing research. Finally, we identify open problems and future research directions, especially in agentic settings, proposing areas for further investigation. By offering a comprehensive review of current research on ambiguities and disambiguation with LLMs, we aim to contribute to the development of more robust and reliable LLM-based systems.

  The task of Critical Questions Generation (CQs-Gen) aims to foster critical thinking by enabling systems to generate questions that expose underlying assumptions and challenge the validity of argumentative reasoning structures. Despite growing interest in this area, progress has been hindered by the lack of suitable datasets and automatic evaluation standards. This paper presents a comprehensive approach to support the development and benchmarking of systems for this task. We construct the first large-scale dataset including ~5K manually annotated questions. We also investigate automatic evaluation methods and propose reference-based techniques as the strategy that best correlates with human judgments. Our zero-shot evaluation of 11 LLMs establishes a strong baseline while showcasing the difficulty of the task. Data and code plus a public leaderboard are provided to encourage further research, not only in terms of model performance, but also to explore the practical benefits of CQs-Gen for both automated reasoning and human critical thinking.

  The rapid development of Multimodal Large Reasoning Models (MLRMs) has demonstrated broad application potential, yet their safety and reliability remain critical concerns that require systematic exploration. To address this gap, we conduct a comprehensive and systematic safety evaluation of 11 MLRMs across 5 benchmarks and unveil prevalent safety degradation phenomena in most advanced models. Moreover, our analysis reveals distinct safety patterns across different benchmarks: significant safety degradation is observed across jailbreak robustness benchmarks, whereas safety-awareness benchmarks demonstrate less pronounced degradation. In particular, the long thought process in some scenarios even enhances safety performance. Therefore, it is a potential approach to address safety issues in MLRMs by leveraging the intrinsic reasoning capabilities of the model to detect unsafe intent. To operationalize this insight, we construct a multimodal tuning dataset that incorporates a safety-oriented thought process. Experimental results from fine-tuning existing MLRMs with this dataset effectively enhances the safety on both jailbreak robustness and safety-awareness benchmarks. This study provides a new perspective for developing safe MLRMs. Our dataset is available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Unified Structured Knowledge Reasoning (USKR) aims to answer natural language questions (NLQs) by using structured sources such as tables, databases, and knowledge graphs in a unified way. Existing USKR methods either rely on employing task-specific strategies or custom-defined representations, which struggle to leverage the knowledge transfer between different SKR tasks or align with the prior of LLMs, thereby limiting their performance. This paper proposes a novel USKR framework named \textsc{Pandora}, which takes advantage of \textsc{Python}'s \textsc{Pandas} API to construct a unified knowledge representation for alignment with LLM pre-training. It employs an LLM to generate textual reasoning steps and executable Python code for each question. Demonstrations are drawn from a memory of training examples that cover various SKR tasks, facilitating knowledge transfer. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks involving three SKR tasks demonstrate that \textsc{Pandora} outperforms existing unified frameworks and competes effectively with task-specific methods.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) by encouraging step-by-step reasoning in natural language. However, leveraging a latent continuous space for reasoning may offer benefits in terms of both efficiency and robustness. Prior implicit CoT methods attempt to bypass language completely by reasoning in continuous space but have consistently underperformed compared to the standard explicit CoT approach. We introduce CODI (Continuous Chain-of-Thought via Self-Distillation), a novel training framework that effectively compresses natural language CoT into continuous space. CODI jointly trains a teacher task (Explicit CoT) and a student task (Implicit CoT), distilling the reasoning ability from language into continuous space by aligning the hidden states of a designated token. Our experiments show that CODI is the first implicit CoT approach to match the performance of explicit CoT on GSM8k at the GPT-2 scale, achieving a 3.1x compression rate and outperforming the previous state-of-the-art by 28.2% in accuracy. CODI also demonstrates robustness, generalizable to complex datasets, and interpretability. These results validate that LLMs can reason effectively not only in natural language, but also in a latent continuous space. Code is available atthis https URL.

  _Tianyi Lorena Yan, Robin Jia_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  To answer one-to-many factual queries (e.g., listing cities of a country), a language model (LM) must simultaneously recall knowledge and avoid repeating previous answers. How are these two subtasks implemented and integrated internally? Across multiple datasets, models, and prompt templates, we identify a promote-then-suppress mechanism: the model first recalls all answers, and then suppresses previously generated ones. Specifically, LMs use both the subject and previous answer tokens to perform knowledge recall, with attention propagating subject information and MLPs promoting the answers. Then, attention attends to and suppresses previous answer tokens, while MLPs amplify the suppression signal. Our mechanism is corroborated by extensive experimental evidence: in addition to using early decoding and causal tracing, we analyze how components use different tokens by introducing both Token Lens, which decodes aggregated attention updates from specified tokens, and a knockout method that analyzes changes in MLP outputs after removing attention to specified tokens. Overall, we provide new insights into how LMs' internal components interact with different input tokens to support complex factual recall. Code is available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Do language models (LMs) offer insights into human language learning? A common argument against this idea is that because their architecture and training paradigm are so vastly different from humans, LMs can learn arbitrary inputs as easily as natural languages. We test this claim by training LMs to model impossible and typologically unattested languages. Unlike previous work, which has focused exclusively on English, we conduct experiments on 12 languages from 4 language families with two newly constructed parallel corpora. Our results show that while GPT-2 small can largely distinguish attested languages from their impossible counterparts, it does not achieve perfect separation between all the attested languages and all the impossible ones. We further test whether GPT-2 small distinguishes typologically attested from unattested languages with different NP orders by manipulating word order based on Greenberg's Universal 20. We find that the model's perplexity scores do not distinguish attested vs. unattested word orders, while its performance on the generalization test does. These findings suggest that LMs exhibit some human-like inductive biases, though these biases are weaker than those found in human learners.

  Explanations are an important tool for gaining insights into the behavior of ML models, calibrating user trust and ensuring regulatory compliance. Past few years have seen a flurry of post-hoc methods for generating model explanations, many of which involve computing model gradients or solving specially designed optimization problems. However, owing to the remarkable reasoning abilities of Large Language Model (LLMs), self-explanation, that is, prompting the model to explain its outputs has recently emerged as a new paradigm. In this work, we study a specific type of self-explanations, self-generated counterfactual explanations (SCEs). We design tests for measuring the efficacy of LLMs in generating SCEs. Analysis over various LLM families, model sizes, temperature settings, and datasets reveals that LLMs sometimes struggle to generate SCEs. Even when they do, their prediction often does not agree with their own counterfactual reasoning.

  We examine three evaluation paradigms: standard benchmarks (e.g., MMLU and BBH), interactive games (e.g., Signalling Games or Taboo), and cognitive tests (e.g., for working memory or theory of mind). First, we investigate which of the former two-benchmarks or games-is most effective at discriminating LLMs of varying quality. Then, inspired by human cognitive assessments, we compile a suite of targeted tests that measure cognitive abilities deemed essential for effective language use, and we investigate their correlation with model performance in benchmarks and games. Our analyses reveal that interactive games are superior to standard benchmarks in discriminating models. Causal and logical reasoning correlate with both static and interactive tests, while differences emerge regarding core executive functions and social/emotional skills, which correlate more with games. We advocate for the development of new interactive benchmarks and targeted cognitive tasks inspired by assessing human abilities but designed specifically for LLMs.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The text produced by language models (LMs) can exhibit specific `behaviors,' such as a failure to follow alignment training, that we hope to detect and react to during deployment. Identifying these behaviors can often only be done post facto, i.e., after the entire text of the output has been generated. We provide evidence that there are times when we can predict how an LM will behave early in computation, before even a single token is generated. We show that probes trained on the internal representation of input tokens alone can predict a wide range of eventual behaviors over the entire output sequence. Using methods from conformal prediction, we provide provable bounds on the estimation error of our probes, creating precise early warning systems for these behaviors. The conformal probes can identify instances that will trigger alignment failures (jailbreaking) and instruction-following failures, without requiring a single token to be generated. An early warning system built on the probes reduces jailbreaking by 91%. Our probes also show promise in pre-emptively estimating how confident the model will be in its response, a behavior that cannot be detected using the output text alone. Conformal probes can preemptively estimate the final prediction of an LM that uses Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, hence accelerating inference. When applied to an LM that uses CoT to perform text classification, the probes drastically reduce inference costs (65% on average across 27 datasets), with negligible accuracy loss. Encouragingly, probes generalize to unseen datasets and perform better on larger models, suggesting applicability to the largest of models in real-world settings.

  Detecting disinformation that blends manipulated text and images has become increasingly challenging, as AI tools make synthetic content easy to generate and disseminate. While most existing AI safety benchmarks focus on single modality misinformation (i.e., false content shared without intent to deceive), intentional multimodal disinformation, such as propaganda or conspiracy theories that imitate credible news, remains largely unaddressed. We introduce the Vision-Language Disinformation Detection Benchmark (VLDBench), the first large-scale resource supporting both unimodal (text-only) and multimodal (text + image) disinformation detection. VLDBench comprises approximately 62,000 labeled text-image pairs across 13 categories, curated from 58 news outlets. Using a semi-automated pipeline followed by expert review, 22 domain experts invested over 500 hours to produce high-quality annotations with substantial inter-annotator agreement. Evaluations of state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on VLDBench show that incorporating visual cues improves detection accuracy by 5 to 35 percentage points over text-only models. VLDBench provides data and code for evaluation, fine-tuning, and robustness testing to support disinformation analysis. Developed in alignment with AI governance frameworks (e.g., the MIT AI Risk Repository), VLDBench offers a principled foundation for advancing trustworthy disinformation detection in multimodal media.Project:this https URLDataset:this https URLCode:this https URL

  Sequence labeling remains a significant challenge in low-resource, domain-specific scenarios, particularly for character-dense languages like Chinese. Existing methods primarily focus on enhancing model comprehension and improving data diversity to boost performance. However, these approaches still struggle with inadequate model applicability and semantic distribution biases in domain-specific contexts. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel framework that combines an LLM-based knowledge enhancement workflow with a span-based Knowledge Fusion for Rich and Efficient Extraction (KnowFREE) model. Our workflow employs explanation prompts to generate precise contextual interpretations of target entities, effectively mitigating semantic biases and enriching the model's contextual understanding. The KnowFREE model further integrates extension label features, enabling efficient nested entity extraction without relying on external knowledge during inference. Experiments on multiple Chinese domain-specific sequence labeling datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, effectively addressing the challenges posed by low-resource settings.

  Model merging has emerged as a key technique for enhancing the capabilities and efficiency of Large Language Models (LLMs). The open-source community has driven model evolution by iteratively merging existing models, yet a principled understanding of the gains and underlying factors in model merging remains limited. In this work, we study model evolution through iterative merging, drawing an analogy to biological evolution, and introduce the concept of model kinship, the degree of similarity or relatedness between LLMs. Through comprehensive empirical analysis, we show that model kinship is closely linked to the performance improvements achieved by merging, providing a useful criterion for selecting candidate models. Building on this insight, we propose a new model merging strategy: Top-k Greedy Merging with Model Kinship, which can improve benchmark performance. Specifically, we discover that incorporating model kinship as a guiding criterion enables continuous merging while mitigating performance degradation caused by local optima, thereby facilitating more effective model evolution.

  Recently, using large language models (LLMs) for data augmentation has led to considerable improvements in unsupervised sentence embedding models. However, existing methods encounter two primary challenges: limited data diversity and high data noise. Current approaches often neglect fine-grained knowledge, such as entities and quantities, leading to insufficient diversity. Besides, unsupervised data frequently lacks discriminative information, and the generated synthetic samples may introduce noise. In this paper, we propose a pipeline-based data augmentation method via LLMs and introduce the Gaussian-decayed gradient-assisted Contrastive Sentence Embedding (GCSE) model to enhance unsupervised sentence embeddings. To tackle the issue of low data diversity, our pipeline utilizes knowledge graphs (KGs) to extract entities and quantities, enabling LLMs to generate more diverse samples. To address high data noise, the GCSE model uses a Gaussian-decayed function to limit the impact of false hard negative samples, enhancing the model's discriminative capability. Experimental results show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in semantic textual similarity (STS) tasks, using fewer data samples and smaller LLMs, demonstrating its efficiency and robustness across various models.

  Programming languages possess rich semantic information - such as data flow - that is represented by graphs and not available from the surface form of source code. Recent code language models have scaled to billions of parameters, but model source code solely as text tokens while ignoring any other structural information. Conversely, models that do encode structural information of code make modifications to the Transformer architecture, limiting their scale and compatibility with pretrained LLMs. In this work, we take the best of both worlds with GALLa - Graph Aligned Large Language Models. GALLa utilizes graph neural networks and cross-modal alignment technologies to inject the structural information of code into LLMs as an auxiliary task during finetuning. This framework is both model-agnostic and task-agnostic, as it can be applied to any code LLM for any code downstream task, and requires the structural graph data only at training time from a corpus unrelated to the finetuning data, while incurring no cost at inference time over the baseline LLM. Experiments on five code tasks with seven different baseline LLMs ranging in size from 350M to 14B validate the effectiveness of GALLa, demonstrating consistent improvement over the baseline, even for powerful models such as LLaMA3 and Qwen2.5-Coder.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Conditional generative modeling aims to learn a conditional data distribution from samples containing data-condition pairs. For this, diffusion and flow-based methods have attained compelling results. These methods use a learned (flow) model to transport an initial standard Gaussian noise that ignores the condition to the conditional data distribution. The model is hence required to learn both mass transport and conditional injection. To ease the demand on the model, we propose Condition-Aware Reparameterization for Flow Matching (CAR-Flow) -- a lightweight, learned shift that conditions the source, the target, or both distributions. By relocating these distributions, CAR-Flow shortens the probability path the model must learn, leading to faster training in practice. On low-dimensional synthetic data, we visualize and quantify the effects of CAR. On higher-dimensional natural image data (ImageNet-256), equipping SiT-XL/2 with CAR-Flow reduces FID from 2.07 to 1.68, while introducing less than 0.6% additional parameters.

  _Weijie Wang, Yeqing Chen, Zeyu Zhang, Hengyu Liu, Haoxiao Wang, Zhiyuan Feng, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Feed-forward 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a highly effective solution for novel view synthesis. Existing methods predominantly rely on a pixel-aligned Gaussian prediction paradigm, where each 2D pixel is mapped to a 3D Gaussian. We rethink this widely adopted formulation and identify several inherent limitations: it renders the reconstructed 3D models heavily dependent on the number of input views, leads to view-biased density distributions, and introduces alignment errors, particularly when source views contain occlusions or low texture. To address these challenges, we introduce VolSplat, a new multi-view feed-forward paradigm that replaces pixel alignment with voxel-aligned Gaussians. By directly predicting Gaussians from a predicted 3D voxel grid, it overcomes pixel alignment's reliance on error-prone 2D feature matching, ensuring robust multi-view consistency. Furthermore, it enables adaptive control over Gaussian density based on 3D scene complexity, yielding more faithful Gaussian point clouds, improved geometric consistency, and enhanced novel-view rendering quality. Experiments on widely used benchmarks including RealEstate10K and ScanNet demonstrate that VolSplat achieves state-of-the-art performance while producing more plausible and view-consistent Gaussian reconstructions. In addition to superior results, our approach establishes a more scalable framework for feed-forward 3D reconstruction with denser and more robust representations, paving the way for further research in wider communities.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Despite steady progress in layout-to-image generation, current methods still struggle with layouts containing significant overlap between bounding boxes. We identify two primary challenges: (1) large overlapping regions and (2) overlapping instances with minimal semantic distinction. Through both qualitative examples and quantitative analysis, we demonstrate how these factors degrade generation quality. To systematically assess this issue, we introduce OverLayScore, a novel metric that quantifies the complexity of overlapping bounding boxes. Our analysis reveals that existing benchmarks are biased toward simpler cases with low OverLayScore values, limiting their effectiveness in evaluating model performance under more challenging conditions. To bridge this gap, we present OverLayBench, a new benchmark featuring high-quality annotations and a balanced distribution across different levels of OverLayScore. As an initial step toward improving performance on complex overlaps, we also propose CreatiLayout-AM, a model fine-tuned on a curated amodal mask dataset. Together, our contributions lay the groundwork for more robust layout-to-image generation under realistic and challenging scenarios. Project link:this https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The way we perceive the world fundamentally shapes how we move, whether it is how we navigate in a room or how we interact with other humans. Current human motion generation methods, neglect this interdependency and use task-specific ``perception'' that differs radically from that of humans. We argue that the generation of human-like avatar behavior requires human-like perception. Consequently, in this work we present CLOPS, the first human avatar that solely uses egocentric vision to perceive its surroundings and navigate. Using vision as the primary driver of motion however, gives rise to a significant challenge for training avatars: existing datasets have either isolated human motion, without the context of a scene, or lack scale. We overcome this challenge by decoupling the learning of low-level motion skills from learning of high-level control that maps visual input to motion. First, we train a motion prior model on a large motion capture dataset. Then, a policy is trained using Q-learning to map egocentric visual inputs to high-level control commands for the motion prior. Our experiments empirically demonstrate that egocentric vision can give rise to human-like motion characteristics in our avatars. For example, the avatars walk such that they avoid obstacles present in their visual field. These findings suggest that equipping avatars with human-like sensors, particularly egocentric vision, holds promise for training avatars that behave like humans.

  _Dheerendranath Battalapalli, Apoorva Safai, Maria Jaramillo, Hyemin Um, Gustavo Adalfo Pineda Ortiz, Ulas Bagci, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  A significant challenge in solid tumors is reliably distinguishing confounding pathologies from malignant neoplasms on routine imaging. While radiomics methods seek surrogate markers of lesion heterogeneity on CT/MRI, many aggregate features across the region of interest (ROI) and miss complex spatial relationships among varying intensity compositions. We present a new Graph-Radiomic Learning (GrRAiL) descriptor for characterizing intralesional heterogeneity (ILH) on clinical MRI scans. GrRAiL (1) identifies clusters of sub-regions using per-voxel radiomic measurements, then (2) computes graph-theoretic metrics to quantify spatial associations among clusters. The resulting weighted graphs encode higher-order spatial relationships within the ROI, aiming to reliably capture ILH and disambiguate confounding pathologies from malignancy. To assess efficacy and clinical feasibility, GrRAiL was evaluated in n=947 subjects spanning three use cases: differentiating tumor recurrence from radiation effects in glioblastoma (GBM; n=106) and brain metastasis (n=233), and stratifying pancreatic intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) into no+low vs high risk (n=608). In a multi-institutional setting, GrRAiL consistently outperformed state-of-the-art baselines - Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), textural radiomics, and intensity-graph analysis. In GBM, cross-validation (CV) and test accuracies for recurrence vs pseudo-progression were 89% and 78% with >10% test-accuracy gains over comparators. In brain metastasis, CV and test accuracies for recurrence vs radiation necrosis were 84% and 74% (>13% improvement). For IPMN risk stratification, CV and test accuracies were 84% and 75%, showing >10% improvement.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Continuous human motion understanding remains a core challenge in computer vision due to its high dimensionality and inherent redundancy. Efficient compression and representation are crucial for analyzing complex motion dynamics. In this work, we introduce an adversarially-refined VQ-GAN framework with dense motion tokenization for compressing spatio-temporal heatmaps while preserving the fine-grained traces of human motion. Our approach combines dense motion tokenization with adversarial refinement, which eliminates reconstruction artifacts like motion smearing and temporal misalignment observed in non-adversarial baselines. Our experiments on the CMU Panoptic dataset provide conclusive evidence of our method's superiority, outperforming the dVAE baseline by 9.31% SSIM and reducing temporal instability by 37.1%. Furthermore, our dense tokenization strategy enables a novel analysis of motion complexity, revealing that 2D motion can be optimally represented with a compact 128-token vocabulary, while 3D motion's complexity demands a much larger 1024-token codebook for faithful reconstruction. These results establish practical deployment feasibility across diverse motion analysis applications. The code base for this work is available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  What does it mean for two videos to be similar? Videos may appear similar when judged by the actions they depict, yet entirely different if evaluated based on the locations where they were filmed. While humans naturally compare videos by taking different aspects into account, this ability has not been thoroughly studied and presents a challenge for models that often depend on broad global similarity scores. Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) with video understanding capabilities open new opportunities for leveraging natural language in comparative video tasks. We introduce Concept-based Video Similarity estimation (ConViS), a novel task that compares pairs of videos by computing interpretable similarity scores across a predefined set of key semantic concepts. ConViS allows for human-like reasoning about video similarity and enables new applications such as concept-conditioned video retrieval. To support this task, we also introduce ConViS-Bench, a new benchmark comprising carefully annotated video pairs spanning multiple domains. Each pair comes with concept-level similarity scores and textual descriptions of both differences and similarities. Additionally, we benchmark several state-of-the-art models on ConViS, providing insights into their alignment with human judgments. Our results reveal significant performance differences on ConViS, indicating that some concepts present greater challenges for estimating video similarity. We believe that ConViS-Bench will serve as a valuable resource for advancing research in language-driven video understanding.

  We proposed Lavida-O, a unified multi-modal Masked Diffusion Model (MDM) capable of image understanding and generation tasks. Unlike existing multimodal diffsion language models such as MMaDa and Muddit which only support simple image-level understanding tasks and low-resolution image generation, Lavida-O exhibits many new capabilities such as object grounding, image-editing, and high-resolution (1024px) image synthesis. It is also the first unified MDM that uses its understanding capabilities to improve image generation and editing results through planning and iterative self-reflection. To allow effective and efficient training and sampling, Lavida-O ntroduces many novel techniques such as Elastic Mixture-of-Transformer architecture, universal text conditioning, and stratified sampling. \ours~achieves state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of benchmarks such as RefCOCO object grounding, GenEval text-to-image generation, and ImgEdit image editing, outperforming existing autoregressive and continuous diffusion models such as Qwen2.5-VL and FluxKontext-dev, while offering considerable speedup at inference.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The rise of realistic digital face generation and manipulation poses significant social risks. The primary challenge lies in the rapid and diverse evolution of generation techniques, which often outstrip the detection capabilities of existing models. To defend against the ever-evolving new types of forgery, we need to enable our model to quickly adapt to new domains with limited computation and data while avoiding forgetting previously learned forgery types. In this work, we posit that genuine facial samples are abundant and relatively stable in acquisition methods, while forgery faces continuously evolve with the iteration of manipulation techniques. Given the practical infeasibility of exhaustively collecting all forgery variants, we frame face forgery detection as a continual learning problem and allow the model to develop as new forgery types emerge. Specifically, we employ a Developmental Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture that uses LoRA models as its individual experts. These experts are organized into two groups: a Real-LoRA to learn and refine knowledge of real faces, and multiple Fake-LoRAs to capture incremental information from different forgery types. To prevent catastrophic forgetting, we ensure that the learning direction of Fake-LoRAs is orthogonal to the established subspace. Moreover, we integrate orthogonal gradients into the orthogonal loss of Fake-LoRAs, preventing gradient interference throughout the training process of each task. Experimental results under both the datasets and manipulation types incremental protocols demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  With the widespread deployment of dashcams and advancements in computer vision, developing accident prediction models from the dashcam perspective has become critical for proactive safety interventions. However, two key challenges persist: modeling feature-level interactions among traffic participants (often occluded in dashcam views) and capturing complex, asynchronous multi-temporal behavioral cues preceding accidents. To deal with these two challenges, a Multi-scale Feature Interaction Network (MsFIN) is proposed for early-stage accident anticipation from dashcam videos. MsFIN has three layers for multi-scale feature aggregation, temporal feature processing and multi-scale feature post fusion, respectively. For multi-scale feature aggregation, a Multi-scale Module is designed to extract scene representations at short-term, mid-term and long-term temporal scales. Meanwhile, the Transformer architecture is leveraged to facilitate comprehensive feature interactions. Temporal feature processing captures the sequential evolution of scene and object features under causal constraints. In the multi-scale feature post fusion stage, the network fuses scene and object features across multiple temporal scales to generate a comprehensive risk representation. Experiments on DAD and DADA datasets show that MsFIN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models with single-scale feature extraction in both prediction correctness and earliness. Ablation studies validate the effectiveness of each module in MsFIN, highlighting how the network achieves superior performance through multi-scale feature fusion and contextual interaction modeling.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Evaluation of hydrocephalus in children is challenging, and the related research is limited by a lack of publicly available, expert-annotated datasets, particularly those with segmentation of the choroid plexus. To address this, we present HyKid, an open-source dataset from 48 pediatric patients with hydrocephalus. 3D MRIs were provided with 1mm isotropic resolution, which was reconstructed from routine low-resolution images using a slice-to-volume algorithm. Manually corrected segmentations of brain tissues, including white matter, grey matter, lateral ventricle, external CSF, and the choroid plexus, were provided by an experienced neurologist. Additionally, structured data was extracted from clinical radiology reports using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation framework. The strong correlation between choroid plexus volume and total CSF volume provided a potential biomarker for hydrocephalus evaluation, achieving excellent performance in a predictive model (AUC = 0.87). The proposed HyKid dataset provided a high-quality benchmark for neuroimaging algorithms development, and it revealed the choroid plexus-related features in hydrocephalus assessments. Our datasets are publicly available atthis https URL.

  _Earl Ranario, Ismael Mayanja, Heesup Yun, Brian N. Bailey, J. Mason Earles_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Accurate plant segmentation in thermal imagery remains a significant challenge for high throughput field phenotyping, particularly in outdoor environments where low contrast between plants and weeds and frequent occlusions hinder performance. To address this, we present a framework that leverages synthetic RGB imagery, a limited set of real annotations, and GAN-based cross-modality alignment to enhance semantic segmentation in thermal images. We trained models on 1,128 synthetic images containing complex mixtures of crop and weed plants in order to generate image segmentation masks for crop and weed plants. We additionally evaluated the benefit of integrating as few as five real, manually segmented field images within the training process using various sampling strategies. When combining all the synthetic images with a few labeled real images, we observed a maximum relative improvement of 22% for the weed class and 17% for the plant class compared to the full real-data baseline. Cross-modal alignment was enabled by translating RGB to thermal using CycleGAN-turbo, allowing robust template matching without calibration. Results demonstrated that combining synthetic data with limited manual annotations and cross-domain translation via generative models can significantly boost segmentation performance in complex field environments for multi-model imagery.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Contrastive vision-language models (VLMs) have made significant progress in binding visual and textual information, but understanding long, dense captions remains an open challenge. We hypothesize that compositionality, the capacity to reason about object-attribute bindings and inter-object relationships, is key to understanding longer captions. In this paper, we investigate the interaction between compositionality and long-caption understanding, asking whether training for one property enhances the other. We train and evaluate a range of models that target each of these capabilities. Our results reveal a bidirectional relationship: compositional training improves performance on long-caption retrieval, and training on long captions promotes compositionality. However, these gains are sensitive to data quality and model design. We find that training on poorly structured captions, or with limited parameter updates, fails to support generalization. Likewise, strategies that aim at retaining general alignment, such as freezing positional embeddings, do not improve compositional understanding. Overall, we find that compositional understanding and long-caption understanding are intertwined capabilities that can be jointly learned through training on dense, grounded descriptions. Despite these challenges, we show that models trained on high-quality, long-caption data can achieve strong performance in both tasks, offering practical guidance for improving VLM generalization.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Contrastively-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have become the standard approach for learning discriminative vision-language representations. However, these models often exhibit shallow language understanding, manifesting bag-of-words behaviour. These limitations are reinforced by their dual-encoder design, which induces a modality gap. Additionally, the reliance on vast web-collected data corpora for training makes the process computationally expensive and introduces significant privacy concerns. To address these limitations, in this work, we challenge the necessity of vision encoders for retrieval tasks by introducing a vision-free, single-encoder retrieval pipeline. Departing from the traditional text-to-image retrieval paradigm, we migrate to a text-to-text paradigm with the assistance of VLLM-generated structured image descriptions. We demonstrate that this paradigm shift has significant advantages, including a substantial reduction of the modality gap, improved compositionality, and better performance on short and long caption queries, all attainable with only a few hours of calibration on two GPUs. Additionally, substituting raw images with textual descriptions introduces a more privacy-friendly alternative for retrieval. To further assess generalisation and address some of the shortcomings of prior compositionality benchmarks, we release two benchmarks derived from Flickr30k and COCO, containing diverse compositional queries made of short captions, which we coin subFlickr and subCOCO. Our vision-free retriever matches and often surpasses traditional multimodal models. Importantly, our approach achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on multiple retrieval and compositionality benchmarks, with models as small as 0.3B parameters.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across a variety of real-world tasks. However, existing VLMs typically process visual information by serializing images, a method that diverges significantly from the parallel nature of human vision. Moreover, their opaque internal mechanisms hinder both deeper understanding and architectural innovation. Inspired by the dual-stream hypothesis of human vision, which distinguishes the "what" and "where" pathways, we deconstruct the visual processing in VLMs into object recognition and spatial perception for separate study. For object recognition, we convert images into text token maps and find that the model's perception of image content unfolds as a two-stage process from shallow to deep layers, beginning with attribute recognition and culminating in semantic disambiguation. For spatial perception, we theoretically derive and empirically verify the geometric structure underlying the positional representation in VLMs. Based on these findings, we introduce an instruction-agnostic token compression algorithm based on a plug-and-play visual decoder to improve decoding efficiency, and a RoPE scaling technique to enhance spatial reasoning. Through rigorous experiments, our work validates these analyses, offering a deeper understanding of VLM internals and providing clear principles for designing more capable future architectures.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Colorectal cancer (CRC), a lethal disease, begins with the growth of abnormal mucosal cell proliferation called polyps in the inner wall of the colon. When left undetected, polyps can become malignant tumors. Colonoscopy is the standard procedure for detecting polyps, as it enables direct visualization and removal of suspicious lesions. Manual detection by colonoscopy can be inconsistent and is subject to oversight. Therefore, object detection based on deep learning offers a better solution for a more accurate and real-time diagnosis during colonoscopy. In this work, we propose YOLO-LAN, a YOLO-based polyp detection pipeline, trained using M2IoU loss, versatile data augmentations and negative data to replicate real clinical situations. Our pipeline outperformed existing methods for the Kvasir-seg and BKAI-IGH NeoPolyp datasets, achieving mAP$_{50}$ of 0.9619, mAP$_{50:95}$ of 0.8599 with YOLOv12 and mAP$_{50}$ of 0.9540, mAP$_{50:95}$ of 0.8487 with YOLOv8 on the Kvasir-seg dataset. The significant increase is achieved in mAP$_{50:95}$ score, showing the precision of polyp detection. We show robustness based on polyp size and precise location detection, making it clinically relevant in AI-assisted colorectal screening.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent self-supervised stereo matching methods have made significant progress, but their performance significantly degrades under adverse weather conditions such as night, rain, and fog. We identify two primary weaknesses contributing to this performance degradation. First, adverse weather introduces noise and reduces visibility, making CNN-based feature extractors struggle with degraded regions like reflective and textureless areas. Second, these degraded regions can disrupt accurate pixel correspondences, leading to ineffective supervision based on the photometric consistency assumption. To address these challenges, we propose injecting robust priors derived from the visual foundation model into the CNN-based feature extractor to improve feature representation under adverse weather conditions. We then introduce scene correspondence priors to construct robust supervisory signals rather than relying solely on the photometric consistency assumption. Specifically, we create synthetic stereo datasets with realistic weather degradations. These datasets feature clear and adverse image pairs that maintain the same semantic context and disparity, preserving the scene correspondence property. With this knowledge, we propose a robust self-supervised training paradigm, consisting of two key steps: robust self-supervised scene correspondence learning and adverse weather distillation. Both steps aim to align underlying scene results from clean and adverse image pairs, thus improving model disparity estimation under adverse weather effects. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of our proposed solution, which outperforms existing state-of-the-art self-supervised methods.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer significant potential for enabling energy-efficient intelligence at the edge. However, performing full SNN inference at the edge can be challenging due to the latency and energy constraints arising from fixed and high timestep overheads. Edge-cloud co-inference systems present a promising solution, but their deployment is often hindered by high latency and feature transmission costs. To address these issues, we introduce NeuCODEX, a neuromorphic co-inference architecture that jointly optimizes both spatial and temporal redundancy. NeuCODEX incorporates a learned spike-driven compression module to reduce data transmission and employs a dynamic early-exit mechanism to adaptively terminate inference based on output confidence. We evaluated NeuCODEX on both static images (CIFAR10 and Caltech) and neuromorphic event streams (CIFAR10-DVS and N-Caltech). To demonstrate practicality, we prototyped NeuCODEX on ResNet-18 and VGG-16 backbones in a real edge-to-cloud testbed. Our proposed system reduces data transfer by up to 2048x and edge energy consumption by over 90%, while reducing end-to-end latency by up to 3x compared to edge-only inference, all with a negligible accuracy drop of less than 2%. In doing so, NeuCODEX enables practical, high-performance SNN deployment in resource-constrained environments.

  We introduce KAMERA: a comprehensive system for multi-camera, multi-spectral synchronization and real-time detection of seals and polar bears. Utilized in aerial surveys for ice-associated seals in the Bering, Chukchi, and Beaufort seas around Alaska, KAMERA provides up to an 80% reduction in dataset processing time over previous methods. Our rigorous calibration and hardware synchronization enable using multiple spectra for object detection. All collected data are annotated with metadata so they can be easily referenced later. All imagery and animal detections from a survey are mapped onto a world plane for accurate surveyed area estimates and quick assessment of survey results. We hope KAMERA will inspire other mapping and detection efforts in the scientific community, with all software, models, and schematics fully open-sourced.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this paper, we consider the problem of long-term point tracking, which requires consistent identification of points across video frames under significant appearance changes, motion, and occlusion. We target the online setting, i.e. tracking points frame-by-frame, making it suitable for real-time and streaming applications. We extend our prior model Track-On into Track-On2, a simple and efficient transformer-based model for online long-term tracking. Track-On2 improves both performance and efficiency through architectural refinements, more effective use of memory, and improved synthetic training strategies. Unlike prior approaches that rely on full-sequence access or iterative updates, our model processes frames causally and maintains temporal coherence via a memory mechanism, which is key to handling drift and occlusions without requiring future frames. At inference, we perform coarse patch-level classification followed by refinement. Beyond architecture, we systematically study synthetic training setups and their impact on memory behavior, showing how they shape temporal robustness over long sequences. Through comprehensive experiments, Track-On2 achieves state-of-the-art results across five synthetic and real-world benchmarks, surpassing prior online trackers and even strong offline methods that exploit bidirectional context. These results highlight the effectiveness of causal, memory-based architectures trained purely on synthetic data as scalable solutions for real-world point tracking. Project page:this https URL

  Medical imaging provides critical evidence for clinical diagnosis, treatment planning, and surgical decisions, yet most existing imaging models are narrowly focused and require multiple specialized networks, limiting their generalization. Although large-scale language and multimodal models exhibit strong reasoning and multi-task capabilities, real-world clinical applications demand precise visual grounding, multimodal integration, and chain-of-thought reasoning. We introduce Citrus-V, a multimodal medical foundation model that combines image analysis with textual reasoning. The model integrates detection, segmentation, and multimodal chain-of-thought reasoning, enabling pixel-level lesion localization, structured report generation, and physician-like diagnostic inference in a single framework. We propose a novel multimodal training approach and release a curated open-source data suite covering reasoning, detection, segmentation, and document understanding tasks. Evaluations demonstrate that Citrus-V outperforms existing open-source medical models and expert-level imaging systems across multiple benchmarks, delivering a unified pipeline from visual grounding to clinical reasoning and supporting precise lesion quantification, automated reporting, and reliable second opinions.

  Multi-spectral imagery plays a crucial role in diverse Remote Sensing applications including land-use classification, environmental monitoring and urban planning. These images are widely adopted because their additional spectral bands correlate strongly with physical materials on the ground, such as ice, water, and vegetation. This allows for more accurate identification, and their public availability from missions, such as Sentinel-2 and Landsat, only adds to their value. Currently, the automatic analysis of such data is predominantly managed through machine learning models specifically trained for multi-spectral input, which are costly to train and support. Furthermore, although providing a lot of utility for Remote Sensing, such additional inputs cannot be used with powerful generalist large multimodal models, which are capable of solving many visual problems, but are not able to understand specialized multi-spectral signals.To address this, we propose a training-free approach which introduces new multi-spectral data in a Zero-Shot-only mode, as inputs to generalist multimodal models, trained on RGB-only inputs. Our approach leverages the multimodal models' understanding of the visual space, and proposes to adapt to inputs to that space, and to inject domain-specific information as instructions into the model. We exemplify this idea with the Gemini2.5 model and observe strong Zero-Shot performance gains of the approach on popular Remote Sensing benchmarks for land cover and land use classification and demonstrate the easy adaptability of Gemini2.5 to new inputs. These results highlight the potential for geospatial professionals, working with non-standard specialized inputs, to easily leverage powerful multimodal models, such as Gemini2.5, to accelerate their work, benefiting from their rich reasoning and contextual capabilities, grounded in the specialized sensor data.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Sa2VA is a recent model for language-guided dense grounding in images and video that achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple segmentation benchmarks and that has become widely popular. However, we found that Sa2VA does not perform according to its full potential for referring video object segmentation tasks. We identify inconsistencies between training and inference procedures as the key factor holding it back. To mitigate this issue, we propose an improved version of Sa2VA, Sa2VA-i, that rectifies these issues and improves the results. In fact, Sa2VA-i sets a new state of the art for multiple video benchmarks and achieves improvements of up to +11.6 J&F on MeViS, +1.4 on Ref-YT-VOS, +3.3 on Ref-DAVIS and +4.1 on ReVOS using the same Sa2VA checkpoints. With our fixes, the Sa2VA-i-1B model even performs on par with the original Sa2VA-26B model on the MeViS benchmark. We hope that this work will show the importance of seemingly trivial implementation details and that it will provide valuable insights for the referring video segmentation field.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper presents ColorBlindnessEval, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the robustness of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in visually adversarial scenarios inspired by the Ishihara color blindness test. Our dataset comprises 500 Ishihara-like images featuring numbers from 0 to 99 with varying color combinations, challenging VLMs to accurately recognize numerical information embedded in complex visual patterns. We assess 9 VLMs using Yes/No and open-ended prompts and compare their performance with human participants. Our experiments reveal limitations in the models' ability to interpret numbers in adversarial contexts, highlighting prevalent hallucination issues. These findings underscore the need to improve the robustness of VLMs in complex visual environments. ColorBlindnessEval serves as a valuable tool for benchmarking and improving the reliability of VLMs in real-world applications where accuracy is critical.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Accurate segmentation of cardiac anatomy in echocardiography is essential for cardiovascular diagnosis and treatment. Yet echocardiography is prone to deformation and speckle noise, causing frame-to-frame segmentation jitter. Even with high accuracy in single-frame segmentation, temporal instability can weaken functional estimates and impair clinical interpretability. To address these issues, we propose DyL-UNet, a dynamic learning-based temporal consistency U-Net segmentation architecture designed to achieve temporally stable and precise echocardiographic segmentation. The framework constructs an Echo-Dynamics Graph (EDG) through dynamic learning to extract dynamic information from videos. DyL-UNet incorporates multiple Swin-Transformer-based encoder-decoder branches for processing single-frame images. It further introduces Cardiac Phase-Dynamics Attention (CPDA) at the skip connections, which uses EDG-encoded dynamic features and cardiac-phase cues to enforce temporal consistency during segmentation. Extensive experiments on the CAMUS and EchoNet-Dynamic datasets demonstrate that DyL-UNet maintains segmentation accuracy comparable to existing methods while achieving superior temporal consistency, providing a reliable solution for automated clinical echocardiography.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this paper, we propose a weakly supervised semantic segmentation approach for food images which takes advantage of the zero-shot capabilities and promptability of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) along with the attention mechanisms of Vision Transformers (ViTs). Specifically, we use class activation maps (CAMs) from ViTs to generate prompts for SAM, resulting in masks suitable for food image segmentation. The ViT model, a Swin Transformer, is trained exclusively using image-level annotations, eliminating the need for pixel-level annotations during training. Additionally, to enhance the quality of the SAM-generated masks, we examine the use of image preprocessing techniques in combination with single-mask and multi-mask SAM generation strategies. The methodology is evaluated on the FoodSeg103 dataset, generating an average of 2.4 masks per image (excluding background), and achieving an mIoU of 0.54 for the multi-mask scenario. We envision the proposed approach as a tool to accelerate food image annotation tasks or as an integrated component in food and nutrition tracking applications.

  Chain of thought reasoning has demonstrated remarkable success in large language models, yet its adaptation to vision-language reasoning remains an open challenge with unclear best practices. Existing attempts typically employ reasoning chains at a coarse-grained level, which struggles to perform fine-grained structured reasoning and, more importantly, are difficult to evaluate the reward and quality of intermediate reasoning. In this work, we delve into chain of step reasoning for vision-language models, enabling assessing reasoning step quality accurately and leading to effective reinforcement learning and inference-time scaling with fine-grained rewards. We present a simple, effective, and fully transparent framework, including the step-level reasoning data, process reward model (PRM), and reinforcement learning training. With the proposed approaches, our models set strong baselines with consistent improvements on challenging vision-language benchmarks. More importantly, we conduct a thorough empirical analysis and ablation study, unveiling the impact of each component and several intriguing properties of inference-time scaling. We believe this paper serves as a baseline for vision-language models and offers insights into more complex multimodal reasoning. Our dataset, PRM, and code will be available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have significantly enhanced video understanding capabilities, opening new possibilities for practical applications. Yet current video benchmarks focus largely on indoor scenes or short-range outdoor activities, leaving the challenges associated with long-distance travel largely unexplored. Mastering extended geospatial-temporal trajectories is critical for next-generation MLLMs, underpinning real-world tasks such as embodied-AI planning and navigation. To bridge this gap, we present VIR-Bench, a novel benchmark consisting of 200 travel videos that frames itinerary reconstruction as a challenging task designed to evaluate and push forward MLLMs' geospatial-temporal intelligence. Experimental results reveal that state-of-the-art MLLMs, including proprietary ones, struggle to achieve high scores, underscoring the difficulty of handling videos that span extended spatial and temporal scales. Moreover, we conduct an in-depth case study in which we develop a prototype travel-planning agent that leverages the insights gained from VIR-Bench. The agent's markedly improved itinerary recommendations verify that our evaluation protocol not only benchmarks models effectively but also translates into concrete performance gains in user-facing applications.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Domain adaptive segmentation (DAS) of numerous organelle instances from large-scale electron microscopy (EM) is a promising way to enable annotation-efficient learning. Inspired by SAM, we propose a promptable multitask framework, namely Prompt-DAS, which is flexible enough to utilize any number of point prompts during the adaptation training stage and testing stage. Thus, with varying prompt configurations, Prompt-DAS can perform unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) and weakly supervised domain adaptation (WDA), as well as interactive segmentation during testing. Unlike the foundation model SAM, which necessitates a prompt for each individual object instance, Prompt-DAS is only trained on a small dataset and can utilize full points on all instances, sparse points on partial instances, or even no points at all, facilitated by the incorporation of an auxiliary center-point detection task. Moreover, a novel prompt-guided contrastive learning is proposed to enhance discriminative feature learning. Comprehensive experiments conducted on challenging benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach over existing UDA, WDA, and SAM-based approaches.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Cholecystectomy is one of the most frequently performed procedures in gastrointestinal surgery, and the laparoscopic approach is the gold standard for symptomatic cholecystolithiasis and acute cholecystitis. In addition to the advantages of a significantly faster recovery and better cosmetic results, the laparoscopic approach bears a higher risk of bile duct injury, which has a significant impact on quality of life and survival. To avoid bile duct injury, it is essential to improve the intraoperative visualization of the bile duct. This work aims to address this problem by leveraging a deep-learning approach for the localization of the biliary tract from white-light images acquired during the surgical procedures. To this end, the construction and annotation of an image database to train the Yolo detection algorithm has been employed. Besides classical data augmentation techniques, the paper proposes Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) for the generation of a synthetic portion of the training dataset. Experimental results have been discussed along with ethical considerations.

  _Zijing Guo, Yunyang Zhao, Lin Wang_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Mirror-containing environments pose unique challenges for 3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis (NVS), as reflective surfaces introduce view-dependent distortions and inconsistencies. While cutting-edge methods such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) excel in typical scenes, their performance deteriorates in the presence of mirrors. Existing solutions mainly focus on handling mirror surfaces through symmetry mapping but often overlook the rich information carried by mirror reflections. These reflections offer complementary perspectives that can fill in absent details and significantly enhance reconstruction quality. To advance 3D reconstruction in mirror-rich environments, we present MirrorScene3D, a comprehensive dataset featuring diverse indoor scenes, 1256 high-quality images, and annotated mirror masks, providing a benchmark for evaluating reconstruction methods in reflective settings. Building on this, we propose ReflectiveGS, an extension of 3D Gaussian Splatting that utilizes mirror reflections as complementary viewpoints rather than simple symmetry artifacts, enhancing scene geometry and recovering absent details. Experiments on MirrorScene3D show that ReflectiveGaussian outperforms existing methods in SSIM, PSNR, LPIPS, and training speed, setting a new benchmark for 3D reconstruction in mirror-rich environments.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  While deep learning, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs), has significantly advanced classification performance, its typical reliance on extensive annotated datasets presents a major obstacle in many practical scenarios where such data is scarce. Vision-language models (VLMs) and transfer learning with pre-trained visual models appear as promising techniques to deal with this problem. This paper proposes a novel zero-shot image classification framework that combines a VLM and a pre-trained visual model within a self-learning cycle. Requiring only the set of class names and no labeled training data, our method utilizes a confidence-based pseudo-labeling strategy to train a lightweight classifier directly on the test data, enabling dynamic adaptation. The VLM identifies high-confidence samples, and the pre-trained visual model enhances their visual representations. These enhanced features then iteratively train the classifier, allowing the system to capture complementary semantic and visual cues without supervision. Notably, our approach avoids VLM fine-tuning and the use of large language models, relying on the visual-only model to reduce the dependence on semantic representation. Experimental evaluations on ten diverse datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms the baseline zero-shot method.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Dendritic spines are key structural components of excitatory synapses in the brain. Given the size of dendritic spines provides a proxy for synaptic efficacy, their detection and tracking across time is important for studies of the neural basis of learning and memory. Despite their relevance, large-scale analyses of the structural dynamics of dendritic spines in 3D+time microscopy data remain challenging and labor-intense. Here, we present a modular machine learning-based pipeline designed to automate the detection, time-tracking, and feature extraction of dendritic spines in volumes chronically recorded with two-photon microscopy. Our approach tackles the challenges posed by biological data by combining a transformer-based detection module, a depth-tracking component that integrates spatial features, a time-tracking module to associate 3D spines across time by leveraging spatial consistency, and a feature extraction unit that quantifies biologically relevant spine properties. We validate our method on open-source labeled spine data, and on two complementary annotated datasets that we publish alongside this work: one for detection and depth-tracking, and one for time-tracking, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first data of this kind. To encourage future research, we release our data, code, and pre-trained weights atthis https URL, establishing a baseline for scalable, end-to-end analysis of dendritic spine dynamics.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce the first method for audio-driven universal photorealistic avatar synthesis, combining a person-agnostic speech model with our novel Universal Head Avatar Prior (UHAP). UHAP is trained on cross-identity multi-view videos. In particular, our UHAP is supervised with neutral scan data, enabling it to capture the identity-specific details at high fidelity. In contrast to previous approaches, which predominantly map audio features to geometric deformations only while ignoring audio-dependent appearance variations, our universal speech model directly maps raw audio inputs into the UHAP latent expression space. This expression space inherently encodes, both, geometric and appearance variations. For efficient personalization to new subjects, we employ a monocular encoder, which enables lightweight regression of dynamic expression variations across video frames. By accounting for these expression-dependent changes, it enables the subsequent model fine-tuning stage to focus exclusively on capturing the subject's global appearance and geometry. Decoding these audio-driven expression codes via UHAP generates highly realistic avatars with precise lip synchronization and nuanced expressive details, such as eyebrow movement, gaze shifts, and realistic mouth interior appearance as well as motion. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our method is not only the first generalizable audio-driven avatar model that can account for detailed appearance modeling and rendering, but it also outperforms competing (geometry-only) methods across metrics measuring lip-sync accuracy, quantitative image quality, and perceptual realism.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The pretraining-finetuning paradigm is a crucial strategy in metallic surface defect detection for mitigating the challenges posed by data scarcity. However, its implementation presents a critical dilemma. Pretraining on natural image datasets such as ImageNet, faces a significant domain gap. Meanwhile, naive self-supervised pretraining on in-domain industrial data is often ineffective due to the inability of existing learning objectives to distinguish subtle defect patterns from complex background noise and textures. To resolve this, we introduce Anomaly-Guided Self-Supervised Pretraining (AGSSP), a novel paradigm that explicitly guides representation learning through anomaly priors. AGSSP employs a two-stage framework: (1) it first pretrains the model's backbone by distilling knowledge from anomaly maps, encouraging the network to capture defect-salient features; (2) it then pretrains the detector using pseudo-defect boxes derived from these maps, aligning it with localization tasks. To enable this, we develop a knowledge-enhanced method to generate high-quality anomaly maps and collect a large-scale industrial dataset of 120,000 images. Additionally, we present two small-scale, pixel-level labeled metallic surface defect datasets for validation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AGSSP consistently enhances performance across various settings, achieving up to a 10\% improvement in mAP@0.5 and 11.4\% in mAP@0.5:0.95 compared to ImageNet-based models. All code, pretrained models, and datasets are publicly available atthis https URL.

  Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are expected to revolutionize transportation by improving efficiency and safety. Their success relies on 3D vision systems that effectively sense the environment and detect traffic agents. Among sensors AVs use to create a comprehensive view of surroundings, LiDAR provides high-resolution depth data enabling accurate object detection, safe navigation, and collision avoidance. However, collecting real-world LiDAR data is time-consuming and often affected by noise and sparsity due to adverse weather or sensor limitations. This work applies a denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM), enhanced with novel noise scheduling and time-step embedding techniques to generate high-quality synthetic data for augmentation, thereby improving performance across a range of computer vision tasks, particularly in AV perception. These modifications impact the denoising process and the model's temporal awareness, allowing it to produce more realistic point clouds based on the projection. The proposed method was extensively evaluated under various configurations using the IAMCV and KITTI-360 datasets, with four performance metrics compared against state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. The results demonstrate the model's superior performance over most existing baselines and its effectiveness in mitigating the effects of noisy and sparse LiDAR data, producing diverse point clouds with rich spatial relationships and structural detail.

We analyze their underlying mechanisms, strengths and limitations, as well as evaluation metrics, thereby providing a comprehensive overview to guide future research and applications.

  Audio-visual segmentation (AVS) plays a critical role in multimodal machine learning by effectively integrating audio and visual cues to precisely segment objects or regions within visual scenes. Recent AVS methods have demonstrated significant improvements. However, they overlook the inherent frequency-domain contradictions between audio and visual modalities--the pervasively interfering noise in audio high-frequency signals vs. the structurally rich details in visual high-frequency signals. Ignoring these differences can result in suboptimal performance. In this paper, we rethink the AVS task from a deeper perspective by reformulating AVS task as a frequency-domain decomposition and recomposition problem. To this end, we introduce a novel Frequency-Aware Audio-Visual Segmentation (FAVS) framework consisting of two key modules: Frequency-Domain Enhanced Decomposer (FDED) module and Synergistic Cross-Modal Consistency (SCMC) module. FDED module employs a residual-based iterative frequency decomposition to discriminate modality-specific semantics and structural features, and SCMC module leverages a mixture-of-experts architecture to reinforce semantic consistency and modality-specific feature preservation through dynamic expert routing. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our FAVS framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on three benchmark datasets, and abundant qualitative visualizations further verify the effectiveness of the proposed FDED and SCMC modules. The code will be released as open source upon acceptance of the paper.

  Moir√© patterns arise from spectral aliasing between display pixel lattices and camera sensor grids, manifesting as anisotropic, multi-scale artifacts that pose significant challenges for digital image demoir√©ing. We propose Moir√©Net, a convolutional neural U-Net-based framework that synergistically integrates frequency and spatial domain features for effective artifact removal. Moir√©Net introduces two key components: a Directional Frequency-Spatial Encoder (DFSE) that discerns moir√© orientation via directional difference convolution, and a Frequency-Spatial Adaptive Selector (FSAS) that enables precise, feature-adaptive suppression. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Moir√©Net achieves state-of-the-art performance on public and actively used datasets while being highly parameter-efficient. With only 5.513M parameters, representing a 48% reduction compared to ESDNet-L, Moir√©Net combines superior restoration quality with parameter efficiency, making it well-suited for resource-constrained applications including smartphone photography, industrial imaging, and augmented reality.

  In this paper, we propose the first Structure-from-Motion (SfM)-free deblurring 3D Gaussian Splatting method via event camera, dubbed DeblurSplat. We address the motion-deblurring problem in two ways. First, we leverage the pretrained capability of the dense stereo module (DUSt3R) to directly obtain accurate initial point clouds from blurred images. Without calculating camera poses as an intermediate result, we avoid the cumulative errors transfer from inaccurate camera poses to the initial point clouds' positions. Second, we introduce the event stream into the deblur pipeline for its high sensitivity to dynamic change. By decoding the latent sharp images from the event stream and blurred images, we can provide a fine-grained supervision signal for scene reconstruction optimization. Extensive experiments across a range of scenes demonstrate that DeblurSplat not only excels in generating high-fidelity novel views but also achieves significant rendering efficiency compared to the SOTAs in deblur 3D-GS.

In this paper, we propose Point Prompt Defender, an adversarial reinforcement learning framework that adopts an attack-for-defense paradigm to automatically optimize point prompts. We construct a task-agnostic point prompt environment by representing image patches as nodes in a dual-space graph, where edges encode both physical and semantic distances. Within this environment, an attacker agent learns to activate a subset of prompts that maximally degrade SAM's segmentation performance, while a defender agent learns to suppress these disruptive prompts and restore accuracy. Both agents are trained using Deep Q-Networks with a reward signal based on segmentation quality variation. During inference, only the defender is deployed to refine arbitrary coarse prompt sets, enabling enhanced SAM segmentation performance across diverse tasks without retraining. Extensive experiments show that Point Prompt Defender effectively improves SAM's robustness and generalization, establishing a flexible, interpretable, and plug-and-play framework for prompt-based segmentation.

  Tool-augmented large language models (LLMs) are usually trained with supervised imitation or coarse-grained reinforcement learning that optimizes single tool calls. Current self-reflection practices rely on heuristic prompts or one-way reasoning: the model is urged to 'think more' instead of learning error diagnosis and repair. This is fragile in multi-turn interactions; after a failure the model often repeats the same mistake. We propose structured reflection, which turns the path from error to repair into an explicit, controllable, and trainable action. The agent produces a short yet precise reflection: it diagnoses the failure using evidence from the previous step and then proposes a correct, executable follow-up call. For training we combine DAPO and GSPO objectives with a reward scheme tailored to tool use, optimizing the stepwise strategy Reflect, then Call, then Final. To evaluate, we introduce Tool-Reflection-Bench, a lightweight benchmark that programmatically checks structural validity, executability, parameter correctness, and result consistency. Tasks are built as mini trajectories of erroneous call, reflection, and corrected call, with disjoint train and test splits. Experiments on BFCL v3 and Tool-Reflection-Bench show large gains in multi-turn tool-call success and error recovery, and a reduction of redundant calls. These results indicate that making reflection explicit and optimizing it directly improves the reliability of tool interaction and offers a reproducible path for agents to learn from failure.

  Image Representation Learning is an important problem in Computer Vision. Traditionally, images were processed as grids, using Convolutional Neural Networks or as a sequence of visual tokens, using Vision Transformers. Recently, Vision Graph Neural Networks (ViG) have proposed the treatment of images as a graph of nodes; which provides a more intuitive image representation. The challenge is to construct a graph of nodes in each layer that best represents the relations between nodes and does not need a hyper-parameter search. ViG models in the literature depend on non-parameterized and non-learnable statistical methods that operate on the latent features of nodes to create a graph. This might not select the best neighborhood for each node. Starting from k-NN graph construction to HyperGraph Construction and Similarity-Thresholded graph construction, these methods lack the ability to provide a learnable hyper-parameter-free graph construction method. To overcome those challenges, we present the Learnable Reparameterized Graph Construction (LRGC) for Vision Graph Neural Networks. LRGC applies key-query attention between every pair of nodes; then uses soft-threshold reparameterization for edge selection, which allows the use of a differentiable mathematical model for training. Using learnable parameters to select the neighborhood removes the bias that is induced by any clustering or thresholding methods previously introduced in the literature. In addition, LRGC allows tuning the threshold in each layer to the training data since the thresholds are learnable through training and are not provided as hyper-parameters to the model. We demonstrate that the proposed ViG-LRGC approach outperforms state-of-the-art ViG models of similar sizes on the ImageNet-1k benchmark dataset.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This study evaluates the capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision Language Models (VLMs) in the task of single-label classification of Christian Iconography. The goal was to assess whether general-purpose VLMs (CLIP and SigLIP) and LLMs, such as GPT-4o and Gemini 2.5, can interpret the Iconography, typically addressed by supervised classifiers, and evaluate their performance. Two research questions guided the analysis: (RQ1) How do multimodal LLMs perform on image classification of Christian saints? And (RQ2), how does performance vary when enriching input with contextual information or few-shot exemplars? We conducted a benchmarking study using three datasets supporting Iconclass natively: ArtDL, ICONCLASS, and Wikidata, filtered to include the top 10 most frequent classes. Models were tested under three conditions: (1) classification using class labels, (2) classification with Iconclass descriptions, and (3) few-shot learning with five exemplars. Results were compared against ResNet50 baselines fine-tuned on the same datasets. The findings show that Gemini-2.5 Pro and GPT-4o outperformed the ResNet50 baselines. Accuracy dropped significantly on the Wikidata dataset, where Siglip reached the highest accuracy score, suggesting model sensitivity to image size and metadata alignment. Enriching prompts with class descriptions generally improved zero-shot performance, while few-shot learning produced lower results, with only occasional and minimal increments in accuracy. We conclude that general-purpose multimodal LLMs are capable of classification in visually complex cultural heritage domains. These results support the application of LLMs as metadata curation tools in digital humanities workflows, suggesting future research on prompt optimization and the expansion of the study to other classification strategies and models.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Unified multimodal models have recently attracted considerable attention for their remarkable abilities in jointly understanding and generating diverse content. However, as contexts integrate increasingly numerous interleaved multimodal tokens, the iterative processes of diffusion denoising and autoregressive decoding impose significant computational overhead. To address this, we propose Hyper-Bagel, a unified acceleration framework designed to simultaneously speed up both multimodal understanding and generation tasks. Our approach uses a divide-and-conquer strategy, employing speculative decoding for next-token prediction and a multi-stage distillation process for diffusion denoising. The framework delivers substantial performance gains, achieving over a 2x speedup in multimodal understanding. For generative tasks, our resulting lossless 6-NFE model yields a 16.67x speedup in text-to-image generation and a 22x speedup in image editing, all while preserving the high-quality output of the original model. We further develop a highly efficient 1-NFE model that enables near real-time interactive editing and generation. By combining advanced adversarial distillation with human feedback learning, this model achieves ultimate cost-effectiveness and responsiveness, making complex multimodal interactions seamless and instantaneous.

  Robot-assisted surgery (RAS) has become a critical paradigm in modern surgery, promoting patient recovery and reducing the burden on surgeons through minimally invasive approaches. To fully realize its potential, however, a precise understanding of the visual data generated during surgical procedures is essential. Previous studies have predominantly focused on single-task approaches, but real surgical scenes involve complex temporal dynamics and diverse instrument interactions that limit comprehensive understanding. Moreover, the effective application of multi-task learning (MTL) requires sufficient pixel-level segmentation data, which are difficult to obtain due to the high cost and expertise required for annotation. In particular, long-term annotations such as phases and steps are available for every frame, whereas short-term annotations such as surgical instrument segmentation and action detection are provided only for key frames, resulting in a significant temporal-spatial imbalance. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework that combines optical flow-based segmentation label interpolation with multi-task learning. optical flow estimated from annotated key frames is used to propagate labels to adjacent unlabeled frames, thereby enriching sparse spatial supervision and balancing temporal and spatial information for training. This integration improves both the accuracy and efficiency of surgical scene understanding and, in turn, enhances the utility of RAS.

  Achieving high image quality for temporal frames in dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) is challenging due to the limited statistic especially for the short frames. Recent studies have shown that deep learning (DL) is useful in a wide range of medical image denoising tasks. In this paper, we propose a model-based neural network for dynamic PET image denoising. The inter-frame spatial correlation and intra-frame structural consistency in dynamic PET are used to establish the kernel space-based multidimensional sparse (KMDS) model. We then substitute the inherent forms of the parameter estimation with neural networks to enable adaptive parameters optimization, forming the end-to-end neural KMDS-Net. Extensive experimental results from simulated and real data demonstrate that the neural KMDS-Net exhibits strong denoising performance for dynamic PET, outperforming previous baseline methods. The proposed method may be used to effectively achieve high temporal and spatial resolution for dynamic PET. Our source code is available atthis https URL.

  The scarcity of annotated surgical data poses a significant challenge for developing deep learning systems in computer-assisted interventions. While diffusion models can synthesize realistic images, they often suffer from data memorization, resulting in inconsistent or non-diverse samples that may fail to improve, or even harm, downstream performance. We introduce \emph{Surgical Application-Aligned Diffusion} (SAADi), a new framework that aligns diffusion models with samples preferred by downstream models. Our method constructs pairs of \emph{preferred} and \emph{non-preferred} synthetic images and employs lightweight fine-tuning of diffusion models to align the image generation process with downstream objectives explicitly. Experiments on three surgical datasets demonstrate consistent gains of $7$--$9\%$ in classification and $2$--$10\%$ in segmentation tasks, with the considerable improvements observed for underrepresented classes. Iterative refinement of synthetic samples further boosts performance by $4$--$10\%$. Unlike baseline approaches, our method overcomes sample degradation and establishes task-aware alignment as a key principle for mitigating data scarcity and advancing surgical vision applications.

  Deer-vehicle collisions represent a critical safety challenge in the United States, causing nearly 2.1 million incidents annually and resulting in approximately 440 fatalities, 59,000 injuries, and 10 billion USD in economic damages. These collisions also contribute significantly to declining deer populations. This paper presents a real-time detection and driver warning system that integrates thermal imaging, deep learning, and vehicle-to-everything communication to help mitigate deer-vehicle collisions. Our system was trained and validated on a custom dataset of over 12,000 thermal deer images collected in Mars Hill, North Carolina. Experimental evaluation demonstrates exceptional performance with 98.84 percent mean average precision, 95.44 percent precision, and 95.96 percent recall. The system was field tested during a follow-up visit to Mars Hill and readily sensed deer providing the driver with advanced warning. Field testing validates robust operation across diverse weather conditions, with thermal imaging maintaining between 88 and 92 percent detection accuracy in challenging scenarios where conventional visible light based cameras achieve less than 60 percent effectiveness. When a high probability threshold is reached sensor data sharing messages are broadcast to surrounding vehicles and roadside units via cellular vehicle to everything (CV2X) communication devices. Overall, our system achieves end to end latency consistently under 100 milliseconds from detection to driver alert. This research establishes a viable technological pathway for reducing deer-vehicle collisions through thermal imaging and connected vehicles.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for medical image representation learning, particularly in settings with limited labeled data. However, existing SSL methods often rely on complex architectures, anatomy-specific priors, or heavily tuned augmentations, which limit their scalability and generalizability. More critically, these models are prone to shortcut learning, especially in modalities like chest X-rays, where anatomical similarity is high and pathology is subtle. In this work, we introduce DiSSECT -- Discrete Self-Supervision for Efficient Clinical Transferable Representations, a framework that integrates multi-scale vector quantization into the SSL pipeline to impose a discrete representational bottleneck. This constrains the model to learn repeatable, structure-aware features while suppressing view-specific or low-utility patterns, improving representation transfer across tasks and domains. DiSSECT achieves strong performance on both classification and segmentation tasks, requiring minimal or no fine-tuning, and shows particularly high label efficiency in low-label regimes. We validate DiSSECT across multiple public medical imaging datasets, demonstrating its robustness and generalizability compared to existing state-of-the-art approaches.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We address the critical gap between the computational demands of vision-language models and the possible ultra-low-bit weight precision (bitwidth $\leq2$ bits) we can use for higher efficiency. Our work is motivated by the substantial computational cost and memory requirements of VLMs, which restrict their applicability in hardware-constrained environments. We propose Bi-VLM, which separates model weights non-uniformly based on the Gaussian quantiles. Our formulation groups the model weights into outlier (salient) and multiple inlier (unsalient) subsets, ensuring that each subset contains a proportion of weights corresponding to its quantile in the distribution. We propose a saliency-aware hybrid quantization algorithm and use it to quantize weights by imposing different constraints on the scaler and binary matrices based on the saliency metric and compression objective. We have evaluated our approach on different VLMs. For the language model part of the VLM, our Bi-VLM outperforms the SOTA by 3%-47% on the visual question answering task in terms of four different benchmarks and three different models. For the overall VLM, our Bi-VLM outperforms the SOTA by 4%-45%. We also perform token pruning on the quantized models and observe that there is redundancy of image tokens 90% - 99% in the quantized models. This helps us to further prune the visual tokens to improve efficiency.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated remarkable success in 3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis. However, reconstructing 3D scenes from sparse viewpoints remains highly challenging due to insufficient visual information, which results in noticeable artifacts persisting across the 3D representation. To address this limitation, recent methods have resorted to generative priors to remove artifacts and complete missing content in under-constrained areas. Despite their effectiveness, these approaches struggle to ensure multi-view consistency, resulting in blurred structures and implausible details. In this work, we propose FixingGS, a training-free method that fully exploits the capabilities of the existing diffusion model for sparse-view 3DGS reconstruction enhancement. At the core of FixingGS is our distillation approach, which delivers more accurate and cross-view coherent diffusion priors, thereby enabling effective artifact removal and inpainting. In addition, we propose an adaptive progressive enhancement scheme that further refines reconstructions in under-constrained regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FixingGS surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods with superior visual quality and reconstruction performance. Our code will be released publicly.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The success of Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly propelled the research of video understanding. To harvest the benefits of well-trained expert models (i.e., tools), video LLMs prioritize the exploration of tool usage capabilities. Existing methods either prompt closed-source LLMs or employ the instruction tuning paradigm for tool-use fine-tuning. These methods, however, assume an established repository of fixed tools and struggle to generalize to real-world environments where tool data is perpetually evolving and streaming in. To this end, we propose to enhance open-source video LLMs with COntinuaL Tool usage (termed COLT), which automatically acquires tool-use ability in a successive tool stream without suffering 'catastrophic forgetting' of the past learned tools. Specifically, our COLT incorporates a learnable tool codebook as a tool-specific memory system. Then relevant tools are dynamically selected based on the similarity between user instruction and tool features within the codebook. To unleash the tool usage potential of video LLMs, we collect a video-centric tool-use instruction tuning dataset VideoToolBench. Extensive experiments on both previous video LLM benchmarks and the tool-use-specific VideoToolBench dataset demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our proposed COLT.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  LiDAR-based perception is central to autonomous driving and robotics, yet raw point clouds remain highly vulnerable to noise, occlusion, and adversarial corruptions. Autoencoders offer a natural framework for denoising and reconstruction, but their performance degrades under challenging real-world conditions. In this work, we propose TriFusion-AE, a multimodal cross-attention autoencoder that integrates textual priors, monocular depth maps from multi-view images, and LiDAR point clouds to improve robustness. By aligning semantic cues from text, geometric (depth) features from images, and spatial structure from LiDAR, TriFusion-AE learns representations that are resilient to stochastic noise and adversarial perturbations. Interestingly, while showing limited gains under mild perturbations, our model achieves significantly more robust reconstruction under strong adversarial attacks and heavy noise, where CNN-based autoencoders collapse. We evaluate on the nuScenes-mini dataset to reflect realistic low-data deployment scenarios. Our multimodal fusion framework is designed to be model-agnostic, enabling seamless integration with any CNN-based point cloud autoencoder for joint representation learning.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  RGB-thermal salient object detection (RGB-T SOD) aims to identify prominent objects by integrating complementary information from RGB and thermal modalities. However, learning the precise boundaries and complete objects remains challenging due to the intrinsic insufficient feature fusion and the extrinsic limitations of data scarcity. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid prompt-driven segment anything model (HyPSAM), which leverages the zero-shot generalization capabilities of the segment anything model (SAM) for RGB-T SOD. Specifically, we first propose a dynamic fusion network (DFNet) that generates high-quality initial saliency maps as visual prompts. DFNet employs dynamic convolution and multi-branch decoding to facilitate adaptive cross-modality interaction, overcoming the limitations of fixed-parameter kernels and enhancing multi-modal feature representation. Moreover, we propose a plug-and-play refinement network (P2RNet), which serves as a general optimization strategy to guide SAM in refining saliency maps by using hybrid prompts. The text prompt ensures reliable modality input, while the mask and box prompts enable precise salient object localization. Extensive experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance. Notably, HyPSAM has remarkable versatility, seamlessly integrating with different RGB-T SOD methods to achieve significant performance gains, thereby highlighting the potential of prompt engineering in this field. The code and results of our method are available at:this https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Current visual foundation models (VFMs) face a fundamental limitation in transferring knowledge from vision language models (VLMs), while VLMs excel at modeling cross-modal interactions through unified representation spaces, existing VFMs predominantly adopt result-oriented paradigms that neglect the underlying interaction processes. This representational discrepancy hinders effective knowledge transfer and limits generalization across diverse vision tasks. We propose Learning from Interactions (LFI), a cognitive-inspired framework that addresses this gap by explicitly modeling visual understanding as an interactive process. Our key insight is that capturing the dynamic interaction patterns encoded in pre-trained VLMs enables more faithful and efficient knowledge transfer to VFMs. The approach centers on two technical innovations, Interaction Queries, which maintain persistent relational structures across network layers, and interaction-based supervision, derived from the cross-modal attention mechanisms of VLMs. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate consistent improvements across multiple benchmarks, achieving 3.3 and 1.6mAP/2.4AP absolute gains on TinyImageNet classification and COCO detection/segmentation respectively, with minimal parameter overhead and faster convergence. The framework particularly excels in cross-domain settings, delivering 2.4 and 9.3 zero-shot improvements on PACS and VLCS. Human evaluations further confirm its cognitive alignment, outperforming result-oriented methods by 2.7 times in semantic consistency metrics.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Object Re-IDentification (ReID) aims to recognize individuals across non-overlapping camera views. While recent advances have achieved remarkable progress, most existing models are constrained to either single-domain or cross-domain scenarios, limiting their real-world applicability. Single-domain models tend to overfit to domain-specific features, whereas cross-domain models often rely on diverse normalization strategies that may inadvertently suppress identity-specific discriminative cues. To address these limitations, we propose an Attribute Prompt Composition (APC) framework, which exploits textual semantics to jointly enhance discrimination and generalization. Specifically, we design an Attribute Prompt Generator (APG) consisting of a Semantic Attribute Dictionary (SAD) and a Prompt Composition Module (PCM). SAD is an over-complete attribute dictionary to provide rich semantic descriptions, while PCM adaptively composes relevant attributes from SAD to generate discriminative attribute-aware features. In addition, motivated by the strong generalization ability of Vision-Language Models (VLM), we propose a Fast-Slow Training Strategy (FSTS) to balance ReID-specific discrimination and generalizable representation learning. Specifically, FSTS adopts a Fast Update Stream (FUS) to rapidly acquire ReID-specific discriminative knowledge and a Slow Update Stream (SUS) to retain the generalizable knowledge inherited from the pre-trained VLM. Through a mutual interaction, the framework effectively focuses on ReID-relevant features while mitigating overfitting. Extensive experiments on both conventional and Domain Generalized (DG) ReID datasets demonstrate that our framework surpasses state-of-the-art methods, exhibiting superior performances in terms of both discrimination and generalization.

  Remote sensing visual grounding (RSVG) aims to localize objects in remote sensing images based on free-form natural language expressions. Existing approaches are typically constrained to closed-set vocabularies, limiting their applicability in open-world scenarios. While recent attempts to leverage generic foundation models for open-vocabulary RSVG, they overly rely on expensive high-quality datasets and time-consuming fine-tuning. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{RSVG-ZeroOV}, a training-free framework that aims to explore the potential of frozen generic foundation models for zero-shot open-vocabulary RSVG. Specifically, RSVG-ZeroOV comprises three key stages: (i) Overview: We utilize a vision-language model (VLM) to obtain cross-attention\footnote[1]{In this paper, although decoder-only VLMs use self-attention over all tokens, we refer to the image-text interaction part as cross-attention to distinguish it from pure visual self-attention.}maps that capture semantic correlations between text queries and visual regions. (ii) Focus: By leveraging the fine-grained modeling priors of a diffusion model (DM), we fill in gaps in structural and shape information of objects, which are often overlooked by VLM. (iii) Evolve: A simple yet effective attention evolution module is introduced to suppress irrelevant activations, yielding purified segmentation masks over the referred objects. Without cumbersome task-specific training, RSVG-ZeroOV offers an efficient and scalable solution. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework consistently outperforms existing weakly-supervised and zero-shot methods.

However, this profusion of data only concerns a few tens of thousands of species, while the planet has nearly 369K. The LifeCLEF 2019 Plant Identification challenge (or "PlantCLEF 2019") was designed to evaluate automated identification on the flora of data deficient regions. It is based on a dataset of 10K species mainly focused on the Guiana shield and the Northern Amazon rainforest, an area known to have one of the greatest diversity of plants and animals in the world. As in the previous edition, a comparison of the performance of the systems evaluated with the best tropical flora experts was carried out.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Fusing cross-category objects to a single coherent object has gained increasing attention in text-to-image (T2I) generation due to its broad applications in virtual reality, digital media, film, and gaming. However, existing methods often produce biased, visually chaotic, or semantically inconsistent results due to overlapping artifacts and poor integration. Moreover, progress in this field has been limited by the absence of a comprehensive benchmark dataset. To address these problems, we propose \textbf{Adaptive Group Swapping (AGSwap)}, a simple yet highly effective approach comprising two key components: (1) Group-wise Embedding Swapping, which fuses semantic attributes from different concepts through feature manipulation, and (2) Adaptive Group Updating, a dynamic optimization mechanism guided by a balance evaluation score to ensure coherent synthesis. Additionally, we introduce \textbf{Cross-category Object Fusion (COF)}, a large-scale, hierarchically structured dataset built upon ImageNet-1K and WordNet. COF includes 95 superclasses, each with 10 subclasses, enabling 451,250 unique fusion pairs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AGSwap outperforms state-of-the-art compositional T2I methods, including GPT-Image-1 using simple and complex prompts.

  Automated plant identification has improved considerably thanks to recent advances in deep learning and the availability of training data with more and more field photos. However, this profusion of data concerns only a few tens of thousands of species, mainly located in North America and Western Europe, much less in the richest regions in terms of biodiversity such as tropical countries. On the other hand, for several centuries, botanists have systematically collected, catalogued and stored plant specimens in herbaria, especially in tropical regions, and recent efforts by the biodiversity informatics community have made it possible to put millions of digitised records online. The LifeCLEF 2021 plant identification challenge (or "PlantCLEF 2021") was designed to assess the extent to which automated identification of flora in data-poor regions can be improved by using herbarium collections. It is based on a dataset of about 1,000 species mainly focused on the Guiana Shield of South America, a region known to have one of the highest plant diversities in the world. The challenge was evaluated as a cross-domain classification task where the training set consisted of several hundred thousand herbarium sheets and a few thousand photos to allow learning a correspondence between the two domains. In addition to the usual metadata (location, date, author, taxonomy), the training data also includes the values of 5 morphological and functional traits for each species. The test set consisted exclusively of photos taken in the field. This article presents the resources and evaluations of the assessment carried out, summarises the approaches and systems used by the participating research groups and provides an analysis of the main results.

  Open-set land-cover analysis in remote sensing requires the ability to achieve fine-grained spatial localization and semantically open categorization. This involves not only detecting and segmenting novel objects without categorical supervision but also assigning them interpretable semantic labels through multimodal reasoning. In this study, we introduce OSDA, an integrated three-stage framework for annotation-free open-set land-cover discovery, segmentation, and description. The pipeline consists of: (1) precise discovery and mask extraction with a promptable fine-tuned segmentation model (SAM), (2) semantic attribution and contextual description via a two-phase fine-tuned multimodal large language model (MLLM), and (3) LLM-as-judge and manual scoring of the MLLMs evaluation. By combining pixel-level accuracy with high-level semantic understanding, OSDA addresses key challenges in open-world remote sensing interpretation. Designed to be architecture-agnostic and label-free, the framework supports robust evaluation across diverse satellite imagery without requiring manual annotation. Our work provides a scalable and interpretable solution for dynamic land-cover monitoring, showing strong potential for automated cartographic updating and large-scale earth observation analysis.

  _Xinle Gao, Linghui Ye, Zhiyong Xiao_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  With the rapid development of society and continuous advances in science and technology, the food industry increasingly demands higher production quality and efficiency. Food image classification plays a vital role in enabling automated quality control on production lines, supporting food safety supervision, and promoting intelligent agricultural production. However, this task faces challenges due to the large number of parameters and high computational complexity of Vision Transformer models. To address these issues, we propose a lightweight food image classification algorithm that integrates a Window Multi-Head Attention Mechanism (WMHAM) and a Spatial Attention Mechanism (SAM). The WMHAM reduces computational cost by capturing local and global contextual features through efficient window partitioning, while the SAM adaptively emphasizes key spatial regions to improve discriminative feature representation. Experiments conducted on the Food-101 and Vireo Food-172 datasets demonstrate that our model achieves accuracies of 95.24% and 94.33%, respectively, while significantly reducing parameters and FLOPs compared with baseline methods. These results confirm that the proposed approach achieves an effective balance between computational efficiency and classification performance, making it well-suited for deployment in resource-constrained environments.

  Monocular relative and metric depth estimation has seen a tremendous boost in the last few years due to the sharp advancements in foundation models and in particular transformer based networks. As we start to see applications to the domain of endoscopic images, there is still a lack of robust benchmarks and high-quality datasets in that area. This paper addresses these limitations by presenting a comprehensive benchmark of state-of-the-art (metric and relative) depth estimation models evaluated on real, unseen endoscopic images, providing critical insights into their generalisation and performance in clinical scenarios. Additionally, we introduce and publish a novel synthetic dataset (EndoSynth) of endoscopic surgical instruments paired with ground truth metric depth and segmentation masks, designed to bridge the gap between synthetic and real-world data. We demonstrate that fine-tuning depth foundation models using our synthetic dataset boosts accuracy on most unseen real data by a significant margin. By providing both a benchmark and a synthetic dataset, this work advances the field of depth estimation for endoscopic images and serves as an important resource for future research.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent works have made notable advancements in enhancing unified models for text-to-image generation through the Chain-of-Thought (CoT). However, these reasoning methods separate the processes of understanding and generation, which limits their ability to guide the reasoning of unified models in addressing the deficiencies of their generative capabilities. To this end, we propose a novel reasoning framework for unified models, Understanding-in-Generation (UiG), which harnesses the robust understanding capabilities of unified models to reinforce their performance in image generation. The core insight of our UiG is to integrate generative guidance by the strong understanding capabilities during the reasoning process, thereby mitigating the limitations of generative abilities. To achieve this, we introduce "Image Editing" as a bridge to infuse understanding into the generation process. Initially, we verify the generated image and incorporate the understanding of unified models into the editing instructions. Subsequently, we enhance the generated image step by step, gradually infusing the understanding into the generation process. Our UiG framework demonstrates a significant performance improvement in text-to-image generation over existing text-to-image reasoning methods, e.g., a 3.92% gain on the long prompt setting of the TIIF benchmark.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Neuroimaging is a ubiquitous tool for evaluating patients with neurological diseases. The global demand for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies has risen steadily, placing significant strain on health systems, prolonging turnaround times, and intensifying physician burnout \cite{Chen2017-bt, Rula2024-qp-1}. These challenges disproportionately impact patients in low-resource and rural settings. Here, we utilized a large academic health system as a data engine to develop Prima, the first vision language model (VLM) serving as an AI foundation for neuroimaging that supports real-world, clinical MRI studies as input. Trained on over 220,000 MRI studies, Prima uses a hierarchical vision architecture that provides general and transferable MRI features. Prima was tested in a 1-year health system-wide study that included 30K MRI studies. Across 52 radiologic diagnoses from the major neurologic disorders, including neoplastic, inflammatory, infectious, and developmental lesions, Prima achieved a mean diagnostic area under the ROC curve of 92.0, outperforming other state-of-the-art general and medical AI models. Prima offers explainable differential diagnoses, worklist priority for radiologists, and clinical referral recommendations across diverse patient demographics and MRI systems. Prima demonstrates algorithmic fairness across sensitive groups and can help mitigate health system biases, such as prolonged turnaround times for low-resource populations. These findings highlight the transformative potential of health system-scale VLMs and Prima's role in advancing AI-driven healthcare.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Inverting corrupted images into the latent space of diffusion models is challenging. Current methods, which encode an image into a single latent vector, struggle to balance structural fidelity with semantic accuracy, leading to reconstructions with semantic drift, such as blurred details or incorrect attributes. To overcome this, we introduce Prompt-Guided Dual Latent Steering (PDLS), a novel, training-free framework built upon Rectified Flow models for their stable inversion paths. PDLS decomposes the inversion process into two complementary streams: a structural path to preserve source integrity and a semantic path guided by a prompt. We formulate this dual guidance as an optimal control problem and derive a closed-form solution via a Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR). This controller dynamically steers the generative trajectory at each step, preventing semantic drift while ensuring the preservation of fine detail without costly, per-image optimization. Extensive experiments on FFHQ-1K and ImageNet-1K under various inversion tasks, including Gaussian deblurring, motion deblurring, super-resolution and freeform inpainting, demonstrate that PDLS produces reconstructions that are both more faithful to the original image and better aligned with the semantic information than single-latent baselines.

  _Yuzhi Wu, Li Xiao, Jun Liu, Guangfeng Jiang, XiangGen Xia_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The emerging 4D millimeter-wave radar, measuring the range, azimuth, elevation, and Doppler velocity of objects, is recognized for its cost-effectiveness and robustness in autonomous driving. Nevertheless, its point clouds exhibit significant sparsity and noise, restricting its standalone application in 3D object detection. Recent 4D radar-camera fusion methods have provided effective perception. Most existing approaches, however, adopt explicit Bird's-Eye-View fusion paradigms originally designed for LiDAR-camera fusion, neglecting radar's inherent drawbacks. Specifically, they overlook the sparse and incomplete geometry of radar point clouds and restrict fusion to coarse scene-level integration. To address these problems, we propose MLF-4DRCNet, a novel two-stage framework for 3D object detection via multi-level fusion of 4D radar and camera images. Our model incorporates the point-, scene-, and proposal-level multi-modal information, enabling comprehensive feature representation. It comprises three crucial components: the Enhanced Radar Point Encoder (ERPE) module, the Hierarchical Scene Fusion Pooling (HSFP) module, and the Proposal-Level Fusion Enhancement (PLFE) module. Operating at the point-level, ERPE densities radar point clouds with 2D image instances and encodes them into voxels via the proposed Triple-Attention Voxel Feature Encoder. HSFP dynamically integrates multi-scale voxel features with 2D image features using deformable attention to capture scene context and adopts pooling to the fused features. PLFE refines region proposals by fusing image features, and further integrates with the pooled features from HSFP. Experimental results on the View-of-Delft (VoD) and TJ4DRadSet datasets demonstrate that MLF-4DRCNet achieves the state-of-the-art performance. Notably, it attains performance comparable to LiDAR-based models on the VoD dataset.

  _Xu Liu, Yibo Lu, Xinxian Wang, Xinyu Wu_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We propose Adaptive Multi-Style Fusion (AMSF), a reference-based training-free framework that enables controllable fusion of multiple reference styles in diffusion models. Most of the existing reference-based methods are limited by (a) acceptance of only one style image, thus prohibiting hybrid aesthetics and scalability to more styles, and (b) lack of a principled mechanism to balance several stylistic influences. AMSF mitigates these challenges by encoding all style images and textual hints with a semantic token decomposition module that is adaptively injected into every cross-attention layer of an frozen diffusion model. A similarity-aware re-weighting module then recalibrates, at each denoising step, the attention allocated to every style component, yielding balanced and user-controllable blends without any fine-tuning or external adapters. Both qualitative and quantitative evaluations show that AMSF produces multi-style fusion results that consistently outperform the state-of-the-art approaches, while its fusion design scales seamlessly to two or more styles. These capabilities position AMSF as a practical step toward expressive multi-style generation in diffusion models.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Radiology report generation (RRG) aims to automatically produce clinically faithful reports from chest X-ray images. Prevailing work typically follows a scale-driven paradigm, by multi-stage training over large paired corpora and oversized backbones, making pipelines highly data- and compute-intensive. In this paper, we propose Oracle-educated GRPO {OraPO) with a FactScore-based reward (FactS) to tackle the RRG task under constrained budgets. OraPO enables single-stage, RL-only training by converting failed GRPO explorations on rare or difficult studies into direct preference supervision via a lightweight oracle step. FactS grounds learning in diagnostic evidence by extracting atomic clinical facts and checking entailment against ground-truth labels, yielding dense, interpretable sentence-level rewards. Together, OraPO and FactS create a compact and powerful framework that significantly improves learning efficiency on clinically challenging cases, setting the new SOTA performance on the CheXpert Plus dataset (0.341 in F1) with 2--3 orders of magnitude less training data using a small base VLM on modest hardware.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multi-contrast Magnetic Resonance Imaging super-resolution (MC-MRI SR) aims to enhance low-resolution (LR) contrasts leveraging high-resolution (HR) references, shortening acquisition time and improving imaging efficiency while preserving anatomical details. The main challenge lies in maintaining spatial-semantic consistency, ensuring anatomical structures remain well-aligned and coherent despite structural discrepancies and motion between the target and reference images. Conventional methods insufficiently model spatial-semantic consistency and underuse frequency-domain information, which leads to poor fine-grained alignment and inadequate recovery of high-frequency details. In this paper, we propose the Spatial-Semantic Consistent Model (SSCM), which integrates a Dynamic Spatial Warping Module for inter-contrast spatial alignment, a Semantic-Aware Token Aggregation Block for long-range semantic consistency, and a Spatial-Frequency Fusion Block for fine structure restoration. Experiments on public and private datasets show that SSCM achieves state-of-the-art performance with fewer parameters while ensuring spatially and semantically consistent reconstructions.

  This paper presents an advanced tumor segmentation framework for real-time MRI-guided radiotherapy, designed for the TrackRAD2025 challenge. Our method leverages the XMem model, a memory-augmented architecture, to segment tumors across long cine-MRI sequences. The proposed system efficiently integrates memory mechanisms to track tumor motion in real-time, achieving high segmentation accuracy even under challenging conditions with limited annotated data. Unfortunately, the detailed experimental records have been lost, preventing us from reporting precise quantitative results at this stage. Nevertheless, From our preliminary impressions during development, the XMem-based framework demonstrated reasonable segmentation performance and satisfied the clinical real-time requirement.

  While editing directly from life, photographers have found it too difficult to see simultaneously both the blue and the sky. Photographer and curator, Szarkowski insightfully revealed one of the notable gaps between general and aesthetic visual understanding: while the former focuses on identifying the factual element in an image (sky), the latter transcends such object identification, viewing it instead as an aesthetic component--a pure color block (blue). Such fundamental distinctions between general (detection, localization, etc.) and aesthetic (color, lighting, composition, etc.) visual understanding present a significant challenge for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Although some recent works have made initial explorations, they are often limited to general and basic aesthetic commonsense. As a result, they frequently fall short in real-world scenarios (Fig. 1), which require extensive expertise--including photographic techniques, photo pre/post-processing knowledge, and more, to provide a detailed analysis and description. To fundamentally enhance the aesthetics understanding of MLLMs, we first introduce a novel dataset, PhotoCritique, derived from extensive discussions among professional photographers and enthusiasts, and characterized by the large scale, expertise, and diversity. Then, to better learn visual aesthetics from PhotoCritique, we furthur propose a novel model, PhotoEye, featuring a languageguided multi-view vision fusion mechanism to understand image aesthetics from multiple perspectives. Finally, we present a novel benchmark, PhotoBench, a comprehensive and professional benchmark for aesthetic visual understanding. On existing benchmarks and PhotoBench, our model demonstrates clear advantages over existing models.

  Real-time threat monitoring identifies threatening behaviors in video streams and provides reasoning and assessment of threat events through explanatory text. However, prevailing methodologies, whether based on supervised learning or generative models, struggle to concurrently satisfy the demanding requirements of real-time performance and decision explainability. To bridge this gap, we introduce Live-E2T, a novel framework that unifies these two objectives through three synergistic mechanisms. First, we deconstruct video frames into structured Human-Object-Interaction-Place semantic tuples. This approach creates a compact, semantically focused representation, circumventing the information degradation common in conventional feature compression. Second, an efficient online event deduplication and updating mechanism is proposed to filter spatio-temporal redundancies, ensuring the system's real time responsiveness. Finally, we fine-tune a Large Language Model using a Chain-of-Thought strategy, endow it with the capability for transparent and logical reasoning over event sequences to produce coherent threat assessment reports. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, including XD-Violence and UCF-Crime, demonstrate that Live-E2T significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of threat detection accuracy, real-time efficiency, and the crucial dimension of explainability.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The distinction between genuine and posed emotions represents a fundamental pattern recognition challenge with significant implications for data mining applications in social sciences, healthcare, and human-computer interaction. While recent multi-task learning frameworks have shown promise in combining deep learning architectures with handcrafted D-Marker features for smile facial emotion recognition, these approaches exhibit computational inefficiencies due to auxiliary task supervision and complex loss balancing requirements. This paper introduces HadaSmileNet, a novel feature fusion framework that directly integrates transformer-based representations with physiologically grounded D-Markers through parameter-free multiplicative interactions. Through systematic evaluation of 15 fusion strategies, we demonstrate that Hadamard multiplicative fusion achieves optimal performance by enabling direct feature interactions while maintaining computational efficiency. The proposed approach establishes new state-of-the-art results for deep learning methods across four benchmark datasets: UvA-NEMO (88.7 percent, +0.8), MMI (99.7 percent), SPOS (98.5 percent, +0.7), and BBC (100 percent, +5.0). Comprehensive computational analysis reveals 26 percent parameter reduction and simplified training compared to multi-task alternatives, while feature visualization demonstrates enhanced discriminative power through direct domain knowledge integration. The framework's efficiency and effectiveness make it particularly suitable for practical deployment in multimedia data mining applications that require real-time affective computing capabilities.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  No-Reference Image Quality Assessment (NR-IQA) models play an important role in various real-world applications. Recently, adversarial attacks against NR-IQA models have attracted increasing attention, as they provide valuable insights for revealing model vulnerabilities and guiding robust system design. Some effective attacks have been proposed against NR-IQA models in white-box settings, where the attacker has full access to the target model. However, these attacks often suffer from poor transferability to unknown target models in more realistic black-box scenarios, where the target model is inaccessible. This work makes the first attempt to address the challenge of low transferability in attacking NR-IQA models by proposing a transferable Signed Ensemble Gaussian black-box Attack (SEGA). The main idea is to approximate the gradient of the target model by applying Gaussian smoothing to source models and ensembling their smoothed gradients. To ensure the imperceptibility of adversarial perturbations, SEGA further removes inappropriate perturbations using a specially designed perturbation filter mask. Experimental results on the CLIVE dataset demonstrate the superior transferability of SEGA, validating its effectiveness in enabling successful transfer-based black-box attacks against NR-IQA models.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Towards intelligent image editing, object removal should eliminate both the target object and its causal visual artifacts, such as shadows and reflections. However, existing image appearance-based methods either follow strictly mask-aligned training and fail to remove these causal effects which are not explicitly masked, or adopt loosely mask-aligned strategies that lack controllability and may unintentionally over-erase other objects. We identify that these limitations stem from ignoring the causal relationship between an object's geometry presence and its visual effects. To address this limitation, we propose a geometry-aware two-stage framework that decouples object removal into (1) geometry removal and (2) appearance rendering. In the first stage, we remove the object directly from the geometry (e.g., depth) using strictly mask-aligned supervision, enabling structure-aware editing with strong geometric constraints. In the second stage, we render a photorealistic RGB image conditioned on the updated geometry, where causal visual effects are considered implicitly as a result of the modified 3D geometry. To guide learning in the geometry removal stage, we introduce a preference-driven objective based on positive and negative sample pairs, encouraging the model to remove objects as well as their causal visual artifacts while avoiding new structural insertions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in removing both objects and their associated artifacts on two popular benchmarks.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Research on unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) for semantic segmentation of remote sensing images has been extensively conducted. However, research on how to achieve domain adaptation in practical scenarios where source domain data is inaccessible namely, source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) remains limited. Self-training has been widely used in SFDA, which requires obtaining as many high-quality pseudo-labels as possible to train models on target domain data. Most existing methods optimize the entire pseudo-label set to obtain more supervisory information. However, as pseudo-label sets often contain substantial noise, simultaneously optimizing all labels is challenging. This limitation undermines the effectiveness of optimization approaches and thus restricts the performance of self-training. To address this, we propose a novel pseudo-label optimization framework called Diffusion-Guided Label Enrichment (DGLE), which starts from a few easily obtained high-quality pseudo-labels and propagates them to a complete set of pseudo-labels while ensuring the quality of newly generated labels. Firstly, a pseudo-label fusion method based on confidence filtering and super-resolution enhancement is proposed, which utilizes cross-validation of details and contextual information to obtain a small number of high-quality pseudo-labels as initial seeds. Then, we leverage the diffusion model to propagate incomplete seed pseudo-labels with irregular distributions due to its strong denoising capability for randomly distributed noise and powerful modeling capacity for complex distributions, thereby generating complete and high-quality pseudo-labels. This method effectively avoids the difficulty of directly optimizing the complete set of pseudo-labels, significantly improves the quality of pseudo-labels, and thus enhances the model's performance in the target domain.

By parametrizing each Gaussian relative to its parent mesh triangle, we enforce alignment between Gaussians and mesh and obtain deformations that can be propagated back to update the CT. We demonstrate BridgeSplat's effectiveness on visceral pig surgeries and synthetic data of a human liver under simulation, showing sensible deformations of the preoperative CT on monocular RGB data.

  In this paper, we introduce MK-UNet, a paradigm shift towards ultra-lightweight, multi-kernel U-shaped CNNs tailored for medical image segmentation. Central to MK-UNet is the multi-kernel depth-wise convolution block (MKDC) we design to adeptly process images through multiple kernels, while capturing complex multi-resolution spatial relationships. MK-UNet also emphasizes the images salient features through sophisticated attention mechanisms, including channel, spatial, and grouped gated attention. Our MK-UNet network, with a modest computational footprint of only 0.316M parameters and 0.314G FLOPs, represents not only a remarkably lightweight, but also significantly improved segmentation solution that provides higher accuracy over state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods across six binary medical imaging benchmarks. Specifically, MK-UNet outperforms TransUNet in DICE score with nearly 333$\times$ and 123$\times$ fewer parameters and FLOPs, respectively. Similarly, when compared against UNeXt, MK-UNet exhibits superior segmentation performance, improving the DICE score up to 6.7% margins while operating with 4.7$\times$ fewer #Params. Our MK-UNet also outperforms other recent lightweight networks, such as MedT, CMUNeXt, EGE-UNet, and Rolling-UNet, with much lower computational resources. This leap in performance, coupled with drastic computational gains, positions MK-UNet as an unparalleled solution for real-time, high-fidelity medical diagnostics in resource-limited settings, such as point-of-care devices.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Coding images for machines with minimal bitrate and strong analysis performance is key to effective edge-cloud systems. Several approaches deploy an image codec and perform analysis on the reconstructed image. Other methods compress intermediate features using entropy models and subsequently perform analysis on the decoded features. Nevertheless, these methods both perform poorly under low-bitrate conditions, as they retain many redundant details or learn over-concentrated symbol distributions. In this paper, we propose a Codebook-based Adaptive Feature Compression framework with Semantic Enhancement, named CAFC-SE. It maps continuous visual features to discrete indices with a codebook at the edge via Vector Quantization (VQ) and selectively transmits them to the cloud. The VQ operation that projects feature vectors onto the nearest visual primitives enables us to preserve more informative visual patterns under low-bitrate conditions. Hence, CAFC-SE is less vulnerable to low-bitrate conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method in terms of rate and accuracy.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce MoCrop, a motion-aware adaptive cropping module for efficient video action recognition in the compressed domain. MoCrop uses motion vectors that are available in H.264 video to locate motion-dense regions and produces a single clip-level crop that is applied to all I-frames at inference. The module is training free, adds no parameters, and can be plugged into diverse backbones. A lightweight pipeline that includes denoising & merge (DM), Monte Carlo sampling (MCS), and adaptive cropping (AC) via a motion-density submatrix search yields robust crops with negligible overhead. On UCF101, MoCrop improves accuracy or reduces compute. With ResNet-50, it delivers +3.5% Top-1 accuracy at equal FLOPs (attention setting), or +2.4% Top-1 accuracy with 26.5% fewer FLOPs (efficiency setting). Applied to CoViAR, it reaches 89.2% Top-1 accuracy at the original cost and 88.5% Top-1 accuracy while reducing compute from 11.6 to 8.5 GFLOPs. Consistent gains on MobileNet-V3, EfficientNet-B1, and Swin-B indicate strong generality and make MoCrop practical for real-time deployment in the compressed domain.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Unpredictable movement patterns and small visual mark make precise tracking of fast-moving tiny objects like a racquetball one of the challenging problems in computer vision. This challenge is particularly relevant for sport robotics applications, where lightweight and accurate tracking systems can improve robot perception and planning capabilities. While Kalman filter-based tracking methods have shown success in general object tracking scenarios, their performance degrades substantially when dealing with rapidly moving objects that exhibit irregular bouncing behavior. In this study, we evaluate the performance of five state-of-the-art Kalman filter-based tracking methods-OCSORT, DeepOCSORT, ByteTrack, BoTSORT, and StrongSORT-using a custom dataset containing 10,000 annotated racquetball frames captured at 720p-1280p resolution. We focus our analysis on two critical performance factors: inference speed and update frequency per image, examining how these parameters affect tracking accuracy and reliability for fast-moving tiny objects. Our experimental evaluation across four distinct scenarios reveals that DeepOCSORT achieves the lowest tracking error with an average ADE of 31.15 pixels compared to ByteTrack's 114.3 pixels, while ByteTrack demonstrates the fastest processing at 26.6ms average inference time versus DeepOCSORT's 26.8ms. However, our results show that all Kalman filter-based trackers exhibit significant tracking drift with spatial errors ranging from 3-11cm (ADE values: 31-114 pixels), indicating fundamental limitations in handling the unpredictable motion patterns of fast-moving tiny objects like racquetballs. Our analysis demonstrates that current tracking approaches require substantial improvements, with error rates 3-4x higher than standard object tracking benchmarks, highlighting the need for specialized methodologies for fast-moving tiny object tracking applications.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision language models (VLMs) show strong results on chart understanding, yet existing benchmarks assume clean figures and fact based queries. Real world charts often contain distortions and demand reasoning beyond simple matching. We evaluate ChatGPT 4o, Claude Sonnet 4, and Gemini 2.5 Pro, finding sharp performance drops under corruption or occlusion, with hallucinations such as value fabrication, trend misinterpretation, and entity confusion becoming more frequent. Models remain overconfident in degraded settings, generating plausible but unsupported explanations.To address this gap, we introduce CHART NOISe(Chart Hallucinations, Answers, and Reasoning Testing on Noisy and Occluded Input Selections), a dataset combining chart corruptions, occlusions, and exam style multiple choice questions inspired by Korea's CSAT English section. A key innovation is prompt reverse inconsistency, where models contradict themselves when asked to confirm versus deny the same statement. Our contributions are threefold: (1) benchmarking state of the art VLMs, exposing systematic vulnerabilities in chart reasoning; (2) releasing CHART NOISe, the first dataset unifying corruption, occlusion, and reverse inconsistency; and (3) proposing baseline mitigation strategies such as quality filtering and occlusion detection. Together, these efforts establish a rigorous testbed for advancing robustness and reliability in chart understanding.

  Checks remain a foundational instrument in the financial ecosystem, facilitating substantial transaction volumes across institutions. However, their continued use also renders them a persistent target for fraud, underscoring the importance of robust check fraud detection mechanisms. At the core of such systems lies the accurate identification and localization of critical fields, such as the signature, magnetic ink character recognition (MICR) line, courtesy amount, legal amount, payee, and payer, which are essential for subsequent verification against reference checks belonging to the same customer. This field-level detection is traditionally dependent on object detection models trained on large, diverse, and meticulously labeled datasets, a resource that is scarce due to proprietary and privacy concerns. In this paper, we introduce a novel, training-free framework for automated check field detection, leveraging the power of a vision language model (VLM) in conjunction with a multimodal large language model (MLLM). Our approach enables zero-shot detection of check components, significantly lowering the barrier to deployment in real-world financial settings. Quantitative evaluation of our model on a hand-curated dataset of 110 checks spanning multiple formats and layouts demonstrates strong performance and generalization capability. Furthermore, this framework can serve as a bootstrap mechanism for generating high-quality labeled datasets, enabling the development of specialized real-time object detection models tailored to institutional needs.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Advances in high dynamic range (HDR) lighting estimation from a single image have opened new possibilities for augmented reality (AR) applications. Predicting complex lighting environments from a single input image allows for the realistic rendering and compositing of virtual objects. In this work, we investigate the color robustness of such methods -- an often overlooked yet critical factor for achieving visual realism. While most evaluations conflate color with other lighting attributes (e.g., intensity, direction), we isolate color as the primary variable of interest. Rather than introducing a new lighting estimation algorithm, we explore whether simple adaptation techniques can enhance the color accuracy of existing models. Using a novel HDR dataset featuring diverse lighting colors, we systematically evaluate several adaptation strategies. Our results show that preprocessing the input image with a pre-trained white balance network improves color robustness, outperforming other strategies across all tested scenarios. Notably, this approach requires no retraining of the lighting estimation model. We further validate the generality of this finding by applying the technique to three state-of-the-art lighting estimation methods from recent literature.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Running a large open-vocabulary (Open-vocab) detector on every video frame is accurate but expensive. We introduce a training-free pipeline that invokes OWLv2 only on fixed-interval keyframes and propagates detections to intermediate frames using compressed-domain motion vectors (MV). A simple 3x3 grid aggregation of motion vectors provides translation and uniform-scale updates, augmented with an area-growth check and an optional single-class switch. The method requires no labels, no fine-tuning, and uses the same prompt list for all open-vocabulary methods. On ILSVRC2015-VID (validation dataset), our approach (MVP) attains mAP@0.5=0.609 and mAP@[0.5:0.95]=0.316. At loose intersection-over-union (IoU) thresholds it remains close to framewise OWLv2-Large (0.747/0.721 at 0.2/0.3 versus 0.784/0.780), reflecting that coarse localization is largely preserved. Under the same keyframe schedule, MVP outperforms tracker-based propagation (MOSSE, KCF, CSRT) at mAP@0.5. A supervised reference (YOLOv12x) reaches 0.631 at mAP@0.5 but requires labeled training, whereas our method remains label-free and open-vocabulary. These results indicate that compressed-domain propagation is a practical way to reduce detector invocations while keeping strong zero-shot coverage in videos.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Motion blur reduces the clarity of fast-moving objects, posing challenges for detection systems, especially in racket sports, where balls often appear as streaks rather than distinct points. Existing labeling conventions mark the ball at the leading edge of the blur, introducing asymmetry and ignoring valuable motion cues correlated with velocity. This paper introduces a new labeling strategy that places the ball at the center of the blur streak and explicitly annotates blur attributes. Using this convention, we release a new table tennis ball detection dataset. We demonstrate that this labeling approach consistently enhances detection performance across various models. Furthermore, we introduce BlurBall, a model that jointly estimates ball position and motion blur attributes. By incorporating attention mechanisms such as Squeeze-and-Excitation over multi-frame inputs, we achieve state-of-the-art results in ball detection. Leveraging blur not only improves detection accuracy but also enables more reliable trajectory prediction, benefiting real-time sports analytics.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present TinyBEV, a unified, camera only Bird's Eye View (BEV) framework that distills the full-stack capabilities of a large planning-oriented teacher (UniAD [19]) into a compact, real-time student model. Unlike prior efficient camera only baselines such as VAD[23] and VADv2[7], TinyBEV supports the complete autonomy stack 3D detection, HD-map segmentation, motion forecasting, occupancy prediction, and goal-directed planning within a streamlined 28M-parameter backbone, achieving a 78% reduction in parameters over UniAD [19]. Our model-agnostic, multi-stage distillation strategy combines feature-level, output-level, and adaptive region-aware supervision to effectively transfer high-capacity multi-modal knowledge to a lightweight BEV representation. On nuScenes[4], Tiny-BEV achieves 39.0 mAP for detection, 1.08 minADE for motion forecasting, and a 0.32 collision rate, while running 5x faster (11 FPS) and requiring only camera input. These results demonstrate that full-stack driving intelligence can be retained in resource-constrained settings, bridging the gap between large-scale, multi-modal perception-planning models and deployment-ready real-time autonomy.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Grounding vision--language models in low-resource languages remains challenging, as they often produce fluent text about the wrong objects. This stems from scarce paired data, translation pivots that break alignment, and English-centric pretraining that ignores target-language semantics. We address this with a compute-aware Bengali captioning pipeline trained on LaBSE-verified EN--BN pairs and 110k bilingual-prompted synthetic images. A frozen MaxViT yields stable visual patches, a Bengali-native mBART-50 decodes, and a lightweight bridge links the modalities. Our core novelty is a tri-loss objective: Patch-Alignment Loss (PAL) aligns real and synthetic patch descriptors using decoder cross-attention, InfoNCE enforces global real--synthetic separation, and Sinkhorn-based OT ensures balanced fine-grained patch correspondence. This PAL+InfoNCE+OT synergy improves grounding, reduces spurious matches, and drives strong gains on Flickr30k-1k (BLEU-4 12.29, METEOR 27.98, BERTScore-F1 71.20) and MSCOCO-1k (BLEU-4 12.00, METEOR 28.14, BERTScore-F1 75.40), outperforming strong CE baselines and narrowing the real--synthetic centroid gap by 41%.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Accurate visual localization from aerial views is a fundamental problem with applications in mapping, large-area inspection, and search-and-rescue operations. In many scenarios, these systems require high-precision localization while operating with limited resources (e.g., no internet connection or GNSS/GPS support), making large image databases or heavy 3D models impractical. Surprisingly, little attention has been given to leveraging orthographic geodata as an alternative paradigm, which is lightweight and increasingly available through free releases by governmental authorities (e.g., the European Union). To fill this gap, we propose OrthoLoC, the first large-scale dataset comprising 16,425 UAV images from Germany and the United States with multiple modalities. The dataset addresses domain shifts between UAV imagery and geospatial data. Its paired structure enables fair benchmarking of existing solutions by decoupling image retrieval from feature matching, allowing isolated evaluation of localization and calibration performance. Through comprehensive evaluation, we examine the impact of domain shifts, data resolutions, and covisibility on localization accuracy. Finally, we introduce a refinement technique called AdHoP, which can be integrated with any feature matcher, improving matching by up to 95% and reducing translation error by up to 63%. The dataset and code are available at:this https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reliable out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is important for safe deployment of deep learning models in fetal ultrasound amidst heterogeneous image characteristics and clinical settings. OOD detection relies on estimating a classification model's uncertainty, which should increase for OOD samples. While existing research has largely focused on uncertainty quantification methods, this work investigates the impact of the classification task itself. Through experiments with eight uncertainty quantification methods across four classification tasks, we demonstrate that OOD detection performance significantly varies with the task, and that the best task depends on the defined ID-OOD criteria; specifically, whether the OOD sample is due to: i) an image characteristic shift or ii) an anatomical feature shift. Furthermore, we reveal that superior OOD detection does not guarantee optimal abstained prediction, underscoring the necessity to align task selection and uncertainty strategies with the specific downstream application in medical image analysis.

  In this study, we curated a densely annotated in-house dataset comprising 490 CTPA scans. Using this dataset, we systematically evaluated nine widely used segmentation architectures from both the CNN and Vision Transformer (ViT) families, initialized with either pretrained or random weights, under a unified testing framework as a performance audit. Our study leads to several important observations: (1) 3D U-Net with a ResNet encoder remains a highly effective architecture for PE segmentation; (2) 3D models are particularly well-suited to this task given the morphological characteristics of emboli; (3) CNN-based models generally yield superior performance compared to their ViT-based counterparts in PE segmentation; (4) classification-based pretraining, even on large PE datasets, can adversely impact segmentation performance compared to training from scratch, suggesting that PE classification and segmentation may rely on different sets of discriminative features; (5) different model architectures show a highly consistent pattern of segmentation performance when trained on the same data; and (6) while central and large emboli can be segmented with satisfactory accuracy, distal emboli remain challenging due to both task complexity and the scarcity of high-quality datasets. Besides these findings, our best-performing model achieves a mean Dice score of 0.7131 for segmentation. It detects 181 emboli with 49 false positives and 28 false negatives from 60 in-house testing scans. Its generalizability is further validated on public datasets.

  As medical diagnoses increasingly leverage multimodal data, machine learning models are expected to effectively fuse heterogeneous information while remaining robust to missing modalities. In this work, we propose a novel multimodal learning framework that integrates enhanced modalities dropout and contrastive learning to address real-world limitations such as modality imbalance and missingness. Our approach introduces learnable modality tokens for improving missingness-aware fusion of modalities and augments conventional unimodal contrastive objectives with fused multimodal representations. We validate our framework on large-scale clinical datasets for disease detection and prediction tasks, encompassing both visual and tabular modalities. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly in challenging and practical scenarios where only a single modality is available. Furthermore, we show its adaptability through successful integration with a recent CT foundation model. Our findings highlight the effectiveness, efficiency, and generalizability of our approach for multimodal learning, offering a scalable, low-cost solution with significant potential for real-world clinical applications.

  Deploying deep learning models in agriculture is difficult because edge devices have limited resources, but this work presents a compressed version of EcoWeedNet using structured channel pruning, quantization-aware training (QAT), and acceleration with NVIDIA's TensorRT on the Jetson Orin Nano. Despite the challenges of pruning complex architectures with residual shortcuts, attention mechanisms, concatenations, and CSP blocks, the model size was reduced by up to 68.5% and computations by 3.2 GFLOPs, while inference speed reached 184 FPS at FP16, 28.7% faster than the baseline. On the CottonWeedDet12 dataset, the pruned EcoWeedNet with a 39.5% pruning ratio outperformed YOLO11n and YOLO12n (with only 20% pruning), achieving 83.7% precision, 77.5% recall, and 85.9% mAP50, proving it to be both efficient and effective for precision agriculture.

  _Junseong Shin, Seungwoo Chung, Yunjeong Yang, Tae Hyun Kim_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Dehazing involves removing haze or fog from images to restore clarity and improve visibility by estimating atmospheric scattering effects. While deep learning methods show promise, the lack of paired real-world training data and the resulting domain gap hinder generalization to real-world scenarios. In this context, physics-grounded learning becomes crucial; however, traditional methods based on the Atmospheric Scattering Model (ASM) often fall short in handling real-world complexities and diverse haze patterns. To solve this problem, we propose HazeFlow, a novel ODE-based framework that reformulates ASM as an ordinary differential equation (ODE). Inspired by Rectified Flow (RF), HazeFlow learns an optimal ODE trajectory to map hazy images to clean ones, enhancing real-world dehazing performance with only a single inference step. Additionally, we introduce a non-homogeneous haze generation method using Markov Chain Brownian Motion (MCBM) to address the scarcity of paired real-world data. By simulating realistic haze patterns through MCBM, we enhance the adaptability of HazeFlow to diverse real-world scenarios. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that HazeFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance across various real-world dehazing benchmark datasets.

Notably, Qianfan-VL-8B and 70B variants incorporate long chain-of-thought capabilities, demonstrating superior performance on mathematical reasoning (MathVista 78.6%) and logical inference tasks. All models are trained entirely on Baidu's Kunlun P800 chips, validating the capability of large-scale AI infrastructure to train SOTA-level multimodal models with over 90% scaling efficiency on 5000 chips for a single task.

  Road traffic accidents remain a major public health challenge, particularly in countries with heterogeneous road conditions, mixed traffic flow, and variable driving discipline, such as Pakistan. Reliable detection of unsafe driving behaviours is a prerequisite for improving road safety, enabling advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS), and supporting data driven decisions in insurance and fleet management. Most of existing datasets originate from the developed countries with limited representation of the behavioural diversity observed in emerging economies and the driver's face recording voilates the privacy preservation. We present V-SenseDrive, the first privacy-preserving multimodal driver behaviour dataset collected entirely within the Pakistani driving environment. V-SenseDrive combines smartphone based inertial and GPS sensor data with synchronized road facing video to record three target driving behaviours (normal, aggressive, and risky) on multiple types of roads, including urban arterials, secondary roads, and motorways. Data was gathered using a custom Android application designed to capture high frequency accelerometer, gyroscope, and GPS streams alongside continuous video, with all sources precisely time aligned to enable multimodal analysis. The focus of this work is on the data acquisition process, covering participant selection, driving scenarios, environmental considerations, and sensor video synchronization techniques. The dataset is structured into raw, processed, and semantic layers, ensuring adaptability for future research in driver behaviour classification, traffic safety analysis, and ADAS development. By representing real world driving in Pakistan, V-SenseDrive fills a critical gap in the global landscape of driver behaviour datasets and lays the groundwork for context aware intelligent transportation solutions.

  Endometriosis often leads to chronic pelvic pain and possible nerve involvement, yet imaging the peripheral nerves remains a challenge. We introduce Visionerves, a novel hybrid AI framework for peripheral nervous system recognition from multi-gradient DWI and morphological MRI data. Unlike conventional tractography, Visionerves encodes anatomical knowledge through fuzzy spatial relationships, removing the need for selection of manual ROIs. The pipeline comprises two phases: (A) automatic segmentation of anatomical structures using a deep learning model, and (B) tractography and nerve recognition by symbolic spatial reasoning. Applied to the lumbosacral plexus in 10 women with (confirmed or suspected) endometriosis, Visionerves demonstrated substantial improvements over standard tractography, with Dice score improvements of up to 25% and spatial errors reduced to less than 5 mm. This automatic and reproducible approach enables detailed nerve analysis and paves the way for non-invasive diagnosis of endometriosis-related neuropathy, as well as other conditions with nerve involvement.

  The Visual-Language-Action (VLA) models can follow text instructions according to visual observations of the surrounding environment. This ability to map multimodal inputs to actions is derived from the training of the VLA model on extensive standard demonstrations. These visual observations captured by third-personal global and in-wrist local cameras are inevitably varied in number and perspective across different environments, resulting in significant differences in the visual features. This perspective heterogeneity constrains the generality of VLA models. In light of this, we first propose the lightweight module VLA-LPAF to foster the perspective adaptivity of VLA models using only 2D data. VLA-LPAF is finetuned using images from a single view and fuses other multiview observations in the latent space, which effectively and efficiently bridge the gap caused by perspective inconsistency. We instantiate our VLA-LPAF framework with the VLA model RoboFlamingo to construct RoboFlamingo-LPAF. Experiments show that RoboFlamingo-LPAF averagely achieves around 8% task success rate improvement on CALVIN, 15% on LIBERO, and 30% on a customized simulation benchmark. We also demonstrate the developed viewadaptive characteristics of the proposed RoboFlamingo-LPAF through real-world tasks.

  With the increasing integration of multimodal AI systems in creative workflows, understanding information loss in vision-language-vision pipelines has become important for evaluating system limitations. However, the degradation that occurs when visual content passes through textual intermediation remains poorly quantified. In this work, we provide empirical analysis of the describe-then-generate bottleneck, where natural language serves as an intermediate representation for visual information. We generated 150 image pairs through the describe-then-generate pipeline and applied existing metrics (LPIPS, SSIM, and color distance) to measure information preservation across perceptual, structural, and chromatic dimensions. Our evaluation reveals that 99.3% of samples exhibit substantial perceptual degradation and 91.5% demonstrate significant structural information loss, providing empirical evidence that the describe-then-generate bottleneck represents a measurable and consistent limitation in contemporary multimodal systems.

  In this paper, we present the Scrapbook framework, a novel methodology designed to generate extensive datasets for probing the learned concepts of artificial intelligence (AI) models. The framework focuses on fundamental concepts such as object recognition, absolute and relative positions, and attribute identification. By generating datasets with a large number of questions about individual concepts and a wide linguistic variation, the Scrapbook framework aims to validate the model's understanding of these basic elements before tackling more complex tasks. Our experimental findings reveal that, while contemporary models demonstrate proficiency in recognizing and enumerating objects, they encounter challenges in comprehending positional information and addressing inquiries with additional constraints. Specifically, the MobileVLM-V2 model showed significant answer disagreements and plausible wrong answers, while other models exhibited a bias toward affirmative answers and struggled with questions involving geometric shapes and positional information, indicating areas for improvement in understanding and consistency. The proposed framework offers a valuable instrument for generating diverse and comprehensive datasets, which can be utilized to systematically assess and enhance the performance of AI models.

  Monitoring ground displacement is crucial for urban infrastructure stability and mitigating geological hazards. However, forecasting future deformation from sparse Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) time-series data remains a significant challenge. This paper introduces a novel deep learning framework that transforms these sparse point measurements into a dense spatio-temporal tensor. This methodological shift allows, for the first time, the direct application of advanced computer vision architectures to this forecasting problem. We design and implement a hybrid Convolutional Neural Network and Long-Short Term Memory (CNN-LSTM) model, specifically engineered to simultaneously learn spatial patterns and temporal dependencies from the generated data tensor. The model's performance is benchmarked against powerful machine learning baselines, Light Gradient Boosting Machine and LASSO regression, using Sentinel-1 data from eastern Ireland. Results demonstrate that the proposed architecture provides significantly more accurate and spatially coherent forecasts, establishing a new performance benchmark for this task. Furthermore, an interpretability analysis reveals that baseline models often default to simplistic persistence patterns, highlighting the necessity of our integrated spatio-temporal approach to capture the complex dynamics of ground deformation. Our findings confirm the efficacy and potential of spatio-temporal deep learning for high-resolution deformation forecasting.

  Arabic document OCR remains a challenging task due to the language's cursive script, diverse fonts, diacritics, and right-to-left orientation. While modern Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have advanced document understanding for high-resource languages, their performance on Arabic remains limited. In this work, we introduce Baseer, a vision-language model fine- tuned specifically for Arabic document OCR. Leveraging a large-scale dataset combining synthetic and real-world documents, Baseer is trained using a decoder-only fine-tuning strategy to adapt a pre-trained MLLM while preserving general visual features. We also present Misraj-DocOCR, a high-quality, expert-verified benchmark designed for rigorous evaluation of Arabic OCR systems. Our experiments show that Baseer significantly outperforms existing open-source and commercial solutions, achieving a WER of 0.25 and establishing a new state-of-the-art in the domain of Arabic document OCR. Our results highlight the benefits of domain-specific adaptation of general-purpose MLLMs and establish a strong baseline for high-accuracy OCR on morphologically rich languages like Arabic.

  _Zhanting Zhou, Jinbo Wang, Zeqin Wu, Fengli Zhang_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We study gradient inversion in the challenging single round averaged gradient SAG regime where per sample cues are entangled within a single batch mean gradient. We introduce MAGIA a momentum based adaptive correction on gradient inversion attack a novel label inference free framework that senses latent per image signals by probing random data subsets. MAGIA objective integrates two core innovations 1 a closed form combinatorial rescaling that creates a provably tighter optimization bound and 2 a momentum based mixing of whole batch and subset losses to ensure reconstruction robustness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MAGIA significantly outperforms advanced methods achieving high fidelity multi image reconstruction in large batch scenarios where prior works fail. This is all accomplished with a computational footprint comparable to standard solvers and without requiring any auxiliary information.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Regularization is essential in deep learning to enhance generalization and mitigate overfitting. However, conventional techniques often rely on heuristics, making them less reliable or effective across diverse settings. We propose Self Identity Mapping (SIM), a simple yet effective, data-intrinsic regularization framework that leverages an inverse mapping mechanism to enhance representation learning. By reconstructing the input from its transformed output, SIM reduces information loss during forward propagation and facilitates smoother gradient flow. To address computational inefficiencies, We instantiate SIM as $ \rho\text{SIM} $ by incorporating patch-level feature sampling and projection-based method to reconstruct latent features, effectively lowering complexity. As a model-agnostic, task-agnostic regularizer, SIM can be seamlessly integrated as a plug-and-play module, making it applicable to different network architectures and tasks.We extensively evaluate $\rho\text{SIM}$ across three tasks: image classification, few-shot prompt learning, and domain generalization. Experimental results show consistent improvements over baseline methods, highlighting $\rho\text{SIM}$'s ability to enhance representation learning across various tasks. We also demonstrate that $\rho\text{SIM}$ is orthogonal to existing regularization methods, boosting their effectiveness. Moreover, our results confirm that $\rho\text{SIM}$ effectively preserves semantic information and enhances performance in dense-to-dense tasks, such as semantic segmentation and image translation, as well as in non-visual domains including audio classification and time series anomaly detection.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains one of the leading causes of cancer-related morbidity and mortality worldwide, with gastrointestinal (GI) polyps serving as critical precursors according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Early and accurate segmentation of polyps during colonoscopy is essential for reducing CRC progression, yet manual delineation is labor-intensive and prone to observer variability. Deep learning methods have demonstrated strong potential for automated polyp analysis, but their limited interpretability remains a barrier to clinical adoption. In this study, we present PolypSeg-GradCAM, an explainable deep learning framework that integrates the U-Net architecture with Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) for transparent polyp segmentation. The model was trained and evaluated on the Kvasir-SEG dataset of 1000 annotated endoscopic images. Experimental results demonstrate robust segmentation performance, achieving a mean Intersection over Union (IoU) of 0.9257 on the test set and consistently high Dice coefficients (F-score > 0.96) on training and validation sets. Grad-CAM visualizations further confirmed that predictions were guided by clinically relevant regions, enhancing transparency and trust in the model's decisions. By coupling high segmentation accuracy with interpretability, PolypSeg-GradCAM represents a step toward reliable, trustworthy AI-assisted colonoscopy and improved early colorectal cancer prevention.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The advancement of diffusion models has enhanced the realism of AI-generated content but also raised concerns about misuse, necessitating robust copyright protection and tampering localization. Although recent methods have made progress toward unified solutions, their reliance on post hoc processing introduces considerable application inconvenience and compromises forensic reliability. We propose StableGuard, a novel framework that seamlessly integrates a binary watermark into the diffusion generation process, ensuring copyright protection and tampering localization in Latent Diffusion Models through an end-to-end design. We develop a Multiplexing Watermark VAE (MPW-VAE) by equipping a pretrained Variational Autoencoder (VAE) with a lightweight latent residual-based adapter, enabling the generation of paired watermarked and watermark-free images. These pairs, fused via random masks, create a diverse dataset for training a tampering-agnostic forensic network. To further enhance forensic synergy, we introduce a Mixture-of-Experts Guided Forensic Network (MoE-GFN) that dynamically integrates holistic watermark patterns, local tampering traces, and frequency-domain cues for precise watermark verification and tampered region detection. The MPW-VAE and MoE-GFN are jointly optimized in a self-supervised, end-to-end manner, fostering a reciprocal training between watermark embedding and forensic accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that StableGuard consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in image fidelity, watermark verification, and tampering localization.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in generating program workflows for visual tasks. However, previous approaches often rely on closed-source models, lack systematic reasoning, and struggle with long-form video question answering (videoQA). To address these challenges, we introduce the FS-VisPR framework, an adaptive visual program reasoning approach that balances fast reasoning for simple queries with slow reasoning for difficult ones. First, we design efficient visual modules (e.g., key clip retrieval and subtitle retrieval) to support long-form video tasks. Then, we construct a diverse and high-quality fast-slow reasoning dataset with a strong LLM to align open-source language models' ability to generate visual program workflows as FS-LLM. Next, we design a fast-slow reasoning framework with FS-LLM: Simple queries are directly solved by VideoLLMs, while difficult ones invoke visual program reasoning, motivated by human-like reasoning processes. During this process, low-confidence fast-thinking answers will trigger a second-stage slow-reasoning process, and a fallback mechanism to fast reasoning is activated if the program execution fails. Moreover, we improve visual programs through parameter search during both training and inference. By adjusting the parameters of the visual modules within the program, multiple variants are generated: during training, programs that yield correct answers are selected, while during inference, the program with the highest confidence result is applied. Experiments show that FS-VisPR improves both efficiency and reliability in visual program workflows. It achieves 50.4% accuracy on LVBench, surpassing GPT-4o, matching the performance of Qwen2.5VL-72B on VideoMME.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The early detection of esophagogastric junction adenocarcinoma (EGJA) is crucial for improving patient prognosis, yet its current diagnosis is highly operator-dependent. This paper aims to make the first attempt to develop an artificial intelligence (AI) foundation model-based method for both screening and staging diagnosis of EGJA using endoscopic images. In this cohort and learning study, we conducted a multicentre study across seven Chinese hospitals between December 28, 2016 and December 30, 2024. It comprises 12,302 images from 1,546 patients; 8,249 of them were employed for model training, while the remaining were divided into the held-out (112 patients, 914 images), external (230 patients, 1,539 images), and prospective (198 patients, 1,600 images) test sets for evaluation. The proposed model employs DINOv2 (a vision foundation model) and ResNet50 (a convolutional neural network) to extract features of global appearance and local details of endoscopic images for EGJA staging diagnosis. Our model demonstrates satisfactory performance for EGJA staging diagnosis across three test sets, achieving an accuracy of 0.9256, 0.8895, and 0.8956, respectively. In contrast, among representative AI models, the best one (ResNet50) achieves an accuracy of 0.9125, 0.8382, and 0.8519 on the three test sets, respectively; the expert endoscopists achieve an accuracy of 0.8147 on the held-out test set. Moreover, with the assistance of our model, the overall accuracy for the trainee, competent, and expert endoscopists improves from 0.7035, 0.7350, and 0.8147 to 0.8497, 0.8521, and 0.8696, respectively. To our knowledge, our model is the first application of foundation models for EGJA staging diagnosis and demonstrates great potential in both diagnostic accuracy and efficiency.

  With the development of deep learning technology, virtual try-on technology has become an important application value in the fields of e-commerce, fashion, and entertainment. The recently proposed Leffa has improved the texture distortion problem of diffu-sion-based models, but there are limitations in that the bottom detection inaccuracy and the existing clothing silhouette remain in the synthesis results. To solve this problem, this study proposes CaP-VTON (Clothing agnostic Pre-inpainting Virtual Try-ON). CaP-VTON has improved the naturalness and consistency of whole-body clothing syn-thesis by integrating multi-category masking based on Dress Code and skin inpainting based on Stable Diffusion. In particular, a generate skin module was introduced to solve the skin restoration problem that occurs when long-sleeved images are converted into short-sleeved or sleeveless ones, and high-quality restoration was implemented consider-ing the human body posture and color. As a result, CaP-VTON recorded 92.5%, which is 15.4% better than Leffa in short-sleeved synthesis accuracy, and showed the performance of consistently reproducing the style and shape of reference clothing in visual evaluation. These structures maintain model-agnostic properties and are applicable to various diffu-sion-based virtual inspection systems, and can contribute to applications that require high-precision virtual wearing, such as e-commerce, custom styling, and avatar creation.

  Modern computer vision is converging on a closed loop in which perception, reasoning and generation mutually reinforce each other. However, this loop remains incomplete: the top-down influence of high-level reasoning on the foundational learning of low-level perceptual features is not yet underexplored. This paper addresses this gap by proposing a new paradigm for pretraining foundation models in downstream domains. We introduce Visual insTruction Pretraining (ViTP), a novel approach that directly leverages reasoning to enhance perception. ViTP embeds a Vision Transformer (ViT) backbone within a Vision-Language Model and pretrains it end-to-end using a rich corpus of visual instruction data curated from target downstream domains. ViTP is powered by our proposed Visual Robustness Learning (VRL), which compels the ViT to learn robust and domain-relevant features from a sparse set of visual tokens. Extensive experiments on 16 challenging remote sensing and medical imaging benchmarks demonstrate that ViTP establishes new state-of-the-art performance across a diverse range of downstream tasks.

  Referring Audio-Visual Segmentation (Ref-AVS) aims to segment specific objects in videos based on natural language expressions involving audio, vision, and text information. This task poses significant challenges in cross-modal reasoning and fine-grained object localization. In this paper, we propose a simple framework, SimToken, that integrates a multimodal large language model (MLLM) with the Segment Anything Model (SAM). The MLLM is guided to generate a special semantic token representing the referred object. This compact token, enriched with contextual information from all modalities, acts as a prompt to guide SAM to segment objectsacross video frames. To further improve semantic learning, we introduce a novel target-consistent semantic alignment loss that aligns token embeddings from different expressions but referring to the same object. Experiments on the Ref-AVS benchmark demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance compared to existing methods.

  Multimodal pathological images are usually in clinical diagnosis, but computer vision-based multimodal image-assisted diagnosis faces challenges with modality fusion, especially in the absence of expert-annotated data. To achieve the modality fusion in multimodal images with label scarcity, we propose a novel ``pretraining + fine-tuning" framework for multimodal semi-supervised medical image classification. Specifically, we propose a synergistic learning pretraining framework of consistency, reconstructive, and aligned learning. By treating one modality as an augmented sample of another modality, we implement a self-supervised learning pre-train, enhancing the baseline model's feature representation capability. Then, we design a fine-tuning method for multimodal fusion. During the fine-tuning stage, we set different encoders to extract features from the original modalities and provide a multimodal fusion encoder for fusion modality. In addition, we propose a distribution shift method for multimodal fusion features, which alleviates the prediction uncertainty and overfitting risks caused by the lack of labeled samples. We conduct extensive experiments on the publicly available gastroscopy image datasets Kvasir and Kvasirv2. Quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the current state-of-the-art classification methods. The code will be released at:this https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper presents a new approach to estimate accurate and robust 3D semantic correspondence with the hierarchical neural semantic representation. Our work has three key contributions. First, we design the hierarchical neural semantic representation (HNSR), which consists of a global semantic feature to capture high-level structure and multi-resolution local geometric features to preserve fine details, by carefully harnessing 3D priors from pre-trained 3D generative models. Second, we design a progressive global-to-local matching strategy, which establishes coarse semantic correspondence using the global semantic feature, then iteratively refines it with local geometric features, yielding accurate and semantically-consistent mappings. Third, our framework is training-free and broadly compatible with various pre-trained 3D generative backbones, demonstrating strong generalization across diverse shape categories. Our method also supports various applications, such as shape co-segmentation, keypoint matching, and texture transfer, and generalizes well to structurally diverse shapes, with promising results even in cross-category scenarios. Both qualitative and quantitative evaluations show that our method outperforms previous state-of-the-art techniques.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The field of Embodied AI predominantly relies on simulation for training and evaluation, often using either fully synthetic environments that lack photorealism or high-fidelity real-world reconstructions captured with expensive hardware. As a result, sim-to-real transfer remains a major challenge. In this paper, we introduce EmbodiedSplat, a novel approach that personalizes policy training by efficiently capturing the deployment environment and fine-tuning policies within the reconstructed scenes. Our method leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) and the Habitat-Sim simulator to bridge the gap between realistic scene capture and effective training environments. Using iPhone-captured deployment scenes, we reconstruct meshes via GS, enabling training in settings that closely approximate real-world conditions. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of training strategies, pre-training datasets, and mesh reconstruction techniques, evaluating their impact on sim-to-real predictivity in real-world scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that agents fine-tuned with EmbodiedSplat outperform both zero-shot baselines pre-trained on large-scale real-world datasets (HM3D) and synthetically generated datasets (HSSD), achieving absolute success rate improvements of 20% and 40% on real-world Image Navigation task. Moreover, our approach yields a high sim-vs-real correlation (0.87-0.97) for the reconstructed meshes, underscoring its effectiveness in adapting policies to diverse environments with minimal effort.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Accurate temporal prediction is the bridge between comprehensive scene understanding and embodied artificial intelligence. However, predicting multiple fine-grained states of a scene at multiple temporal scales is difficult for vision-language models. We formalize the Multi-Scale Temporal Prediction (MSTP) task in general and surgical scenes by decomposing multi-scale into two orthogonal dimensions: the temporal scale, forecasting states of humans and surgery at varying look-ahead intervals, and the state scale, modeling a hierarchy of states in general and surgical scenes. For example, in general scenes, states of contact relationships are finer-grained than states of spatial relationships. In surgical scenes, medium-level steps are finer-grained than high-level phases yet remain constrained by their encompassing phase. To support this unified task, we introduce the first MSTP Benchmark, featuring synchronized annotations across multiple state scales and temporal scales. We further propose a method, Incremental Generation and Multi-agent Collaboration (IG-MC), which integrates two key innovations. First, we present a plug-and-play incremental generation module that continuously synthesizes up-to-date visual previews at expanding temporal scales to inform multiple decision-making agents, keeping decisions and generated visuals synchronized and preventing performance degradation as look-ahead intervals lengthen. Second, we present a decision-driven multi-agent collaboration framework for multi-state prediction, comprising generation, initiation, and multi-state assessment agents that dynamically trigger and evaluate prediction cycles to balance global coherence and local fidelity.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a powerful alternative to NeRF-based approaches, enabling real-time, high-quality novel view synthesis through explicit, optimizable 3D Gaussians. However, 3DGS suffers from significant memory overhead due to its reliance on per-Gaussian parameters to model view-dependent effects and anisotropic shapes. While recent works propose compressing 3DGS with neural fields, these methods struggle to capture high-frequency spatial variations in Gaussian properties, leading to degraded reconstruction of fine details. We present Hybrid Radiance Fields (HyRF), a novel scene representation that combines the strengths of explicit Gaussians and neural fields. HyRF decomposes the scene into (1) a compact set of explicit Gaussians storing only critical high-frequency parameters and (2) grid-based neural fields that predict remaining properties. To enhance representational capacity, we introduce a decoupled neural field architecture, separately modeling geometry (scale, opacity, rotation) and view-dependent color. Additionally, we propose a hybrid rendering scheme that composites Gaussian splatting with a neural field-predicted background, addressing limitations in distant scene representation. Experiments demonstrate that HyRF achieves state-of-the-art rendering quality while reducing model size by over 20 times compared to 3DGS and maintaining real-time performance.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful technique for text-to-image (T2I) generation, creating high-quality, diverse images across various domains. However, a common limitation in these models is the incomplete display of objects, where fragments or missing parts undermine the model's performance in downstream applications. In this study, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the incompleteness issue and reveal that the primary factor behind incomplete object generation is the usage of RandomCrop during model training. This widely used data augmentation method, though enhances model generalization ability, disrupts object continuity during training. To address this, we propose a training-free solution that penalizes activation values at image boundaries during the early denoising steps. Our method is easily applicable to pre-trained Stable Diffusion models with minimal modifications and negligible computational overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, showing substantial improvements in object integrity and image quality.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As an essential vision task, infrared small target detection (IRSTD) has seen significant advancements through deep learning. However, critical limitations in current evaluation protocols impede further progress. First, existing methods rely on fragmented pixel- and target-level specific metrics, which fails to provide a comprehensive view of model capabilities. Second, an excessive emphasis on overall performance scores obscures crucial error analysis, which is vital for identifying failure modes and improving real-world system performance. Third, the field predominantly adopts dataset-specific training-testing paradigms, hindering the understanding of model robustness and generalization across diverse infrared scenarios. This paper addresses these issues by introducing a hybrid-level metric incorporating pixel- and target-level performance, proposing a systematic error analysis method, and emphasizing the importance of cross-dataset evaluation. These aim to offer a more thorough and rational hierarchical analysis framework, ultimately fostering the development of more effective and robust IRSTD models. An open-source toolkit has be released to facilitate standardized benchmarking.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Class Incremental Learning (CIL) aims to continuously learn new categories while retaining the knowledge of old ones. Pre-trained models (PTMs) show promising capabilities in CIL. However, existing approaches that apply lightweight fine-tuning to backbones still induce parameter drift, thereby compromising the generalization capability of pre-trained models. Parameter drift can be conceptualized as a form of noise that obscures critical patterns learned for previous tasks. However, recent researches have shown that noise is not always harmful. For example, the large number of visual patterns learned from pre-training can be easily abused by a single task, and introducing appropriate noise can suppress some low-correlation features, thus leaving a margin for future tasks. To this end, we propose learning beneficial noise for CIL guided by information theory and propose Mixture of Noise (Min), aiming to mitigate the degradation of backbone generalization from adapting new tasks. Specifically, task-specific noise is learned from high-dimension features of new tasks. Then, a set of weights is adjusted dynamically for optimal mixture of different task noise. Finally, Min embeds the beneficial noise into the intermediate features to mask the response of inefficient patterns. Extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets demonstrate that Min achieves state-of-the-art performance in most incremental settings, with particularly outstanding results in 50-steps incremental settings. This shows the significant potential for beneficial noise in continual learning. Code is available atthis https URL.

  Automated pain assessment from facial expressions is crucial for non-communicative patients, such as those with dementia. Progress has been limited by two challenges: (i) existing datasets exhibit severe demographic and label imbalance due to ethical constraints, and (ii) current generative models cannot precisely control facial action units (AUs), facial structure, or clinically validated pain levels.We present 3DPain, a large-scale synthetic dataset specifically designed for automated pain assessment, featuring unprecedented annotation richness and demographic diversity. Our three-stage framework generates diverse 3D meshes, textures them with diffusion models, and applies AU-driven face rigging to synthesize multi-view faces with paired neutral and pain images, AU configurations, PSPI scores, and the first dataset-level annotations of pain-region heatmaps. The dataset comprises 82,500 samples across 25,000 pain expression heatmaps and 2,500 synthetic identities balanced by age, gender, and ethnicity.We further introduce ViTPain, a Vision Transformer based cross-modal distillation framework in which a heatmap-trained teacher guides a student trained on RGB images, enhancing accuracy, interpretability, and clinical reliability. Together, 3DPain and ViTPain establish a controllable, diverse, and clinically grounded foundation for generalizable automated pain assessment.

  Recent advances in radiance fields and novel view synthesis enable creation of realistic digital twins from photographs. However, current methods struggle with flat, texture-less surfaces, creating uneven and semi-transparent reconstructions, due to an ill-conditioned photometric reconstruction objective. Surface reconstruction methods solve this issue but sacrifice visual quality. We propose a novel hybrid 2D/3D representation that jointly optimizes constrained planar (2D) Gaussians for modeling flat surfaces and freeform (3D) Gaussians for the rest of the scene. Our end-to-end approach dynamically detects and refines planar regions, improving both visual fidelity and geometric accuracy. It achieves state-of-the-art depth estimation on ScanNet++ and ScanNetv2, and excels at mesh extraction without overfitting to a specific camera model, showing its effectiveness in producing high-quality reconstruction of indoor scenes.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Real-time understanding of continuous video streams is essential for intelligent agents operating in high-stakes environments, including autonomous vehicles, surveillance drones, and disaster response robots. Yet, most existing video understanding and highlight detection methods assume access to the entire video during inference, making them unsuitable for online or streaming scenarios. In particular, current models optimize for offline summarization, failing to support step-by-step reasoning needed for real-time decision-making. We introduce Aha, an autoregressive highlight detection framework that predicts the relevance of each video frame against a task described in natural language. Without accessing future video frames, Aha utilizes a multimodal vision-language model and lightweight, decoupled heads trained on a large, curated dataset of human-centric video labels. To enable scalability, we introduce the Dynamic SinkCache mechanism that achieves constant memory usage across infinite-length streams without degrading performance on standard benchmarks. This encourages the hidden representation to capture high-level task objectives, enabling effective frame-level rankings for informativeness, relevance, and uncertainty with respect to the natural language task. Aha achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on highlight detection benchmarks, surpassing even prior offline, full-context approaches and video-language models by +5.9% on TVSum and +8.3% on Mr. Hisum in mAP (mean Average Precision). We explore Aha's potential for real-world robotics applications given a task-oriented natural language input and a continuous, robot-centric video.

  _Jialiang Kang, Han Shu, Wenshuo Li, Yingjie Zhai, Xinghao Chen_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Speculative decoding is a widely adopted technique for accelerating inference in large language models (LLMs), yet its application to vision-language models (VLMs) remains underexplored, with existing methods achieving only modest speedups (<1.5x). This gap is increasingly significant as multimodal capabilities become central to large-scale models. We hypothesize that large VLMs can effectively filter redundant image information layer by layer without compromising textual comprehension, whereas smaller draft models struggle to do so. To address this, we introduce Vision-Aware Speculative Decoding (ViSpec), a novel framework tailored for VLMs. ViSpec employs a lightweight vision adaptor module to compress image tokens into a compact representation, which is seamlessly integrated into the draft model's attention mechanism while preserving original image positional information. Additionally, we extract a global feature vector for each input image and augment all subsequent text tokens with this feature to enhance multimodal coherence. To overcome the scarcity of multimodal datasets with long assistant responses, we curate a specialized training dataset by repurposing existing datasets and generating extended outputs using the target VLM with modified prompts. Our training strategy mitigates the risk of the draft model exploiting direct access to the target model's hidden states, which could otherwise lead to shortcut learning when training solely on target model outputs. Extensive experiments validate ViSpec, achieving, to our knowledge, the first substantial speedup in VLM speculative decoding. Code is available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce MOCHA (Multi-modal Objects-aware Cross-arcHitecture Alignment), a knowledge distillation approach that transfers region-level multimodal semantics from a large vision-language teacher (e.g., LLaVa) into a lightweight vision-only object detector student (e.g., YOLO). A translation module maps student features into a joint space, where the training of the student and translator is guided by a dual-objective loss that enforces both local alignment and global relational consistency. Unlike prior approaches focused on dense or global alignment, MOCHA operates at the object level, enabling efficient transfer of semantics without modifying the teacher or requiring textual input at inference. We validate our method across four personalized detection benchmarks under few-shot regimes. Results show consistent gains over baselines, with a +10.1 average score improvement. Despite its compact architecture, MOCHA reaches performance on par with larger multimodal models, proving its suitability for real-world deployment.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As large vision language models (VLMs) advance, their capabilities in multilingual visual question answering (mVQA) have significantly improved. Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning has been proven to enhance interpretability and complex reasoning. However, most existing approaches rely primarily on textual CoT and provide limited support for multilingual multimodal reasoning, constraining their deployment in real-world applications. To address this gap, we introduce \textbf{LaV-CoT}, the first Language-aware Visual CoT framework with Multi-Aspect Reward Optimization. LaV-CoT incorporates an interpretable multi-stage reasoning pipeline consisting of Text Summary with Bounding Box (BBox), Language Identification, Spatial Object-level Captioning, and Step-by-step Logical Reasoning. Following this reasoning pipeline, we design an automated data curation method that generates multilingual CoT annotations through iterative generation, correction, and refinement, enabling scalable and high-quality training data. To improve reasoning and generalization, LaV-CoT adopts a two-stage training paradigm combining Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with Language-aware Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), guided by verifiable multi-aspect rewards including language consistency, structural accuracy, and semantic alignment. Extensive evaluations on public datasets including MMMB, Multilingual MMBench, and MTVQA show that LaV-CoT achieves up to ~9.5% accuracy improvements over open-source baselines of similar size and even surpasses models with 2$\times$ larger scales by ~2.6%. Moreover, LaV-CoT outperforms advanced proprietary models such as GPT-4o-0513 and Gemini-2.5-flash. We further conducted an online A/B test to validate our method on real-world data, highlighting its effectiveness for industrial deployment. Our code is available at this link: \href{this https URL}

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Humans can recognize the same actions despite large context and viewpoint variations, such as differences between species (walking in spiders vs. horses), viewpoints (egocentric vs. third-person), and contexts (real life vs movies). Current deep learning models struggle with such generalization. We propose using features generated by a Vision Diffusion Model (VDM), aggregated via a transformer, to achieve human-like action recognition across these challenging conditions. We find that generalization is enhanced by the use of a model conditioned on earlier timesteps of the diffusion process to highlight semantic information over pixel level details in the extracted features. We experimentally explore the generalization properties of our approach in classifying actions across animal species, across different viewing angles, and different recording contexts. Our model sets a new state-of-the-art across all three generalization benchmarks, bringing machine action recognition closer to human-like robustness. Project page:this https URL. Code:this https URL

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Dense image matching aims to find a correspondent for every pixel of a source image in a partially overlapping target image. State-of-the-art methods typically rely on a coarse-to-fine mechanism where a single correspondent hypothesis is produced per source location at each scale. In challenging cases -- such as at depth discontinuities or when the target image is a strong zoom-in of the source image -- the correspondents of neighboring source locations are often widely spread and predicting a single correspondent hypothesis per source location at each scale may lead to erroneous matches. In this paper, we investigate the idea of predicting multiple correspondent hypotheses per source location at each scale instead. We consider a beam search strategy to propagat multiple hypotheses at each scale and propose integrating these multiple hypotheses into cross-attention layers, resulting in a novel dense matching architecture called BEAMER. BEAMER learns to preserve and propagate multiple hypotheses across scales, making it significantly more robust than state-of-the-art methods, especially at depth discontinuities or when the target image is a strong zoom-in of the source image.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Video-based AI systems are increasingly adopted in safety-critical domains such as autonomous driving and healthcare. However, interpreting their decisions remains challenging due to the inherent spatiotemporal complexity of video data and the opacity of deep learning models. Existing explanation techniques often suffer from limited temporal coherence, insufficient robustness, and a lack of actionable causal insights. Current counterfactual explanation methods typically do not incorporate guidance from the target model, reducing semantic fidelity and practical utility. We introduce Latent Diffusion for Video Counterfactual Explanations (LD-ViCE), a novel framework designed to explain the behavior of video-based AI models. Compared to previous approaches, LD-ViCE reduces the computational costs of generating explanations by operating in latent space using a state-of-the-art diffusion model, while producing realistic and interpretable counterfactuals through an additional refinement step. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of LD-ViCE across three diverse video datasets, including EchoNet-Dynamic (cardiac ultrasound), FERV39k (facial expression), and Something-Something V2 (action recognition). LD-ViCE outperforms a recent state-of-the-art method, achieving an increase in R2 score of up to 68% while reducing inference time by half. Qualitative analysis confirms that LD-ViCE generates semantically meaningful and temporally coherent explanations, offering valuable insights into the target model behavior. LD-ViCE represents a valuable step toward the trustworthy deployment of AI in safety-critical domains.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a dominant novel-view synthesis technique, but its high memory consumption severely limits its applicability on edge devices. A growing number of 3DGS compression methods have been proposed to make 3DGS more efficient, yet most only focus on storage compression and fail to address the critical bottleneck of rendering memory. To address this problem, we introduce MEGS$^{2}$, a novel memory-efficient framework that tackles this challenge by jointly optimizing two key factors: the total primitive number and the parameters per primitive, achieving unprecedented memory compression. Specifically, we replace the memory-intensive spherical harmonics with lightweight, arbitrarily oriented spherical Gaussian lobes as our color representations. More importantly, we propose a unified soft pruning framework that models primitive-number and lobe-number pruning as a single constrained optimization problem. Experiments show that MEGS$^{2}$ achieves a 50% static VRAM reduction and a 40% rendering VRAM reduction compared to existing methods, while maintaining comparable rendering quality.

  _Linqing Wang, Ximing Xing, Yiji Cheng, Zhiyuan Zhao, Donghao Li, Tiankai Hang, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advancements in text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in generating high-fidelity images. However, these models often struggle to faithfully render complex user prompts, particularly in aspects like attribute binding, negation, and compositional relationships. This leads to a significant mismatch between user intent and the generated output. To address this challenge, we introduce PromptEnhancer, a novel and universal prompt rewriting framework that enhances any pretrained T2I model without requiring modifications to its weights. Unlike prior methods that rely on model-specific fine-tuning or implicit reward signals like image-reward scores, our framework decouples the rewriter from the generator. We achieve this by training a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) rewriter through reinforcement learning, guided by a dedicated reward model we term the AlignEvaluator. The AlignEvaluator is trained to provide explicit and fine-grained feedback based on a systematic taxonomy of 24 key points, which are derived from a comprehensive analysis of common T2I failure modes. By optimizing the CoT rewriter to maximize the reward from our AlignEvaluator, our framework learns to generate prompts that are more precisely interpreted by T2I models. Extensive experiments on the HunyuanImage 2.1 model demonstrate that PromptEnhancer significantly improves image-text alignment across a wide range of semantic and compositional challenges. Furthermore, we introduce a new, high-quality human preference benchmark to facilitate future research in this direction.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this paper, we aim to transfer CLIP's robust 2D generalization capabilities to identify 3D anomalies across unseen objects of highly diverse class semantics. To this end, we propose a unified framework to comprehensively detect and segment 3D anomalies by leveraging both point- and pixel-level information. We first design PointAD, which leverages point-pixel correspondence to represent 3D anomalies through their associated rendering pixel representations. This approach is referred to as implicit 3D representation, as it focuses solely on rendering pixel anomalies but neglects the inherent spatial relationships within point clouds. Then, we propose PointAD+ to further broaden the interpretation of 3D anomalies by introducing explicit 3D representation, emphasizing spatial abnormality to uncover abnormal spatial relationships. Hence, we propose G-aggregation to involve geometry information to enable the aggregated point representations spatially aware. To simultaneously capture rendering and spatial abnormality, PointAD+ proposes hierarchical representation learning, incorporating implicit and explicit anomaly semantics into hierarchical text prompts: rendering prompts for the rendering layer and geometry prompts for the geometry layer. A cross-hierarchy contrastive alignment is further introduced to promote the interaction between the rendering and geometry layers, facilitating mutual anomaly learning. Finally, PointAD+ integrates anomaly semantics from both layers to capture the generalized anomaly semantics. During the test, PointAD+ can integrate RGB information in a plug-and-play manner and further improve its detection performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of PointAD+ in ZS 3D anomaly detection across unseen objects with highly diverse class semantics, achieving a holistic understanding of abnormality.

  _Lianwei Yang, Haokun Lin, Tianchen Zhao, Yichen Wu, Hongyu Zhu, Ruiqi Xie, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have achieved impressive performance in text-to-image and text-to-video generation. However, their high computational cost and large parameter sizes pose significant challenges for usage in resource-constrained scenarios. Effective compression of models has become a crucial issue that urgently needs to be addressed. Post-training quantization (PTQ) is a promising solution to reduce memory usage and accelerate inference, but existing PTQ methods suffer from severe performance degradation under extreme low-bit settings. After experiments and analysis, we identify two key obstacles to low-bit PTQ for DiTs: (1) the weights of DiT models follow a Gaussian-like distribution with long tails, causing uniform quantization to poorly allocate intervals and leading to significant quantization errors. This issue has been observed in the linear layer weights of different DiT models, which deeply limits the performance. (2) two types of activation outliers in DiT models: (i) Mild Outliers with slightly elevated values, and (ii) Salient Outliers with large magnitudes concentrated in specific channels, which disrupt activation quantization. To address these issues, we propose LRQ-DiT, an efficient and accurate post-training quantization framework for image and video generation. First, we introduce Twin-Log Quantization (TLQ), a log-based method that allocates more quantization intervals to the intermediate dense regions, effectively achieving alignment with the weight distribution and reducing quantization errors. Second, we propose an Adaptive Rotation Scheme (ARS) that dynamically applies Hadamard or outlier-aware rotations based on activation fluctuation, effectively mitigating the impact of both types of outliers. Extensive experiments on various text-to-image and text-to-video DiT models demonstrate that LRQ-DiT preserves high generation quality.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Feature-level fusion shows promise in collaborative perception (CP) through balanced performance and communication bandwidth trade-off. However, its effectiveness critically relies on input feature quality. The acquisition of high-quality features faces domain gaps from hardware diversity and deployment conditions, alongside temporal misalignment from transmission delays. These challenges degrade feature quality with cumulative effects throughout the collaborative network. In this paper, we present the Domain-And-Time Alignment (DATA) network, designed to systematically align features while maximizing their semantic representations for fusion. Specifically, we propose a Consistency-preserving Domain Alignment Module (CDAM) that reduces domain gaps through proximal-region hierarchical downsampling and observability-constrained discriminator. We further propose a Progressive Temporal Alignment Module (PTAM) to handle transmission delays via multi-scale motion modeling and two-stage compensation. Building upon the aligned features, an Instance-focused Feature Aggregation Module (IFAM) is developed to enhance semantic representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DATA achieves state-of-the-art performance on three typical datasets, maintaining robustness with severe communication delays and pose errors. The code will be released atthis https URL.

  Surface defects are a primary source of yield loss in manufacturing, yet existing anomaly detection methods often fail in real-world deployment due to limited and unrepresentative datasets. To overcome this, we introduce 3D-ADAM, a 3D Anomaly Detection in Additive Manufacturing dataset, that is the first large-scale, industry-relevant dataset for RGB+3D surface defect detection in additive manufacturing. 3D-ADAM comprises 14,120 high-resolution scans of 217 unique parts, captured with four industrial depth sensors, and includes 27,346 annotated defects across 12 categories along with 27,346 annotations of machine element features in 16 classes. 3D-ADAM is captured in a real industrial environment and as such reflects real production conditions, including variations in part placement, sensor positioning, lighting, and partial occlusion. Benchmarking state-of-the-art models demonstrates that 3D-ADAM presents substantial challenges beyond existing datasets. Validation through expert labelling surveys with industry partners further confirms its industrial relevance. By providing this benchmark, 3D-ADAM establishes a foundation for advancing robust 3D anomaly detection capable of meeting manufacturing demands.

  _Chenqiu Zhao, Anup Basu_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  A common assumption in probabilistic generative models for image generation is that learning the global data distribution suffices to generate novel images via sampling. We investigate the limitation of this core assumption, namely that learning global distributions leads to memorization rather than generative behavior. We propose two theoretical frameworks, the Mutually Exclusive Probability Space (MEPS) and the Local Dependence Hypothesis (LDH), for investigation. MEPS arises from the observation that deterministic mappings (e.g. neural networks) involving random variables tend to reduce overlap coefficients among involved random variables, thereby inducing exclusivity. We further propose a lower bound in terms of the overlap coefficient, and introduce a Binary Latent Autoencoder (BL-AE) that encodes images into signed binary latent representations. LDH formalizes dependence within a finite observation radius, which motivates our $\gamma$-Autoregressive Random Variable Model ($\gamma$-ARVM). $\gamma$-ARVM is an autoregressive model, with a variable observation range $\gamma$, that predicts a histogram for the next token. Using $\gamma$-ARVM, we observe that as the observation range increases, autoregressive models progressively shift toward memorization. In the limit of global dependence, the model behaves as a pure memorizer when operating on the binary latents produced by our BL-AE. Comprehensive experiments and discussions support our investigation.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  To be adopted in safety-critical domains like medical image analysis, AI systems must provide human-interpretable decisions. Variational Information Pursuit (V-IP) offers an interpretable-by-design framework by sequentially querying input images for human-understandable concepts, using their presence or absence to make predictions. However, existing V-IP methods overlook sample-specific uncertainty in concept predictions, which can arise from ambiguous features or model limitations, leading to suboptimal query selection and reduced robustness. In this paper, we propose an interpretable and uncertainty-aware framework for medical imaging that addresses these limitations by accounting for upstream uncertainties in concept-based, interpretable-by-design models. Specifically, we introduce two uncertainty-aware models, EUAV-IP and IUAV-IP, that integrate uncertainty estimates into the V-IP querying process to prioritize more reliable concepts per sample. EUAV-IP skips uncertain concepts via masking, while IUAV-IP incorporates uncertainty into query selection implicitly for more informed and clinically aligned decisions. Our approach allows models to make reliable decisions based on a subset of concepts tailored to each individual sample, without human intervention, while maintaining overall interpretability. We evaluate our methods on five medical imaging datasets across four modalities: dermoscopy, X-ray, ultrasound, and blood cell imaging. The proposed IUAV-IP model achieves state-of-the-art accuracy among interpretable-by-design approaches on four of the five datasets, and generates more concise explanations by selecting fewer yet more informative concepts. These advances enable more reliable and clinically meaningful outcomes, enhancing model trustworthiness and supporting safer AI deployment in healthcare.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Today, Earth Observation (EO) satellites generate massive volumes of data. To fully exploit this, it is essential to pretrain EO Foundation Models (FMs) on large unlabeled datasets, enabling efficient fine-tuning for downstream tasks with minimal labeled data. In this paper, we study scaling-up FMs: we train our models on the pretraining dataset MajorTOM 23TB which includes all regions, and the performance on average is competitive versus models pretrained on more specialized datasets which are substantially smaller and include only land. The additional data of oceans and ice do not decrease the performance on land-focused downstream tasks. These results indicate that large FMs trained on global datasets for a wider variety of downstream tasks can be useful for downstream applications that only require a subset of the information included in their training. The second contribution is the exploration of U-Net Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Vision Transformers (ViT), and Mamba State-Space Models (SSM) as FMs. U-Net captures local correlations amongst pixels, while ViT and Mamba capture local and distant correlations. We develop various models using different architectures, including U-Net, ViT, and Mamba, and different number of parameters. We evaluate the FLoating-point OPerations (FLOPs) needed by the models. We fine-tune on the PhilEO Bench for different downstream tasks: roads, buildings, and land cover. For most n-shots for roads and buildings, U-Net 200M-2T outperforms the other models. Using Mamba, we achieve comparable results on the downstream tasks, with less computational expenses. We also compare with the recent FM TerraMind which we evaluate on PhilEO Bench.

  Human-machine interaction, particularly in prosthetic and robotic control, has seen progress with gesture recognition via surface electromyographic (sEMG)this http URL, classifying similar gestures that produce nearly identical muscle signals remains a challenge, often reducing classification accuracy. Traditional deep learning models for sEMG gesture recognition are large and computationally expensive, limiting their deployment on resource-constrained embedded systems. In this work, we propose WaveFormer, a lightweight transformer-based architecture tailored for sEMG gesture recognition. Our model integrates time-domain and frequency-domain features through a novel learnable wavelet transform, enhancing feature extraction. In particular, the WaveletConv module, a multi-level wavelet decomposition layer with depthwise separable convolution, ensures both efficiency and compactness. With just 3.1 million parameters, WaveFormer achieves 95% classification accuracy on the EPN612 dataset, outperforming larger models. Furthermore, when profiled on a laptop equipped with an Intel CPU, INT8 quantization achieves real-time deployment with a 6.75 ms inference latency.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a powerful technique for radiance field rendering, but it typically requires millions of redundant Gaussian primitives, overwhelming memory and rendering budgets. Existing compaction approaches address this by pruning Gaussians based on heuristic importance scores, without global fidelity guarantee. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel optimal transport perspective that casts 3DGS compaction as global Gaussian mixture reduction. Specifically, we first minimize the composite transport divergence over a KD- tree partition to produce a compact geometric representation, and then decouple appearance from geometry by fine-tuning color and opacity attributes with far fewer Gaussian primitives. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that our method (i) yields negligible loss in rendering quality (PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS) compared to vanilla 3DGS with only 10% Gaussians; and (ii) consistently outperforms state- of-the-art 3DGS compaction techniques. Notably, our method is applicable to any stage of vanilla or accelerated 3DGS pipelines, providing an efficient and agnostic pathway to lightweight neural rendering.

  Finding correspondences between semantically similar points across images and object instances is one of the everlasting challenges in computer vision. While large pre-trained vision models have recently been demonstrated as effective priors for semantic matching, they still suffer from ambiguities for symmetric objects or repeated object parts. We propose improving semantic correspondence estimation through 3D-aware pseudo-labeling. Specifically, we train an adapter to refine off-the-shelf features using pseudo-labels obtained via 3D-aware chaining, filtering wrong labels through relaxed cyclic consistency, and 3D spherical prototype mapping constraints. While reducing the need for dataset-specific annotations compared to prior work, we establish a new state-of-the-art on SPair-71k, achieving an absolute gain of over 4% and of over 7% compared to methods with similar supervision requirements. The generality of our proposed approach simplifies the extension of training to other data sources, which we demonstrate in our experiments.

  Recent advances in Artificial Intelligence Generated Content have led to highly realistic synthetic videos, particularly in human-centric scenarios involving speech, gestures, and full-body motion, posing serious threats to information authenticity and public trust. Unlike DeepFake techniques that focus on localized facial manipulation, human-centric video generation methods can synthesize entire human bodies with controllable movements, enabling complex interactions with environments, objects, and even other people. However, existing detection methods largely overlook the growing risks posed by such full-body synthetic content. Meanwhile, a growing body of research has explored leveraging LLMs for interpretable fake detection, aiming to explain decisions in natural language. Yet these approaches heavily depend on supervised fine-tuning, which introduces limitations such as annotation bias, hallucinated supervision, and weakened generalization. To address these challenges, we propose AvatarShield, a novel multimodal human-centric synthetic video detection framework that eliminates the need for dense textual supervision by adopting Group Relative Policy Optimization, enabling LLMs to develop reasoning capabilities from simple binary labels. Our architecture combines a discrete vision tower for high-level semantic inconsistencies and a residual extractor for fine-grained artifact analysis. We further introduce FakeHumanVid, a large-scale benchmark containing 15K real and synthetic videos across nine state-of-the-art human generation methods driven by text, pose, or audio. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AvatarShield outperforms existing methods in both in-domain and cross-domain settings.

  Existing detectors are often trained on biased datasets, leading to the possibility of overfitting on non-causal image attributes that are spuriously correlated with real/synthetic labels. While these biased features enhance performance on the training data, they result in substantial performance degradation when applied to unbiased datasets. One common solution is to perform dataset alignment through generative reconstruction, matching the semantic content between real and synthetic images. However, we revisit this approach and show that pixel-level alignment alone is insufficient. The reconstructed images still suffer from frequency-level misalignment, which can perpetuate spurious correlations. To illustrate, we observe that reconstruction models tend to restore the high-frequency details lost in real images (possibly due to JPEG compression), inadvertently creating a frequency-level misalignment, where synthetic images appear to have richer high-frequency content than real ones. This misalignment leads to models associating high-frequency features with synthetic labels, further reinforcing biased cues. To resolve this, we propose Dual Data Alignment (DDA), which aligns both the pixel and frequency domains. Moreover, we introduce two new test sets: DDA-COCO, containing DDA-aligned synthetic images for testing detector performance on the most aligned dataset, and EvalGEN, featuring the latest generative models for assessing detectors under new generative architectures such as visual auto-regressive generators. Finally, our extensive evaluations demonstrate that a detector trained exclusively on DDA-aligned MSCOCO could improve across 8 diverse benchmarks by a non-trivial margin, showing a +7.2% on in-the-wild benchmarks, highlighting the improved generalizability of unbiased detectors.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Due to the unidirectional masking mechanism, Decoder-Only models propagate information from left to right. LVLMs (Large Vision-Language Models) follow the same architecture, with visual information gradually integrated into semantic representations during forward propagation. Through systematic analysis, we observe that the majority of the visual information is absorbed into the semantic representations. However, the model's attention distribution does not exhibit sufficient emphasis on semantic representations. This misalignment between the attention distribution and the actual information flow undermines the model's visual understanding ability and contributes to hallucinations. To address this issue, we enhance the model's visual understanding by leveraging the core information embedded in semantic representations. Specifically, we identify attention heads that focus on core semantic representations based on their attention distributions. Then, through a two-stage optimization paradigm, we propagate the advantages of these attention heads across the entire model, aligning the attention distribution with the actual information flow. We evaluate our method on three image captioning benchmarks using five different LVLMs, demonstrating its effectiveness in significantly reducing hallucinations. Further experiments reveal a trade-off between reduced hallucinations and richer details. Notably, our method allows for manual adjustment of the model's conservativeness, enabling flexible control to meet diverse real-world requirements.

  BEV-based 3D perception has emerged as a focal point of research in end-to-end autonomous driving. However, existing BEV approaches encounter significant challenges due to the large feature space, complicating efficient modeling and hindering effective integration of global attention mechanisms. We propose a novel modeling strategy, called InstanceBEV, that synergistically combines the strengths of both map-centric approaches and object-centric approaches. Our method effectively extracts instance-level features within the BEV features, facilitating the implementation of global attention modeling in a highly compressed feature space, thereby addressing the efficiency challenges inherent in map-centric global modeling. Furthermore, our approach enables effective multi-task learning without introducing additional module. We validate the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed model through predicting occupancy, achieving 3D occupancy panoptic segmentation by combining instance information. Experimental results on the OCC3D-nuScenes dataset demonstrate that InstanceBEV, utilizing only 8 frames, achieves a RayPQ of 15.3 and a RayIoU of 38.2. This surpasses SparseOcc's RayPQ by 9.3% and RayIoU by 10.7%, showcasing the effectiveness of multi-task synergy.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Zero-shot Semantic Segmentation (ZSS) aims to segment categories that are not annotated during training. While fine-tuning vision-language models has achieved promising results, these models often overfit to seen categories due to the lack of supervision for unseen classes. As an alternative to fully supervised approaches, query-based segmentation has shown great latent in ZSS, as it enables object localization without relying on explicit labels. However, conventional Hungarian matching, a core component in query-based frameworks, needs full supervision and often misclassifies unseen categories as background in the setting of ZSS. To address this issue, we propose Split Matching (SM), a novel assignment strategy that decouples Hungarian matching into two components: one for seen classes in annotated regions and another for latent classes in unannotated regions (referred to as unseen candidates). Specifically, we partition the queries into seen and candidate groups, enabling each to be optimized independently according to its available supervision. To discover unseen candidates, we cluster CLIP dense features to generate pseudo masks and extract region-level embeddings using CLS tokens. Matching is then conducted separately for the two groups based on both class-level similarity and mask-level consistency. Additionally, we introduce a Multi-scale Feature Enhancement (MFE) module that refines decoder features through residual multi-scale aggregation, improving the model's ability to capture spatial details across resolutions. SM is the first to introduce decoupled Hungarian matching under the inductive ZSS setting, and achieves state-of-the-art performance on two standard benchmarks.

  Pain is a manifold condition that impacts a significant percentage of the population. Accurate and reliable pain evaluation for the people suffering is crucial to developing effective and advanced pain management protocols. Automatic pain assessment systems provide continuous monitoring and support decision-making processes, ultimately aiming to alleviate distress and prevent functionality decline. This study introduces PainFormer, a vision foundation model based on multi-task learning principles trained simultaneously on 14 tasks/datasets with a total of 10.9 million samples. Functioning as an embedding extractor for various input modalities, the foundation model provides feature representations to the Embedding-Mixer, a transformer-based module that performs the final pain assessment. Extensive experiments employing behavioral modalities - including RGB, synthetic thermal, and estimated depth videos - and physiological modalities such as ECG, EMG, GSR, and fNIRS revealed that PainFormer effectively extracts high-quality embeddings from diverse input modalities. The proposed framework is evaluated on two pain datasets, BioVid and AI4Pain, and directly compared to 75 different methodologies documented in the literature. Experiments conducted in unimodal and multimodal settings demonstrate state-of-the-art performances across modalities and pave the way toward general-purpose models for automatic pain assessment. The foundation model's architecture (code) and weights are available at:this https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Instruction-based image editing enables precise modifications via natural language prompts, but existing methods face a precision-efficiency tradeoff: fine-tuning demands massive datasets (>10M) and computational resources, while training-free approaches suffer from weak instruction comprehension. We address this by proposing ICEdit, which leverages the inherent comprehension and generation abilities of large-scale Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) through three key innovations: (1) An in-context editing paradigm without architectural modifications; (2) Minimal parameter-efficient fine-tuning for quality improvement; (3) Early Filter Inference-Time Scaling, which uses VLMs to select high-quality noise samples for efficiency. Experiments show that ICEdit achieves state-of-the-art editing performance with only 0.1\% of the training data and 1\% trainable parameters compared to previous methods. Our approach establishes a new paradigm for balancing precision and efficiency in instructional image editing. Codes and demos can be found inthis https URL.

  Wheat accounts for approximately 20% of the world's caloric intake, making it a vital component of global food security. Given this importance, mapping wheat fields plays a crucial role in enabling various stakeholders, including policy makers, researchers, and agricultural organizations, to make informed decisions regarding food security, supply chain management, and resource allocation. In this paper, we tackle the problem of accurately mapping wheat fields out of satellite images by introducing an improved pipeline for winter wheat segmentation, as well as presenting a case study on a decade-long analysis of wheat mapping in Lebanon. We integrate a Temporal Spatial Vision Transformer (TSViT) with Parameter-Efficient Fine Tuning (PEFT) and a novel post-processing pipeline based on the Fields of The World (FTW) framework. Our proposed pipeline addresses key challenges encountered in existing approaches, such as the clustering of small agricultural parcels in a single large field. By merging wheat segmentation with precise field boundary extraction, our method produces geometrically coherent and semantically rich maps that enable us to perform in-depth analysis such as tracking crop rotation pattern over years. Extensive evaluations demonstrate improved boundary delineation and field-level precision, establishing the potential of the proposed framework in operational agricultural monitoring and historical trend analysis. By allowing for accurate mapping of wheat fields, this work lays the foundation for a range of critical studies and future advances, including crop monitoring and yield estimation.

  Despite recent progress in diffusion models, generating realistic head portraits from novel viewpoints remains a significant challenge. Most current approaches are constrained to limited angular ranges, predominantly focusing on frontal or near-frontal views. Moreover, although the recent emerging large-scale diffusion models have been proven robust in handling 3D scenes, they underperform on facial data, given their complex structure and the uncanny valley pitfalls. In this paper, we propose SpinMeRound, a diffusion-based approach designed to generate consistent and accurate head portraits from novel viewpoints. By leveraging a number of input views alongside an identity embedding, our method effectively synthesizes diverse viewpoints of a subject whilst robustly maintaining its unique identity features. Through experimentation, we showcase our model's generation capabilities in 360 head synthesis, while beating current state-of-the-art multiview diffusion models.

  While diffusion models excel at generating high-quality images from text prompts, they struggle with visual consistency when generating image sequences. Existing methods generate each image independently, leading to disjointed narratives - a challenge further exacerbated in non-linear storytelling, where scenes must connect beyond adjacent images. We introduce a novel beam search strategy for latent space exploration, enabling conditional generation of full image sequences with beam search decoding. In contrast to earlier methods that rely on fixed latent priors, our method dynamically samples past latents to search for an optimal sequence of latent representations, ensuring coherent visual transitions. As the latent denoising space is explored, the beam search graph is pruned with a cross-attention mechanism that efficiently scores search paths, prioritizing alignment with both textual prompts and visual context. Human and automatic evaluations confirm that BeamDiffusion outperforms other baseline methods, producing full sequences with superior coherence, visual continuity, and textual alignment.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in video-based multimodal large language models (Video-LLMs) have significantly improved video understanding by processing videos as sequences of image frames. However, many existing methods treat frames independently in the vision backbone, lacking explicit temporal modeling, which limits their ability to capture dynamic patterns and efficiently handle long videos. To address these limitations, we introduce STORM (Spatiotemporal TOken Reduction for Multimodal LLMs), a novel architecture incorporating a dedicated temporal encoder between the image encoder and the LLM. Our temporal encoder leverages the Mamba State Space Model to integrate temporal information into image tokens, generating enriched representations that preserve inter-frame dynamics across the entire video sequence. This enriched encoding not only enhances video reasoning capabilities but also enables effective token reduction strategies, including test-time sampling and training-based temporal and spatial pooling, substantially reducing computational demands on the LLM without sacrificing key temporal information. By integrating these techniques, our approach simultaneously reduces training and inference latency while improving performance, enabling efficient and robust video understanding over extended temporal contexts. Extensive evaluations show that STORM achieves state-of-the-art results across various long video understanding benchmarks (more than 5% improvement on MLVU and LongVideoBench) while reducing the computation costs by up to $8\times$ and the decoding latency by 2.4-2.9$\times$ for the fixed numbers of input frames.

We also evaluate the alignment between state-of-the-art (SoTA) vision language models (VLMs) and humans on our proposed benchmark, demonstrating both the promises and challenges of using VLMs for automatic creativity assessment.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Image anomaly detection plays a vital role in applications such as industrial quality inspection and medical imaging, where it directly contributes to improving product quality and system reliability. However, existing methods often struggle with complex and diverse anomaly patterns. In particular, the separation between generation and discrimination tasks limits the effective coordination between anomaly sample generation and anomaly region detection. To address these challenges, we propose a novel hybrid diffusion model (HDM) that integrates generation and discrimination into a unified framework. The model consists of three key modules: the Diffusion Anomaly Generation Module (DAGM), the Diffusion Discriminative Module (DDM), and the Probability Optimization Module (POM). DAGM generates realistic and diverse anomaly samples, improving their representativeness. DDM then applies a reverse diffusion process to capture the differences between generated and normal samples, enabling precise anomaly region detection and localization based on probability distributions. POM refines the probability distributions during both the generation and discrimination phases, ensuring high-quality samples are used for training. Extensive experiments on multiple industrial image datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, significantly improving both image-level and pixel-level anomaly detection performance, as measured by AUROC.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Pre-trained diffusion models are commonly used to generate clean data (e.g., images) from random noises, effectively forming pairs of noises and corresponding clean images. Distillation on these pre-trained models can be viewed as the process of constructing advanced trajectories within the pair to accelerate sampling. For instance, consistency model distillation develops consistent projection functions to regulate trajectories, although sampling efficiency remains a concern. Rectified flow method enforces straight trajectories to enable faster sampling, yet relies on numerical ODE solvers, which may introduce approximation errors. In this work, we bridge the gap between the consistency model and the rectified flow method by proposing a Straight Consistent Trajectory~(SCoT) model. SCoT enjoys the benefits of both approaches for fast sampling, producing trajectories with consistent and straight properties simultaneously. These dual properties are strategically balanced by targeting two critical objectives: (1) regulating the gradient of SCoT's mapping to a constant, (2) ensuring trajectory consistency. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of SCoT.

  Change detection (CD) in remote sensing images plays a vital role in Earth observation. However, the scarcity of high-resolution, comprehensive open-source datasets and the difficulty in achieving robust performance across varying change types remain major challenges. To address these issues, we introduce JL1-CD, a large-scale, sub-meter CD dataset consisting of 5,000 image pairs. We further propose a novel Origin-Partition (O-P) strategy and integrate it into a Multi-Teacher Knowledge Distillation (MTKD) framework to enhance CD performance. The O-P strategy partitions the training set by Change Area Ratio (CAR) and trains specialized teacher models on each subset. The MTKD framework then distills complementary knowledge from these teachers into a single student model, enabling improved detection results across diverse CAR scenarios without additional inference cost. Our MTKD approach demonstrated strong performance in the 2024 ``Jilin-1'' Cup challenge, ranking first in the preliminary and second in the final rounds. Extensive experiments on the JL1-CD and SYSU-CD datasets show that the MTKD framework consistently improves the performance of CD models with various network architectures and parameter sizes, establishing new state-of-the-art results.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Drone-view Geo-Localization (DVGL) aims to achieve accurate localization of drones by retrieving the most relevant GPS-tagged satellite images. However, most existing methods heavily rely on strictly pre-paired drone-satellite images for supervised learning. When the target region shifts, new paired samples are typically required to adapt to the distribution changes. The high cost of annotation and the limited transferability of these methods significantly hinder the practical deployment of DVGL in open-world scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose a novel end-to-end self-supervised learning method with a shallow backbone network, called the dynamic memory-driven and neighborhood information learning (DMNIL) method. It employs a clustering algorithm to generate pseudo-labels and adopts a dual-path contrastive learning framework to learn discriminative intra-view representations. Furthermore, DMNIL incorporates two core modules, including the dynamic hierarchical memory learning (DHML) module and the information consistency evolution learning (ICEL) module. The DHML module combines short-term and long-term memory to enhance intra-view feature consistency and discriminability. Meanwhile, the ICEL module utilizes a neighborhood-driven dynamic constraint mechanism to systematically capture implicit cross-view semantic correlations, consequently improving cross-view feature alignment. To further stabilize and strengthen the self-supervised training process, a pseudo-label enhancement strategy is introduced to enhance the quality of pseudo supervision. Extensive experiments on three public benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms existing self-supervised methods and even surpasses several state-of-the-art supervised methods.

  The event-based Vision-Language Model (VLM) recently has made good progress for practical vision tasks. However, most of these works just utilize CLIP for focusing on traditional perception tasks, which obstruct model understanding explicitly the sufficient semantics and context from event streams. To address the deficiency, we propose EventVL, the first generative event-based MLLM (Multimodal Large Language Model) framework for explicit semantic understanding. Specifically, to bridge the data gap for connecting different modalities semantics, we first annotate a large event-image/video-text dataset, containing almost 1.4 million high-quality pairs of data, which enables effective learning across various scenes, e.g., drive scene or human motion. After that, we design Event Spatiotemporal Representation to fully explore the comprehensive information by diversely aggregating and segmenting the event stream. To further promote a compact semantic space, Dynamic Semantic Alignment is introduced to improve and complete sparse semantic spaces of events. Extensive experiments show that our EventVL can significantly surpass existing MLLM baselines in event captioning and scene description generation tasks. We hope our research could contribute to the development of the event vision community.

  Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in processing both visual and textual information. However, the critical challenge of alignment between visual and textual representations is not fully understood. This survey presents a comprehensive examination of alignment and misalignment in LVLMs through an explainability lens. We first examine the fundamentals of alignment, exploring its representational and behavioral aspects, training methodologies, and theoretical foundations. We then analyze misalignment phenomena across three semantic levels: object, attribute, and relational misalignment. Our investigation reveals that misalignment emerges from challenges at multiple levels: the data level, the model level, and the inference level. We provide a comprehensive review of existing mitigation strategies, categorizing them into parameter-frozen and parameter-tuning approaches. Finally, we outline promising future research directions, emphasizing the need for standardized evaluation protocols and in-depth explainability studies.

  Weakly Supervised Monitoring Anomaly Detection (WSMAD) utilizes weak supervision learning to identify anomalies, a critical task for smart city monitoring. However, existing multimodal approaches often fail to meet the real-time and interpretability requirements of edge devices due to their complexity. This paper presents TCVADS (Two-stage Cross-modal Video Anomaly Detection System), which leverages knowledge distillation and cross-modal contrastive learning to enable efficient, accurate, and interpretable anomaly detection on edgethis http URLoperates in two stages: coarse-grained rapid classification and fine-grained detailed analysis. In the first stage, TCVADS extracts features from video frames and inputs them into a time series analysis module, which acts as the teacher model. Insights are then transferred via knowledge distillation to a simplified convolutional network (student model) for binary classification. Upon detecting an anomaly, the second stage is triggered, employing a fine-grained multi-class classification model. This stage uses CLIP for cross-modal contrastive learning with text and images, enhancing interpretability and achieving refined classification through specially designed triplet textual relationships. Experimental results demonstrate that TCVADS significantly outperforms existing methods in model performance, detection efficiency, and interpretability, offering valuable contributions to smart city monitoring applications.

  Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has been demonstrated to be highly effective in mitigating hallucinations in Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) by aligning their outputs more closely with human preferences. Despite the recent progress, existing methods suffer from two drawbacks: 1) Lack of scalable token-level rewards; and 2) Neglect of visual-anchored tokens. To this end, we propose a novel Token Preference Optimization model with self-calibrated rewards (dubbed as TPO), which adaptively attends to visual-correlated tokens without fine-grained annotations. Specifically, we introduce a token-level \emph{visual-anchored} \emph{reward} as the difference of the logistic distributions of generated tokens conditioned on the raw image and the corrupted one. In addition, to highlight the informative visual-anchored tokens, a visual-aware training objective is proposed to enhance more accurate token-level optimization. Extensive experimental results have manifested the state-of-the-art performance of the proposed TPO. For example, by building on top of LLAVA-1.5-7B, our TPO boosts the performance absolute improvement for hallucination benchmarks.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Diffusion Transformers (DiT) are renowned for their impressive generative performance; however, they are significantly constrained by considerable computational costs due to the quadratic complexity in self-attention and the extensive sampling steps required. While advancements have been made in expediting the sampling process, the underlying architectural inefficiencies within DiT remain underexplored. We introduce SparseDiT, a novel framework that implements token sparsification across spatial and temporal dimensions to enhance computational efficiency while preserving generative quality. Spatially, SparseDiT employs a tri-segment architecture that allocates token density based on feature requirements at each layer: Poolingformer in the bottom layers for efficient global feature extraction, Sparse-Dense Token Modules (SDTM) in the middle layers to balance global context with local detail, and dense tokens in the top layers to refine high-frequency details. Temporally, SparseDiT dynamically modulates token density across denoising stages, progressively increasing token count as finer details emerge in later timesteps. This synergy between SparseDiT spatially adaptive architecture and its temporal pruning strategy enables a unified framework that balances efficiency and fidelity throughout the generation process. Our experiments demonstrate SparseDiT effectiveness, achieving a 55% reduction in FLOPs and a 175% improvement in inference speed on DiT-XL with similar FID score on 512x512 ImageNet, a 56% reduction in FLOPs across video generation datasets, and a 69% improvement in inference speed on PixArt-$\alpha$ on text-to-image generation task with a 0.24 FID score decrease. SparseDiT provides a scalable solution for high-quality diffusion-based generation compatible with sampling optimization techniques.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  For many years, image over-segmentation into superpixels has been essential to computer vision pipelines, by creating homogeneous and identifiable regions of similar sizes. Such constrained segmentation problem would require a clear definition and specific evaluation criteria. However, the validation framework for superpixel methods, typically viewed as standard object segmentation, has rarely been thoroughly studied. In this work, we first take a step back to show that superpixel segmentation is fundamentally an ill-posed problem, due to the implicit regularity constraint on the shape and size of superpixels. We also demonstrate through a novel comprehensive study that the literature suffers from only evaluating certain aspects, sometimes incorrectly and with inappropriate metrics. Concurrently, recent deep learning-based superpixel methods mainly focus on the object segmentation task at the expense of regularity. In this ill-posed context, we show that we can achieve competitive results using a recent architecture like the Segment Anything Model (SAM), without dedicated training for the superpixel segmentation task. This leads to rethinking superpixel segmentation and the necessary properties depending on the targeted downstream task.

  We introduce EMMA, an End-to-end Multimodal Model for Autonomous driving. Built upon a multi-modal large language model foundation like Gemini, EMMA directly maps raw camera sensor data into various driving-specific outputs, including planner trajectories, perception objects, and road graph elements. EMMA maximizes the utility of world knowledge from the pre-trained large language models, by representing all non-sensor inputs (e.g. navigation instructions and ego vehicle status) and outputs (e.g. trajectories and 3D locations) as natural language text. This approach allows EMMA to jointly process various driving tasks in a unified language space, and generate the outputs for each task using task-specific prompts. Empirically, we demonstrate EMMA's effectiveness by achieving state-of-the-art performance in motion planning on nuScenes as well as competitive results on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD). EMMA also yields competitive results for camera-primary 3D object detection on the Waymo Open Dataset (WOD). We show that co-training EMMA with planner trajectories, object detection, and road graph tasks yields improvements across all three domains, highlighting EMMA's potential as a generalist model for autonomous driving applications. We hope that our results will inspire research to further evolve the state of the art in autonomous driving model architectures.

  The field of Remote Sensing Domain Generalization (RSDG) has emerged as a critical and valuable research frontier, focusing on developing models that generalize effectively across diverse scenarios. Despite the substantial domain gaps in RS images that are characterized by variabilities such as location, wavelength, and sensor type, research in this area remains underexplored: (1) Current cross-domain methods primarily focus on Domain Adaptation (DA), which adapts models to predefined domains rather than to unseen ones; (2) Few studies targeting the RSDG issue, especially for semantic segmentation tasks, where existing models are developed for specific unknown domains, struggling with issues of underfitting on other unknown scenarios; (3) Existing RS foundation models tend to prioritize in-domain performance over cross-domain generalization. To this end, we introduce the first vision foundation model for RSDG semantic segmentation, CrossEarth. CrossEarth demonstrates strong cross-domain generalization through a specially designed data-level Earth-Style Injection pipeline and a model-level Multi-Task Training pipeline. In addition, for the semantic segmentation task, we have curated an RSDG benchmark comprising 32 cross-domain settings across various regions, spectral bands, platforms, and climates, providing a comprehensive framework for testing the generalizability of future RSDG models. Extensive experiments on this benchmark demonstrate the superiority of CrossEarth over existing state-of-the-art methods.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting has emerged as a promising approach for modeling 3D scenes using mixtures of Gaussians. The predominant optimization method for these models relies on backpropagating gradients through a differentiable rendering pipeline, which struggles with catastrophic forgetting when dealing with continuous streams of data. To address this limitation, we propose Variational Bayes Gaussian Splatting (VBGS), a novel approach that frames training a Gaussian splat as variational inference over model parameters. By leveraging the conjugacy properties of multivariate Gaussians, we derive a closed-form variational update rule, allowing efficient updates from partial, sequential observations without the need for replay buffers. Our experiments show that VBGS not only matches state-of-the-art performance on static datasets, but also enables continual learning from sequentially streamed 2D and 3D data, drastically improving performance in this setting.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  People with Parkinson's Disease (PD) often experience progressively worsening gait, including changes in how they turn around, as the disease progresses. Existing clinical rating tools are not capable of capturing hour-by-hour variations of PD symptoms, as they are confined to brief assessments within clinic settings. Measuring gait turning angles continuously and passively is a component step towards using gait characteristics as sensitive indicators of disease progression in PD. This paper presents a deep learning-based approach to automatically quantify turning angles by extracting 3D skeletons from videos and calculating the rotation of hip and knee joints. We utilise state-of-the-art human pose estimation models, Fastpose and Strided Transformer, on a total of 1386 turning video clips from 24 subjects (12 people with PD and 12 healthy control volunteers), trimmed from a PD dataset of unscripted free-living videos in a home-like setting (Turn-REMAP). We also curate a turning video dataset, Turn-H3.6M, from the public Human3.6M human pose benchmark with 3D ground truth, to further validate our method. Previous gait research has primarily taken place in clinics or laboratories evaluating scripted gait outcomes, but this work focuses on free-living home settings where complexities exist, such as baggy clothing and poor lighting. Due to difficulties in obtaining accurate ground truth data in a free-living setting, we quantise the angle into the nearest bin $45^\circ$ based on the manual labelling of expert clinicians. Our method achieves a turning calculation accuracy of 41.6%, a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 34.7¬∞, and a weighted precision WPrec of 68.3% for Turn-REMAP. This is the first work to explore the use of single monocular camera data to quantify turns by PD patients in a home setting.

  Over the years, the use of superpixel segmentation has become very popular in various applications, serving as a preprocessing step to reduce data size by adapting to the content of the image, regardless of its semantic content. While the superpixel segmentation of standard planar images, captured with a 90¬∞ field of view, has been extensively studied, there has been limited focus on dedicated methods to omnidirectional or spherical images, captured with a 360¬∞ field of view. In this study, we introduce the first deep learning-based superpixel segmentation approach tailored for omnidirectional images called DSS (for Deep Spherical Superpixels). Our methodology leverages on spherical CNN architectures and the differentiable K-means clustering paradigm for superpixels, to generate superpixels that follow the spherical geometry. Additionally, we propose to use data augmentation techniques specifically designed for 360¬∞ images, enabling our model to efficiently learn from a limited set of annotated omnidirectional data. Our extensive validation across two datasets demonstrates that taking into account the inherent circular geometry of such images into our framework improves the segmentation performance over traditional and deep learning-based superpixel methods. Our code is available online.

  Scene Graph Generation (SGG) is a task that encodes visual relationships between objects in images as graph structures. SGG shows significant promise as a foundational component for downstream tasks, such as reasoning for embodied agents. To enable real-time applications, SGG must address the trade-off between performance and inference speed. However, current methods tend to focus on one of the following: (1) improving relation prediction accuracy, (2) enhancing object detection accuracy, or (3) reducing latency, without aiming to balance all three objectives simultaneously. To address this limitation, we propose the Real-time Efficiency and Accuracy Compromise for Tradeoffs in Scene Graph Generation (REACT) architecture, which achieves the highest inference speed among existing SGG models, improving object detection accuracy without sacrificing relation prediction performance. Compared to state-of-the-art approaches, REACT is 2.7 times faster and improves object detection accuracy by 58\%. Furthermore, our proposal significantly reduces model size, with an average of 5.5x fewer parameters. The code is available atthis https URL

  Deep learning algorithms require extensive data to achieve robust performance. However, data availability is often restricted in the medical domain due to patient privacy concerns. Synthetic data presents a possible solution to these challenges. Recently, image generative models have found increasing use for medical applications but are often designed for singular medical specialties and imaging modalities, thus limiting their broader utility. To address this, we introduce MediSyn: a text-guided, latent diffusion model capable of generating synthetic images from 6 medical specialties and 10 image types. Through extensive experimentation, we first demonstrate that MediSyn quantitatively matches or surpasses the performance of specialist models. Second, we show that our synthetic images are realistic and exhibit strong alignment with their corresponding text prompts, as validated by a team of expert physicians. Third, we provide empirical evidence that our synthetic images are visually distinct from their corresponding real patient images. Finally, we demonstrate that in data-limited settings, classifiers trained solely on synthetic data or real data supplemented with synthetic data can outperform those trained solely on real data. Our findings highlight the immense potential of generalist image generative models to accelerate algorithmic research and development in medicine.

  Understanding individual differences in cortical structure is key to advancing diagnostics in neurology and psychiatry. Reference models aid in detecting aberrant cortical thickness, yet site-specific biases limit their direct application to unseen data, and region-wise averages prevent the detection of localized cortical changes. To address these limitations, we developed the Stochastic Cortical Self-Reconstruction (SCSR), a novel method that leverages deep learning to reconstruct cortical thickness maps at the vertex level without needing additional subject information. Trained on over 25,000 healthy individuals, SCSR generates highly individualized cortical reconstructions that can detect subtle thickness deviations. Our evaluations on independent test sets demonstrated that SCSR achieved significantly lower reconstruction errors and identified atrophy patterns that enabled better disease discrimination than established methods. It also hints at cortical thinning in preterm infants that went undetected by existing models, showcasing its versatility. Finally, SCSR excelled in mapping highly resolved cortical deviations of dementia patients from clinical data, highlighting its potential for supporting diagnosis in clinical practice.

  In the past few years the transformer model has been utilized for a variety of tasks such as image captioning, image classification natural language generation, and natural language understanding. As a key component of the transformer model, self-attention calculates the attention values by mapping the relationships among the head elements of the source and target sequence, yet there is no explicit mechanism to refine and intensify the attention values with respect to the context of the input and target sequences. Based on this intuition, we introduce a novel refine and intensify attention mechanism that is called Zoneup Dropout Injection Attention Calculation (ZoDIAC), in which the intensities of attention values in the elements of the input source and target sequences are first refined using GELU and dropout and then intensified using a proposed zoneup process which includes the injection of a learned scalar factor. Our extensive experiments show that ZoDIAC achieves statistically significant higher scores under all image captioning metrics using various feature extractors in comparison to the conventional self-attention module in the transformer model on the MS-COCO dataset. Our proposed ZoDIAC attention modules can be used as a drop-in replacement for the attention components in all transformer models. The code for our experiments is publicly available at:this https URL

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In the superpixel literature, the comparison of state-of-the-art methods can be biased by the non-robustness of some metrics to decomposition aspects, such as the superpixel scale. Moreover, most recent decomposition methods allow to set a shape regularity parameter, which can have a substantial impact on the measured performances. In this paper, we introduce an evaluation framework, that aims to unify the comparison process of superpixel methods. We investigate the limitations of existing metrics, and propose to evaluate each of the three core decomposition aspects: color homogeneity, respect of image objects and shape regularity. To measure the regularity aspect, we propose a new global regularity measure (GR), which addresses the non-robustness of state-of-the-art metrics. We evaluate recent superpixel methods with these criteria, at several superpixel scales and regularity levels. The proposed framework reduces the bias in the comparison process of state-of-the-art superpixel methods. Finally, we demonstrate that the proposed GR measure is correlated with the performances of various applications.

  _Yunzhen Feng, Julia Kempe, Cheng Zhang, Parag Jain, Anthony Hartshorn_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large reasoning models (LRMs) spend substantial test-time compute on long chain-of-thought (CoT) traces, but what *characterizes* an effective CoT remains unclear. While prior work reports gains from lengthening CoTs and increasing review (revisiting earlier steps) via appended *wait* tokens, recent studies suggest that shorter thinking can outperform longer traces. We therefore conduct a systematic evaluation across ten LRMs on math and scientific reasoning. Contrary to the "longer-is-better" narrative, we find that both naive CoT lengthening and increased review are associated with *lower* accuracy.As CoT unfolds step by step, token-level metrics can conflate verbosity with process quality. We introduce a graph view of CoT to extract structure and identify a single statistic-the *Failed-Step Fraction (FSF)*, the fraction of steps in abandoned branches-that consistently outpredicts length and review ratio for correctness across models. To probe causality, we design two interventions. First, we rank candidate CoTs by each metric at test time, where FSF yields the largest pass@1 gains; second, we edit CoTs to remove failed branches, which significantly improves accuracy, indicating that failed branches bias subsequent reasoning. Taken together, these results characterize effective CoTs as those that *fail less* and support *structure-aware* test-time scaling over indiscriminately generating long CoT.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In the context of the energy transition, with increasing integration of renewable sources and cross-border electricity exchanges, power grids are encountering greater uncertainty and operational risk. Maintaining grid stability under varying conditions is a complex task, and power flow simulators are commonly used to support operators by evaluating potential actions before implementation. However, traditional physical solvers, while accurate, are often too slow for near real-time use. Machine learning models have emerged as fast surrogates, and to improve their adherence to physical laws (e.g., Kirchhoff's laws), they are often trained with embedded constraints which are also known as physics-informed or hybrid models. This paper presents an ablation study to demystify hybridization strategies, ranging from incorporating physical constraints as regularization terms or unsupervised losses, and exploring model architectures from simple multilayer perceptrons to advanced graph-based networks enabling the direct optimization of physics equations. Using our custom benchmarking pipeline for hybrid models called LIPS, we evaluate these models across four dimensions: accuracy, physical compliance, industrial readiness, and out-of-distribution generalization. The results highlight how integrating physical knowledge impacts performance across these criteria. All the implementations are reproducible and provided in the corresponding Github page.

  Recent advances in text-to-video (T2V) generation have enabled the creation of high-fidelity, temporally coherent clips from natural language prompts. Yet these systems come with significant computational costs, and their energy demands remain poorly understood. In this paper, we present a systematic study of the latency and energy consumption of state-of-the-art open-source T2V models. We first develop a compute-bound analytical model that predicts scaling laws with respect to spatial resolution, temporal length, and denoising steps. We then validate these predictions through fine-grained experiments on WAN2.1-T2V, showing quadratic growth with spatial and temporal dimensions, and linear scaling with the number of denoising steps. Finally, we extend our analysis to six diverse T2V models, comparing their runtime and energy profiles under default settings. Our results provide both a benchmark reference and practical insights for designing and deploying more sustainable generative video systems.

  Data-driven models, especially deep learning classifiers often demonstrate great success on clean datasets. Yet, they remain vulnerable to common data distortions such as adversarial and common corruption perturbations. These perturbations can significantly degrade performance, thereby challenging the overall reliability of the models. Traditional robustness validation typically relies on perturbed test datasets to assess and improve model performance. In our framework, however, we propose a validation approach that extracts "weak robust" samples directly from the training dataset via local robustness analysis. These samples, being the most susceptible to perturbations, serve as an early and sensitive indicator of the model's vulnerabilities. By evaluating models on these challenging training instances, we gain a more nuanced understanding of its robustness, which informs targeted performance enhancement. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on models trained with CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet, highlighting how robustness validation guided by weak robust samples can drive meaningful improvements in model reliability under adversarial and common corruption scenarios.

  Catastrophic forgetting has remained a significant challenge for efficient reinforcement learning for decades (Ring 1994, Rivest and Precup 2003). While recent works have proposed effective methods to mitigate this issue, they mainly focus on the algorithmic side. Meanwhile, we do not fully understand what architectural properties of neural networks lead to catastrophic forgetting. This study aims to fill this gap by studying the role of activation functions in the training dynamics of neural networks and their impact on catastrophic forgetting in reinforcement learning setup. Our study reveals that, besides sparse representations, the gradient sparsity of activation functions also plays an important role in reducing forgetting. Based on this insight, we propose a new class of activation functions, elephant activation functions, that can generate both sparse outputs and sparse gradients. We show that by simply replacing classical activation functions with elephant activation functions in the neural networks of value-based algorithms, we can significantly improve the resilience of neural networks to catastrophic forgetting, thus making reinforcement learning more sample-efficient and memory-efficient.

  Human mobility traces, often recorded as sequences of check-ins, provide a unique window into both short-term visiting patterns and persistent lifestyle regularities. In this work we introduce GSTM-HMU, a generative spatio-temporal framework designed to advance mobility analysis by explicitly modeling the semantic and temporal complexity of human movement. The framework consists of four key innovations. First, a Spatio-Temporal Concept Encoder (STCE) integrates geographic location, POI category semantics, and periodic temporal rhythms into unified vector representations. Second, a Cognitive Trajectory Memory (CTM) adaptively filters historical visits, emphasizing recent and behaviorally salient events in order to capture user intent more effectively. Third, a Lifestyle Concept Bank (LCB) contributes structured human preference cues, such as activity types and lifestyle patterns, to enhance interpretability and personalization. Finally, task-oriented generative heads transform the learned representations into predictions for multiple downstream tasks. We conduct extensive experiments on four widely used real-world datasets, including Gowalla, WeePlace, Brightkite, and FourSquare, and evaluate performance on three benchmark tasks: next-location prediction, trajectory-user identification, and time estimation. The results demonstrate consistent and substantial improvements over strong baselines, confirming the effectiveness of GSTM-HMU in extracting semantic regularities from complex mobility data. Beyond raw performance gains, our findings also suggest that generative modeling provides a promising foundation for building more robust, interpretable, and generalizable systems for human mobility intelligence.

  Reinforcement Learning (RL) is increasingly utilized to enhance the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, effectively scaling these RL methods presents significant challenges, primarily due to the difficulty in maintaining high AI accelerator utilization without generating stale, off-policy data that harms common RL algorithms. This paper introduces PipelineRL, an approach designed to achieve a superior trade-off between hardware efficiency and data on-policyness for LLM training. PipelineRL employs concurrent asynchronous data generation and model training, distinguished by the novel in-flight weight updates. This mechanism allows the LLM generation engine to receive updated model weights with minimal interruption during the generation of token sequences, thereby maximizing both the accelerator utilization and the freshness of training data. Experiments conducted on long-form reasoning tasks using 128 H100 GPUs demonstrate that PipelineRL achieves approximately $\sim 2x$ faster learning compared to conventional RL baselines while maintaining highly on-policy training data. A scalable and modular open-source implementation of PipelineRL is also released as a key contribution.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The study on architecture and parameter characteristics remains the hot topic in the research of large language models. In this paper we concern with the characteristics of weight which are used to analyze the correlations and differences between models. Two kinds of vectors-standard deviation vector and clustering vector-are proposed to describe features of models. In the first case, the weights are assumed to follow normal distribution. The standard deviation values of projection matrices are normalized to form Standard-Deviation Vector, representing the distribution characteristics of models. In the second case, the singular values from each weight projection matrix are extracted and grouped by K-Means algorithm. The grouped data with the same type matrix are combined as Clustering Vector to represent the correlation characteristics of models' weights. The study reveals that these two vectors can effectively distinguish between different models and clearly show the similarities among models of the same family. Moreover, after conducting LoRA fine-tuning with different datasets and models, it is found that the distribution of weights represented by standard deviation vector is directly influenced by the dataset, but the correlations between different weights represented by clustering vector remain unaffected and maintain a high consistency with the pre-trained model.

  Understanding causality in event sequences where outcome labels such as diseases or system failures arise from preceding events like symptoms or error codes is critical. Yet remains an unsolved challenge across domains like healthcare or vehicle diagnostics. We introduce CARGO, a scalable multi-label causal discovery method for sparse, high-dimensional event sequences comprising of thousands of unique event types. Using two pretrained causal Transformers as domain-specific foundation models for event sequences. CARGO infers in parallel, per sequence one-shot causal graphs and aggregates them using an adaptive frequency fusion to reconstruct the global Markov boundaries of labels. This two-stage approach enables efficient probabilistic reasoning at scale while bypassing the intractable cost of full-dataset conditional independence testing. Our results on a challenging real-world automotive fault prediction dataset with over 29,100 unique event types and 474 imbalanced labels demonstrate CARGO's ability to perform structured reasoning.

  Given the widespread use of deep learning models in safety-critical applications, ensuring that the decisions of such models are robust against adversarial exploitation is of fundamental importance. In this thesis, we discuss recent progress toward designing algorithms that exhibit desirable robustness properties. First, we discuss the problem of adversarial examples in computer vision, for which we introduce new technical results, training paradigms, and certification algorithms. Next, we consider the problem of domain generalization, wherein the task is to train neural networks to generalize from a family of training distributions to unseen test distributions. We present new algorithms that achieve state-of-the-art generalization in medical imaging, molecular identification, and image classification. Finally, we study the setting of jailbreaking large language models (LLMs), wherein an adversarial user attempts to design prompts that elicit objectionable content from an LLM. We propose new attacks and defenses, which represent the frontier of progress toward designing robust language-based agents.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable success across various graph-based tasks. However, they face some fundamental limitations: feature oversmoothing can cause node representations to become indistinguishable in deeper networks, they struggle to effectively manage heterogeneous relationships where connected nodes differ significantly, and they process entire feature vectors as indivisible units, which limits flexibility. We seek to address these limitations. We propose AxelGNN, a novel GNN architecture inspired by Axelrod's cultural dissemination model that addresses these limitations through a unified framework. AxelGNN incorporates similarity-gated probabilistic interactions that adaptively promote convergence or divergence based on node similarity, implements trait-level copying mechanisms for fine-grained feature aggregation at the segment level, and maintains global polarization to preserve node distinctiveness across multiple representation clusters. The model's bistable convergence dynamics naturally handle both homophilic and heterophilic graphs within a single architecture. Extensive experiments on node classification and influence estimation benchmarks demonstrate that AxelGNN consistently outperforms or matches state-of-the-art GNN methods across diverse graph structures with varying homophily-heterophily characteristics.

  Deep Gaussian processes (DGPs) enable expressive hierarchical Bayesian modeling but pose substantial challenges for posterior inference, especially over inducing variables. Denoising diffusion variational inference (DDVI) addresses this by modeling the posterior as a time-reversed diffusion from a simple Gaussian prior. However, DDVI's fixed unconditional starting distribution remains far from the complex true posterior, resulting in inefficient inference trajectories and slow convergence. In this work, we propose Diffusion Bridge Variational Inference (DBVI), a principled extension of DDVI that initiates the reverse diffusion from a learnable, data-dependent initial distribution. This initialization is parameterized via an amortized neural network and progressively adapted using gradients from the ELBO objective, reducing the posterior gap and improving sample efficiency. To enable scalable amortization, we design the network to operate on the inducing inputs, which serve as structured, low-dimensional summaries of the dataset and naturally align with the inducing variables' shape. DBVI retains the mathematical elegance of DDVI, including Girsanov-based ELBOs and reverse-time SDEs,while reinterpreting the prior via a Doob-bridged diffusion process. We derive a tractable training objective under this formulation and implement DBVI for scalable inference in large-scale DGPs. Across regression, classification, and image reconstruction tasks, DBVI consistently outperforms DDVI and other variational baselines in predictive accuracy, convergence speed, and posterior quality.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The rising computational and energy demands of deep neural networks (DNNs), driven largely by backpropagation (BP), challenge sustainable AI development. This paper rigorously investigates three BP-free training methods: the Forward-Forward (FF), Cascaded-Forward (CaFo), and Mono-Forward (MF) algorithms, tracing their progression from foundational concepts to a demonstrably superior solution.A robust comparative framework was established: each algorithm was implemented on its native architecture (MLPs for FF and MF, a CNN for CaFo) and benchmarked against an equivalent BP-trained model. Hyperparameters were optimized with Optuna, and consistent early stopping criteria were applied based on validation performance, ensuring all models were optimally tuned before comparison.Results show that MF not only competes with but consistently surpasses BP in classification accuracy on its native MLPs. Its superior generalization stems from converging to a more favorable minimum in the validation loss landscape, challenging the assumption that global optimization is required for state-of-the-art results. Measured at the hardware level using the NVIDIA Management Library (NVML) API, MF reduces energy consumption by up to 41% and shortens training time by up to 34%, translating to a measurably smaller carbon footprint as estimated by CodeCarbon.Beyond this primary result, we present a hardware-level analysis that explains the efficiency gains: exposing FF's architectural inefficiencies, validating MF's computationally lean design, and challenging the assumption that all BP-free methods are inherently more memory-efficient. By documenting the evolution from FF's conceptual groundwork to MF's synthesis of accuracy and sustainability, this work offers a clear, data-driven roadmap for future energy-efficient deep learning.

  _Yang Li, Chenyu Wang, Tingrui Wang, Yongwei Wang, Haonan Li, Zhunga Liu, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Black-box adversarial attacks remain challenging due to limited access to model internals. Existing methods often depend on specific network architectures or require numerous queries, resulting in limited cross-architecture transferability and high query costs. To address these limitations, we propose JAD, a latent diffusion model framework for black-box adversarial attacks. JAD generates adversarial examples by leveraging a latent diffusion model guided by attention maps distilled from both a convolutional neural network (CNN) and a Vision Transformer (ViT) models. By focusing on image regions that are commonly sensitive across architectures, this approach crafts adversarial perturbations that transfer effectively between different model types. This joint attention distillation strategy enables JAD to be architecture-agnostic, achieving superior attack generalization across diverse models. Moreover, the generative nature of the diffusion framework yields high adversarial sample generation efficiency by reducing reliance on iterative queries.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Detection of credit card fraud is an acute issue of financial security because transaction datasets are highly lopsided, with fraud cases being only a drop in the ocean. Balancing datasets using the most popular methods of traditional oversampling such as the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) generally create simplistic synthetic samples that are not readily applicable to complex fraud patterns. Recent industry advances that include Conditional Tabular Generative Adversarial Networks (CTGAN) and Tabular Variational Autoencoders (TVAE) have demonstrated increased efficiency in tabular synthesis, yet all these models still exhibit issues with high-dimensional dependence modelling. Now we will present our hybrid approach where we use a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) with a Transformer encoder block to produce realistic fraudulent transactions samples. The GAN architecture allows training realistic generators adversarial, and the Transformer allows the model to learn rich feature interactions by self-attention. Such a hybrid strategy overcomes the limitations of SMOTE, CTGAN, and TVAE by producing a variety of high-quality synthetic minority classes samples. We test our algorithm on the publicly-available Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset and compare it to conventional and generative resampling strategies with a variety of classifiers, such as Logistic Regression (LR), Random Forest (RF), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and Support Vector Machine (SVM). Findings indicate that our Transformer-based GAN shows substantial gains in Recall, F1-score and Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC), which indicates that it is effective in overcoming the severe class imbalance inherent in the task of fraud detection.

  Recent advances in multimodal large language models (LLMs) have led to significant progress in understanding, generation, and retrieval tasks. However, current solutions often treat these tasks in isolation or require training LLMs from scratch, resulting in high computational costs and limited generalization across modalities. In this work, we present OmniBridge, a unified and modular multimodal framework that supports vision-language understanding, generation, and retrieval within a unified architecture. OmniBridge adopts a language-centric design that reuses pretrained LLMs and introduces a lightweight bidirectional latent alignment module. To address the challenge of task interference, we propose a two-stage decoupled training strategy: supervised fine-tuning and latent space alignment for aligning LLM behavior with multimodal reasoning, and semantic-guided diffusion training to align cross-modal latent spaces via learnable query embeddings. Extensive experiments across a wide range of benchmarks demonstrate that OmniBridge achieves competitive or state-of-the-art performance in all three tasks. Moreover, our results highlight the effectiveness of latent space alignment for unifying multimodal modeling under a shared representation space. Code and models are released atthis https URL.

  _Hazem Dewidar, Elena Umili_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Non-Markovian Reinforcement Learning (RL) tasks present significant challenges, as agents must reason over entire trajectories of state-action pairs to make optimal decisions. A common strategy to address this is through symbolic formalisms, such as Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) or automata, which provide a structured way to express temporally extended objectives. However, these approaches often rely on restrictive assumptions -- such as the availability of a predefined Symbol Grounding (SG) function mapping raw observations to high-level symbolic representations, or prior knowledge of the temporal task. In this work, we propose a fully learnable version of Neural Reward Machines (NRM), which can learn both the SG function and the automaton end-to-end, removing any reliance on prior knowledge. Our approach is therefore as easily applicable as classic deep RL (DRL) approaches, while being far more explainable, because of the finite and compact nature of automata. Furthermore, we show that by integrating Fully Learnable Reward Machines (FLNRM) with DRL, our method outperforms previous approaches based on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs).

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Representation learning from unlabeled data has been extensively studied in statistics, data science and signal processing with a rich literature on techniques for dimension reduction, compression, multi-dimensional scaling among others. However, current deep learning models use new principles for unsupervised representation learning that cannot be easily analyzed using classical theories. For example, visual foundation models have found tremendous success using self-supervision or denoising/masked autoencoders, which effectively learn representations from massive amounts of unlabeled data. However, it remains difficult to characterize the representations learned by these models and to explain why they perform well for diverse prediction tasks or show emergent behavior. To answer these questions, one needs to combine mathematical tools from statistics and optimization. This paper provides an overview of recent theoretical advances in representation learning from unlabeled data and mentions our contributions in this direction.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Low-rank architectures have become increasingly important for efficient large language model (LLM) pre-training, providing substantial reductions in both parameter complexity and memory/computational demands. Despite these advantages, current low-rank methods face three critical shortcomings: (1) compromised model performance, (2) considerable computational overhead, and (3) limited activation memory savings. To address these limitations, we propose Cross-layer Low-Rank residual Network (CR-Net), an innovative parameter-efficient framework inspired by our discovery that inter-layer activation residuals possess low-rank properties. CR-Net implements this insight through a dual-path architecture that efficiently reconstructs layer activations by combining previous-layer outputs with their low-rank differences, thereby maintaining high-rank information with minimal parameters. We further develop a specialized activation recomputation strategy tailored for CR-Net that dramatically reduces memory requirements. Extensive pre-training experiments across model scales from 60M to 7B parameters demonstrate that CR-Net consistently outperforms state-of-the-art low-rank frameworks while requiring fewer computational resources and less memory.

  _Zhanglu Yan, Jiayi Mao, Qianhui Liu, Fanfan Li, Gang Pan, Tao Luo, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Spiking neural networks (SNNs) promise high energy efficiency, particularly with time-to-first-spike (TTFS) encoding, which maximizes sparsity by emitting at most one spike per neuron. However, such energy advantage is often unrealized because inference requires evaluating a temporal decay function and subsequent multiplication with the synaptic weights. This paper challenges this costly approach by repurposing a physical hardware `bug', namely, the natural signal decay in optoelectronic devices, as the core computation of TTFS. We fabricated a custom indium oxide optoelectronic synapse, showing how its natural physical decay directly implements the required temporal function. By treating the device's analog output as the fused product of the synaptic weight and temporal decay, optoelectronic synaptic TTFS (named Otters) eliminates these expensive digital operations. To use the Otters paradigm in complex architectures like the transformer, which are challenging to train directly due to the sparsity issue, we introduce a novel quantized neural network-to-SNN conversion algorithm. This complete hardware-software co-design enables our model to achieve state-of-the-art accuracy across seven GLUE benchmark datasets and demonstrates a 1.77$\times$ improvement in energy efficiency over previous leading SNNs, based on a comprehensive analysis of compute, data movement, and memory access costs using energy measurements from a commercial 22nm process. Our work thus establishes a new paradigm for energy-efficient SNNs, translating fundamental device physics directly into powerful computational primitives. All codes and data are open source.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Ensemble methods for stream mining necessitate managing multiple models and updating them as data distributions evolve. Considering the calls for more sustainability, established methods are however not sufficiently considerate of ensemble members' computational expenses and instead overly focus on predictive capabilities. To address these challenges and enable green online learning, we propose heterogeneous online ensembles (HEROS). For every training step, HEROS chooses a subset of models from a pool of models initialized with diverse hyperparameter choices under resource constraints to train. We introduce a Markov decision process to theoretically capture the trade-offs between predictive performance and sustainability constraints. Based on this framework, we present different policies for choosing which models to train on incoming data. Most notably, we propose the novel $\zeta$-policy, which focuses on training near-optimal models at reduced costs. Using a stochastic model, we theoretically prove that our $\zeta$-policy achieves near optimal performance while using fewer resources compared to the best performing policy. In our experiments across 11 benchmark datasets, we find empiric evidence that our $\zeta$-policy is a strong contribution to the state-of-the-art, demonstrating highly accurate performance, in some cases even outperforming competitors, and simultaneously being much more resource-friendly.

  Bayesian networks (BN) are probabilistic graphical models that enable efficient knowledge representation and inference. These have proven effective across diverse domains, including healthcare, bioinformatics and economics. The structure and parameters of a BN can be obtained by domain experts or directly learned from available data. However, as privacy concerns escalate, it becomes increasingly critical for publicly released models to safeguard sensitive information in training data. Typically, released models do not prioritize privacy by design. In particular, tracing attacks from adversaries can combine the released BN with auxiliary data to determine whether specific individuals belong to the data from which the BN was learned. State-of-the-art protection tecniques involve introducing noise into the learned parameters. While this offers robust protection against tracing attacks, it significantly impacts the model's utility, in terms of both the significance and accuracy of the resulting inferences. Hence, high privacy may be attained at the cost of releasing a possibly ineffective model. This paper introduces credal networks (CN) as a novel solution for balancing the model's privacy and utility. After adapting the notion of tracing attacks, we demonstrate that a CN enables the masking of the learned BN, thereby reducing the probability of successful attacks. As CNs are obfuscated but not noisy versions of BNs, they can achieve meaningful inferences while safeguarding privacy. Moreover, we identify key learning information that must be concealed to prevent attackers from recovering the underlying BN. Finally, we conduct a set of numerical experiments to analyze how privacy gains can be modulated by tuning the CN hyperparameters. Our results confirm that CNs provide a principled, practical, and effective approach towards the development of privacy-aware probabilistic graphical models.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Neural Algorithmic Reasoning (NAR) is a paradigm that trains neural networks to execute classic algorithms by supervised learning. Despite its successes, important limitations remain: inability to construct valid solutions without post-processing and to reason about multiple correct ones, poor performance on combinatorial NP-hard problems, and inapplicability to problems for which strong algorithms are not yet known. To address these limitations, we reframe the problem of learning algorithm trajectories as a Markov Decision Process, which imposes structure on the solution construction procedure and unlocks the powerful tools of imitation and reinforcement learning (RL). We propose the GNARL framework, encompassing the methodology to translate problem formulations from NAR to RL and a learning architecture suitable for a wide range of graph-based problems. We achieve very high graph accuracy results on several CLRS-30 problems, performance matching or exceeding much narrower NAR approaches for NP-hard problems and, remarkably, applicability even when lacking an expert algorithm.

  _Zhaoxin Wang, Handing Wang, Cong Tian, Yaochu Jin_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Federated learning allows multiple participants to collaboratively train a central model without sharing their private data. However, this distributed nature also exposes new attack surfaces. In particular, backdoor attacks allow attackers to implant malicious behaviors into the global model while maintaining high accuracy on benign inputs. Existing attacks usually rely on fixed patterns or adversarial perturbations as triggers, which tightly couple the main and backdoor tasks. This coupling makes them vulnerable to dilution by honest updates and limits their persistence under federated defenses. In this work, we propose an approach to decouple the backdoor task from the main task by dynamically optimizing the backdoor trigger within a min-max framework. The inner layer maximizes the performance gap between poisoned and benign samples, ensuring that the contributions of benign users have minimal impact on the backdoor. The outer process injects the adaptive triggers into the local model. We evaluate our method on both computer vision and natural language tasks, and compare it with six backdoor attack methods under six defense algorithms. Experimental results show that our method achieves good attack performance and can be easily integrated into existing backdoor attack techniques.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  While heterophily has been widely studied in node-level tasks, its impact on graph-level tasks remains unclear. We present the first analysis of heterophily in graph-level learning, combining theoretical insights with empirical validation. We first introduce a taxonomy of graph-level labeling schemes, and focus on motif-based tasks within local structure labeling, which is a popular labeling scheme. Using energy-based gradient flow analysis, we reveal a key insight: unlike frequency-dominated regimes in node-level tasks, motif detection requires mixed-frequency dynamics to remain flexible across multiple spectral components. Our theory shows that motif objectives are inherently misaligned with global frequency dominance, demanding distinct architectural considerations. Experiments on synthetic datasets with controlled heterophily and real-world molecular property prediction support our findings, showing that frequency-adaptive model outperform frequency-dominated models. This work establishes a new theoretical understanding of heterophily in graph-level learning and offers guidance for designing effective GNN architectures.

  RLVR has enhanced the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) across various tasks. However, GRPO, a representative RLVR algorithm, suffers from a critical limitation: when all responses within a group are either entirely correct or entirely incorrect, the model fails to learn from these homogeneous responses. This is particularly problematic for homogeneously incorrect groups, where GRPO's advantage function yields a value of zero, leading to null gradients and the loss of valuable learning signals. To overcome this issue, we propose NGRPO (Negative-enhanced Group Relative Policy Optimization), an algorithm designed to convert homogeneous errors into robust learning signals. First, NGRPO introduces Advantage Calibration. This mechanism hypothesizes the existence of a virtual maximum-reward sample during advantage calculation, thereby altering the mean and variance of rewards within a group and ensuring that the advantages for homogeneously incorrect samples are no longer zero. Second, NGRPO employs Asymmetric Clipping, which relaxes the update magnitude for positive samples while imposing stricter constraints on that of negative samples. This serves to stabilize the exploration pressure introduced by the advantage calibration. Our experiments on Qwen2.5-Math-7B demonstrate that NGRPO significantly outperforms baselines such as PPO, GRPO, DAPO, and PSR-NSR on mathematical benchmarks including MATH500, AMC23, and AIME2025. These results validate NGRPO's ability to learn from homogeneous errors, leading to stable and substantial improvements in mathematical reasoning. Our code is available atthis https URL.

  Expanding neural networks during training is a promising way to augment capacity without retraining larger models from scratch. However, newly added neurons often fail to adjust to a trained network and become inactive, providing no contribution to capacity growth. We propose the Shared-Weights Extender (SWE), a novel method explicitly designed to prevent inactivity of new neurons by coupling them with existing ones for smooth integration. In parallel, we introduce the Steepest Voting Distributor (SVoD), a gradient-based method for allocating neurons across layers during deep network expansion. Our extensive benchmarking on four datasets shows that our method can effectively suppress neuron inactivity and achieve better performance compared to other expanding methods and baselines.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The well-known graph-based clustering methods, including spectral clustering, symmetric non-negative matrix factorization, and doubly stochastic normalization, can be viewed as relaxations of the kernel $k$-means approach. However, we posit that these methods excessively relax their inherent low-rank, nonnegative, doubly stochastic, and orthonormal constraints to ensure numerical feasibility, potentially limiting their clustering efficacy. In this paper, guided by our theoretical analyses, we propose \textbf{Lo}w-\textbf{R}ank \textbf{D}oubly stochastic clustering (\textbf{LoRD}), a model that only relaxes the orthonormal constraint to derive a probabilistic clustering results. Furthermore, we theoretically establish the equivalence between orthogonality and block diagonality under the doubly stochastic constraint. By integrating \textbf{B}lock diagonal regularization into LoRD, expressed as the maximization of the Frobenius norm, we propose \textbf{B-LoRD}, which further enhances the clustering performance. To ensure numerical solvability, we transform the non-convex doubly stochastic constraint into a linear convex constraint through the introduction of a class probability parameter. We further theoretically demonstrate the gradient Lipschitz continuity of our LoRD and B-LoRD enables the proposal of a globally convergent projected gradient descent algorithm for their optimization. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our approaches. The code is publicly available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recently reconstruction-based deep models have been widely used for time series anomaly detection, but as their capacity and representation capability increase, these models tend to over-generalize, often reconstructing unseen anomalies accurately. Prior works have attempted to mitigate this by incorporating a memory architecture that stores prototypes of normal patterns. Nevertheless, these approaches suffer from high training costs and have yet to be effectively integrated with time series foundation models (TFMs). To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{MOMEMTO}, a TFM for anomaly detection, enhanced with a patch-based memory module to mitigate over-generalization. The memory module is designed to capture representative normal patterns from multiple domains and enables a single model to be jointly fine-tuned across multiple datasets through a multi-domain training strategy. MOMEMTO initializes memory items with latent representations from a pre-trained encoder, organizes them into patch-level units, and updates them via an attention mechanism. We evaluate our method using 23 univariate benchmark datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that MOMEMTO, as a single model, achieves higher scores on AUC and VUS metrics compared to baseline methods, and further enhances the performance of its backbone TFM, particularly in few-shot learning scenarios.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce a novel convolutional neural network architecture, termed the \emph{periodic CNN}, which incorporates periodic boundary conditions into the convolutional layers. Our main theoretical contribution is a rigorous approximation theorem: periodic CNNs can approximate ridge functions depending on $d-1$ linear variables in a $d$-dimensional input space, while such approximation is impossible in lower-dimensional ridge settings ($d-2$ or fewer variables). This result establishes a sharp characterization of the expressive power of periodic CNNs. Beyond the theory, our findings suggest that periodic CNNs are particularly well-suited for problems where data naturally admits a ridge-like structure of high intrinsic dimension, such as image analysis on wrapped domains, physics-informed learning, and materials science. The work thus both expands the mathematical foundation of CNN approximation theory and highlights a class of architectures with surprising and practically relevant approximation capabilities.

  This paper presents a novel approach to e-commerce payment fraud detection by integrating reinforcement learning (RL) with Large Language Models (LLMs). By framing transaction risk as a multi-step Markov Decision Process (MDP), RL optimizes risk detection across multiple payment stages. Crafting effective reward functions, essential for RL model success, typically requires significant human expertise due to the complexity and variability in design. LLMs, with their advanced reasoning and coding capabilities, are well-suited to refine these functions, offering improvements over traditional methods. Our approach leverages LLMs to iteratively enhance reward functions, achieving better fraud detection accuracy and demonstrating zero-shot capability. Experiments with real-world data confirm the effectiveness, robustness, and resilience of our LLM-enhanced RL framework through long-term evaluations, underscoring the potential of LLMs in advancing industrial RL applications.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The bisimulation metric (BSM) is a powerful tool for computing state similarities within a Markov decision process (MDP), revealing that states closer in BSM have more similar optimal value functions. While BSM has been successfully utilized in reinforcement learning (RL) for tasks like state representation learning and policy exploration, its application to multiple-MDP scenarios, such as policy transfer, remains challenging. Prior work has attempted to generalize BSM to pairs of MDPs, but a lack of rigorous analysis of its mathematical properties has limited further theoretical progress. In this work, we formally establish a generalized bisimulation metric (GBSM) between pairs of MDPs, which is rigorously proven with the three fundamental properties: GBSM symmetry, inter-MDP triangle inequality, and the distance bound on identical state spaces. Leveraging these properties, we theoretically analyse policy transfer, state aggregation, and sampling-based estimation in MDPs, obtaining explicit bounds that are strictly tighter than those derived from the standard BSM. Additionally, GBSM provides a closed-form sample complexity for estimation, improving upon existing asymptotic results based on BSM. Numerical results validate our theoretical findings and demonstrate the effectiveness of GBSM in multi-MDP scenarios.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Foundation models excel across diverse tasks, but adapting them to specialized applications often requires fine-tuning, an approach that is memory and compute-intensive. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods mitigate this by updating only a small subset of weights. In this paper, we introduce HyperAdapt, a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method that significantly reduces the number of trainable parameters compared to state-of-the-art methods like LoRA. Specifically, HyperAdapt adapts a pre-trained weight matrix by applying row- and column-wise scaling through diagonal matrices, thereby inducing a high-rank update while requiring only $n+m$ trainable parameters for an $n \times m$ matrix. Theoretically, we establish an upper bound on the rank of HyperAdapt's updates, and empirically, we confirm that it consistently induces high-rank transformations across model layers. Experiments on GLUE, arithmetic reasoning, and commonsense reasoning benchmarks with models up to 14B parameters demonstrate that HyperAdapt matches or nearly matches the performance of full fine-tuning and state-of-the-art PEFT methods while using orders of magnitude fewer trainable parameters.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Pretraining on large-scale collections of PDE-governed spatiotemporal trajectories has recently shown promise for building generalizable models of dynamical systems. Yet most existing PDE foundation models rely on deterministic Transformer architectures, which lack generative flexibility for many science and engineering applications. We propose Flow Marching, an algorithm that bridges neural operator learning with flow matching motivated by an analysis of error accumulation in physical dynamical systems, and we build a generative PDE foundation model on top of it. By jointly sampling the noise level and the physical time step between adjacent states, the model learns a unified velocity field that transports a noisy current state toward its clean successor, reducing long-term rollout drift while enabling uncertainty-aware ensemble generations. Alongside this core algorithm, we introduce a Physics-Pretrained Variational Autoencoder (P2VAE) to embed physical states into a compact latent space, and an efficient Flow Marching Transformer (FMT) that combines a diffusion-forcing scheme with latent temporal pyramids, achieving up to 15x greater computational efficiency than full-length video diffusion models and thereby enabling large-scale pretraining at substantially reduced cost. We curate a corpus of ~2.5M trajectories across 12 distinct PDE families and train suites of P2VAEs and FMTs at multiple scales. On downstream evaluation, we benchmark on unseen Kolmogorov turbulence with few-shot adaptation, demonstrate long-term rollout stability over deterministic counterparts, and present uncertainty-stratified ensemble results, highlighting the importance of generative PDE foundation models for real-world applications.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in interactive decision-making tasks, but existing methods often struggle with error accumulation and lack robust self-correction mechanisms. We introduce "Reflect before Act" (REBACT), a novel approach that enhances LLM-based decision-making by introducing a critical reflect step prior to taking the next action. This approach allows for immediate error correction, ensuring smooth action path and adaptibity to environment feedback. We evaluate REBACT on three diverse interactive environments: ALFWorld, WebShop, and TextCraft. Our results demonstrate that REBACT significantly outperforms strong baselines, improving success rates by up to 24% on WebShop (achieving 61%), 6.72% on ALFWorld (achieving 98.51%), and 0.5% on TextCraft (achieving 99.5%) using Claude3.5-sonnet as the underlying LLM. Further analysis reveals that REBACT's performance improvements are achieved with only a few modification steps, demonstrating its computational efficiency.

  _Mingchun Sun, Rongqiang Zhao, Jie Liu_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Diffusion models are the mainstream approach for time series generation tasks. However, existing diffusion models for time series generation require retraining the entire framework to introduce specific conditional guidance. There also exists a certain degree of distributional bias between the generated data and the real data, which leads to potential model biases in downstream tasks. Additionally, the complexity of diffusion models and the latent spaces leads to an uninterpretable inference process. To address these issues, we propose the data style-guided diffusion model (DS-Diffusion). In the DS-Diffusion, a diffusion framework based on style-guided kernels is developed to avoid retraining for specific conditions. The time-information based hierarchical denoising mechanism (THD) is developed to reduce the distributional bias between the generated data and the real data. Furthermore, the generated samples can clearly indicate the data style from which they originate. We conduct comprehensive evaluations using multiple public datasets to validate our approach. Experimental results show that, compared to the state-of-the-art model such as ImagenTime, the predictive score and the discriminative score decrease by 5.56% and 61.55%, respectively. The distributional bias between the generated data and the real data is further reduced, the inference process is also more interpretable. Moreover, by eliminating the need to retrain the diffusion model, the flexibility and adaptability of the model to specific conditions are also enhanced.

  Dementia is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder with multiple etiologies, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, frontotemporal dementia, and vascular dementia. Its clinical and biological heterogeneity makes diagnosis and subtype differentiation highly challenging. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have recently shown strong potential in modeling brain connectivity, but their limited robustness, data scarcity, and lack of interpretability constrain clinical adoption. Explainable Graph Neural Networks (XGNNs) have emerged to address these barriers by combining graph-based learning with interpretability, enabling the identification of disease-relevant biomarkers, analysis of brain network disruptions, and provision of transparent insights for clinicians. This paper presents the first comprehensive review dedicated to XGNNs in dementia research. We examine their applications across Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, mild cognitive impairment, and multi-disease diagnosis. A taxonomy of explainability methods tailored for dementia-related tasks is introduced, alongside comparisons of existing models in clinical scenarios. We also highlight challenges such as limited generalizability, underexplored domains, and the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) for early detection. By outlining both progress and open problems, this review aims to guide future work toward trustworthy, clinically meaningful, and scalable use of XGNNs in dementia research.

  The meta-task of obtaining and aligning representations through contrastive pretraining is steadily gaining importance since its introduction in CLIP and ALIGN. In this paper we theoretically explain the advantages of synchronizing with trainable inverse temperature and bias under the sigmoid loss, as implemented in the recent SigLIP and SigLIP2 models of Google DeepMind. Temperature and bias can drive the loss function to zero for a rich class of configurations that we call $(\mathsf{m}, \mathsf{b}_{\mathsf{rel}})$-Constellations. $(\mathsf{m}, \mathsf{b}_{\mathsf{rel}})$-Constellations are a novel combinatorial object related to spherical codes and are parametrized by a margin $\mathsf{m}$ and relative bias $\mathsf{b}_{\mathsf{rel}}$. We use our characterization of constellations to theoretically justify the success of SigLIP on retrieval, to explain the modality gap present in SigLIP, and to identify the necessary dimension for producing high-quality representations. Finally, we propose a reparameterization of the sigmoid loss with explicit relative bias, which improves training dynamics in experiments with synthetic data.

  _Qi Wang, Hanyang Peng, Yue Yu_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models enable scalable performance by activating large parameter sets sparsely, minimizing computational overhead. To circumvent the prohibitive cost of training MoEs from scratch, recent work employs upcycling, reusing a single pre-trained dense model by replicating its feed-forward network (FFN) layers into experts. However, this limits expert diversity, as all experts originate from a single pre-trained dense model. This paper addresses this limitation by constructing powerful MoE models using experts sourced from multiple identically-architected but disparate pre-trained models (e.g., Llama2-Chat and Code Llama). A key challenge lies in the fact that these source models occupy disparate, dissonant regions of the parameter space, making direct upcycling prone to severe performance degradation. To overcome this, we propose Symphony-MoE, a novel two-stage framework designed to harmonize these models into a single, coherent expert mixture. First, we establish this harmony in a training-free manner: we construct a shared backbone via a layer-aware fusion strategy and, crucially, alleviate parameter misalignment among experts using activation-based functional alignment. Subsequently, a single lightweight stage of router training coordinates the entire architecture. Experiments demonstrate that our method successfully integrates experts from heterogeneous sources, achieving an MoE model that significantly surpasses baselines in multi-domain tasks and out-of-distribution generalization.

  _Yuzhen Zhou, Jiajun Li, Yusheng Su, Gowtham Ramesh, Zilin Zhu, Xiang Long, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a cornerstone in advancing large-scale pre-trained language models (LLMs). Successive generations, including GPT-o series, DeepSeek-R1, Kimi-K1.5, Grok 4, and GLM-4.5, have relied on large-scale RL training to enhance reasoning and coding capabilities. To meet the community's growing RL needs, numerous RL frameworks have been proposed. Most of these frameworks primarily rely on inference engines for rollout generation and training engines for policy updates. However, RL training remains computationally expensive, with rollout generation accounting for more than 90% of total runtime. In addition, its efficiency is often constrained by the long-tail distribution of rollout response lengths, where a few lengthy responses stall entire batches, leaving GPUs idle and underutilized. As model and rollout sizes continue to grow, this bottleneck increasingly limits scalability. To address this challenge, we propose Active Partial Rollouts in Reinforcement Learning (APRIL), which mitigates long-tail inefficiency. In the rollout phase, APRIL over-provisions rollout requests, terminates once the target number of responses is reached, and recycles incomplete responses for continuation in future steps. This strategy ensures that no rollouts are discarded while substantially reducing GPU idle time. Experiments show that APRIL improves rollout throughput by at most 44% across commonly used RL algorithms (GRPO, DAPO, GSPO), accelerates convergence, and achieves at most 8% higher final accuracy across tasks. Moreover, APRIL is both framework and hardware agnostic, already integrated into the slime RL framework, and deployable on NVIDIA and AMD GPUs alike. Taken together, this work unifies system-level and algorithmic considerations in proposing APRIL, with the aim of advancing RL training efficiency and inspiring further optimizations in RL systems.

  Money laundering is a critical global issue for financial institutions. Automated Anti-money laundering (AML) models, like Graph Neural Networks (GNN), can be trained to identify illicit transactions in real time. A major issue for developing such models is the lack of access to training data due to privacy and confidentiality concerns. Synthetically generated data that mimics the statistical properties of real data but preserves privacy and confidentiality has been proposed as a solution. However, training AML models on purely synthetic datasets presents its own set of challenges. This article proposes the use of hybrid datasets to augment the utility of synthetic datasets by incorporating publicly available, easily accessible, and real-world features. These additions demonstrate that hybrid datasets not only preserve privacy but also improve model utility, offering a practical pathway for financial institutions to enhance AML systems.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper proposes GluMind, a transformer-based multimodal framework designed for continual and long-term blood glucose forecasting. GluMind devises two attention mechanisms, including cross-attention and multi-scale attention, which operate in parallel and deliver accurate predictive performance. Cross-attention effectively integrates blood glucose data with other physiological and behavioral signals such as activity, stress, and heart rate, addressing challenges associated with varying sampling rates and their adverse impacts on robust prediction. Moreover, the multi-scale attention mechanism captures long-range temporal dependencies. To mitigate catastrophic forgetting, GluMind incorporates a knowledge retention technique into the transformer-based forecasting model. The knowledge retention module not only enhances the model's ability to retain prior knowledge but also boosts its overall forecasting performance. We evaluate GluMind on the recently released AIREADI dataset, which contains behavioral and physiological data collected from healthy people, individuals with prediabetes, and those with type 2 diabetes. We examine the performance stability and adaptability of GluMind in learning continuously as new patient cohorts are introduced. Experimental results show that GluMind consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art forecasting models, achieving approximately 15% and 9% improvements in root mean squared error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE), respectively.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Utilizing offline reinforcement learning (RL) with real-world clinical data is getting increasing attention in AI for healthcare. However, implementation poses significant challenges. Defining direct rewards is difficult, and inverse RL (IRL) struggles to infer accurate reward functions from expert behavior in complex environments. Offline RL also encounters challenges in aligning learned policies with observed human behavior in healthcare applications. To address challenges in applying offline RL to physical activity promotion for older adults at high risk of falls, based on wearable sensor activity monitoring, we introduce Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks and Diffusion Policies for Offline Inverse Reinforcement Learning (KANDI). By leveraging the flexible function approximation in Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks, we estimate reward functions by learning free-living environment behavior from low-fall-risk older adults (experts), while diffusion-based policies within an Actor-Critic framework provide a generative approach for action refinement and efficiency in offline RL. We evaluate KANDI using wearable activity monitoring data in a two-arm clinical trial from our Physio-feedback Exercise Program (PEER) study, emphasizing its practical application in a fall-risk intervention program to promote physical activity among older adults. Additionally, KANDI outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the D4RL benchmark. These results underscore KANDI's potential to address key challenges in offline RL for healthcare applications, offering an effective solution for activity promotion intervention strategies in healthcare.

  Deep learning optimizers are optimization algorithms that enable deep neural networks to learn. The effectiveness of learning is highly dependent on the optimizer employed in the training process. Alongside the rapid advancement of deep learning, a wide range of optimizers with different approaches have been developed. This study aims to provide a review of various optimizers that have been proposed and received attention in the literature. From Stochastic gradient descent to the most recent ones such as Momentum, AdamW, Sophia, and Muon in chronological order, optimizers are examined individually, and their distinctive features are highlighted in the study. The update rule of each optimizer is presented in detail, with an explanation of the associated concepts and variables. The techniques applied by these optimizers, their contributions to the optimization process, and their default hyperparameter settings are also discussed. In addition, insights are offered into the open challenges encountered in the optimization of deep learning models. Thus, a comprehensive resource is provided both for understanding the current state of optimizers and for identifying potential areas of future development.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Typically, a modern reinforcement learning (RL) agent solves a task by updating its neural network parameters to adapt its policy to the task. Recently, it has been observed that some RL agents can solve a wide range of new out-of-distribution tasks without parameter updates after pretraining on some task distribution. When evaluated in a new task, instead of making parameter updates, the pretrained agent conditions its policy on additional input called the context, e.g., the agent's interaction history in the new task. The agent's performance increases as the information in the context increases, with the agent's parameters fixed. This phenomenon is typically called in-context RL (ICRL). The pretrained parameters of the agent network enable the remarkable ICRL phenomenon. However, many ICRL works perform the pretraining with standard RL algorithms. This raises the central question this paper aims to address: Why can the RL pretraining algorithm generate network parameters that enable ICRL? We hypothesize that the parameters capable of ICRL are minimizers of the pretraining loss. This work provides initial support for this hypothesis through a case study. In particular, we prove that when a Transformer is pretrained for policy evaluation, one of the global minimizers of the pretraining loss can enable in-context temporal difference learning.

  Trajectory anomaly detection is essential for identifying unusual and unexpected movement patterns in applications ranging from intelligent transportation systems to urban safety and fraud prevention.Existing methods only consider limited aspects of the trajectory nature and its movement space by treating trajectories as sequences of sampled locations, with sampling determined by positioning technology, e.g., GPS, or by high-level abstractions such as staypoints. Trajectories are analyzed in Euclidean space, neglecting the constraints and connectivity information of the underlying movement network, e.g., road or transit networks.The proposed Graph Enhanced Trajectory Anomaly Detection (GETAD) framework tightly integrates road network topology, segment semantics, and historical travel patterns to model trajectory data. GETAD uses a Graph Attention Network to learn road-aware embeddings that capture both physical attributes and transition behavior, and augments these with graph-based positional encodings that reflect the spatial layout of the road network.A Transformer-based decoder models sequential movement, while a multiobjective loss function combining autoregressive prediction and supervised link prediction ensures realistic and structurally coherent representations.To improve the robustness of anomaly detection, we introduce Confidence Weighted Negative Log Likelihood (CW NLL), an anomaly scoring function that emphasizes high-confidence deviations.Experiments on real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that GETAD achieves consistent improvements over existing methods, particularly in detecting subtle anomalies in road-constrained environments. These results highlight the benefits of incorporating graph structure and contextual semantics into trajectory modeling, enabling more precise and context-aware anomaly detection.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in distributed swarm learning (DSL) offer a promising paradigm for edge Internet of Things. Such advancements enhance data privacy, communication efficiency, energy saving, and model scalability. However, the presence of non-independent and identically distributed (non-i.i.d.) data pose a significant challenge for multi-access edge computing, degrading learning performance and diverging training behavior of vanilla DSL. Further, there still lacks theoretical guidance on how data heterogeneity affects model training accuracy, which requires thorough investigation. To fill the gap, this paper first study the data heterogeneity by measuring the impact of non-i.i.d. datasets under the DSL framework. This then motivates a new multi-worker selection design for DSL, termed M-DSL algorithm, which works effectively with distributed heterogeneous data. A new non-i.i.d. degree metric is introduced and defined in this work to formulate the statistical difference among local datasets, which builds a connection between the measure of data heterogeneity and the evaluation of DSL performance. In this way, our M-DSL guides effective selection of multiple works who make prominent contributions for global model updates. We also provide theoretical analysis on the convergence behavior of our M-DSL, followed by extensive experiments on different heterogeneous datasets and non-i.i.d. data settings. Numerical results verify performance improvement and network intelligence enhancement provided by our M-DSL beyond the benchmarks.

  As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly powerful, the sequential nature of autoregressive generation creates a fundamental throughput bottleneck that limits the practical deployment. While Multi-Token Prediction (MTP) has demonstrated remarkable benefits for model training efficiency and performance, its inherent potential for inference acceleration remains largely unexplored. This paper introduces FastMTP, a simple yet effective method that improves multi-step draft quality by aligning MTP training with its inference pattern, significantly enhancing speculative decoding performance. Our approach fine-tunes a single MTP head with position-shared weights on self-distilled data, enabling it to capture dependencies among consecutive future tokens and maintain high acceptance rates across multiple recursive draft steps. By integrating language-aware dynamic vocabulary compression into the MTP head, we further reduce computational overhead in the drafting process. Experimental results across seven diverse benchmarks demonstrate that FastMTP achieves an average of 2.03x speedup compared to standard next token prediction with lossless output quality, outperforming vanilla MTP by 82%. FastMTP requires only lightweight training and seamlessly integrates with existing inference frameworks, offering a practical and rapidly deployable solution for accelerating LLM inference.

  The size, diversity, and quality of pretraining datasets critically determine the generalization ability of foundation models. Despite their growing importance in chemoinformatics, the effectiveness of molecular representation learning has been hindered by limitations in existing small molecule datasets. To address this gap, we present MolPILE, large-scale, diverse, and rigorously curated collection of 222 million compounds, constructed from 6 large-scale databases using an automated curation pipeline. We present a comprehensive analysis of current pretraining datasets, highlighting considerable shortcomings for training ML models, and demonstrate how retraining existing models on MolPILE yields improvements in generalization performance. This work provides a standardized resource for model training, addressing the pressing need for an ImageNet-like dataset in molecular chemistry.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Task vectors capture how a model changes during fine-tuning by recording the difference between pre-trained and task-specific weights. The composition of task vectors, a key operator in task arithmetic, enables models to integrate knowledge from multiple tasks without incurring additional inference costs. In this paper, we propose variational task vector composition, where composition coefficients are taken as latent variables and estimated in a Bayesian inference framework. Unlike previous methods that operate at the task level, our framework focuses on sample-specific composition. Motivated by the observation of structural redundancy in task vectors, we introduce a Spike-and-Slab prior that promotes sparsity and preserves only the most informative components. To further address the high variance and sampling inefficiency in sparse, high-dimensional spaces, we develop a gated sampling mechanism that constructs a controllable posterior by filtering the composition coefficients based on both uncertainty and importance. This yields a more stable and interpretable variational framework by deterministically selecting reliable task components, reducing sampling variance while improving transparency and generalization. Experimental results demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing approaches across all datasets by selectively leveraging the most reliable and informative components in task vectors. These findings highlight the practical value of our approach, establishing a new standard for efficient and effective task vector composition.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Conversational agents must translate egocentric utterances (e.g., "on my right") into allocentric orientations (N/E/S/W). This challenge is particularly critical in indoor or complex facilities where GPS signals are weak and detailed maps are unavailable. While chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting has advanced reasoning in language and vision tasks, its application to multimodal spatial orientation remains underexplored. We introduce Conversational Orientation Reasoning (COR), a new benchmark designed for Traditional Chinese conversational navigation projected from real-world environments, addressing egocentric-to-allocentric reasoning in non-English and ASR-transcribed scenarios. We propose a multimodal chain-of-thought (MCoT) framework, which integrates ASR-transcribed speech with landmark coordinates through a structured three-step reasoning process: (1) extracting spatial relations, (2) mapping coordinates to absolute directions, and (3) inferring user orientation. A curriculum learning strategy progressively builds these capabilities on Taiwan-LLM-13B-v2.0-Chat, a mid-sized model representative of resource-constrained settings. Experiments show that MCoT achieves 100% orientation accuracy on clean transcripts and 98.1% with ASR transcripts, substantially outperforming unimodal and non-structured baselines. Moreover, MCoT demonstrates robustness under noisy conversational conditions, including ASR recognition errors and multilingual code-switching. The model also maintains high accuracy in cross-domain evaluation and resilience to linguistic variation, domain shift, and referential ambiguity. These findings highlight the potential of structured MCoT spatial reasoning as a path toward interpretable and resource-efficient embodied navigation.

  Humans can interpret geospatial information through natural language, while the geospatial cognition capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) remain underexplored. Prior research in this domain has been constrained by non-quantifiable metrics, limited evaluation datasets and unclear research hierarchies. Therefore, we propose a large-scale benchmark and conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the geospatial route cognition of LLMs. We create a large-scale evaluation dataset comprised of 36000 routes from 12 metropolises worldwide. Then, we introduce PathBuilder, a novel tool for converting natural language instructions into navigation routes, and vice versa, bridging the gap between geospatial information and natural language. Finally, we propose a new evaluation framework and metrics to rigorously assess 11 state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs on the task of route reversal. The benchmark reveals that LLMs exhibit limitation to reverse routes: most reverse routes neither return to the starting point nor are similar to the optimal route. Additionally, LLMs face challenges such as low robustness in route generation and high confidence for their incorrect answers. Code\ \&\ Data available here: \href{this https URL}{TurnBack.}

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  With the advent of large language models (LLMs), numerous Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) strategies have been proposed to alleviate deployment barriers created by their enormous parameter counts. Quantization achieves compression by limiting the number of representable points in the data. Therefore, the key to achieving efficient quantization is selecting the optimal combination of representation points, or codes, for the given data. Existing PTQ solutions adopt two major approaches to this problem: Round-To-Nearest (RTN)-based methods and codebook-based methods. RTN-based methods map LLM weights onto uniformly distributed integer grids, failing to account for the Gaussian-like weight distribution of LLM weights. Codebook-based methods mitigate this issue by constructing distribution-aware codebooks; however, they suffer from random and strided memory access patterns, resulting in degraded inference speed that is exacerbated by the limited size of GPU L1 cache. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel LLM quantization method, SBVR (Summation of BitVector Representation), that enables Gaussian-like code representation in a hardware-friendly manner for fast inference. SBVR maps weight values to non-uniform representation points whose distribution follows the actual distribution of LLM weights, enabling more accurate compression. Additionally, we design a custom CUDA kernel that allows matrix-vector multiplication directly in the SBVR format without decompression, thereby enabling high-performance execution of SBVR-compressed models. Our evaluations of SBVR on various models demonstrate state-of-the-art perplexity and accuracy benchmark performance while delivering a 2.21x- 3.04x end-to-end token-generation speedup over naive FP16 models in the 4-bit quantization regime.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Federated Graph Learning (FGL) under domain skew -- as observed on platforms such as \emph{Twitch Gamers} and multilingual \emph{Wikipedia} networks -- drives client models toward incompatible representations, rendering naive aggregation both unstable and ineffective. We find that the culprit is not the weighting scheme but the \emph{noisy gradient signal}: empirical analysis of baseline methods suggests that a vast majority of gradient dimensions can be dominated by domain-specific variance. We therefore shift focus from "aggregation-first" to a \emph{projection-first} strategy that denoises client updates \emph{before} they are combined. The proposed FedIA framework realises this \underline{I}mportance-\underline{A}ware idea through a two-stage, plug-and-play pipeline: (i) a server-side top-$\rho$ mask keeps only the most informative about 5% of coordinates, and (ii) a lightweight influence-regularised momentum weight suppresses outlier clients. FedIA adds \emph{no extra uplink traffic and only negligible server memory}, making it readily deployable. On both homogeneous (Twitch Gamers) and heterogeneous (Wikipedia) graphs, it yields smoother, more stable convergence and higher final accuracy than nine strong baselines. A convergence sketch further shows that dynamic projection maintains the optimal $\mathcal{O}(\sigma^{2}/\sqrt{T})$ rate.

  With the rapid development of mobile communication technologies, future mobile networks will offer vast services and resources for commuting, production, daily life, and entertainment. Accurate and efficient forecasting of mobile data (e.g., cell traffic, user behavior, channel quality) helps operators monitor network state changes, orchestrate wireless resources, and schedule infrastructure and users, thereby improving supply efficiency and service quality. However, current forecasting paradigms rely on customized designs with tailored models for exclusive data types. Such approaches increase complexity and deployment costs under large-scale, heterogeneous networks involving base stations, users, and channels. In this paper, we design a foundation model for mobile data forecasting, MobiGPT, with a unified structure capable of forecasting three data types: base station traffic, user app usage, and channel quality. We propose a soft-prompt learning method to help the model understand features of different data types, and introduce a temporal masking mechanism to guide the model through three forecasting tasks: short-term prediction, long-term prediction, and distribution generation, supporting diverse optimization scenarios. Evaluations on real-world datasets with over 100,000 samples show that MobiGPT achieves accurate multi-type forecasting. Compared to existing models, it improves forecasting accuracy by 27.37%, 20.08%, and 7.27%, reflecting strong generalization. Moreover, MobiGPT exhibits superior zero/few-shot performance in unseen scenarios, with over 21.51% improvement, validating its strong transferability as a foundation model.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) have emerged as a new architecture following auto regressive models. Their denoising process offers a powerful generative advantage, but they present significant challenges in learning and understanding numerically sensitive mathematical and order-sensitive logical tasks. Current training methods, including pre-training, fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning, focus primarily on improving general knowledge retention and reasoning abilities, but lack a comprehensive understanding of mathematical and logical patterns. We propose DSFT, a simple yet effective Diffusion SFT strategy, by adjusting the masking strategy and loss function, guiding models to understand mathematical and logical patterns. This strategy can be flexibly combined with pre-training, reinforcement learning, and other training methods. Validated on models such as LLaDA and Dream series, we prove that DSFT on small-scale data can achieve improvements of 5-10% and approximately 2% on mathematical and logical problems, respectively. This inspiring masking approach offers insights for future learning of specific patterns, which can be easily and efficiently combined with other training methods and applied to various dLLMs. Our code is publicly available atthis https URL

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We study last-mile delivery with one truck and one drone under explicit battery management: the drone flies at twice the truck speed; each sortie must satisfy an endurance budget; after every delivery the drone recharges on the truck before the next launch. We introduce a hybrid reinforcement learning (RL) solver that couples an ALNS-based truck tour (with 2/3-opt and Or-opt) with a small pointer/attention policy that schedules drone sorties. The policy decodes launch--serve--rendezvous triplets with hard feasibility masks for endurance and post-delivery recharge; a fast, exact timeline simulator enforces launch/recovery handling and computes the true makespan used by masked greedy/beam decoding. On Euclidean instances with $N{=}50$, $E{=}0.7$, and $R{=}0.1$, the method achieves an average makespan of \textbf{5.203}$\pm$0.093, versus \textbf{5.349}$\pm$0.038 for ALNS and \textbf{5.208}$\pm$0.124 for NN -- i.e., \textbf{2.73\%} better than ALNS on average and within \textbf{0.10\%} of NN. Per-seed, the RL scheduler never underperforms ALNS on the same instance and ties or beats NN on two of three seeds. A decomposition of the makespan shows the expected truck--wait trade-off across heuristics; the learned scheduler balances both to minimize the total completion time. We provide a config-first implementation with plotting and significance-test utilities to support replication.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Activation functions in neural networks are typically selected from a set of empirically validated, commonly used static functions such as ReLU, tanh, or sigmoid. However, by optimizing the shapes of a network's activation functions, we can train models that are more parameter-efficient and accurate by assigning more optimal activations to the neurons. In this paper, I present and compare 9 training methodologies to explore dual-optimization dynamics in neural networks with parameterized linear B-spline activation functions. The experiments realize up to 94% lower end model error rates in FNNs and 51% lower rates in CNNs compared to traditional ReLU-based models. These gains come at the cost of additional development and training complexity as well as end model latency.

  Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are undergoing rapid progress and represent the frontier of AI development. However, their training and inference efficiency have emerged as a core bottleneck in making MLLMs more accessible and scalable. To address the challenges, we present MiniCPM-V 4.5, an 8B parameter model designed for high efficiency and strong performance. We introduce three core improvements in model architecture, data strategy and training method: a unified 3D-Resampler model architecture for highly compact encoding over images and videos, a unified learning paradigm for document knowledge and text recognition without heavy data engineering, and a hybrid reinforcement learning strategy for proficiency in both short and long reasoning modes. Comprehensive experimental results in OpenCompass evaluation show that MiniCPM-V 4.5 surpasses widely used proprietary models such as GPT-4o-latest, and significantly larger open-source models such as Qwen2.5-VL 72B. Notably, the strong performance is achieved with remarkable efficiency. For example, on the widely adopted VideoMME benchmark, MiniCPM-V 4.5 achieves state-of-the-art performance among models under 30B size, using just 46.7\% GPU memory cost and 8.7\% inference time of Qwen2.5-VL 7B.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Well-log interpretation is fundamental for subsurface characterization but remains challenged by heterogeneous tool responses, noisy signals, and limited labels. We propose WLFM, a foundation model pretrained on multi-curve logs from 1200 wells, comprising three stages: tokenization of log patches into geological tokens, self-supervised pretraining with masked-token modeling and stratigraphy-aware contrastive learning, and multi-task adaptation with few-shot fine-tuning. WLFM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving 0.0041 MSE in porosity estimation and 74.13\% accuracy in lithology classification, while WLFM-Finetune further improves to 0.0038 MSE and 78.10\% accuracy. Beyond predictive accuracy, WLFM exhibits emergent layer-awareness, learns a reusable geological vocabulary, and reconstructs masked curves with reasonable fidelity, though systematic offsets are observed in shallow and ultra-deep intervals. Although boundary detection is not explicitly evaluated here, clustering analyses suggest strong potential for future extension. These results establish WLFM as a scalable, interpretable, and transferable backbone for geological AI, with implications for multi-modal integration of logs, seismic, and textual data.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Time-intensive performance evaluations significantly impede progress in Neural Architecture Search (NAS). To address this, neural predictors leverage surrogate models trained on proxy datasets, allowing for direct performance predictions for new architectures. However, these predictors often exhibit poor generalization due to their limited ability to capture intricate relationships among various architectures. In this paper, we propose HyperNAS, a novel neural predictor paradigm for enhancing architecture representation learning. HyperNAS consists of two primary components: a global encoding scheme and a shared hypernetwork. The global encoding scheme is devised to capture the comprehensive macro-structure information, while the shared hypernetwork serves as an auxiliary task to enhance the investigation of inter-architecture patterns. To ensure training stability, we further develop a dynamic adaptive multi-task loss to facilitate personalized exploration on the Pareto front. Extensive experiments across five representative search spaces, including ViTs, demonstrate the advantages of HyperNAS, particularly in few-shot scenarios. For instance, HyperNAS strikes new state-of-the-art results, with 97.60\% top-1 accuracy on CIFAR-10 and 82.4\% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet, using at least 5.0$\times$ fewer samples.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated outstanding performance across a variety of domains. However, training MLLMs is often inefficient due to the significantly longer input sequences introduced by multimodal data and the low utilization of inter-layer computations. To address this challenge, we shift the focus to the training process itself and propose a novel training-efficient framework based on sparse representations, termed the Sparse Training Scheme (STS). This scheme consists of two key components: the Visual Token Compressor, which reduces the information load by compressing visual tokens, and the Layer Dynamic Skipper, which mitigates the computational overhead by dynamically skipping unnecessary layers in the language model during both forward and backward passes. Our approach is broadly applicable to diverse MLLM architectures and has been extensively evaluated on multiple benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness and efficiency.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Concept-based interpretability for Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) aims to align internal model representations with high-level semantic concepts, but existing approaches largely overlook the semantic roles of individual filters and the dynamic propagation of concepts across layers. To address these limitations, we propose ConceptFlow, a concept-based interpretability framework that simulates the internal "thinking path" of a model by tracing how concepts emerge and evolve across layers. ConceptFlow comprises two key components: (i) concept attentions, which associate each filter with relevant high-level concepts to enable localized semantic interpretation, and (ii) conceptual pathways, derived from a concept transition matrix that quantifies how concepts propagate and transform between filters. Together, these components offer a unified and structured view of internal model reasoning. Experimental results demonstrate that ConceptFlow yields semantically meaningful insights into model reasoning, validating the effectiveness of concept attentions and conceptual pathways in explaining decision behavior. By modeling hierarchical conceptual pathways, ConceptFlow provides deeper insight into the internal logic of CNNs and supports the generation of more faithful and human-aligned explanations.

  Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients often present with complex, overlapping signs of physiological deterioration that require timely escalation of care. Traditional early warning systems, such as SOFA or MEWS, are limited by their focus on single outcomes and fail to capture the multi-dimensional nature of clinical decline. This study proposes a multi-label classification framework to predict Care Escalation Triggers (CETs), including respiratory failure, hemodynamic instability, renal compromise, and neurological deterioration, using the first 24 hours of ICU data. Using the MIMIC-IV database, CETs are defined through rule-based criteria applied to data from hours 24 to 72 (for example, oxygen saturation below 90, mean arterial pressure below 65 mmHg, creatinine increase greater than 0.3 mg/dL, or a drop in Glasgow Coma Scale score greater than 2). Features are extracted from the first 24 hours and include vital sign aggregates, laboratory values, and static demographics. We train and evaluate multiple classification models on a cohort of 85,242 ICU stays (80 percent training: 68,193; 20 percent testing: 17,049). Evaluation metrics include per-label precision, recall, F1-score, and Hamming loss. XGBoost, the best performing model, achieves F1-scores of 0.66 for respiratory, 0.72 for hemodynamic, 0.76 for renal, and 0.62 for neurologic deterioration, outperforming baseline models. Feature analysis shows that clinically relevant parameters such as respiratory rate, blood pressure, and creatinine are the most influential predictors, consistent with the clinical definitions of the CETs. The proposed framework demonstrates practical potential for early, interpretable clinical alerts without requiring complex time-series modeling or natural language processing.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Spatio-temporal data abounds in domain like traffic and environmental monitoring. However, it often suffers from missing values due to sensor malfunctions, transmission failures, etc. Recent years have seen continued efforts to improve spatio-temporal data imputation performance. Recently diffusion models have outperformed other approaches in various tasks, including spatio-temporal imputation, showing competitive performance. Extracting and utilizing spatio-temporal dependencies as conditional information is vital in diffusion-based methods. However, previous methods introduce error accumulation in this process and ignore the variability of the dependencies in the noisy data at different diffusion steps. In this paper, we propose AdaSTI (Adaptive Dependency Model in Diffusion-based Spatio-Temporal Imputation), a novel spatio-temporal imputation approach based on conditional diffusion model. Inside AdaSTI, we propose a BiS4PI network based on a bi-directional S4 model for pre-imputation with the imputed result used to extract conditional information by our designed Spatio-Temporal Conditionalizer (STC)network. We also propose a Noise-Aware Spatio-Temporal (NAST) network with a gated attention mechanism to capture the variant dependencies across diffusion steps. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets show that AdaSTI outperforms existing methods in all the settings, with up to 46.4% reduction in imputation error.

  Metabolic disorders, particularly type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), represent a significant global health burden, disproportionately impacting genetically predisposed populations such as the Pima Indians (a Native American tribe from south central Arizona). This study introduces a novel machine learning (ML) framework that integrates predictive modeling with gene-agnostic pathway mapping to identify high-risk individuals and uncover potential therapeutic targets. Using the Pima Indian dataset, logistic regression and t-tests were applied to identify key predictors of T2DM, yielding an overall model accuracy of 78.43%. To bridge predictive analytics with biological relevance, we developed a pathway mapping strategy that links identified predictors to critical signaling networks, including insulin signaling, AMPK, and PPAR pathways. This approach provides mechanistic insights without requiring direct molecular data. Building upon these connections, we propose therapeutic strategies such as dual GLP-1/GIP receptor agonists, AMPK activators, SIRT1 modulators, and phytochemical, further validated through pathway enrichment analyses. Overall, this framework advances precision medicine by offering interpretable and scalable solutions for early detection and targeted intervention in metabolic disorders. The key contributions of this work are: (1) development of an ML framework combining logistic regression and principal component analysis (PCA) for T2DM risk prediction; (2) introduction of a gene-agnostic pathway mapping approach to generate mechanistic insights; and (3) identification of novel therapeutic strategies tailored for high-risk populations.

  Recently, the demand for Machine Learning (ML) models that can balance accuracy, efficiency, and interpreability has grown significantly. Traditionally, there has been a tradeoff between accuracy and explainability in predictive models, with models such as Neural Networks achieving high accuracy on complex datasets while sacrificing internal transparency. As such, new rule-based algorithms such as FOLD-SE have been developed that provide tangible justification for predictions in the form of interpretable rule sets. The primary objective of this study was to compare FOLD-SE and FOLD-R++, both rule-based classifiers, in binary classification and evaluate how FOLD-SE performs against XGBoost, a widely used ensemble classifier, when applied to multi-category classification. We hypothesized that because FOLD-SE can generate a condensed rule set in a more explainable manner, it would lose upwards of an average of 3 percent in accuracy and F1 score when compared with XGBoost and FOLD-R++ in multiclass and binary classification, respectively. The research used data collections for classification, with accuracy, F1 scores, and processing time as the primary performance measures. Outcomes show that FOLD-SE is superior to FOLD-R++ in terms of binary classification by offering fewer rules but losing a minor percentage of accuracy and efficiency in processing time; in tasks that involve multi-category classifications, FOLD-SE is more precise and far more efficient compared to XGBoost, in addition to generating a comprehensible rule set. The results point out that FOLD-SE is a better choice for both binary tasks and classifications with multiple categories. Therefore, these results demonstrate that rule-based approaches like FOLD-SE can bridge the gap between explainability and performance, highlighting their potential as viable alternatives to black-box models in diverse classification tasks.

  We introduce a new algorithm, \emph{Rank-Induced Plackett--Luce Mirror Descent (RIPLM)}, which leverages the structural equivalence between the \emph{rank benchmark} and the \emph{distributional benchmark} established in \citet{BergamOzcanHsu2022}. Unlike prior approaches that operate on expert identities, RIPLM updates directly in the \emph{rank-induced Plackett--Luce (PL)} parameterization. This ensures that the algorithm's played distributions remain within the class of rank-induced distributions at every round, preserving the equivalence with the rank benchmark. To our knowledge, RIPLM is the first algorithm that is both (i) \emph{rank-faithful} and (ii) \emph{variance-adaptive} in the sleeping experts setting.

  As a parameter efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method, low-rank adaptation (LoRA) can save significant costs in storage and computing, but its strong adaptability to a single task is often accompanied by insufficient cross-task generalization capabilities. To improve this, existing work combines LoRA with mixture-of-experts (MoE) to enhance the model's adaptability through expert modules and routing mechanisms. However, existing LoRA-MoE methods lack unified standards in models, datasets, hyperparameters, and evaluation methods, making it difficult to conduct fair comparisons between different methods. To this end, we proposed a unified benchmark named LoRALib. Specifically, we standardized datasets from $40$ downstream tasks into a unified format, fine-tuned them using the same hyperparameters and obtained $680$ LoRA modules across $17$ model architectures. Based on this LoRA library, we conduct large-scale experiments on $3$ representative LoRA-MoE methods and different LoRA selection mechanisms using the open-sourced testing tool OpenCompass. Extensive experiments show that LoRAMoE performs best, and that prioritizing LoRAs relevant to the target task can further improve the performance of MoE. We hope these findings will inspire future work. Our datasets and LoRA library are available atthis https URLandthis https URL.

  Inter-series correlations are crucial for accurate multivariate time series forecasting, yet these relationships often exhibit complex dynamics across different temporal scales. Existing methods are limited in modeling these multi-scale dependencies and struggle to capture their intricate and evolving nature. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a novel Static-Dynamic Graph Fusion network (SDGF), whose core lies in capturing multi-scale inter-series correlations through a dual-path graph structure learning approach. Specifically, the model utilizes a static graph based on prior knowledge to anchor long-term, stable dependencies, while concurrently employing Multi-level Wavelet Decomposition to extract multi-scale features for constructing an adaptively learned dynamic graph to capture associations at different scales. We design an attention-gated module to fuse these two complementary sources of information intelligently, and a multi-kernel dilated convolutional network is then used to deepen the understanding of temporal patterns. Comprehensive experiments on multiple widely used real-world benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model.

To prevent transferring task-irrelevant noise through the shared pathway, we integrate a task-aware discriminator within a GAN. The discriminator encourages the shared expert to pass only task-aligned information during sequential training.

  It is shown that the weight matrices of transformer-based machine learning applications to the solution of two representative physical applications show a random-like character which bears no directly recognizable link to the physical and mathematical structure of the physical problem under study. This suggests that machine learning and the scientific method may represent two distinct and potentially complementary paths to knowledge, even though a strict notion of explainability in terms of direct correspondence between network parameters and physical structures may remain out of reach. It is also observed that drawing a parallel between transformer operation and (generalized) path-integration techniques may account for the random-like nature of the weights, but still does not resolve the tension with explainability. We conclude with some general comments on the hazards of gleaning knowledge without the benefit of Insight.

  Machine learning surrogates are increasingly employed to replace expensive computational models for physics-based reliability analysis. However, their use introduces epistemic uncertainty from model approximation errors, which couples with aleatory uncertainty in model inputs, potentially compromising the accuracy of reliability predictions. This study proposes a Gauss-Hermite quadrature approach to decouple these nested uncertainties and enable more accurate reliability analysis. The method evaluates conditional failure probabilities under aleatory uncertainty using First and Second Order Reliability Methods and then integrates these probabilities across realizations of epistemic uncertainty. Three examples demonstrate that the proposed approach maintains computational efficiency while yielding more trustworthy predictions than traditional methods that ignore model uncertainty.

  Increasing deployment of large language models (LLMs) in real-world applications raises significant safety concerns. Most existing safety research focuses on evaluating LLM outputs or specific safety tasks, limiting their ability to ad- dress broader, undefined risks. Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) facilitate interpretability research to clarify model behavior by explaining single-meaning atomic features decomposed from entangled signals. jHowever, prior applications on SAEs do not interpret features with fine-grained safety-related con- cepts, thus inadequately addressing safety-critical behaviors, such as generating toxic responses and violating safety regu- lations. For rigorous safety analysis, we must extract a rich and diverse set of safety-relevant features that effectively capture these high-risk behaviors, yet face two challenges: identifying SAEs with the greatest potential for generating safety concept-specific neurons, and the prohibitively high cost of detailed feature explanation. In this paper, we pro- pose Safe-SAIL, a framework for interpreting SAE features within LLMs to advance mechanistic understanding in safety domains. Our approach systematically identifies SAE with best concept-specific interpretability, explains safety-related neurons, and introduces efficient strategies to scale up the in- terpretation process. We will release a comprehensive toolkit including SAE checkpoints and human-readable neuron ex- planations, which supports empirical analysis of safety risks to promote research on LLM safety.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Federated Learning (FL) is a decentralized training framework widely used in IoT ecosystems that preserves privacy by keeping raw data local, making it ideal for IoT-enabled cyber-physical systems with sensing and communication like Smart Grids (SGs), Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAV), and Electric Vehicle Charging Stations (EVCS). With the rapid expansion of electric vehicle infrastructure, securing these IoT-based charging stations against cyber threats has become critical. Centralized Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) raise privacy concerns due to sensitive network and user data, making FL a promising alternative. However, current FL-based IDS evaluations overlook practical challenges such as system heterogeneity and non-IID data. To address these challenges, we conducted experiments to evaluate the performance of federated learning for anomaly detection in EV charging stations under system and data heterogeneity. We used FedAvg and FedAvgM, widely studied optimization approaches, to analyze their effectiveness in anomaly detection. Under IID settings, FedAvg achieves superior performance to centralized models using the same neural network. However, performance degrades with non-IID data and system heterogeneity. FedAvgM consistently outperforms FedAvg in heterogeneous settings, showing better convergence and higher anomaly detection accuracy. Our results demonstrate that FL can handle heterogeneity in IoT-based EVCS without significant performance loss, with FedAvgM as a promising solution for robust, privacy-preserving EVCS security.

  Healthcare systems face increasing pressure to allocate limited nursing resources efficiently while accounting for skill heterogeneity, patient acuity, staff fatigue, and continuity of care. Traditional optimization and heuristic scheduling methods struggle to capture these dynamic, multi-constraint environments. I propose NurseSchedRL, a reinforcement learning framework for nurse-patient assignment that integrates structured state encoding, constrained action masking, and attention-based representations of skills, fatigue, and geographical context. NurseSchedRL uses Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) with feasibility masks to ensure assignments respect real-world constraints, while dynamically adapting to patient arrivals and varying nurse availability. In simulation with realistic nurse and patient data, NurseSchedRL achieves improved scheduling efficiency, better alignment of skills to patient needs, and reduced fatigue compared to baseline heuristic and unconstrained RL approaches. These results highlight the potential of reinforcement learning for decision support in complex, high-stakes healthcare workforce management.

  Building general-purpose graphical user interface (GUI) agents has become increasingly promising with the progress in vision language models. However, developing effective mobile GUI agents with reinforcement learning (RL) remains challenging due to the heavy-tailed distribution of task difficulty and the inefficiency of large-scale environment sampling. We present an online agentic reinforcement learning framework MOBILERL to enhance GUI agents in mobile environments. Its core component is the Difficulty-Adaptive GRPO (ADAGRPO) algorithm. In ADAGRPO, we design difficulty-adaptive positive replay and failure curriculum filtering to adapt the model to different task difficulties. We introduce the shortest path reward adjustment strategy to reshape rewards concerning the task length in multi-turn agentic tasks. Those strategies jointly stabilize RL training, improve sample efficiency, and generate strong performance across diverse mobile apps and tasks. We apply MOBILERL to two open models (Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct and GLM-4.1V-9B-Base). The resultant MOBILERL-9B model achieves state-of-the-art results in terms of success rates on both AndroidWorld (75.8%) and AndroidLab (46.8%). The MOBILERL framework is adopted in the AutoGLM products, and also open-sourced atthis https URL.

  The paper presents a machine learning approach to design digital interfaces that can dynamically adapt to different users and usage strategies. The algorithm uses Bayesian statistics to model users' browsing behavior, focusing on their habits rather than group preferences. It is distinguished by its online incremental learning, allowing reliable predictions even with little data and in the case of a changing environment. This inference method generates a task model, providing a graphical representation of navigation with the usage statistics of the current user. The algorithm learns new tasks while preserving prior knowledge. The theoretical framework is described, and simulations show the effectiveness of the approach in stationary and non-stationary environments. In conclusion, this research paves the way for adaptive systems that improve the user experience by helping them to better navigate and act on their interface.

Latent space test-time optimization methods like LatentSeek offer a more direct approach by steering hidden representations, but still demand expensive per-query optimization loops with multiple backward passes. We propose Amortized Latent Steering (ALS), which collapses this iterative optimization into a single offline-computed vector applied at constant cost during inference. ALS computes the mean difference between hidden states from successful versus unsuccessful generations, then uses this direction to calibrate the model's hidden representations: when decoding drifts away from the success manifold, ALS nudges activations back toward it. Across GSM8K and MATH-$500$ benchmarks, ALS achieves $2$--$5\times$ speedup over iterative methods while matching or surpassing greedy Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Self-Consistency baselines, yielding up to 101\% improvement in efficiency--accuracy trade-off. These results show that much of latent optimization's benefit can be captured offline, making sophisticated reasoning techniques viable for production deployment.

  In this paper, we propose a novel Spatial Balance Attention block for spatiotemporal forecasting. To strike a balance between obeying spatial proximity and capturing global correlation, we partition the spatial graph into a set of subgraphs and instantiate Intra-subgraph Attention to learn local spatial correlation within each subgraph; to capture the global spatial correlation, we further aggregate the nodes to produce subgraph representations and achieve message passing among the subgraphs via Inter-subgraph Attention. Building on the proposed Spatial Balance Attention block, we develop a multiscale spatiotemporal forecasting model by progressively increasing the subgraph scales. The resulting model is both scalable and able to produce structured spatial correlation, and meanwhile, it is easy to implement. We evaluate its efficacy and efficiency against the existing models on real-world spatiotemporal datasets from medium to large sizes. The experimental results show that it can achieve performance improvements up to 7.7% over the baseline methods at low running costs.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Autoregressive inference in large transformer-based language models (LLMs) presents significant challenges for runtime efficiency, particularly during the decode phase where load imbalance across GPU shards can cause throughput degradation and latency spikes. A DPU-assisted framework leveraged by BlueField-3 Data Processing Units can enable real-time detection and mitigation of load imbalance in multi-node tensor-parallel inference. By offloading monitoring tasks to the DPU and analyzing GPU telemetry and inter-node communication patterns, the resulting system can provide actionable feedback to inference controllers and schedulers. The goal of this study is three-fold i) identify the reported skews/imbalances/pathological conditions that arise in muti-GPU execution of a) LLM tensor computing (both during training and inference), b) identify their impact on computational performance, and c) make a critical assessment if those can be tracked for potential mitigation from a DPU network.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Foundation models (FMs) and large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities across diverse domains through training on massive datasets. These models have demonstrated exceptional performance in healthcare applications, yet their potential for electronic fetal monitoring (EFM)/cardiotocography (CTG) analysis, a critical technology for evaluating fetal well-being, remains largely underexplored. Antepartum CTG interpretation presents unique challenges due to the complex nature of fetal heart rate (FHR) patterns and uterine activity, requiring sophisticated analysis of long time-series data. The assessment of CTG is heavily based on subjective clinical interpretation, often leading to variability in diagnostic accuracy and deviation from timely pregnancy care. This study presents the first comprehensive comparison of state-of-the-art AI approaches for automated antepartum CTG analysis. We systematically compare time-series FMs and LLMs against established CTG-specific architectures. Our evaluation encompasses over 500 CTG recordings of varying durations reflecting real-world clinical recordings, providing robust performance benchmarks across different modelling paradigms. Our results demonstrate that fine-tuned LLMs achieve superior performance compared to both foundation models and domain-specific approaches, offering a promising alternative pathway for clinical CTG interpretation. These findings provide critical insights into the relative strengths of different AI methodologies for fetal monitoring applications and establish a foundation for future clinical AI development in prenatal care.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The reliability of artificial intelligence (AI) systems in open-world settings depends heavily on their ability to flag out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs unseen during training. Recent advances in large-scale vision-language models (VLMs) have enabled promising few-shot OOD detection frameworks using only a handful of in-distribution (ID) samples. However, existing prompt learning-based OOD methods rely solely on softmax probabilities, overlooking the rich discriminative potential of the feature embeddings learned by VLMs trained on millions of samples. To address this limitation, we propose a novel context optimization (CoOp)-based framework that integrates subspace representation learning with prompt tuning. Our approach improves ID-OOD separability by projecting the ID features into a subspace spanned by prompt vectors, while projecting ID-irrelevant features into an orthogonal null space. To train such OOD detection framework, we design an easy-to-handle end-to-end learning criterion that ensures strong OOD detection performance as well as high ID classification accuracy. Experiments on real-world datasets showcase the effectiveness of our approach.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Neural operator learning has emerged as a powerful approach for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) in a data-driven manner. However, applying principal component analysis (PCA) to high-dimensional solution fields incurs significant computational overhead. To address this, we propose a patch-based PCA-Net framework that decomposes the solution fields into smaller patches, applies PCA within each patch, and trains a neural operator in the reduced PCA space. We investigate two different patch-based approaches that balance computational efficiency and reconstruction accuracy: (1) local-to-global patch PCA, and (2) local-to-local patch PCA. The trade-off between computational cost and accuracy is analyzed, highlighting the advantages and limitations of each approach. Furthermore, within each approach, we explore two refinements for the most computationally efficient method: (i) introducing overlapping patches with a smoothing filter and (ii) employing a two-step process with a convolutional neural network (CNN) for refinement. Our results demonstrate that patch-based PCA significantly reduces computational complexity while maintaining high accuracy, reducing end-to-end pipeline processing time by a factor of 3.7 to 4 times compared to global PCA, thefore making it a promising technique for efficient operator learning in PDE-based systems.

- **[Machine Learning-Based Classification of Vessel Types in Straits Using AIS Tracks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18109)**  `arXiv:2509.18109`  
  _Jonatan Katz Nielsen_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Accurate recognition of vessel types from Automatic Identification System (AIS) tracks is essential for safety oversight and combating illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) activity. This paper presents a strait-scale, machine-learning pipeline that classifies moving vessels using only AIS data. We analyze eight days of historical AIS from the Danish Maritime Authority covering the Bornholm Strait in the Baltic Sea (January 22-30, 2025). After forward/backward filling voyage records, removing kinematic and geospatial outliers, and segmenting per-MMSI tracks while excluding stationary periods ($\ge 1$ h), we derive 31 trajectory-level features spanning kinematics (e.g., SOG statistics), temporal, geospatial (Haversine distances, spans), and ship-shape attributes computed from AIS A/B/C/D reference points (length, width, aspect ratio, bridge-position ratio). To avoid leakage, we perform grouped train/test splits by MMSI and use stratified 5-fold cross-validation. Across five classes (cargo, tanker, passenger, high-speed craft, fishing; N=1{,}910 trajectories; test=382), tree-based models dominate: a Random Forest with SMOTE attains 92.15% accuracy (macro-precision 94.11%, macro-recall 92.51%, macro-F1 93.27%) on the held-out test set, while a tuned RF reaches one-vs-rest ROC-AUC up to 0.9897. Feature-importance analysis highlights the bridge-position ratio and maximum SOG as the most discriminative signals; principal errors occur between cargo and tanker, reflecting similar transit behavior. We demonstrate operational value by backfilling missing ship types on unseen data and discuss improvements such as DBSCAN based trip segmentation and gradient-boosted ensembles to handle frequent-stop ferries and further lift performance. The results show that lightweight features over AIS trajectories enable real-time vessel type classification in straits.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multivariate time series forecasting involves predicting future values based on historical observations. However, existing approaches primarily rely on predefined single-scale patches or lack effective mechanisms for multi-scale feature fusion. These limitations hinder them from fully capturing the complex patterns inherent in time series, leading to constrained performance and insufficient generalizability. To address these challenges, we propose a novel architecture named Adaptive Weighted Mixture of Multi-Scale Expert Transformers (AdaMixT). Specifically, AdaMixT introduces various patches and leverages both General Pre-trained Models (GPM) and Domain-specific Models (DSM) for multi-scale feature extraction. To accommodate the heterogeneity of temporal features, AdaMixT incorporates a gating network that dynamically allocates weights among different experts, enabling more accurate predictions through adaptive multi-scale fusion. Comprehensive experiments on eight widely used benchmarks, including Weather, Traffic, Electricity, ILI, and four ETT datasets, consistently demonstrate the effectiveness of AdaMixT in real-world scenarios.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The growing use of permanent monitoring systems has increased data availability, offering new opportunities for structural assessment but also posing scalability challenges, especially across large bridge networks. Managing multiple structures requires tracking and comparing long-term behaviour efficiently. To address this, knowledge transfer between similar structures becomes essential. This study proposes a model-based transfer learning approach using neural network surrogate models, enabling a model trained on one bridge to be adapted to another with similar characteristics. These models capture shared damage mechanisms, supporting a scalable and generalizable monitoring framework. The method was validated using real data from two bridges. The transferred model was integrated into a Bayesian inference framework for continuous damage assessment based on modal features from monitoring data. Results showed high sensitivity to damage location, severity, and extent. This approach enhances real-time monitoring and enables cross-structure knowledge transfer, promoting smart monitoring strategies and improved resilience at the network level.

  _Nachiket N. Naik, Prathamesh Dinesh Joshi, Raj Abhijit Dandekar, Rajat Dandekar, Sreedath Panat_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We study learning of continuous-time inventory dynamics under stochastic demand and quantify when structure helps or hurts forecasting of the bullwhip effect. BULL-ODE compares a fully learned Neural ODE (NODE) that models the entire right-hand side against a physics-informed Universal Differential Equation (UDE) that preserves conservation and order-up-to structure while learning a small residual policy term. Classical supply chain models explain the bullwhip through control/forecasting choices and information sharing, while recent physics-informed and neural differential equation methods blend domain constraints with learned components. It is unclear whether structural bias helps or hinders forecasting under different demand regimes. We address this by using a single-echelon testbed with three demand regimes - AR(1) (autocorrelated), i.i.d. Gaussian, and heavy-tailed lognormal. Training is done on varying fractions of each trajectory, followed by evaluation of multi-step forecasts for inventory I, order rate O, and demand D. Across the structured regimes, UDE consistently generalizes better: with 90% of the training horizon, inventory RMSE drops from 4.92 (NODE) to 0.26 (UDE) under AR(1) and from 5.96 to 0.95 under Gaussian demand. Under heavy-tailed lognormal shocks, the flexibility of NODE is better. These trends persist as train18 ing data shrinks, with NODE exhibiting phase drift in extrapolation while UDE remains stable but underreacts to rare spikes. Our results provide concrete guidance: enforce structure when noise is light-tailed or temporally correlated; relax structure when extreme events dominate. Beyond inventory control, the results offer guidance for hybrid modeling in scientific and engineering systems: enforce known structure when conservation laws and modest noise dominate, and relax structure to capture extremes in settings where rare events drive dynamics.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In the era of Artificial Intelligence (AI), marketplaces have become essential platforms for facilitating the exchange of data products to foster data sharing. Model transactions provide economic solutions in data marketplaces that enhance data reusability and ensure the traceability of data ownership. To establish trustworthy data marketplaces, Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising paradigm to enable collaborative learning across siloed datasets while safeguarding data privacy. However, effective data valuation and selection from heterogeneous sources in the FL setup remain key challenges. This paper introduces a comprehensive framework centered on a Wasserstein-based estimator tailored for FL. The estimator not only predicts model performance across unseen data combinations but also reveals the compatibility between data heterogeneity and FL aggregation algorithms. To ensure privacy, we propose a distributed method to approximate Wasserstein distance without requiring access to raw data. Furthermore, we demonstrate that model performance can be reliably extrapolated under the neural scaling law, enabling effective data selection without full-scale training. Extensive experiments across diverse scenarios, such as label skew, mislabeled, and unlabeled sources, show that our approach consistently identifies high-performing data combinations, paving the way for more reliable FL-based model marketplaces.

  _Richard Cornelius Suwandi, Feng Yin, Juntao Wang, Renjie Li, Tsung-Hui Chang, Sergios Theodoridis_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The efficiency of Bayesian optimization (BO) relies heavily on the choice of the Gaussian process (GP) kernel, which plays a central role in balancing exploration and exploitation under limited evaluation budgets. Traditional BO methods often rely on fixed or heuristic kernel selection strategies, which can result in slow convergence or suboptimal solutions when the chosen kernel is poorly suited to the underlying objective function. To address this limitation, we propose a freshly-baked Context-Aware Kernel Evolution (CAKE) to enhance BO with large language models (LLMs). Concretely, CAKE leverages LLMs as the crossover and mutation operators to adaptively generate and refine GP kernels based on the observed data throughout the optimization process. To maximize the power of CAKE, we further propose BIC-Acquisition Kernel Ranking (BAKER) to select the most effective kernel through balancing the model fit measured by the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) with the expected improvement at each iteration of BO. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our fresh CAKE-based BO method consistently outperforms established baselines across a range of real-world tasks, including hyperparameter optimization, controller tuning, and photonic chip design.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Deep neural networks (DNNs) have been widely applied in diverse applications, but the problems of high latency and energy overhead are inevitable on resource-constrained devices. To address this challenge, most researchers focus on the dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) technique to balance the latency and energy consumption by changing the computing frequency of processors. However, the adjustment of memory frequency is usually ignored and not fully utilized to achieve efficient DNN inference, which also plays a significant role in the inference time and energy consumption. In this paper, we first investigate the impact of joint memory frequency and computing frequency scaling on the inference time and energy consumption with a model-based and data-driven method. Then by combining with the fitting parameters of different DNN models, we give a preliminary analysis for the proposed model to see the effects of adjusting memory frequency and computing frequency simultaneously. Finally, simulation results in local inference and cooperative inference cases further validate the effectiveness of jointly scaling the memory frequency and computing frequency to reduce the energy consumption of devices.

  Efficient inference is a critical challenge in deep generative modeling, particularly as diffusion models grow in capacity and complexity.

This work investigates techniques such as pruning, quantization, knowledge distillation, and simplified attention to reduce computational overhead without impacting performance. The study also explores the Mixture of Experts (MoE) approach to further enhance efficiency. These experiments provide insights into optimizing inference for the state-of-the-art Fast Diffusion Transformer (fast-DiT) model.

  Multimodal intent recognition (MMIR) suffers from weak semantic grounding and poor robustness under noisy or rare-class conditions.

On MIntRec and MIntRec2.0, MVCL-DAF++ achieves new state-of-the-art results, improving rare-class recognition by +1.05\% and +4.18\% WF1, respectively. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of prototype-guided learning and coarse-to-fine fusion for robust multimodal understanding. The source code is available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The sliced Wasserstein distance (SW) reduces optimal transport on $\mathbb{R}^d$ to a sum of one-dimensional projections, and thanks to this efficiency, it is widely used in geometry, generative modeling, and registration tasks. Recent work shows that quasi-Monte Carlo constructions for computing SW (QSW) yield direction sets with excellent approximation error. This paper presents an alternate, novel approach: learning directions with Bayesian optimization (BO), particularly in settings where SW appears inside an optimization loop (e.g., gradient flows). We introduce a family of drop-in selectors for projection directions: BOSW, a one-shot BO scheme on the unit sphere; RBOSW, a periodic-refresh variant; ABOSW, an adaptive hybrid that seeds from competitive QSW sets and performs a few lightweight BO refinements; and ARBOSW, a restarted hybrid that periodically relearns directions during optimization. Our BO approaches can be composed with QSW and its variants (demonstrated by ABOSW/ARBOSW) and require no changes to downstream losses or gradients. We provide numerical experiments where our methods achieve state-of-the-art performance, and on the experimental suite of the original QSW paper, we find that ABOSW and ARBOSW can achieve convergence comparable to the best QSW variants with modest runtime overhead.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Performative prediction (PP) is an algorithmic framework for optimizing machine learning (ML) models where the model's deployment affects the distribution of the data it is trained on. Compared to traditional ML with fixed data, designing algorithms in PP converging to a stable point -- known as a stationary performative stable (SPS) solution -- is more challenging than the counterpart in conventional ML tasks due to the model-induced distribution shifts. While considerable efforts have been made to find SPS solutions using methods such as repeated gradient descent (RGD) and greedy stochastic gradient descent (SGD-GD), most prior studies assumed a strongly convex loss until a recent work established $O(1/\sqrt{T})$ convergence of SGD-GD to SPS solutions under smooth, non-convex losses. However, this latest progress is still based on the restricted bounded variance assumption in stochastic gradient estimates and yields convergence bounds with a non-vanishing error neighborhood that scales with the variance. This limitation motivates us to improve convergence rates and reduce error in stochastic optimization for PP, particularly in non-convex settings. Thus, we propose a new algorithm called stochastic performative prediction with variance reduction (SPRINT) and establish its convergence to an SPS solution at a rate of $O(1/T)$. Notably, the resulting error neighborhood is independent of the variance of the stochastic gradients. Experiments on multiple real datasets with non-convex models demonstrate that SPRINT outperforms SGD-GD in both convergence rate and stability.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Attention mechanisms in Transformers have gained significant empirical success. Nonetheless, the optimization objectives underlying their forward pass are still unclear. Additionally, the quadratic complexity of self-attention is increasingly prohibitive. Unlike the prior work on addressing the interpretability or efficiency issue separately, we propose a unified optimization objective to alleviate both issues simultaneously. By unrolling the optimization over the objective, we derive an inherently interpretable and efficient attention mechanism, which compresses all tokens into low-dimensional structures by contracting a few representative tokens and then broadcasting the contractions back. This Contract-and-Broadcast Self-Attention (CBSA) mechanism can not only scale linearly but also generalize existing attention mechanisms as its special cases. Experiments further demonstrate comparable performance and even superior advantages of CBSA on several visual tasks. Code is available at this https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this paper, we introduce a novel weighted co-training approach that is guided by Large Language Models (LLMs). Namely, in our co-training approach, we use LLM labels on unlabeled data as target labels and co-train two encoder-only based networks that train each other over multiple iterations: first, all samples are forwarded through each network and historical estimates of each network's confidence in the LLM label are recorded; second, a dynamic importance weight is derived for each sample according to each network's belief in the quality of the LLM label for that sample; finally, the two networks exchange importance weights with each other -- each network back-propagates all samples weighted with the importance weights coming from its peer network and updates its own parameters. By strategically utilizing LLM-generated guidance, our approach significantly outperforms conventional SSL methods, particularly in settings with abundant unlabeled data. Empirical results show that it achieves state-of-the-art performance on 4 out of 5 benchmark datasets and ranks first among 14 compared methods according to the Friedman test. Our results highlight a new direction in semi-supervised learning -- where LLMs serve as knowledge amplifiers, enabling backbone co-training models to achieve state-of-the-art performance efficiently.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We investigate imbalanced regression with tabular data that have an imbalance ratio larger than 1,000 ("highly imbalanced"). Accurately estimating the target values of rare instances is important in applications such as forecasting the intensity of rare harmful Solar Energetic Particle (SEP) events. For regression, the MSE loss does not consider the correlation between predicted and actual values. Typical inverse importance functions allow only convex functions. Uniform sampling might yield mini-batches that do not have rare instances. We propose CISIR that incorporates correlation, Monotonically Decreasing Involution (MDI) importance, and stratified sampling. Based on five datasets, our experimental results indicate that CISIR can achieve lower error and higher correlation than some recent methods. Also, adding our correlation component to other recent methods can improve their performance. Lastly, MDI importance can outperform other importance functions. Our code can be found inthis https URL.

  Hyper-parameter Tuning (HPT) is a necessary step in machine learning (ML) pipelines but becomes computationally expensive and opaque with larger models. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been explored for HPT, yet most rely on models exceeding 100 billion parameters. We propose an Expert Block Framework for HPT using Small LLMs. At its core is the Trajectory Context Summarizer (TCS), a deterministic block that transforms raw training trajectories into structured context, enabling small LLMs to analyze optimization progress with reliability comparable to larger models. Using two locally-run LLMs (phi4:reasoning14B and qwen2.5-coder:32B) and a 10-trial budget, our TCS-enabled HPT pipeline achieves average performance within ~0.9 percentage points of GPT-4 across six diverse tasks.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Federated Learning (FL) offers a decentralized solution that allows collaborative local model training and global aggregation, thereby protecting data privacy. In conventional FL frameworks, data privacy is typically preserved under the assumption that local data remains absolutely private, whereas the mobility of clients is frequently neglected in explicit modeling. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical federated learning framework based on the social network with mobility namely HFL-SNM that considers both data sharing among clients and their mobility patterns. Under the constraints of limited resources, we formulate a joint optimization problem of resource allocation and client scheduling, which objective is to minimize the energy consumption of clients during the FL process. In social network, we introduce the concepts of Effective Data Coverage Rate and Redundant Data Coverage Rate. We analyze the impact of effective data and redundant data on the model performance through preliminary experiments. We decouple the optimization problem into multiple sub-problems, analyze them based on preliminary experimental results, and propose Dynamic Optimization in Social Network with Mobility (DO-SNM) algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm achieves superior model performance while significantly reducing energy consumption, compared to traditional baseline algorithms.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Ensuring fairness in machine learning models is critical, especially when biases compound across intersecting protected attributes like race, gender, and age. While existing methods address fairness for single attributes, they fail to capture the nuanced, multiplicative biases faced by intersectional subgroups. We introduce Adaptive Pareto Front Explorer (APFEx), the first framework to explicitly model intersectional fairness as a joint optimization problem over the Cartesian product of sensitive attributes. APFEx combines three key innovations- (1) an adaptive multi-objective optimizer that dynamically switches between Pareto cone projection, gradient weighting, and exploration strategies to navigate fairness-accuracy trade-offs, (2) differentiable intersectional fairness metrics enabling gradient-based optimization of non-smooth subgroup disparities, and (3) theoretical guarantees of convergence to Pareto-optimal solutions. Experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate APFEx's superiority, reducing fairness violations while maintaining competitive accuracy. Our work bridges a critical gap in fair ML, providing a scalable, model-agnostic solution for intersectional fairness.

  _Wenbo Lu, Shaoyi Zheng, Yuxuan Xia, Shengjie Wang_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Diffusion models excel in high-fidelity image generation but face scalability limits due to transformers' quadratic attention complexity. Plug-and-play token reduction methods like ToMeSD and ToFu reduce FLOPs by merging redundant tokens in generated images but rely on GPU-inefficient operations (e.g., sorting, scattered writes), introducing overheads that negate theoretical speedups when paired with optimized attention implementations (e.g., FlashAttention). To bridge this gap, we propose Token Merge with Attention (ToMA), an off-the-shelf method that redesigns token reduction for GPU-aligned efficiency, with three key contributions: 1) a reformulation of token merge as a submodular optimization problem to select diverse tokens; 2) merge/unmerge as an attention-like linear transformation via GPU-friendly matrix operations; and 3) exploiting latent locality and sequential redundancy (pattern reuse) to minimize overhead. ToMA reduces SDXL/Flux generation latency by 24%/23%, respectively (with DINO $\Delta < 0.07$), outperforming prior methods. This work bridges the gap between theoretical and practical efficiency for transformers in diffusion.

  _Sahil Rajesh Dhayalkar_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present a formal and constructive theory showing that probabilistic finite automata (PFAs) can be exactly simulated using symbolic feedforward neural networks. Our architecture represents state distributions as vectors and transitions as stochastic matrices, enabling probabilistic state propagation via matrix-vector products. This yields a parallel, interpretable, and differentiable simulation of PFA dynamics using soft updates-without recurrence. We formally characterize probabilistic subset construction, $\varepsilon$-closure, and exact simulation via layered symbolic computation, and prove equivalence between PFAs and specific classes of neural networks. We further show that these symbolic simulators are not only expressive but learnable: trained with standard gradient descent-based optimization on labeled sequence data, they recover the exact behavior of ground-truth PFAs. This learnability, formalized in Proposition 5.1, is the crux of this work. Our results unify probabilistic automata theory with neural architectures under a rigorous algebraic framework, bridging the gap between symbolic computation and deep learning.

  _Hanyi Mao, Quanjia Xiao, Lei Pang, Haixiao Liu_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We propose FSPO (Fair Sequence Policy Optimization), a sequence-level reinforcement learning method for LLMs that enforces length-fair clipping on the importance-sampling (IS) weight. We study RL methods with sequence-level IS and identify a mismatch when PPO/GRPO-style clipping is transplanted to sequences: a fixed clip range systematically reweights short vs.\ long responses, distorting the optimization direction. FSPO introduces a simple remedy: we clip the sequence log-IS ratio with a band that scales as $\sqrt{L}$. Theoretically, we formalize length fairness via a Length Reweighting Error (LRE) and prove that small LRE yields a cosine directional guarantee between the clipped and true updates. Empirically, FSPO flattens clip rates across length bins, stabilizes training, and outperforms all baselines across multiple evaluation datasets on Qwen3-8B-Base model.

  _Xiaolong Luo, Michael Lingzhi Li_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  While existing critical care EHR datasets such as MIMIC and eICU have enabled significant advances in clinical AI research, the CRITICAL dataset opens new frontiers by providing extensive scale and diversity -- containing 1.95 billion records from 371,365 patients across four geographically diverse CTSA institutions. CRITICAL's unique strength lies in capturing full-spectrum patient journeys, including pre-ICU, ICU, and post-ICU encounters across both inpatient and outpatient settings. This multi-institutional, longitudinal perspective creates transformative opportunities for developing generalizable predictive models and advancing health equity research. However, the richness of this multi-site resource introduces substantial complexity in data harmonization, with heterogeneous collection practices and diverse vocabulary usage patterns requiring sophisticated preprocessing approaches.We present CRISP to unlock the full potential of this valuable resource. CRISP systematically transforms raw Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model data into ML-ready datasets through: (1) transparent data quality management with comprehensive audit trails, (2) cross-vocabulary mapping of heterogeneous medical terminologies to unified SNOMED-CT standards, with deduplication and unit standardization, (3) modular architecture with parallel optimization enabling complete dataset processing in $<$1 day even on standard computing hardware, and (4) comprehensive baseline model benchmarks spanning multiple clinical prediction tasks to establish reproducible performance standards. By providing processing pipeline, baseline implementations, and detailed transformation documentation, CRISP saves researchers months of preprocessing effort and democratizes access to large-scale multi-institutional critical care data, enabling them to focus on advancing clinical AI.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Foundation models have demonstrated remarkable performance across a wide range of tasks, yet their large parameter sizes pose challenges for practical deployment, especially in decentralized environments. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), reduces local computing and memory overhead, making it attractive for federated learning. However, existing federated LoRA methods typically assume uniform rank configurations and unimodal inputs, overlooking two key real-world challenges: (1) heterogeneous client resources have different LoRA ranks, and (2) multimodal data settings with potentially missing modalities. In this work, we propose FediLoRA, a simple yet effective framework for federated multimodal fine-tuning under heterogeneous LoRA ranks and missing modalities. FediLoRA introduces a dimension-wise aggregation strategy that reweights LoRA updates without information dilution during aggregation. It also includes a lightweight layer-wise model editing method that selectively incorporates global parameters to repair local components which improves both client and global model performances. Experimental results on three multimodal benchmark datasets demonstrate that FediLoRA achieves superior performance over competitive baselines in both global and personalized settings, particularly in the presence of modality incompleteness.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Modeling long-range interactions, the propagation of information across distant parts of a graph, is a central challenge in graph machine learning. Graph wavelets, inspired by multi-resolution signal processing, provide a principled way to capture both local and global structures. However, existing wavelet-based graph neural networks rely on finite-order polynomial approximations, which limit their receptive fields and hinder long-range propagation. We propose Long-Range Graph Wavelet Networks (LR-GWN), which decompose wavelet filters into complementary local and global components. Local aggregation is handled with efficient low-order polynomials, while long-range interactions are captured through a flexible spectral-domain parameterization. This hybrid design unifies short- and long-distance information flow within a principled wavelet framework. Experiments show that LR-GWN achieves state-of-the-art performance among wavelet-based methods on long-range benchmarks, while remaining competitive on short-range datasets.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  While foundation models have revolutionized such fields as natural language processing and computer vision, their potential in graph machine learning remains largely unexplored. One of the key challenges in designing graph foundation models (GFMs) is handling diverse node features that can vary across different graph datasets. While many works on GFMs have focused exclusively on text-attributed graphs, the problem of handling arbitrary features of other types in GFMs has not been fully addressed. However, this problem is not unique to the graph domain, as it also arises in the field of machine learning for tabular data. In this work, motivated by the recent success of tabular foundation models (TFMs) like TabPFNv2 or LimiX, we propose G2T-FM, a simple framework for turning tabular foundation models into graph foundation models. Specifically, G2T-FM augments the original node features with neighborhood feature aggregation, adds structural embeddings, and then applies a TFM to the constructed node representations. Even in a fully in-context regime, our model achieves strong results, significantly outperforming publicly available GFMs and performing competitively with, and often better than, well-tuned GNNs trained from scratch. Moreover, after finetuning, G2T-FM surpasses well-tuned GNN baselines. In particular, when combined with LimiX, G2T-FM often outperforms the best GNN by a significant margin. In summary, our paper reveals the potential of a previously overlooked direction of utilizing tabular foundation models for graph machine learning tasks.

  _Robert Yang_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Bold claims about AI's role in science-from "AGI will cure all diseases" to promises of radically accelerated discovery-raise a central epistemic question: do large language models (LLMs) truly generate new knowledge, or do they merely remix memorized fragments? We propose unlearning-as-ablation as a falsifiable probe of constructive scientific discovery. The idea is to systematically remove a target result together with its forget-closure (supporting lemmas, paraphrases, and multi-hop entailments) and then evaluate whether the model can re-derive the result from only permitted axioms and tools. Success would indicate generative capability beyond recall; failure would expose current limits. Unlike prevailing motivations for unlearning-privacy, copyright, or safety-our framing repositions it as an epistemic probe for AI-for-Science. We outline a minimal pilot in mathematics and algorithms to illustrate feasibility, and sketch how the same approach could later be extended to domains such as physics or chemistry. This is a position paper: our contribution is conceptual and methodological, not empirical. We aim to stimulate discussion on how principled ablation tests could help distinguish models that reconstruct knowledge from those that merely retrieve it, and how such probes might guide the next generation of AI-for-Science benchmarks.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly improved reasoning capabilities, with in-context learning (ICL) emerging as a key technique for adaptation without retraining. While previous works have focused on leveraging correct examples, recent research highlights the importance of learning from errors to enhance performance. However, existing methods lack a structured framework for analyzing and mitigating errors, particularly in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), where integrating visual and textual inputs adds complexity. To address this issue, we propose REFINE: Retrieval-Enhanced Feedback via In-context Neural Error-book, a teacher-student framework that systematically structures errors and provides targeted feedback. REFINE introduces three systematic queries to construct structured feedback -- Feed-Target, Feed-Check, and Feed-Path -- to enhance multimodal reasoning by prioritizing relevant visual information, diagnosing critical failure points, and formulating corrective actions. Unlike prior approaches that rely on redundant retrievals, REFINE optimizes structured feedback retrieval, improving inference efficiency, token usage, and scalability. Our results demonstrate substantial speedup, reduced computational costs, and successful generalization, highlighting REFINE's potential for enhancing multimodal reasoning.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Rapid scaling of deep learning models has enabled performance gains across domains, yet it introduced several challenges. Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising framework to address these concerns by enabling decentralized training. Nevertheless, communication efficiency remains a key bottleneck in FL, particularly under heterogeneous and dynamic client participation. Existing methods, such as FedAvg and FedProx, or other approaches, including client selection strategies, attempt to mitigate communication costs. However, the problem of choosing the number of clients in a training round remains extremely underexplored. We introduce Intelligent Selection of Participants (ISP), an adaptive mechanism that dynamically determines the optimal number of clients per round to enhance communication efficiency without compromising model accuracy. We validate the effectiveness of ISP across diverse setups, including vision transformers, real-world ECG classification, and training with gradient compression. Our results show consistent communication savings of up to 30\% without losing the final quality. Applying ISP to different real-world ECG classification setups highlighted the selection of the number of clients as a separate task of federated learning.

  Realizing personalized medicine at scale calls for methods that distill insights from longitudinal patient journeys, which can be viewed as a sequence of medical events. Foundation models pretrained on large-scale medical event data represent a promising direction for scaling real-world evidence generation and generalizing to diverse downstream tasks. Using Epic Cosmos, a dataset with medical events from de-identified longitudinal health records for 16.3 billion encounters over 300 million unique patient records from 310 health systems, we introduce the Comet models, a family of decoder-only transformer models pretrained on 118 million patients representing 115 billion discrete medical events (151 billion tokens). We present the largest scaling-law study of medical event data, establishing a methodology for pretraining and revealing power-law scaling relationships for compute, tokens, and model size. Consequently, we pretrained a series of compute-optimal models with up to 1 billion parameters. Conditioned on a patient's real-world history, Comet autoregressively predicts the next medical event to simulate patient health timelines. We studied 78 real-world tasks, including diagnosis prediction, disease prognosis, and healthcare operations. Remarkably for a foundation model with generic pretraining and simulation-based inference, Comet generally outperformed or matched task-specific supervised models on these tasks, without requiring task-specific fine-tuning or few-shot examples. Comet's predictive power consistently improves as the model and pretraining scale. Our results show that Comet, a generative medical event foundation model, can effectively capture complex clinical dynamics, providing an extensible and generalizable framework to support clinical decision-making, streamline healthcare operations, and improve patient outcomes.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reinforcement learning with verifiable reward (RLVR) has become a promising paradigm for post-training large language models (LLMs) to improve their reasoning capability. However, when the rollout accuracy is low on hard problems, the reward becomes sparse, limiting learning efficiency and causing exploration bottlenecks. Existing approaches either rely on teacher models for distillation or filter out difficult problems, which limits scalability or restricts reasoning improvement through exploration.We propose EvoCoT, a self-evolving curriculum learning framework based on two-stage chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning optimization. EvoCoT constrains the exploration space by self-generating and verifying CoT trajectories, then gradually shortens CoT steps to expand the space in a controlled way. The framework enables LLMs to stably learn from initially unsolved hard problems under sparse rewards. We apply EvoCoT to multiple LLM families, including Qwen, DeepSeek, and Llama. Experiments show that EvoCoT enables LLMs to solve previously unsolved problems, improves reasoning capability without external CoT supervision, and is compatible with various RL fine-tuning methods. We release the source code to support future research.

  Partial observability presents a significant challenge for Safe Reinforcement Learning (Safe RL), as it impedes the identification of potential risks and rewards. Leveraging specific types of privileged information during training to mitigate the effects of partial observability has yielded notable empirical successes. In this paper, we propose Asymmetric Constrained Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (ACPOMDPs) to theoretically examine the advantages of incorporating privileged information in Safe RL. Building upon ACPOMDPs, we propose the Privileged Information Guided Dreamer (PIGDreamer), a model-based RL approach that leverages privileged information to enhance the agent's safety and performance through privileged representation alignment and an asymmetric actor-critic structure. Our empirical results demonstrate that PIGDreamer significantly outperforms existing Safe RL methods. Furthermore, compared to alternative privileged RL methods, our approach exhibits enhanced performance, robustness, and efficiency. Codes are available at:this https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Learning representations for continuous-time dynamic graphs is critical for dynamic link prediction. While recent methods have become increasingly complex, the field lacks a strong and informative baseline to reliably gauge progress. This paper proposes HyperEvent, a simple approach that captures relative structural patterns in event sequences through an intuitive encoding mechanism. As a straightforward baseline, HyperEvent leverages relative structural encoding to identify meaningful event sequences without complex parameterization. By combining these interpretable features with a lightweight transformer classifier, HyperEvent reframes link prediction as event structure recognition. Despite its simplicity, HyperEvent achieves competitive results across multiple benchmarks, often matching the performance of more complex models. This work demonstrates that effective modeling can be achieved through simple structural encoding, providing a clear reference point for evaluating future advancements.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Federated Class Incremental Learning (FCIL) aims to collaboratively process continuously increasing incoming tasks across multiple clients. Among various approaches, data replay has become a promising solution, which can alleviate forgetting by reintroducing representative samples from previous tasks. However, their performance is typically limited by class imbalance, both within the replay buffer due to limited global awareness and between replayed and newly arrived classes. To address this issue, we propose a class wise balancing data replay method for FCIL (FedCBDR), which employs a global coordination mechanism for class-level memory construction and reweights the learning objective to alleviate the aforementioned imbalances. Specifically, FedCBDR has two key components: 1) the global-perspective data replay module reconstructs global representations of prior task in a privacy-preserving manner, which then guides a class-aware and importance-sensitive sampling strategy to achieve balanced replay; 2) Subsequently, to handle class imbalance across tasks, the task aware temperature scaling module adaptively adjusts the temperature of logits at both class and instance levels based on task dynamics, which reduces the model's overconfidence in majority classes while enhancing its sensitivity to minority classes. Experimental results verified that FedCBDR achieves balanced class-wise sampling under heterogeneous data distributions and improves generalization under task imbalance between earlier and recent tasks, yielding a 2%-15% Top-1 accuracy improvement over six state-of-the-art methods.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present Athena-PRM, a multimodal process reward model (PRM) designed to evaluate the reward score for each step in solving complex reasoning problems. Developing high-performance PRMs typically demands significant time and financial investment, primarily due to the necessity for step-level annotations of reasoning steps. Conventional automated labeling methods, such as Monte Carlo estimation, often produce noisy labels and incur substantial computational costs. To efficiently generate high-quality process-labeled data, we propose leveraging prediction consistency between weak and strong completers as a criterion for identifying reliable process labels. Remarkably, Athena-PRM demonstrates outstanding effectiveness across various scenarios and benchmarks with just 5,000 samples. Furthermore, we also develop two effective strategies to improve the performance of PRMs: ORM initialization and up-sampling for negative data. We validate our approach in three specific scenarios: verification for test time scaling, direct evaluation of reasoning step correctness, and reward ranked fine-tuning. Our Athena-PRM consistently achieves superior performance across multiple benchmarks and scenarios. Notably, when using Qwen2.5-VL-7B as the policy model, Athena-PRM enhances performance by 10.2 points on WeMath and 7.1 points on MathVista for test time scaling. Furthermore, Athena-PRM sets the state-of-the-art (SoTA) results in VisualProcessBench and outperforms the previous SoTA by 3.9 F1-score, showcasing its robust capability to accurately assess the correctness of the reasoning step. Additionally, utilizing Athena-PRM as the reward model, we develop Athena-7B with reward ranked fine-tuning and outperforms baseline with a significant margin on five benchmarks.

  A generalist agent must continuously learn and adapt throughout its lifetime, achieving efficient forward transfer while minimizing catastrophic forgetting. Previous work within the dominant pretrain-then-finetune paradigm has explored parameter-efficient fine-tuning for single-task adaptation, effectively steering a frozen pretrained model with a small number of parameters. However, in the context of lifelong learning, these methods rely on the impractical assumption of a test-time task identifier and restrict knowledge sharing among isolated adapters. To address these limitations, we propose Dynamic Mixture of Progressive Parameter-Efficient Expert Library (DMPEL) for lifelong robot learning. DMPEL progressively builds a low-rank expert library and employs a lightweight router to dynamically combine experts into an end-to-end policy, enabling flexible and efficient lifelong forward transfer. Furthermore, by leveraging the modular structure of the fine-tuned parameters, we introduce expert coefficient replay, which guides the router to accurately retrieve frozen experts for previously encountered tasks. This technique mitigates forgetting while being significantly more storage- and computation-efficient than experience replay over the entire policy. Extensive experiments on the lifelong robot learning benchmark LIBERO demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art lifelong learning methods in success rates during continual adaptation, while utilizing minimal trainable parameters and storage.

  Dysplasia is a recognised risk factor for osteoarthritis (OA) of the hip, early diagnosis of dysplasia is important to provide opportunities for surgical interventions aimed at reducing the risk of hip OA. We have developed a pipeline for semi-automated classification of dysplasia using volumetric CT scans of patients' hips and a minimal set of clinically annotated landmarks, combining the framework of the Gaussian Process Latent Variable Model with diffeomorphism to create a statistical shape model, which we termed the Gaussian Process Diffeomorphic Statistical Shape Model (GPDSSM). We used 192 CT scans, 100 for model training and 92 for testing. The GPDSSM effectively distinguishes dysplastic samples from controls while also highlighting regions of the underlying surface that show dysplastic variations. As well as improving classification accuracy compared to angle-based methods (AUC 96.2% vs 91.2%), the GPDSSM can save time for clinicians by removing the need to manually measure angles and interpreting 2D scans for possible markers of dysplasia.

  Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) achieve state-of-the-art results in text-to-image, text-to-video generation, and editing. However, their large model size and the quadratic cost of spatial-temporal attention over multiple denoising steps make video generation computationally expensive. Static caching mitigates this by reusing features across fixed steps but fails to adapt to generation dynamics, leading to suboptimal trade-offs between speed and quality.We propose Foresight, an adaptive layer-reuse technique that reduces computational redundancy across denoising steps while preserving baseline performance. Foresight dynamically identifies and reuses DiT block outputs for all layers across steps, adapting to generation parameters such as resolution and denoising schedules to optimize efficiency. Applied to OpenSora, Latte, and CogVideoX, Foresight achieves up to \latencyimprv end-to-end speedup, while maintaining video quality.

  Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have recently emerged as powerful tools for interpreting and steering the internal representations of large language models (LLMs). However, conventional approaches to analyzing SAEs typically rely solely on input-side activations, without considering the causal influence between each latent feature and the model's output. This work is built on two key hypotheses: (1) activated latents do not contribute equally to the construction of the model's output, and (2) only latents with high causal influence are effective for model steering. To validate these hypotheses, we propose Gradient Sparse Autoencoder (GradSAE), a simple yet effective method that identifies the most influential latents by incorporating output-side gradient information.

  Empirical and theoretical studies have shown that continuous low-loss paths can be constructed between independently trained neural network models. This phenomenon, known as mode connectivity, refers to the existence of such paths between distinct modes-i.e., well-trained solutions in parameter space. However, existing empirical methods are primarily effective for older and relatively simple architectures such as basic CNNs, VGG, and ResNet, raising concerns about their applicability to modern and structurally diverse models. In this work, we propose a new empirical algorithm for connecting independently trained modes that generalizes beyond traditional architectures and supports a broader range of networks, including MobileNet, ShuffleNet, EfficientNet, RegNet, Deep Layer Aggregation (DLA), and Compact Convolutional Transformers (CCT). In addition to broader applicability, the proposed method yields more consistent connectivity paths across independently trained mode pairs and supports connecting modes obtained with different training hyperparameters.

  Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being deployed on mobile devices, but the limited DRAM capacity constrains the deployable model size. This paper introduces ActiveFlow, the first LLM inference framework that can achieve adaptive DRAM usage for modern LLMs (not ReLU-based), enabling the scaling up of deployable model sizes. The framework is based on the novel concept of active weight DRAM-flash swapping and incorporates three novel techniques: (1) Cross-layer active weights preloading. It uses the activations from the current layer to predict the active weights of several subsequent layers, enabling computation and data loading to overlap, as well as facilitating large I/O transfers. (2) Sparsity-aware self-distillation. It adjusts the active weights to align with the dense-model output distribution, compensating for approximations introduced by contextual sparsity. (3) Active weight DRAM-flash swapping pipeline. It orchestrates the DRAM space allocation among the hot weight cache, preloaded active weights, and computation-involved weights based on available memory. Results show ActiveFlow achieves the performance-cost Pareto frontier compared to existing efficiency optimization methods.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this work, we propose DARSLP, a simple gloss-free, transformer-based sign language production (SLP) framework that directly maps spoken-language text to sign pose sequences. We first train a pose autoencoder that encodes sign poses into a compact latent space using an articulator-based disentanglement strategy, where features corresponding to the face, right hand, left hand, and body are modeled separately to promote structured and interpretable representation learning. Next, a non-autoregressive transformer decoder is trained to predict these latent representations from word-level text embeddings of the input sentence. To guide this process, we apply channel-aware regularization by aligning predicted latent distributions with priors extracted from the ground-truth encodings using a KL divergence loss. The contribution of each channel to the loss is weighted according to its associated articulator region, enabling the model to account for the relative importance of different articulators during training. Our approach does not rely on gloss supervision or pretrained models, and achieves state-of-the-art results on the PHOENIX14T and CSL-Daily datasets.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed natural language processing, yet their internal mechanisms remain largely opaque. Recently, mechanistic interpretability has attracted significant attention from the research community as a means to understand the inner workings of LLMs. Among various mechanistic interpretability approaches, Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a promising method due to their ability to disentangle the complex, superimposed features within LLMs into more interpretable components. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of SAEs for interpreting and understanding the internal workings of LLMs. Our major contributions include: (1) exploring the technical framework of SAEs, covering basic architecture, design improvements, and effective training strategies; (2) examining different approaches to explaining SAE features, categorized into input-based and output-based explanation methods; (3) discussing evaluation methods for assessing SAE performance, covering both structural and functional metrics; and (4) investigating real-world applications of SAEs in understanding and manipulating LLM behaviors.

  Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) enhances model performance while maintaining computational efficiency, making it well-suited for large-scale applications. Conventional mixture-of-experts (MoE) architectures suffer from suboptimal coordination dynamics, where isolated expert operations expose the model to overfitting risks. Moreover, they have not been effectively extended to attention blocks, which limits further efficiency improvements. To tackle these issues, we propose Union-of-Experts (UoE), which decomposes the transformer model into an equivalent group of experts and applies a hierarchical routing mechanism to allocate input subspaces to specialized experts. Our approach advances MoE design with four key innovations: (1) Constructing expert groups by partitioning non-MoE models into functionally equivalent specialists (2) Developing a hierarchical routing paradigm that integrates patch-wise data selection and expert selection strategies. (3) Extending the MoE design to attention blocks. (4) Proposing a hardware-optimized parallelization scheme that exploits batched matrix multiplications for efficient expert computation. The experiments demonstrate that our UoE model surpasses Full Attention, state-of-the-art MoEs and efficient transformers in several tasks across image and natural language domains. In language modeling tasks, UoE achieves an average reduction of 2.38 in perplexity compared to the best-performing MoE method with only 76% of its FLOPs. In the Long Range Arena benchmark, it demonstrates an average score at least 0.68% higher than all comparison models, with only 50% of the FLOPs of the best MoE method. In image classification, it yields an average accuracy improvement of 1.75% over the best model while maintaining comparable FLOPs. The source codes are available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The study of mechanistic interpretability aims to reverse-engineer a model to explain its behaviors. While recent studies have focused on the static mechanism of a certain behavior, the learning dynamics inside a model remain to be explored. In this work, we develop a fine-tuning method for analyzing the mechanism behind learning. Inspired by the concept of intrinsic dimension, we view a model as a computational graph with redundancy for a specific task, and treat the fine-tuning process as a search for and optimization of a subgraph within this graph. Based on this hypothesis, we propose circuit-tuning, an algorithm that iteratively builds the subgraph for a specific task and updates the relevant parameters in a heuristic way. We first validate our hypothesis through a carefully designed experiment and provide a detailed analysis of the learning dynamics during fine-tuning. Subsequently, we conduct experiments on more complex tasks, demonstrating that circuit-tuning could strike a balance between the performance on the target task and the general capabilities. Our work offers a new analytical method for the dynamics of fine-tuning, provides new findings on the mechanisms behind the training process, and inspires the design of superior algorithms for the training of neural networks.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Linearization of attention using various kernel approximation and kernel learning techniques has shown promise. Past methods used a subset of combinations of component functions and weight matrices within the random feature paradigm. We identify the need for a systematic comparison of different combinations of weight matrices and component functions for attention learning in Transformer. Hence, we introduce Spectraformer, a unified framework for approximating and learning the kernel function in the attention mechanism of the Transformer. Our empirical results demonstrate, for the first time, that a random feature-based approach can achieve performance comparable to top-performing sparse and low-rank methods on the challenging Long Range Arena benchmark. Thus, we establish a new state-of-the-art for random feature-based efficient Transformers. The framework also produces many variants that offer different advantages in accuracy, training time, and memory consumption. Our code is available at:this https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The performance of machine learning models relies heavily on the quality of input data, yet real-world applications often face significant data-related challenges. A common issue arises when curating training data or deploying models: two datasets from the same domain may exhibit differing distributions. While many techniques exist for detecting such distribution shifts, there is a lack of comprehensive methods to explain these differences in a human-understandable way beyond opaque quantitative metrics. To bridge this gap, we propose a versatile framework of interpretable methods for comparing datasets. Using a variety of case studies, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach across diverse data modalities-including tabular data, text data, images, time-series signals -- in both low and high-dimensional settings. These methods complement existing techniques by providing actionable and interpretable insights to better understand and address distribution shifts.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In the context of few-shot learning, it is currently believed that a fixed pre-trained (PT) model, along with fine-tuning the final layer during evaluation, outperforms standard meta-learning algorithms. We re-evaluate these claims under an in-depth empirical examination of an extensive set of formally diverse datasets and compare PT to Model Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML). Unlike previous work, we emphasize a fair comparison by using: the same architecture, the same optimizer, and all models trained to convergence. Crucially, we use a more rigorous statistical tool -- the effect size (Cohen's d) -- to determine the practical significance of the difference between a model trained with PT vs. a MAML. We then use a previously proposed metric -- the diversity coefficient -- to compute the average formal diversity of a dataset. Using this analysis, we demonstrate the following: 1. when the formal diversity of a data set is low, PT beats MAML on average and 2. when the formal diversity is high, MAML beats PT on average. The caveat is that the magnitude of the average difference between a PT vs. MAML using the effect size is low (according to classical statistical thresholds) -- less than 0.2. Nevertheless, this observation is contrary to the currently held belief that a pre-trained model is always better than a meta-learning model. Our extensive experiments consider 21 few-shot learning benchmarks, including the large-scale few-shot learning dataset Meta-Data set. We also show no significant difference between a MAML model vs. a PT model with GPT-2 on Openwebtext. We, therefore, conclude that a pre-trained model does not always beat a meta-learned model and that the formal diversity of a dataset is a driving factor.

  \kmeans clustering is a fundamental problem in many scientific and engineering domains. The optimization problem associated with \kmeans clustering is nonconvex, for which standard algorithms are only guaranteed to find a local optimum. Leveraging the hidden structure of local solutions, we propose a general algorithmic framework for escaping undesirable local solutions and recovering the global solution or the ground truth clustering. This framework consists of iteratively alternating between two steps: (i) detect mis-specified clusters in a local solution, and (ii) improve the local solution by non-local operations. We discuss specific implementation of these steps, and elucidate how the proposed framework unifies many existing variants of \kmeans algorithms through a geometric perspective. We also present two natural variants of the proposed framework, where the initial number of clusters may be over- or under-specified. We provide theoretical justifications and extensive experiments to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach.

  _Chuhao Qin, Evangelos Pournaras_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Decentralized combinatorial optimization in evolving multi-agent systems poses significant challenges, requiring agents to balance long-term decision-making, short-term optimized collective outcomes, while preserving autonomy of interactive agents under unanticipated changes. Reinforcement learning offers a way to model sequential decision-making through dynamic programming to anticipate future environmental changes. However, applying multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to decentralized combinatorial optimization problems remains an open challenge due to the exponential growth of the joint state-action space, high communication overhead, and privacy concerns in centralized training. To address these limitations, this paper proposes Hierarchical Reinforcement and Collective Learning (HRCL), a novel approach that leverages both MARL and decentralized collective learning based on a hierarchical framework. Agents take high-level strategies using MARL to group possible plans for action space reduction and constrain the agent behavior for Pareto optimality. Meanwhile, the low-level collective learning layer ensures efficient and decentralized coordinated decisions among agents with minimal communication. Extensive experiments in a synthetic scenario and real-world smart city application models, including energy self-management and drone swarm sensing, demonstrate that HRCL significantly improves performance, scalability, and adaptability compared to the standalone MARL and collective learning approaches, achieving a win-win synthesis solution.

  The evolution of morality presents a puzzle: natural selection should favor self-interest, yet humans developed moral systems promoting altruism. We address this question by introducing a novel Large Language Model (LLM)-based agent simulation framework modeling prehistoric hunter-gatherer societies. This platform is designed to probe diverse questions in social evolution, from survival advantages to inter-group dynamics. To investigate moral evolution, we designed agents with varying moral dispositions based on the Expanding Circle Theory \citep{singer1981expanding}. We evaluated their evolutionary success across a series of simulations and analyzed their decision-making in specially designed moral dilemmas. These experiments reveal how an agent's moral framework, in combination with its cognitive constraints, directly shapes its behavior and determines its evolutionary outcome. Crucially, the emergent patterns echo seminal theories from related domains of social science, providing external validation for the simulations. This work establishes LLM-based simulation as a powerful new paradigm to complement traditional research in evolutionary biology and anthropology, opening new avenues for investigating the complexities of moral and social evolution.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In networked multi-agent reinforcement learning (Networked-MARL), decentralized agents must act under local observability and constrained communication over fixed physical graphs. Existing methods often assume static neighborhoods, limiting adaptability to dynamic or heterogeneous environments. While centralized frameworks can learn dynamic graphs, their reliance on global state access and centralized infrastructure is impractical in real-world decentralized systems. We propose a stochastic graph-based policy for Networked-MARL, where each agent conditions its decision on a sampled subgraph over its local physical neighborhood. Building on this formulation, we introduce BayesG, a decentralized actor-framework that learns sparse, context-aware interaction structures via Bayesian variational inference. Each agent operates over an ego-graph and samples a latent communication mask to guide message passing and policy computation. The variational distribution is trained end-to-end alongside the policy using an evidence lower bound (ELBO) objective, enabling agents to jointly learn both interaction topology and decision-making strategies. BayesG outperforms strong MARL baselines on large-scale traffic control tasks with up to 167 agents, demonstrating superior scalability, efficiency, and performance.

  Multi-agent debate (MAD) has demonstrated the ability to augment collective intelligence by scaling test-time compute and leveraging expertise. Current frameworks for multi-agent debate are often designed towards tool use, lack integrated evaluation, or provide limited configurability of agent personas, response generators, discussion paradigms, and decision protocols. We introduce MALLM (Multi-Agent Large Language Models), an open-source framework that enables systematic analysis of MAD components. MALLM offers more than 144 unique configurations of MAD, including (1) agent personas (e.g., Expert, Personality), (2) response generators (e.g., Critical, Reasoning), (3) discussion paradigms (e.g., Memory, Relay), and (4) decision protocols (e.g., Voting, Consensus). MALLM uses simple configuration files to define a debate. Furthermore, MALLM can load any textual Hugging Face dataset (e.g., MMLU-Pro, WinoGrande) and provides an evaluation pipeline for easy comparison of MAD configurations. MALLM enables researchers to systematically configure, run, and evaluate debates for their problems, facilitating the understanding of the components and their interplay.

  Successful teamwork depends on interpersonal dynamics, the ways in which individuals coordinate, influence, and adapt to one another over time. Existing measures of interpersonal dynamics, such as CRQA, correlation, Granger causality, and transfer entropy, typically capture only a single dimension: either the synchrony/coordination or the direction of influence between individuals. What is missing is a psychologically meaningful representation that unifies these dimensions and varies systematically with behavior. We propose the "context matrix" as one such representation. The context matrix, modeled within a linear dynamical system, has psychologically interpretable entries specifying how much each individual's current behavior is attributable to their own versus every other group member's past behaviors. Critically, these entries can be distilled into summary features that represent synchrony and directional influence. Evidence for the context matrix as psychologically meaningful is provided in two steps. First, we develop a sequential Bayesian model that infers context matrices from timeseries data and show that it accurately recovers them in noisy simulations. Second, applying the model to human eyetracking data, we demonstrate that summary features of the inferred context matrices capture expected task-based differences in interpersonal dynamics (or lack thereof), predict task accuracy in psychologically reasonable ways, and show some correspondence with existing measures (CRQA and Granger causality). We conclude by situating the context matrix within a broader agenda for modeling interpersonal dynamics in joint action.

  LLMs are used predominantly in synchronous communication, where a human user and a model communicate in alternating turns. In contrast, many real-world settings are asynchronous. For example, in group chats, online team meetings, or social games, there is no inherent notion of turns. In this work, we develop an adaptive asynchronous LLM agent consisting of two modules: a generator that decides what to say, and a scheduler that decides when to say it. To evaluate our agent, we collect a unique dataset of online Mafia games, where our agent plays with human participants. Overall, our agent performs on par with human players, both in game performance metrics and in its ability to blend in with the other human players. Our analysis shows that the agent's behavior in deciding when to speak closely mirrors human patterns, although differences emerge in message content. We make all of our code and data publicly available. This work paves the way for integration of LLMs into realistic human group settings, from assistance in team discussions to educational and professional environments where complex social dynamics must be navigated.

  Recent advances in behavior cloning (BC) have enabled impressive visuomotor control policies. However, these approaches are limited by the quality of human demonstrations, the manual effort required for data collection, and the diminishing returns from increasing offline data. In comparison, reinforcement learning (RL) trains an agent through autonomous interaction with the environment and has shown remarkable success in various domains. Still, training RL policies directly on real-world robots remains challenging due to sample inefficiency, safety concerns, and the difficulty of learning from sparse rewards for long-horizon tasks, especially for high-degree-of-freedom (DoF) systems. We present a recipe that combines the benefits of BC and RL through a residual learning framework. Our approach leverages BC policies as black-box bases and learns lightweight per-step residual corrections via sample-efficient off-policy RL. We demonstrate that our method requires only sparse binary reward signals and can effectively improve manipulation policies on high-degree-of-freedom (DoF) systems in both simulation and the real world. In particular, we demonstrate, to the best of our knowledge, the first successful real-world RL training on a humanoid robot with dexterous hands. Our results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in various vision-based tasks, pointing towards a practical pathway for deploying RL in the real world. Project website:this https URL

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Intelligent agents progress by continually refining their capabilities through actively exploring environments. Yet robot policies often lack sufficient exploration capability due to action mode collapse. Existing methods that encourage exploration typically rely on random perturbations, which are unsafe and induce unstable, erratic behaviors, thereby limiting their effectiveness. We propose Self-Improvement via On-Manifold Exploration (SOE), a framework that enhances policy exploration and improvement in robotic manipulation. SOE learns a compact latent representation of task-relevant factors and constrains exploration to the manifold of valid actions, ensuring safety, diversity, and effectiveness. It can be seamlessly integrated with arbitrary policy models as a plug-in module, augmenting exploration without degrading the base policy performance. Moreover, the structured latent space enables human-guided exploration, further improving efficiency and controllability. Extensive experiments in both simulation and real-world tasks demonstrate that SOE consistently outperforms prior methods, achieving higher task success rates, smoother and safer exploration, and superior sample efficiency. These results establish on-manifold exploration as a principled approach to sample-efficient policy self-improvement. Project website:this https URL

  Robotic manipulation in dynamic environments often requires seamless transitions between different grasp types to maintain stability and efficiency. However, achieving smooth and adaptive grasp transitions remains a challenge, particularly when dealing with external forces and complex motion constraints. Existing grasp transition strategies often fail to account for varying external forces and do not optimize motion performance effectively. In this work, we propose an Imitation-Guided Bimanual Planning Framework that integrates efficient grasp transition strategies and motion performance optimization to enhance stability and dexterity in robotic manipulation. Our approach introduces Strategies for Sampling Stable Intersections in Grasp Manifolds for seamless transitions between uni-manual and bi-manual grasps, reducing computational costs and regrasping inefficiencies. Additionally, a Hierarchical Dual-Stage Motion Architecture combines an Imitation Learning-based Global Path Generator with a Quadratic Programming-driven Local Planner to ensure real-time motion feasibility, obstacle avoidance, and superior manipulability. The proposed method is evaluated through a series of force-intensive tasks, demonstrating significant improvements in grasp transition efficiency and motion performance.

  The transfer of manipulation skills from human demonstration to robotic execution is often hindered by a "domain gap" in sensing and morphology. This paper introduces MagiClaw, a versatile two-finger end-effector designed to bridge this gap. MagiClaw functions interchangeably as both a handheld tool for intuitive data collection and a robotic end-effector for policy deployment, ensuring hardware consistency and reliability. Each finger incorporates a Soft Polyhedral Network (SPN) with an embedded camera, enabling vision-based estimation of 6-DoF forces and contact deformation. This proprioceptive data is fused with exteroceptive environmental sensing from an integrated iPhone, which provides 6D pose, RGB video, and LiDAR-based depth maps. Through a custom iOS application, MagiClaw streams synchronized, multi-modal data for real-time teleoperation, offline policy learning, and immersive control via mixed-reality interfaces. We demonstrate how this unified system architecture lowers the barrier to collecting high-fidelity, contact-rich datasets and accelerates the development of generalizable manipulation policies.

  In this paper, we present a receding-horizon, sampling-based planner capable of reasoning over multimodal policy distributions. By using the cross-entropy method to optimize a multimodal policy under a common cost function, our approach increases robustness against local minima and promotes effective exploration of the solution space. We show that our approach naturally extends to multi-robot collision-free planning, enables agents to share diverse candidate policies to avoid deadlocks, and allows teams to minimize a global objective without incurring the computational complexity of centralized optimization. Numerical simulations demonstrate that employing multiple modes significantly improves success rates in trap environments and in multi-robot collision avoidance.

  Bimanual grasping is essential for robots to handle large and complex objects. However, existing methods either focus solely on single-arm grasping or employ separate grasp generation and bimanual evaluation stages, leading to coordination problems including collision risks and unbalanced force distribution. To address these limitations, we propose BiGraspFormer, a unified end-to-end transformer framework that directly generates coordinated bimanual grasps from object point clouds. Our key idea is the Single-Guided Bimanual (SGB) strategy, which first generates diverse single grasp candidates using a transformer decoder, then leverages their learned features through specialized attention mechanisms to jointly predict bimanual poses and quality scores. This conditioning strategy reduces the complexity of the 12-DoF search space while ensuring coordinated bimanual manipulation. Comprehensive simulation experiments and real-world validation demonstrate that BiGraspFormer consistently outperforms existing methods while maintaining efficient inference speed (<0.05s), confirming the effectiveness of our framework.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Successful navigation in outdoor environments requires accurate prediction of the physical interactions between the robot and the terrain. To this end, several methods rely on geometric or semantic labels to classify traversable surfaces. However, such labels cannot distinguish visually similar surfaces that differ in material properties. Spectral sensors enable inference of material composition from surface reflectance measured across multiple wavelength bands. Although spectral sensing is gaining traction in robotics, widespread deployment remains constrained by the need for custom hardware integration, high sensor costs, and compute-intensive processing pipelines. In this paper, we present RGB Image to Spectral Signature Neural Network (RS-Net), a deep neural network designed to bridge the gap between the accessibility of RGB sensing and the rich material information provided by spectral data. RS-Net predicts spectral signatures from RGB patches, which we map to terrain labels and friction coefficients. The resulting terrain classifications are integrated into a sampling-based motion planner for a wheeled robot operating in outdoor environments. Likewise, the friction estimates are incorporated into a contact-force-based MPC for a quadruped robot navigating slippery surfaces. Thus, we introduce a framework that learns the task-relevant physical property once during training and thereafter relies solely on RGB sensing at test time. The code is available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  General-purpose robotic skills from end-to-end demonstrations often leads to task-specific policies that fail to generalize beyond the training distribution. Therefore, we introduce FunCanon, a framework that converts long-horizon manipulation tasks into sequences of action chunks, each defined by an actor, verb, and object. These chunks focus policy learning on the actions themselves, rather than isolated tasks, enabling compositionality and reuse. To make policies pose-aware and category-general, we perform functional object canonicalization for functional alignment and automatic manipulation trajectory transfer, mapping objects into shared functional frames using affordance cues from large vision language models. An object centric and action centric diffusion policy FuncDiffuser trained on this aligned data naturally respects object affordances and poses, simplifying learning and improving generalization ability. Experiments on simulated and real-world benchmarks demonstrate category-level generalization, cross-task behavior reuse, and robust sim2real deployment, showing that functional canonicalization provides a strong inductive bias for scalable imitation learning in complex manipulation domains.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Robotic manipulation policies are commonly initialized through imitation learning, but their performance is limited by the scarcity and narrow coverage of expert data. Reinforcement learning can refine polices to alleviate this limitation, yet real-robot training is costly and unsafe, while training in simulators suffers from the sim-to-real gap. Recent advances in generative models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in real-world simulation, with diffusion models in particular excelling at generation. This raises the question of how diffusion model-based world models can be combined to enhance pre-trained policies in robotic manipulation. In this work, we propose World4RL, a framework that employs diffusion-based world models as high-fidelity simulators to refine pre-trained policies entirely in imagined environments for robotic manipulation. Unlike prior works that primarily employ world models for planning, our framework enables direct end-to-end policy optimization. World4RL is designed around two principles: pre-training a diffusion world model that captures diverse dynamics on multi-task datasets and refining policies entirely within a frozen world model to avoid online real-world interactions. We further design a two-hot action encoding scheme tailored for robotic manipulation and adopt diffusion backbones to improve modeling fidelity. Extensive simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate that World4RL provides high-fidelity environment modeling and enables consistent policy refinement, yielding significantly higher success rates compared to imitation learning and other baselines.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Contact-rich manipulation tasks such as precision assembly require precise control of interaction forces, yet existing imitation learning methods rely mainly on vision-only demonstrations. We propose ManipForce, a handheld system designed to capture high-frequency force-torque (F/T) and RGB data during natural human demonstrations for contact-rich manipulation. Building on these demonstrations, we introduce the Frequency-Aware Multimodal Transformer (FMT). FMT encodes asynchronous RGB and F/T signals using frequency- and modality-aware embeddings and fuses them via bi-directional cross-attention within a transformer diffusion policy. Through extensive experiments on six real-world contact-rich manipulation tasks - such as gear assembly, box flipping, and battery insertion - FMT trained on ManipForce demonstrations achieves robust performance with an average success rate of 83% across all tasks, substantially outperforming RGB-only baselines. Ablation and sampling-frequency analyses further confirm that incorporating high-frequency F/T data and cross-modal integration improves policy performance, especially in tasks demanding high precision and stable contact.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision-Based Tactile Sensors (VBTSs) are widely used in robotic tasks because of the high spatial resolution they offer and their relatively low manufacturing costs. However, variations in their sensing mechanisms, structural dimension, and other parameters lead to significant performance disparities between existing VBTSs. This makes it challenging to optimize them for specific tasks, as both the initial choice and subsequent fine-tuning are hindered by the lack of standardized metrics. To address this issue, TacEva is introduced as a comprehensive evaluation framework for the quantitative analysis of VBTS performance. The framework defines a set of performance metrics that capture key characteristics in typical application scenarios. For each metric, a structured experimental pipeline is designed to ensure consistent and repeatable quantification. The framework is applied to multiple VBTSs with distinct sensing mechanisms, and the results demonstrate its ability to provide a thorough evaluation of each design and quantitative indicators for each performance dimension. This enables researchers to pre-select the most appropriate VBTS on a task by task basis, while also offering performance-guided insights into the optimization of VBTS design.

  _Shuai Liu, Meng Cheng Lau_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce Reduced-Order Model-Guided Reinforcement Learning (ROM-GRL), a two-stage reinforcement learning framework for humanoid walking that requires no motion capture data or elaborate reward shaping. In the first stage, a compact 4-DOF (four-degree-of-freedom) reduced-order model (ROM) is trained via Proximal Policy Optimization. This generates energy-efficient gait templates. In the second stage, those dynamically consistent trajectories guide a full-body policy trained with Soft Actor--Critic augmented by an adversarial discriminator, ensuring the student's five-dimensional gait feature distribution matches the ROM's demonstrations. Experiments at 1 meter-per-second and 4 meter-per-second show that ROM-GRL produces stable, symmetric gaits with substantially lower tracking error than a pure-reward baseline. By distilling lightweight ROM guidance into high-dimensional policies, ROM-GRL bridges the gap between reward-only and imitation-based locomotion methods, enabling versatile, naturalistic humanoid behaviors without any human demonstrations.

  The emergence of Vision Language Action (VLA) models marks a paradigm shift from traditional policy-based control to generalized robotics, reframing Vision Language Models (VLMs) from passive sequence generators into active agents for manipulation and decision-making in complex, dynamic environments. This survey delves into advanced VLA methods, aiming to provide a clear taxonomy and a systematic, comprehensive review of existing research. It presents a comprehensive analysis of VLA applications across different scenarios and classifies VLA approaches into several paradigms: autoregression-based, diffusion-based, reinforcement-based, hybrid, and specialized methods; while examining their motivations, core strategies, and implementations in detail. In addition, foundational datasets, benchmarks, and simulation platforms are introduced. Building on the current VLA landscape, the review further proposes perspectives on key challenges and future directions to advance research in VLA models and generalizable robotics. By synthesizing insights from over three hundred recent studies, this survey maps the contours of this rapidly evolving field and highlights the opportunities and challenges that will shape the development of scalable, general-purpose VLA methods.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Object shape and pose estimation is a foundational robotics problem, supporting tasks from manipulation to scene understanding and navigation. We present a fast local solver for shape and pose estimation which requires only category-level object priors and admits an efficient certificate of global optimality. Given an RGB-D image of an object, we use a learned front-end to detect sparse, category-level semantic keypoints on the target object. We represent the target object's unknown shape using a linear active shape model and pose a maximum a posteriori optimization problem to solve for position, orientation, and shape simultaneously. Expressed in unit quaternions, this problem admits first-order optimality conditions in the form of an eigenvalue problem with eigenvector nonlinearities. Our primary contribution is to solve this problem efficiently with self-consistent field iteration, which only requires computing a 4-by-4 matrix and finding its minimum eigenvalue-vector pair at each iterate. Solving a linear system for the corresponding Lagrange multipliers gives a simple global optimality certificate. One iteration of our solver runs in about 100 microseconds, enabling fast outlier rejection. We test our method on synthetic data and a variety of real-world settings, including two public datasets and a drone tracking scenario. Code is released atthis https URL.

  _Minoo Dolatabadi, Fardin Ayar, Ehsan Javanmardi, Manabu Tsukada, Mahdi Javanmardi_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  LiDAR-based localization and SLAM often rely on iterative matching algorithms, particularly the Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm, to align sensor data with pre-existing maps or previous scans. However, ICP is prone to errors in featureless environments and dynamic scenes, leading to inaccurate pose estimation. Accurately predicting the uncertainty associated with ICP is crucial for robust state estimation but remains challenging, as existing approaches often rely on handcrafted models or simplified assumptions. Moreover, a few deep learning-based methods for localizability estimation either depend on a pre-built map, which may not always be available, or provide a binary classification of localizable versus non-localizable, which fails to properly model uncertainty. In this work, we propose a data-driven framework that leverages deep learning to estimate the registration error covariance of ICP before matching, even in the absence of a reference map. By associating each LiDAR scan with a reliable 6-DoF error covariance estimate, our method enables seamless integration of ICP within Kalman filtering, enhancing localization accuracy and robustness. Extensive experiments on the KITTI dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, showing that it accurately predicts covariance and, when applied to localization using a pre-built map or SLAM, reduces localization errors and improves robustness.

  _Hanqing Liu, Jiahuan Long, Junqi Wu, Jiacheng Hou, Huili Tang, Tingsong Jiang, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged as promising solutions for robotic manipulation, yet their robustness to real-world physical variations remains critically underexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose Eva-VLA, the first unified framework that systematically evaluates the robustness of VLA models by transforming discrete physical variations into continuous optimization problems. However, comprehensively assessing VLA robustness presents two key challenges: (1) how to systematically characterize diverse physical variations encountered in real-world deployments while maintaining evaluation reproducibility, and (2) how to discover worst-case scenarios without prohibitive real-world data collection costs efficiently. To address the first challenge, we decompose real-world variations into three critical domains: object 3D transformations that affect spatial reasoning, illumination variations that challenge visual perception, and adversarial patches that disrupt scene understanding. For the second challenge, we introduce a continuous black-box optimization framework that transforms discrete physical variations into parameter optimization, enabling systematic exploration of worst-case scenarios. Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art OpenVLA models across multiple benchmarks reveal alarming vulnerabilities: all variation types trigger failure rates exceeding 60%, with object transformations causing up to 97.8% failure in long-horizon tasks. Our findings expose critical gaps between controlled laboratory success and unpredictable deployment readiness, while the Eva-VLA framework provides a practical pathway for hardening VLA-based robotic manipulation models against real-world deployment challenges.

  Designing robotic hand morphologies for diverse manipulation tasks requires balancing dexterity, manufacturability, and task-specific functionality. While open-source frameworks and parametric tools support reproducible design, they still rely on expert heuristics and manual tuning. Automated methods using optimization are often compute-intensive, simulation-dependent, and rarely target dexterous hands. Large language models (LLMs), with their broad knowledge of human-object interactions and strong generative capabilities, offer a promising alternative for zero-shot design reasoning. In this paper, we present Lang2Morph, a language-driven pipeline for robotic hand design. It uses LLMs to translate natural-language task descriptions into symbolic structures and OPH-compatible parameters, enabling 3D-printable task-specific morphologies. The pipeline consists of: (i) Morphology Design, which maps tasks into semantic tags, structural grammars, and OPH-compatible parameters; and (ii) Selection and Refinement, which evaluates design candidates based on semantic alignment and size compatibility, and optionally applies LLM-guided refinement when needed. We evaluate Lang2Morph across varied tasks, and results show that our approach can generate diverse, task-relevant morphologies. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to develop an LLM-based framework for task-conditioned robotic hand design.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We propose Bilateral Control-Based Imitation Learning via Vision-Language Fusion for Action Generation (Bi-VLA), a novel framework that extends bilateral control-based imitation learning to handle more than one task within a single model. Conventional bilateral control methods exploit joint angle, velocity, torque, and vision for precise manipulation but require task-specific models, limiting their generality. Bi-VLA overcomes this limitation by utilizing robot joint angle, velocity, and torque data from leader-follower bilateral control with visual features and natural language instructions through SigLIP and FiLM-based fusion. We validated Bi-VLA on two task types: one requiring supplementary language cues and another distinguishable solely by vision. Real-robot experiments showed that Bi-VLA successfully interprets vision-language combinations and improves task success rates compared to conventional bilateral control-based imitation learning. Our Bi-VLA addresses the single-task limitation of prior bilateral approaches and provides empirical evidence that combining vision and language significantly enhances versatility. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of Bi-VLA in real-world tasks. For additional material, please visit the website:this https URL

  Human skin provides a rich tactile sensing stream, localizing intentional and unintentional contact events over a large and contoured region. Replicating these tactile sensing capabilities for dexterous robotic manipulation systems remains a longstanding challenge. In this work, we take a step towards this goal by introducing DexSkin. DexSkin is a soft, conformable capacitive electronic skin that enables sensitive, localized, and calibratable tactile sensing, and can be tailored to varying geometries. We demonstrate its efficacy for learning downstream robotic manipulation by sensorizing a pair of parallel jaw gripper fingers, providing tactile coverage across almost the entire finger surfaces. We empirically evaluate DexSkin's capabilities in learning challenging manipulation tasks that require sensing coverage across the entire surface of the fingers, such as reorienting objects in hand and wrapping elastic bands around boxes, in a learning-from-demonstration framework. We then show that, critically for data-driven approaches, DexSkin can be calibrated to enable model transfer across sensor instances, and demonstrate its applicability to online reinforcement learning on real robots. Our results highlight DexSkin's suitability and practicality for learning real-world, contact-rich manipulation. Please see our project webpage for videos and visualizations:this https URL.

  In this paper, we address the point cloud registration problem, where well-known methods like ICP fail under uncertainty arising from sensor noise, pose-estimation errors, and partial overlap due to occlusion. We develop a novel approach, Gaussian Process Concept Attribution (GP-CA), which not only quantifies registration uncertainty but also explains it by attributing uncertainty to well-known sources of errors in registration problems. Our approach leverages active learning to discover new uncertainty sources in the wild by querying informative instances. We validate GP-CA on three publicly available datasets and in our real-world robot experiment. Extensive ablations substantiate our design choices. Our approach outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in terms of runtime, high sample-efficiency with active learning, and high accuracy. Our real-world experiment clearly demonstrates its applicability. Our video also demonstrates that GP-CA enables effective failure-recovery behaviors, yielding more robust robotic perception.

  Visual imitation learning frameworks allow robots to learn manipulation skills from expert demonstrations. While existing approaches mainly focus on policy design, they often neglect the structure and capacity of visual encoders, limiting spatial understanding and generalization. Inspired by biological vision systems, which rely on both visual and proprioceptive cues for robust control, we propose VGGT-DP, a visuomotor policy framework that integrates geometric priors from a pretrained 3D perception model with proprioceptive feedback. We adopt the Visual Geometry Grounded Transformer (VGGT) as the visual encoder and introduce a proprioception-guided visual learning strategy to align perception with internal robot states, improving spatial grounding and closed-loop control. To reduce inference latency, we design a frame-wise token reuse mechanism that compacts multi-view tokens into an efficient spatial representation. We further apply random token pruning to enhance policy robustness and reduce overfitting. Experiments on challenging MetaWorld tasks show that VGGT-DP significantly outperforms strong baselines such as DP and DP3, particularly in precision-critical and long-horizon scenarios.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in imitation learning have shown great promise for developing robust robot manipulation policies from demonstrations. However, this promise is contingent on the availability of diverse, high-quality datasets, which are not only challenging and costly to collect but are often constrained to a specific robot embodiment. Portable handheld grippers have recently emerged as intuitive and scalable alternatives to traditional robotic teleoperation methods for data collection. However, their reliance solely on first-person view wrist-mounted cameras often creates limitations in capturing sufficient scene contexts. In this paper, we present MV-UMI (Multi-View Universal Manipulation Interface), a framework that integrates a third-person perspective with the egocentric camera to overcome this limitation. This integration mitigates domain shifts between human demonstration and robot deployment, preserving the cross-embodiment advantages of handheld data-collection devices. Our experimental results, including an ablation study, demonstrate that our MV-UMI framework improves performance in sub-tasks requiring broad scene understanding by approximately 47% across 3 tasks, confirming the effectiveness of our approach in expanding the range of feasible manipulation tasks that can be learned using handheld gripper systems, without compromising the cross-embodiment advantages inherent to such systems.

  One of the challenges faced by Autonomous Aerial Vehicles is reliable navigation through urban environments. Factors like reduction in precision of Global Positioning System (GPS), narrow spaces and dynamically moving obstacles make the path planning of an aerial robot a complicated task. One of the skills required for the agent to effectively navigate through such an environment is to develop an ability to avoid collisions using information from onboard depth sensors. In this paper, we propose Reinforcement Learning of a virtual quadcopter robot agent equipped with a Depth Camera to navigate through a simulated urban environment.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The robotic assembly task poses a key challenge in building generalist robots due to the intrinsic complexity of part interactions and the sensitivity to noise perturbations in contact-rich settings. The assembly agent is typically designed in a hierarchical manner: high-level multi-part reasoning and low-level precise control. However, implementing such a hierarchical policy is challenging in practice due to the mismatch between high-level skill queries and low-level execution. To address this, we propose the Query-centric Diffusion Policy (QDP), a hierarchical framework that bridges high-level planning and low-level control by utilizing queries comprising objects, contact points, and skill information. QDP introduces a query-centric mechanism that identifies task-relevant components and uses them to guide low-level policies, leveraging point cloud observations to improve the policy's robustness. We conduct comprehensive experiments on the FurnitureBench in both simulation and real-world settings, demonstrating improved performance in skill precision and long-horizon success rate. In the challenging insertion and screwing tasks, QDP improves the skill-wise success rate by over 50% compared to baselines without structured queries.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In mobile manipulation, the manipulation policy has strong preferences for initial poses where it is executed. However, the navigation module focuses solely on reaching the task area, without considering which initial pose is preferable for downstream manipulation. To address this misalignment, we introduce N2M, a transition module that guides the robot to a preferable initial pose after reaching the task area, thereby substantially improving task success rates. N2M features five key advantages: (1) reliance solely on ego-centric observation without requiring global or historical information; (2) real-time adaptation to environmental changes; (3) reliable prediction with high viewpoint robustness; (4) broad applicability across diverse tasks, manipulation policies, and robot hardware; and (5) remarkable data efficiency and generalizability. We demonstrate the effectiveness of N2M through extensive simulation and real-world experiments. In the PnPCounterToCab task, N2M improves the averaged success rate from 3% with the reachability-based baseline to 54%. Furthermore, in the Toybox Handover task, N2M provides reliable predictions even in unseen environments with only 15 data samples, showing remarkable data efficiency and generalizability.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Safety remains a major concern for deploying reinforcement learning (RL) in real-world applications. Simulators provide safe, scalable training environments, but the inevitable sim-to-real gap introduces additional safety concerns, as policies must satisfy constraints in real-world conditions that differ from simulation. To address this challenge, robust safe RL techniques offer principled methods, but are often incompatible with standard scalable training pipelines. In contrast, domain randomization, a simple and popular sim-to-real technique, stands out as a promising alternative, although it often results in unsafe behaviors in practice. We present SPiDR, short for Sim-to-real via Pessimistic Domain Randomization -- a scalable algorithm with provable guarantees for safe sim-to-real transfer. SPiDR uses domain randomization to incorporate the uncertainty about the sim-to-real gap into the safety constraints, making it versatile and highly compatible with existing training pipelines. Through extensive experiments on sim-to-sim benchmarks and two distinct real-world robotic platforms, we demonstrate that SPiDR effectively ensures safety despite the sim-to-real gap while maintaining strong performance.

  _Juntu Zhao, Wenbo Lu, Di Zhang, Yufeng Liu, Yushen Liang, Tianluo Zhang, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Imitation-learning-based visuomotor policies have been widely used in robot manipulation, where both visual observations and proprioceptive states are typically adopted together for precise control. However, in this study, we find that this common practice makes the policy overly reliant on the proprioceptive state input, which causes overfitting to the training trajectories and results in poor spatial generalization. On the contrary, we propose the State-free Policy, removing the proprioceptive state input and predicting actions only conditioned on visual observations. The State-free Policy is built in the relative end-effector action space, and should ensure the full task-relevant visual observations, here provided by dual wide-angle wrist cameras. Empirical results demonstrate that the State-free policy achieves significantly stronger spatial generalization than the state-based policy: in real-world tasks such as pick-and-place, challenging shirt-folding, and complex whole-body manipulation, spanning multiple robot embodiments, the average success rate improves from 0\% to 85\% in height generalization and from 6\% to 64\% in horizontal generalization. Furthermore, they also show advantages in data efficiency and cross-embodiment adaptation, enhancing their practicality for real-world deployment.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Formation maintenance with varying number of drones in narrow environments hinders the convergence of planning to the desired configurations. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a formation planning method guided by Deformable Virtual Structures (DVS) with continuous spatiotemporal transformation. Firstly, to satisfy swarm safety distance and preserve formation shape filling integrity for irregular formation geometries, we employ Lloyd algorithm for uniform $\underline{PA}$rtitioning and Hungarian algorithm for $\underline{AS}$signment (PAAS) in DVS. Subsequently, a spatiotemporal trajectory involving DVS is planned using primitive-based path search and nonlinear trajectory optimization. The DVS trajectory achieves adaptive transitions with respect to a varying number of drones while ensuring adaptability to narrow environments through affine transformation. Finally, each agent conducts distributed trajectory planning guided by desired spatiotemporal positions within the DVS, while incorporating collision avoidance and dynamic feasibility requirements. Our method enables up to 15\% of swarm numbers to join or leave in cluttered environments while rapidly restoring the desired formation shape in simulation. Compared to cutting-edge formation planning method, we demonstrate rapid formation recovery capacity and environmental adaptability. Real-world experiments validate the effectiveness and resilience of our formation planning method.

  Behavior cloning has shown promise for robot manipulation, but real-world demonstrations are costly to acquire at scale. While simulated data offers a scalable alternative, particularly with advances in automated demonstration generation, transferring policies to the real world is hampered by various simulation and real domain gaps. In this work, we propose a unified sim-and-real co-training framework for learning generalizable manipulation policies that primarily leverages simulation and only requires a few real-world demonstrations. Central to our approach is learning a domain-invariant, task-relevant feature space. Our key insight is that aligning the joint distributions of observations and their corresponding actions across domains provides a richer signal than aligning observations (marginals) alone. We achieve this by embedding an Optimal Transport (OT)-inspired loss within the co-training framework, and extend this to an Unbalanced OT framework to handle the imbalance between abundant simulation data and limited real-world examples. We validate our method on challenging manipulation tasks, showing it can leverage abundant simulation data to achieve up to a 30% improvement in the real-world success rate and even generalize to scenarios seen only in simulation.

  Learning-based autonomous driving systems are trained mostly on incident-free data, offering little guidance near safety-performance boundaries. Real crash reports contain precisely the contrastive evidence needed, but they are hard to use: narratives are unstructured, third-person, and poorly grounded to sensor views. We address these challenges by normalizing crash narratives to ego-centric language and converting both logs and crashes into a unified scene-action representation suitable for retrieval. At decision time, our system adjudicates proposed actions by retrieving relevant precedents from this unified index; an agentic counterfactual extension proposes plausible alternatives, retrieves for each, and reasons across outcomes before deciding. On a nuScenes benchmark, precedent retrieval substantially improves calibration, with recall on contextually preferred actions rising from 24% to 53%. The counterfactual variant preserves these gains while sharpening decisions near risk.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large vision-language models have driven remarkable progress in open-vocabulary robot policies, e.g., generalist robot manipulation policies, that enable robots to complete complex tasks specified in natural language. Despite these successes, open-vocabulary autonomous drone navigation remains an unsolved challenge due to the scarcity of large-scale demonstrations, real-time control demands of drones for stabilization, and lack of reliable external pose estimation modules. In this work, we present SINGER for language-guided autonomous drone navigation in the open world using only onboard sensing and compute. To train robust, open-vocabulary navigation policies, SINGER leverages three central components: (i) a photorealistic language-embedded flight simulator with minimal sim-to-real gap using Gaussian Splatting for efficient data generation, (ii) an RRT-inspired multi-trajectory generation expert for collision-free navigation demonstrations, and these are used to train (iii) a lightweight end-to-end visuomotor policy for real-time closed-loop control. Through extensive hardware flight experiments, we demonstrate superior zero-shot sim-to-real transfer of our policy to unseen environments and unseen language-conditioned goal objects. When trained on ~700k-1M observation action pairs of language conditioned visuomotor data and deployed on hardware, SINGER outperforms a velocity-controlled semantic guidance baseline by reaching the query 23.33% more on average, and maintains the query in the field of view 16.67% more on average, with 10% fewer collisions.

  End-to-end motion planning is promising for simplifying complex autonomous driving pipelines. However, challenges such as scene understanding and effective prediction for decision-making continue to present substantial obstacles to its large-scale deployment. In this paper, we present PIE, a pioneering framework that integrates advanced perception, reasoning, and intention modeling to dynamically capture interactions between the ego vehicle and surrounding agents. It incorporates a bidirectional Mamba fusion that addresses data compression losses in multimodal fusion of camera and LiDAR inputs, alongside a novel reasoning-enhanced decoder integrating Mamba and Mixture-of-Experts to facilitate scene-compliant anchor selection and optimize adaptive trajectory inference. PIE adopts an action-motion interaction module to effectively utilize state predictions of surrounding agents to refine ego planning. The proposed framework is thoroughly validated on the NAVSIM benchmark. PIE, without using any ensemble and data augmentation techniques, achieves an 88.9 PDM score and 85.6 EPDM score, surpassing the performance of prior state-of-the-art methods. Comprehensive quantitative and qualitative analyses demonstrate that PIE is capable of reliably generating feasible and high-quality ego trajectories.

The policy was validated in simulation, achieving a 100% success rate in straight-row plantations and showing a gradual decline in performance as row curvature increased, tested across varying sinusoidal frequencies and amplitudes.

  _Yuan Meng, Zhenguo Sun, Max Fest, Xukun Li, Zhenshan Bing, Alois Knoll_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs)-based code generation for robotic manipulation has recently shown promise by directly translating human instructions into executable code, but existing methods remain noisy, constrained by fixed primitives and limited context windows, and struggle with long-horizon tasks. While closed-loop feedback has been explored, corrected knowledge is often stored in improper formats, restricting generalization and causing catastrophic forgetting, which highlights the need for learning reusable skills. Moreover, approaches that rely solely on LLM guidance frequently fail in extremely long-horizon scenarios due to LLMs' limited reasoning capability in the robotic domain, where such issues are often straightforward for humans to identify. To address these challenges, we propose a human-in-the-loop framework that encodes corrections into reusable skills, supported by external memory and Retrieval-Augmented Generation with a hint mechanism for dynamic reuse. Experiments on Ravens, Franka Kitchen, and MetaWorld, as well as real-world settings, show that our framework achieves a 0.93 success rate (up to 27% higher than baselines) and a 42% efficiency improvement in correction rounds. It can robustly solve extremely long-horizon tasks such as "build a house", which requires planning over 20 primitives.

  Multimodal semantic learning plays a critical role in embodied intelligence, especially when robots perceive their surroundings, understand human instructions, and make intelligent decisions. However, the field faces technical challenges such as effective fusion of heterogeneous data and computational efficiency in resource-constrained environments. To address these challenges, this study proposes the lightweight LCMF cascaded attention framework, introducing a multi-level cross-modal parameter sharing mechanism into the Mamba module. By integrating the advantages of Cross-Attention and Selective parameter-sharing State Space Models (SSMs), the framework achieves efficient fusion of heterogeneous modalities and semantic complementary alignment. Experimental results show that LCMF surpasses existing multimodal baselines with an accuracy of 74.29% in VQA tasks and achieves competitive mid-tier performance within the distribution cluster of Large Language Model Agents (LLM Agents) in EQA video tasks. Its lightweight design achieves a 4.35-fold reduction in FLOPs relative to the average of comparable baselines while using only 166.51M parameters (image-text) and 219M parameters (video-text), providing an efficient solution for Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) applications in resource-constrained scenarios with strong multimodal decision generalization capabilities.

  _Siyuan Yu, Congkai Shen, Yufei Xi, James Dallas, Michael Thompson, John Subosits, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper presents a novel envelope based model predictive control (MPC) framework designed to enable autonomous vehicles to handle high performance driving across a wide range of scenarios without a predefined reference. In high performance autonomous driving, safe operation at the vehicle's dynamic limits requires a real time planning and control framework capable of accounting for key vehicle dynamics and environmental constraints when following a predefined reference trajectory is suboptimal or even infeasible. State of the art planning and control frameworks, however, are predominantly reference based, which limits their performance in such situations. To address this gap, this work first introduces a computationally efficient vehicle dynamics model tailored for optimization based control and a continuously differentiable mathematical formulation that accurately captures the entire drivable envelope. This novel model and formulation allow for the direct integration of dynamic feasibility and safety constraints into a unified planning and control framework, thereby removing the necessity for predefined references. The challenge of envelope planning, which refers to maximally approximating the safe drivable area, is tackled by combining reinforcement learning with optimization techniques. The framework is validated through both simulations and real world experiments, demonstrating its high performance across a variety of tasks, including racing, emergency collision avoidance and off road navigation. These results highlight the framework's scalability and broad applicability across a diverse set of scenarios.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Model predictive control (MPC) has demonstrated effectiveness for humanoid bipedal locomotion; however, its applicability in challenging environments, such as rough and slippery terrain, is limited by the difficulty of modeling terrain interactions. In contrast, reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved notable success in training robust locomotion policies over diverse terrain, yet it lacks guarantees of constraint satisfaction and often requires substantial reward shaping. Recent efforts in combining MPC and RL have shown promise of taking the best of both worlds, but they are primarily restricted to flat terrain or quadrupedal robots. In this work, we propose an RL-augmented MPC framework tailored for bipedal locomotion over rough and slippery terrain. Our method parametrizes three key components of single-rigid-body-dynamics-based MPC: system dynamics, swing leg controller, and gait frequency. We validate our approach through bipedal robot simulations in NVIDIA IsaacLab across various terrains, including stairs, stepping stones, and low-friction surfaces. Experimental results demonstrate that our RL-augmented MPC framework produces significantly more adaptive and robust behaviors compared to baseline MPC and RL.

  _Jannick van Buuren, Roberto Giglio, Loris Roveda, Luka Peternel_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper explores how deliberate mutations of reward function in reinforcement learning can produce diversified skill variations in robotic manipulation tasks, examined with a liquid pouring use case. To this end, we developed a new reward function mutation framework that is based on applying Gaussian noise to the weights of the different terms in the reward function. Inspired by the cost-benefit tradeoff model from human motor control, we designed the reward function with the following key terms: accuracy, time, and effort. The study was performed in a simulation environment created in NVIDIA Isaac Sim, and the setup included Franka Emika Panda robotic arm holding a glass with a liquid that needed to be poured into a container. The reinforcement learning algorithm was based on Proximal Policy Optimization. We systematically explored how different configurations of mutated weights in the rewards function would affect the learned policy. The resulting policies exhibit a wide range of behaviours: from variations in execution of the originally intended pouring task to novel skills useful for unexpected tasks, such as container rim cleaning, liquid mixing, and watering. This approach offers promising directions for robotic systems to perform diversified learning of specific tasks, while also potentially deriving meaningful skills for future tasks.

  _Yunshuang Li, Yiyang Ling, Gaurav S. Sukhatme, Daniel Seita_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Nonprehensile manipulation, such as pushing and pulling, enables robots to move, align, or reposition objects that may be difficult to grasp due to their geometry, size, or relationship to the robot or the environment. Much of the existing work in nonprehensile manipulation relies on parallel-jaw grippers or tools such as rods and spatulas. In contrast, multi-fingered dexterous hands offer richer contact modes and versatility for handling diverse objects to provide stable support over the objects, which compensates for the difficulty of modeling the dynamics of nonprehensile manipulation. Therefore, we propose Geometry-aware Dexterous Pushing and Pulling (GD2P) for nonprehensile manipulation with dexterous robotic hands. We study pushing and pulling by framing the problem as synthesizing and learning pre-contact dexterous hand poses that lead to effective manipulation. We generate diverse hand poses via contact-guided sampling, filter them using physics simulation, and train a diffusion model conditioned on object geometry to predict viable poses. At test time, we sample hand poses and use standard motion planners to select and execute pushing and pulling actions. We perform 840 real-world experiments with an Allegro Hand, comparing our method to baselines. The results indicate that GD2P offers a scalable route for training dexterous nonprehensile manipulation policies. We further demonstrate GD2P on a LEAP Hand, highlighting its applicability to different hand morphologies. Our pre-trained models and dataset, including 1.3 million hand poses across 2.3k objects, will be open-source to facilitate further research. Our project website is available at:this http URL.

  _Rishabh Madan, Jiawei Lin, Mahika Goel, Angchen Xie, Xiaoyu Liang, Marcus Lee, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Physical human-robot interaction (pHRI) requires robots to adapt to individual contact preferences, such as where and how much force is applied. Identifying preferences is difficult for a single contact; with whole-arm interaction involving multiple simultaneous contacts between the robot and human, the challenge is greater because different body parts can impose incompatible force requirements. In caregiving tasks, where contact is frequent and varied, such conflicts are unavoidable. With multiple preferences across multiple contacts, no single solution can satisfy all objectives--trade-offs are inherent, making prioritization essential. We present PrioriTouch, a framework for ranking and executing control objectives across multiple contacts. PrioriTouch can prioritize from a general collection of controllers, making it applicable not only to caregiving scenarios such as bed bathing and dressing but also to broader multi-contact settings. Our method combines a novel learning-to-rank approach with hierarchical operational space control, leveraging simulation-in-the-loop rollouts for data-efficient and safe exploration. We conduct a user study on physical assistance preferences, derive personalized comfort thresholds, and incorporate them into PrioriTouch. We evaluate PrioriTouch through extensive simulation and real-world experiments, demonstrating its ability to adapt to user contact preferences, maintain task performance, and enhance safety and comfort.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have gained popularity for learning robotic manipulation tasks that follow language instructions. State-of-the-art VLAs, such as OpenVLA and $\pi_{0}$, were trained on large-scale, manually labeled action datasets collected through teleoperation. More recent approaches, including LAPA and villa-X, introduce latent action representations that enable unsupervised pretraining on unlabeled datasets by modeling abstract visual changes between frames. Although these methods have shown strong results, their large model sizes make deployment in real-world settings challenging. In this work, we propose LAWM, a model-agnostic framework to pretrain imitation learning models in a self-supervised way, by learning latent action representations from unlabeled video data through world modeling. These videos can be sourced from robot recordings or videos of humans performing actions with everyday objects. Our framework is designed to be effective for transferring across tasks, environments, and embodiments. It outperforms models trained with ground-truth robotics actions and similar pretraining methods on the LIBERO benchmark and real-world setup, while being significantly more efficient and practical for real-world settings.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Accurate localisation is critical for mobile robots in structured outdoor environments, yet LiDAR-based methods often fail in vineyards due to repetitive row geometry and perceptual aliasing. We propose a semantic particle filter that incorporates stable object-level detections, specifically vine trunks and support poles into the likelihood estimation process. Detected landmarks are projected into a birds eye view and fused with LiDAR scans to generate semantic observations. A key innovation is the use of semantic walls, which connect adjacent landmarks into pseudo-structural constraints that mitigate row aliasing. To maintain global consistency in headland regions where semantics are sparse, we introduce a noisy GPS prior that adaptively supports the filter. Experiments in a real vineyard demonstrate that our approach maintains localisation within the correct row, recovers from deviations where AMCL fails, and outperforms vision-based SLAM methods such as RTAB-Map.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  When a human dyad jointly manipulates an object, they must communicate about their intended motion plans. Some of that collaboration is achieved through the motion of the manipulated object itself, which we call "haptic communication." In this work, we captured the motion of human-human dyads moving an object together with one participant leading a motion plan about which the follower is uninformed. We then captured the same human participants manipulating the same object with a robot collaborator. By tracking the motion of the shared object using a low-cost IMU, we can directly compare human-human shared manipulation to the motion of those same participants interacting with the robot. Intra-study and post-study questionnaires provided participant feedback on the collaborations, indicating that the human-human collaborations are significantly more fluent, and analysis of the IMU data indicates that it captures objective differences in the motion profiles of the conditions. The differences in objective and subjective measures of accuracy and fluency between the human-human and human-robot trials motivate future research into improving robot assistants for physical tasks by enabling them to send and receive anthropomorphic haptic signals.

  _Benjamin A. Christie, Sagar Parekh, Dylan P. Losey_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent works introduce general-purpose robot policies. These policies provide a strong prior over how robots should behave -- e.g., how a robot arm should manipulate food items. But in order for robots to match an individual person's needs, users typically fine-tune these generalized policies -- e.g., showing the robot arm how to make their own preferred dinners. Importantly, during the process of personalizing robots, end-users leak data about their preferences, habits, and styles (e.g., the foods they prefer to eat). Other agents can simply roll-out the fine-tuned policy and see these personally-trained behaviors. This leads to a fundamental challenge: how can we develop robots that personalize actions while keeping learning private from external agents? We here explore this emerging topic in human-robot interaction and develop PRoP, a model-agnostic framework for personalized and private robot policies. Our core idea is to equip each user with a unique key; this key is then used to mathematically transform the weights of the robot's network. With the correct key, the robot's policy switches to match that user's preferences -- but with incorrect keys, the robot reverts to its baseline behaviors. We show the general applicability of our method across multiple model types in imitation learning, reinforcement learning, and classification tasks. PRoP is practically advantageous because it retains the architecture and behaviors of the original policy, and experimentally outperforms existing encoder-based approaches.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Robotic manipulation policies often fail to generalize because they must simultaneously learn where to attend, what actions to take, and how to execute them. We argue that high-level reasoning about where and what can be offloaded to vision-language models (VLMs), leaving policies to specialize in how to act. We present PEEK (Policy-agnostic Extraction of Essential Keypoints), which fine-tunes VLMs to predict a unified point-based intermediate representation: 1. end-effector paths specifying what actions to take, and 2. task-relevant masks indicating where to focus. These annotations are directly overlaid onto robot observations, making the representation policy-agnostic and transferable across architectures. To enable scalable training, we introduce an automatic annotation pipeline, generating labeled data across 20+ robot datasets spanning 9 embodiments. In real-world evaluations, PEEK consistently boosts zero-shot generalization, including a 41.4x real-world improvement for a 3D policy trained only in simulation, and 2-3.5x gains for both large VLAs and small manipulation policies. By letting VLMs absorb semantic and visual complexity, PEEK equips manipulation policies with the minimal cues they need--where, what, and how. Website atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Current state-of-the-art autonomous vehicles could face safety-critical situations when their local sensors are occluded by large nearby objects on the road. Vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) cooperative autonomous driving has been proposed as a means of addressing this problem, and one recently introduced framework for cooperative autonomous driving has further adopted an approach that incorporates a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) to integrate cooperative perception and planning processes. However, despite the potential benefit of applying graph-of-thoughts reasoning to the MLLM, this idea has not been considered by previous cooperative autonomous driving research. In this paper, we propose a novel graph-of-thoughts framework specifically designed for MLLM-based cooperative autonomous driving. Our graph-of-thoughts includes our proposed novel ideas of occlusion-aware perception and planning-aware prediction. We curate the V2V-GoT-QA dataset and develop the V2V-GoT model for training and testing the cooperative driving graph-of-thoughts. Our experimental results show that our method outperforms other baselines in cooperative perception, prediction, and planning tasks. Our project website:this https URL.

  Optimizing and refining action execution through exploration and interaction is a promising way for robotic manipulation. However, practical approaches to interaction-driven robotic learning are still underexplored, particularly for long-horizon tasks where sequential decision-making, physical constraints, and perceptual uncertainties pose significant challenges. Motivated by embodied cognition theory, we propose RoboSeek, a framework for embodied action execution that leverages interactive experience to accomplish manipulation tasks. RoboSeek optimizes prior knowledge from high-level perception models through closed-loop training in simulation and achieves robust real-world execution via a real2sim2real transfer pipeline. Specifically, we first replicate real-world environments in simulation using 3D reconstruction to provide visually and physically consistent environments, then we train policies in simulation using reinforcement learning and the cross-entropy method leveraging visual priors. The learned policies are subsequently deployed on real robotic platforms for execution. RoboSeek is hardware-agnostic and is evaluated on multiple robotic platforms across eight long-horizon manipulation tasks involving sequential interactions, tool use, and object handling. Our approach achieves an average success rate of 79%, significantly outperforming baselines whose success rates remain below 50%, highlighting its generalization and robustness across tasks and platforms. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our training framework in complex, dynamic real-world settings and demonstrate the stability of the proposed real2sim2real transfer mechanism, paving the way for more generalizable embodied robotic learning.

  Scaling Reinforcement Learning to in-the-wild social robot navigation is both data-intensive and unsafe, since policies must learn through direct interaction and inevitably encounter collisions. Offline Imitation learning (IL) avoids these risks by collecting expert demonstrations safely, training entirely offline, and deploying policies zero-shot. However, we find that naively applying Behaviour Cloning (BC) to social navigation is insufficient; achieving strong performance requires careful architectural and training choices. We present Ratatouille, a pipeline and model architecture that, without changing the data, reduces collisions per meter by 6 times and improves success rate by 3 times compared to naive BC. We validate our approach in both simulation and the real world, where we collected over 11 hours of data on a dense university campus. We further demonstrate qualitative results in a public food court. Our findings highlight that thoughtful IL design, rather than additional data, can substantially improve safety and reliability in real-world social navigation. Video:this https URL.

  Enabling robust whole-body humanoid-object interaction (HOI) remains challenging due to motion data scarcity and the contact-rich nature. We present HDMI (HumanoiD iMitation for Interaction), a simple and general framework that learns whole-body humanoid-object interaction skills directly from monocular RGB videos. Our pipeline (i) extracts and retargets human and object trajectories from unconstrained videos to build structured motion datasets, (ii) trains a reinforcement learning (RL) policy to co-track robot and object states with three key designs: a unified object representation, a residual action space, and a general interaction reward, and (iii) zero-shot deploys the RL policies on real humanoid robots. Extensive sim-to-real experiments on a Unitree G1 humanoid demonstrate the robustness and generality of our approach: HDMI achieves 67 consecutive door traversals and successfully performs 6 distinct loco-manipulation tasks in the real world and 14 tasks in simulation. Our results establish HDMI as a simple and general framework for acquiring interactive humanoid skills from human videos.

  Embodied AI development significantly lags behind large foundation models due to three critical challenges: (1) lack of systematic understanding of core capabilities needed for Embodied AI, making research lack clear objectives; (2) absence of unified and standardized evaluation systems, rendering cross-benchmark evaluation infeasible; and (3) underdeveloped automated and scalable acquisition methods for embodied data, creating critical bottlenecks for model scaling. To address these obstacles, we present Embodied Arena, a comprehensive, unified, and evolving evaluation platform for Embodied AI. Our platform establishes a systematic embodied capability taxonomy spanning three levels (perception, reasoning, task execution), seven core capabilities, and 25 fine-grained dimensions, enabling unified evaluation with systematic research objectives. We introduce a standardized evaluation system built upon unified infrastructure supporting flexible integration of 22 diverse benchmarks across three domains (2D/3D Embodied Q&A, Navigation, Task Planning) and 30+ advanced models from 20+ worldwide institutes. Additionally, we develop a novel LLM-driven automated generation pipeline ensuring scalable embodied evaluation data with continuous evolution for diversity and comprehensiveness. Embodied Arena publishes three real-time leaderboards (Embodied Q&A, Navigation, Task Planning) with dual perspectives (benchmark view and capability view), providing comprehensive overviews of advanced model capabilities. Especially, we present nine findings summarized from the evaluation results on the leaderboards of Embodied Arena. This helps to establish clear research veins and pinpoint critical research problems, thereby driving forward progress in the field of Embodied AI.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models often fail to generalize to novel camera viewpoints, a limitation stemming from their difficulty in inferring robust 3D geometry from 2D images. We introduce GeoAware-VLA, a simple yet effective approach that enhances viewpoint invariance by integrating strong geometric priors into the vision backbone. Instead of training a visual encoder or relying on explicit 3D data, we leverage a frozen, pretrained geometric vision model as a feature extractor. A trainable projection layer then adapts these geometrically-rich features for the policy decoder, relieving it of the burden of learning 3D consistency from scratch. Through extensive evaluations on LIBERO benchmark subsets, we show GeoAware-VLA achieves substantial improvements in zero-shot generalization to novel camera poses, boosting success rates by over 2x in simulation. Crucially, these benefits translate to the physical world; our model shows a significant performance gain on a real robot, especially when evaluated from unseen camera angles. Our approach proves effective across both continuous and discrete action spaces, highlighting that robust geometric grounding is a key component for creating more generalizable robotic agents.

  Robust robotic task execution hinges on the reliable detection of execution failures in order to trigger safe operation modes, recovery strategies, or task replanning. However, many failure detection methods struggle to provide meaningful performance when applied to a variety of real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose a video-based failure detection approach that uses spatio-temporal knowledge in the form of the actions the robot performs and task-relevant objects within the field of view. Both pieces of information are available in most robotic scenarios and can thus be readily obtained. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on three datasets that we amend, in part, with additional annotations of the aforementioned task-relevant knowledge. In light of the results, we also propose a data augmentation method that improves performance by applying variable frame rates to different parts of the video. We observe an improvement from 77.9 to 80.0 in F1 score on the ARMBench dataset without additional computational expense and an additional increase to 81.4 with test-time augmentation. The results emphasize the importance of spatio-temporal information during failure detection and suggest further investigation of suitable heuristics in future implementations. Code and annotations are available.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Learning from demonstration has proven effective in robotics for acquiring natural behaviors, such as stylistic motions and lifelike agility, particularly when explicitly defining style-oriented reward functions is challenging. Synthesizing stylistic motions for real-world tasks usually requires balancing task performance and imitation quality. Existing methods generally depend on expert demonstrations closely aligned with task objectives. However, practical demonstrations are often incomplete or unrealistic, causing current methods to boost style at the expense of task performance. To address this issue, we propose formulating the problem as a constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP). Specifically, we optimize a style-imitation objective with constraints to maintain near-optimal task performance. We introduce an adaptively adjustable Lagrangian multiplier to guide the agent to imitate demonstrations selectively, capturing stylistic nuances without compromising task performance. We validate our approach across multiple robotic platforms and tasks, demonstrating both robust task performance and high-fidelity style learning. On ANYmal-D hardware we show a 14.5% drop in mechanical energy and a more agile gait pattern, showcasing real-world benefits.

  Coordinating the motion between lower and upper limbs and aligning limb control with perception are substantial challenges in robotics, particularly in dynamic environments. To this end, we introduce an approach for enabling legged mobile manipulators to play badminton, a task that requires precise coordination of perception, locomotion, and arm swinging. We propose a unified reinforcement learning-based control policy for whole-body visuomotor skills involving all degrees of freedom to achieve effective shuttlecock tracking and striking. This policy is informed by a perception noise model that utilizes real-world camera data, allowing for consistent perception error levels between simulation and deployment and encouraging learned active perception behaviors. Our method includes a shuttlecock prediction model, constrained reinforcement learning for robust motion control, and integrated system identification techniques to enhance deployment readiness. Extensive experimental results in a variety of environments validate the robot's capability to predict shuttlecock trajectories, navigate the service area effectively, and execute precise strikes against human players, demonstrating the feasibility of using legged mobile manipulators in complex and dynamic sports scenarios.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Accurate localization serves as an important component in autonomous driving systems. Traditional rule-based localization involves many standalone modules, which is theoretically fragile and requires costly hyperparameter tuning, therefore sacrificing the accuracy and generalization. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end visual localization system, RAVE, in which the surrounding images are associated with the HD map data to estimate pose. To ensure high-quality observations for localization, a low-rank flow-based prior fusion module (FLORA) is developed to incorporate misaligned map prior into the perceived BEV features. Pursuing a balance among efficiency, interpretability, and accuracy, a hierarchical localization module is proposed, which efficiently estimates poses through a decoupled BEV neural matching-based pose solver (DEMA) using rasterized HD map, and then refines the estimation through a Transformer-based pose regressor (POET) using vectorized HD map. The experimental results demonstrate that our method can perform robust and accurate localization under varying environmental conditions while running efficiently.

  Despite the many recent achievements in developing and deploying social robotics, there are still many underexplored environments and applications for which systematic evaluation of such systems by end-users is necessary. While several robotic platforms have been used in gerontological healthcare, the question of whether or not a social interactive robot with multi-modal conversational capabilities will be useful and accepted in real-life facilities is yet to be answered. This paper is an attempt to partially answer this question, via two waves of experiments with patients and companions in a day-care gerontological facility in Paris with a full-sized humanoid robot endowed with social and conversational interaction capabilities. The software architecture, developed during the H2020 SPRING project, together with the experimental protocol, allowed us to evaluate the acceptability (AES) and usability (SUS) with more than 60 end-users. Overall, the users are receptive to this technology, especially when the robot perception and action skills are robust to environmental clutter and flexible to handle a plethora of different interactions.
