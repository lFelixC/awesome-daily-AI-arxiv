- **[Benchmarking World-Model Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19788)**  `arXiv:2510.19788`  
  _Archana Warrier, Dat Nyugen, Michelangelo Naim, Moksh Jain, Yichao Liang, Karen Schroeder, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Model-learning agents should gather information to learn world models that support many downstream tasks and inferences, such as predicting unobserved states, estimating near- and far-term consequences of actions, planning action sequences, and detecting changes in dynamics. Current methods for learning and evaluating world models diverge from this goal: training and evaluation are anchored to next-frame prediction, and success is scored by reward maximization in the same environment. We propose WorldTest, a protocol to evaluate model-learning agents that separates reward-free interaction from a scored test phase in a different but related environment. WorldTest is open-ended$\unicode{x2014}$models should support many different tasks unknown ahead of time$\unicode{x2014}$and agnostic to model representation, allowing comparison across approaches. We instantiated WorldTest with AutumnBench, a suite of 43 interactive grid-world environments and 129 tasks across three families: masked-frame prediction, planning, and predicting changes to the causal dynamics. We compared 517 human participants and three frontier models on AutumnBench. We found that humans outperform the models, and scaling compute improves performance only in some environments but not others. WorldTest provides a novel template$\unicode{x2014}$reward-free exploration, derived tests, and behavior-based scoring$\unicode{x2014}$to evaluate what agents learn about environment dynamics, and AutumnBench exposes significant headroom in world-model learning.

- **[Beyond Reactivity: Measuring Proactive Problem Solving in LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19771)**  `arXiv:2510.19771`  
  _Gil Pasternak, Dheeraj Rajagopal, Julia White, Dhruv Atreja, Matthew Thomas, George Hurn-Maloney, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  LLM-based agents are increasingly moving towards proactivity: rather than awaiting instruction, they exercise agency to anticipate user needs and solve them autonomously. However, evaluating proactivity is challenging; current benchmarks are constrained to localized context, limiting their ability to test reasoning across sources and longer time horizons. To address this gap, we present PROBE (Proactive Resolution Of BottlEnecks). PROBE decomposes proactivity as a pipeline of three core capabilities: (1) searching for unspecified issues, (2) identifying specific bottlenecks, and (3) executing appropriate resolutions. We apply PROBE to evaluate leading LLMs and popular agentic frameworks, showing that even state-of-the-art models struggle to solve this benchmark. Computing our consistent measurements across frontier LLMs and agents, we find that the best end-to-end performance of 40% is achieved by both GPT-5 and Claude Opus-4.1. Additionally, we demonstrate the relative capabilities of each model and analyze mutual failure modes. Our results highlight the current limitations of autonomous action in agentic systems, and expose promising future research directions.

- **[Memo: Training Memory-Efficient Embodied Agents with Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19732)**  `arXiv:2510.19732`  
  _Gunshi Gupta, Karmesh Yadav, Zsolt Kira, Yarin Gal, Rahaf Aljundi_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  To enable embodied agents to operate effectively over extended timeframes, it is crucial to develop models that form and access memories to stay contextualized in their environment. In the current paradigm of training transformer-based policies for embodied sequential decision-making tasks, visual inputs often overwhelm the context limits of transformers, while humans can maintain and utilize a lifetime of experience compressed as memories. Significant compression is possible in principle, as much of the input is irrelevant and can be abstracted. However, existing approaches predominantly focus on either recurrent models with fixed-size memory or transformers with full-context reliance. In this work, we propose Memo, a transformer-based architecture and training recipe for reinforcement learning (RL) on memory-intensive, long-horizon tasks. Memo incorporates the creation and retrieval of memory by interleaving periodic summarization tokens with the inputs of a model during training. We demonstrate Memo's effectiveness on a gridworld meta-RL benchmark and a multi-object navigation task in photo-realistic indoor settings. Memo outperforms naive long-context transformer baselines while being more compute and storage efficient. Additionally, Memo generalizes better to longer contexts at inference time and remains robust in streaming settings, where historical context must be truncated to fit inference constraints.

- **[RLIE: Rule Generation with Logistic Regression, Iterative Refinement, and Evaluation for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19698)**  `arXiv:2510.19698`  
  _Yang Yang, Hua XU, Zhangyi Hu, Yutao Yue_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) can propose rules in natural language, sidestepping the need for a predefined predicate space in traditional rule learning. Yet many LLM-based approaches ignore interactions among rules, and the opportunity to couple LLMs with probabilistic rule learning for robust inference remains underexplored. We present RLIE, a unified framework that integrates LLMs with probabilistic modeling to learn a set of weighted rules. RLIE has four stages: (1) Rule generation, where an LLM proposes and filters candidates; (2) Logistic regression, which learns probabilistic weights for global selection and calibration; (3) Iterative refinement, which updates the rule set using prediction errors; and (4) Evaluation, which compares the weighted rule set as a direct classifier with methods that inject rules into an LLM. We evaluate multiple inference strategies on real-world datasets. Applying rules directly with their learned weights yields superior performance, whereas prompting LLMs with the rules, weights, and logistic-model outputs surprisingly degrades accuracy. This supports the view that LLMs excel at semantic generation and interpretation but are less reliable for precise probabilistic integration. RLIE clarifies the potential and limitations of LLMs for inductive reasoning and couples them with classic probabilistic rule combination methods to enable more reliable neuro-symbolic reasoning.

- **[Explainable e-sports win prediction through Machine Learning classification in streaming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19671)**  `arXiv:2510.19671`  
  _Silvia Garc√≠a-M√©ndez, Francisco de Arriba-P√©rez_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The increasing number of spectators and players in e-sports, along with the development of optimized communication solutions and cloud computing technology, has motivated the constant growth of the online game industry. Even though Artificial Intelligence-based solutions for e-sports analytics are traditionally defined as extracting meaningful patterns from related data and visualizing them to enhance decision-making, most of the effort in professional winning prediction has been focused on the classification aspect from a batch perspective, also leaving aside the visualization techniques. Consequently, this work contributes to an explainable win prediction classification solution in streaming in which input data is controlled over several sliding windows to reflect relevant game changes. Experimental results attained an accuracy higher than 90 %, surpassing the performance of competing solutions in the literature. Ultimately, our system can be leveraged by ranking and recommender systems for informed decision-making, thanks to the explainability module, which fosters trust in the outcome predictions.

- **[A Graph Engine for Guitar Chord-Tone Soloing Education](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19666)**  `arXiv:2510.19666`  
  _Matthew Keating, Michael Casey_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present a graph-based engine for computing chord tone soloing suggestions for guitar students. Chord tone soloing is a fundamental practice for improvising over a chord progression, where the instrumentalist uses only the notes contained in the current chord. This practice is a building block for all advanced jazz guitar theory but is difficult to learn and practice. First, we discuss methods for generating chord-tone arpeggios. Next, we construct a weighted graph where each node represents a chord tone arpeggio for a chord in the progression. Then, we calculate the edge weight between each consecutive chord's nodes in terms of optimal transition tones. We then find the shortest path through this graph and reconstruct a chord-tone soloing line. Finally, we discuss a user-friendly system to handle input and output to this engine for guitar students to practice chord tone soloing.

- **[AgentSense: LLMs Empower Generalizable and Explainable Web-Based Participatory Urban Sensing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19661)**  `arXiv:2510.19661`  
  _Xusen Guo, Mingxing Peng, Xixuan Hao, Xingchen Zou, Qiongyan Wang, Sijie Ruan, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Web-based participatory urban sensing has emerged as a vital approach for modern urban management by leveraging mobile individuals as distributed sensors. However, existing urban sensing systems struggle with limited generalization across diverse urban scenarios and poor interpretability in decision-making. In this work, we introduce AgentSense, a hybrid, training-free framework that integrates large language models (LLMs) into participatory urban sensing through a multi-agent evolution system. AgentSense initially employs classical planner to generate baseline solutions and then iteratively refines them to adapt sensing task assignments to dynamic urban conditions and heterogeneous worker preferences, while producing natural language explanations that enhance transparency and trust. Extensive experiments across two large-scale mobility datasets and seven types of dynamic disturbances demonstrate that AgentSense offers distinct advantages in adaptivity and explainability over traditional methods. Furthermore, compared to single-agent LLM baselines, our approach outperforms in both performance and robustness, while delivering more reasonable and transparent explanations. These results position AgentSense as a significant advancement towards deploying adaptive and explainable urban sensing systems on the web.

- **[HSCodeComp: A Realistic and Expert-level Benchmark for Deep Search Agents in Hierarchical Rule Application](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19631)**  `arXiv:2510.19631`  
  _Yiqian Yang, Tian Lan, Qianghuai Jia, Li Zhu, Hui Jiang, Hang Zhu, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Effective deep search agents must not only access open-domain and domain-specific knowledge but also apply complex rules-such as legal clauses, medical manuals and tariff rules. These rules often feature vague boundaries and implicit logic relationships, making precise application challenging for agents. However, this critical capability is largely overlooked by current agent benchmarks.To fill this gap, we introduce HSCodeComp, the first realistic, expert-level e-commerce benchmark designed to evaluate deep search agents in hierarchical rule application. In this task, the deep reasoning process of agents is guided by these rules to predict 10-digit Harmonized System Code (HSCode) of products with noisy but realistic descriptions. These codes, established by the World Customs Organization, are vital for global supply chain efficiency. Built from real-world data collected from large-scale e-commerce platforms, our proposed HSCodeComp comprises 632 product entries spanning diverse product categories, with these HSCodes annotated by several human experts.Extensive experimental results on several state-of-the-art LLMs, open-source, and closed-source agents reveal a huge performance gap: best agent achieves only 46.8% 10-digit accuracy, far below human experts at 95.0%. Besides, detailed analysis demonstrates the challenges of hierarchical rule application, and test-time scaling fails to improve performance further.

- **[DAIL: Beyond Task Ambiguity for Language-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19562)**  `arXiv:2510.19562`  
  _Runpeng Xie, Quanwei Wang, Hao Hu, Zherui Zhou, Ni Mu, Xiyun Li, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Comprehending natural language and following human instructions are critical capabilities for intelligent agents. However, the flexibility of linguistic instructions induces substantial ambiguity across language-conditioned tasks, severely degrading algorithmic performance. To address these limitations, we present a novel method named DAIL (Distributional Aligned Learning), featuring two key components: distributional policy and semantic alignment. Specifically, we provide theoretical results that the value distribution estimation mechanism enhances task differentiability. Meanwhile, the semantic alignment module captures the correspondence between trajectories and linguistic instructions. Extensive experimental results on both structured and visual observation benchmarks demonstrate that DAIL effectively resolves instruction ambiguities, achieving superior performance to baseline methods. Our implementation is available atthis https URL.

- **[NeSyPr: Neurosymbolic Proceduralization For Efficient Embodied Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19429)**  `arXiv:2510.19429`  
  _Wonje Choi, Jooyoung Kim, Honguk Woo_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We address the challenge of adopting language models (LMs) for embodied tasks in dynamic environments, where online access to large-scale inference engines or symbolic planners is constrained due to latency, connectivity, and resource limitations. To this end, we present NeSyPr, a novel embodied reasoning framework that compiles knowledge via neurosymbolic proceduralization, thereby equipping LM-based agents with structured, adaptive, and timely reasoning capabilities. In NeSyPr, task-specific plans are first explicitly generated by a symbolic tool leveraging its declarative knowledge. These plans are then transformed into composable procedural representations that encode the plans' implicit production rules, enabling the resulting composed procedures to be seamlessly integrated into the LM's inference process. This neurosymbolic proceduralization abstracts and generalizes multi-step symbolic structured path-finding and reasoning into single-step LM inference, akin to human knowledge compilation. It supports efficient test-time inference without relying on external symbolic guidance, making it well suited for deployment in latency-sensitive and resource-constrained physical systems. We evaluate NeSyPr on the embodied benchmarks PDDLGym, VirtualHome, and ALFWorld, demonstrating its efficient reasoning capabilities over large-scale reasoning models and a symbolic planner, while using more compact LMs.

- **[MSC-Bench: A Rigorous Benchmark for Multi-Server Tool Orchestration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19423)**  `arXiv:2510.19423`  
  _Jia-Kai Dong, I-Wei Huang, Chun-Tin Wu, Yi-Tien Tsai_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce MSC-Bench, a large-scale benchmark for evaluating multi-hop, end-to-end tool orchestration by LLM agents in a hierarchical Model-Context Protocol (MCP) ecosystem. Existing benchmarks often evaluate tools in isolation, ignoring challenges such as functional overlap and cross-server orchestration, leading to overly optimistic assessments. MSC-Bench addresses these gaps by constructing ground truth through 'equal function sets', allowing objective metrics such as F1 score and reducing the dependency on LLM-as-a-judge evaluation. Organized as a five-level curriculum, it systematically tests agent capabilities from single-tool orchestration to complex cross-server planning, and robustness to out-of-scope requests. Experiments reveal that rigid hierarchies can hinder performance without co-designed strategies, and even state-of-the-art agents exhibit systemic weaknesses in robustness. MSC-Bench provides a diagnostic framework to expose these limitations and guide the development of more capable and efficient tool-using agents. The benchmark and resources are publicly available atthis https URL.

- **[Continual Knowledge Adaptation for Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19314)**  `arXiv:2510.19314`  
  _Jinwu Hu, Zihao Lian, Zhiquan Wen, Chenghao Li, Guohao Chen, Xutao Wen, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reinforcement Learning enables agents to learn optimal behaviors through interactions with environments. However, real-world environments are typically non-stationary, requiring agents to continuously adapt to new tasks and changing conditions. Although Continual Reinforcement Learning facilitates learning across multiple tasks, existing methods often suffer from catastrophic forgetting and inefficient knowledge utilization. To address these challenges, we propose Continual Knowledge Adaptation for Reinforcement Learning (CKA-RL), which enables the accumulation and effective utilization of historical knowledge. Specifically, we introduce a Continual Knowledge Adaptation strategy, which involves maintaining a task-specific knowledge vector pool and dynamically using historical knowledge to adapt the agent to new tasks. This process mitigates catastrophic forgetting and enables efficient knowledge transfer across tasks by preserving and adapting critical model parameters. Additionally, we propose an Adaptive Knowledge Merging mechanism that combines similar knowledge vectors to address scalability challenges, reducing memory requirements while ensuring the retention of essential knowledge. Experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed CKA-RL outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving an improvement of 4.20% in overall performance and 8.02% in forward transfer.

- **[An Argumentative Explanation Framework for Generalized Reason Model with Inconsistent Precedents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19263)**  `arXiv:2510.19263`  
  _Wachara Fungwacharakorn, Gauvain Bourgne, Ken Satoh_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Precedential constraint is one foundation of case-based reasoning in AI and Law. It generally assumes that the underlying set of precedents must be consistent. To relax this assumption, a generalized notion of the reason model has been introduced. While several argumentative explanation approaches exist for reasoning with precedents based on the traditional consistent reason model, there has been no corresponding argumentative explanation method developed for this generalized reasoning framework accommodating inconsistent precedents. To address this question, this paper examines an extension of the derivation state argumentation framework (DSA-framework) to explain the reasoning according to the generalized notion of the reason model.

  _Marianna Molinari, Ilaria Angela Amantea, Marinella Quaranta, Guido Governatori_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This study examines the performance of ChatGPT with an experiment in the legal domain. We compare the outcome with it a baseline using regular expressions (Regex), rather than focusing solely on the assessment against human performance. The study reveals that even if ChatGPT has access to the necessary knowledge and competencies, it is unable to assemble them, reason through, in a way that leads to an exhaustive result. This unveils a major limitation of ChatGPT. Intelligence encompasses the ability to break down complex issues and address them according to multiple required competencies, providing a unified and comprehensive solution. In the legal domain, one of the most crucial tasks is reading legal decisions and extracting key passages condensed from principles of law (PoLs), which are then incorporated into subsequent rulings by judges or defense documents by lawyers. In performing this task, artificial intelligence lacks an all-encompassing understanding and reasoning, which makes it inherently limited. Genuine intelligence, remains a uniquely human trait, at least in this particular field.

- **[WebGraphEval: Multi-Turn Trajectory Evaluation for Web Agents using Graph Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19205)**  `arXiv:2510.19205`  
  _Yaoyao Qian, Yuanli Wang, Jinda Zhang, Yun Zong, Meixu Chen, Hanhan Zhou, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Current evaluation of web agents largely reduces to binary success metrics or conformity to a single reference trajectory, ignoring the structural diversity present in benchmark datasets. We present WebGraphEval, a framework that abstracts trajectories from multiple agents into a unified, weighted action graph. This representation is directly compatible with benchmarks such as WebArena, leveraging leaderboard runs and newly collected trajectories without modifying environments. The framework canonically encodes actions, merges recurring behaviors, and applies structural analyses including reward propagation and success-weighted edge statistics. Evaluations across thousands of trajectories from six web agents show that the graph abstraction captures cross-model regularities, highlights redundancy and inefficiency, and identifies critical decision points overlooked by outcome-based metrics. By framing web interaction as graph-structured data, WebGraphEval establishes a general methodology for multi-path, cross-agent, and efficiency-aware evaluation of web agents.

- **[The Zero-Step Thinking: An Empirical Study of Mode Selection as Harder Early Exit in Reasoning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19176)**  `arXiv:2510.19176`  
  _Yuqiao Tan, Shizhu He, Kang Liu, Jun Zhao_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reasoning models have demonstrated exceptional performance in tasks such as mathematics and logical reasoning, primarily due to their ability to engage in step-by-step thinking during the reasoning process. However, this often leads to overthinking, resulting in unnecessary computational overhead. To address this issue, Mode Selection aims to automatically decide between Long-CoT (Chain-of-Thought) or Short-CoT by utilizing either a Thinking or NoThinking mode. Simultaneously, Early Exit determines the optimal stopping point during the iterative reasoning process. Both methods seek to reduce the computational burden. In this paper, we first identify Mode Selection as a more challenging variant of the Early Exit problem, as they share similar objectives but differ in decision timing. While Early Exit focuses on determining the best stopping point for concise reasoning at inference time, Mode Selection must make this decision at the beginning of the reasoning process, relying on pre-defined fake thoughts without engaging in an explicit reasoning process, referred to as zero-step thinking. Through empirical studies on nine baselines, we observe that prompt-based approaches often fail due to their limited classification capabilities when provided with minimal hand-crafted information. In contrast, approaches that leverage internal information generally perform better across most scenarios but still exhibit issues with stability. Our findings indicate that existing methods relying solely on the information provided by models are insufficient for effectively addressing Mode Selection in scenarios with limited information, highlighting the ongoing challenges of this task. Our code is available atthis https URL.

- **[A Multi-faceted Analysis of Cognitive Abilities: Evaluating Prompt Methods with Large Language Models on the CONSORT Checklist](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19139)**  `arXiv:2510.19139`  
  _Sohyeon Jeon, Hyung-Chul Lee_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Despite the rapid expansion of Large Language Models (LLMs) in healthcare, the ability of these systems to assess clinical trial reporting according to CONSORT standards remains unclear, particularly with respect to their cognitive and reasoning strategies. This study applies a behavioral and metacognitive analytic approach with expert-validated data, systematically comparing two representative LLMs under three prompt conditions. Clear differences emerged in how the models approached various CONSORT items, and prompt types, including shifts in reasoning style, explicit uncertainty, and alternative interpretations shaped response patterns. Our results highlight the current limitations of these systems in clinical compliance automation and underscore the importance of understanding their cognitive adaptations and strategic behavior in developing more explainable and reliable medical AI.

- **[Rectifying Shortcut Behaviors in Preference-based Reward Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19050)**  `arXiv:2510.19050`  
  _Wenqian Ye, Guangtao Zheng, Aidong Zhang_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In reinforcement learning from human feedback, preference-based reward models play a central role in aligning large language models to human-aligned behavior. However, recent studies show that these models are prone to reward hacking and often fail to generalize well due to over-optimization. They achieve high reward scores by exploiting shortcuts, that is, exploiting spurious features (e.g., response verbosity, agreeable tone, or sycophancy) that correlate with human preference labels in the training data rather than genuinely reflecting the intended objectives. In this paper, instead of probing these issues one at a time, we take a broader view of the reward hacking problem as shortcut behaviors and introduce a principled yet flexible approach to mitigate shortcut behaviors in preference-based reward learning. Inspired by the invariant theory in the kernel perspective, we propose Preference-based Reward Invariance for Shortcut Mitigation (PRISM), which learns group-invariant kernels with feature maps in a closed-form learning objective. Experimental results in several benchmarks show that our method consistently improves the accuracy of the reward model on diverse out-of-distribution tasks and reduces the dependency on shortcuts in downstream policy models, establishing a robust framework for preference-based alignment.

- **[Timely Clinical Diagnosis through Active Test Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18988)**  `arXiv:2510.18988`  
  _Silas Ruhrberg Est√©vez, Nicol√°s Astorga, Mihaela van der Schaar_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  There is growing interest in using machine learning (ML) to support clinical diag- nosis, but most approaches rely on static, fully observed datasets and fail to reflect the sequential, resource-aware reasoning clinicians use in practice. Diagnosis remains complex and error prone, especially in high-pressure or resource-limited settings, underscoring the need for frameworks that help clinicians make timely and cost-effective decisions. We propose ACTMED (Adaptive Clinical Test selection via Model-based Experimental Design), a diagnostic framework that integrates Bayesian Experimental Design (BED) with large language models (LLMs) to better emulate real-world diagnostic reasoning. At each step, ACTMED selects the test expected to yield the greatest reduction in diagnostic uncertainty for a given patient. LLMs act as flexible simulators, generating plausible patient state distributions and supporting belief updates without requiring structured, task-specific training data. Clinicians can remain in the loop; reviewing test suggestions, interpreting intermediate outputs, and applying clinical judgment throughout. We evaluate ACTMED on real-world datasets and show it can optimize test selection to improve diagnostic accuracy, interpretability, and resource use. This represents a step to- ward transparent, adaptive, and clinician-aligned diagnostic systems that generalize across settings with reduced reliance on domain-specific data.

- **[Test-time Verification via Optimal Transport: Coverage, ROC, & Sub-optimality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18982)**  `arXiv:2510.18982`  
  _Arpan Mukherjee, Marcello Bullo, Debabrota Basu, Deniz G√ºnd√ºz_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  While test-time scaling with verification has shown promise in improving the performance of large language models (LLMs), the role of the verifier and its imperfections remain underexplored. The effect of verification manifests through interactions of three quantities: (i) the generator's coverage, (ii) the verifier's region of convergence (ROC), and (iii) the sampling algorithm's sub-optimality. Though recent studies capture subsets of these factors, a unified framework quantifying the geometry of their interplay is missing. We frame verifiable test-time scaling as a transport problem. This characterizes the interaction of coverage, ROC, and sub-optimality, and uncovers that the sub-optimality--coverage curve exhibits three regimes. A transport regime -- where sub-optimality increases with coverage, a policy improvement regime -- where sub-optimality may decrease with coverage, depending on the verifier's ROC, and a saturation regime -- where sub-optimality plateaus, unaffected by coverage. We further propose and analyze two classes of sampling algorithms -- sequential and batched, and examine how their computational complexities shape these trade-offs. Empirical results with Qwen, Llama, and Gemma models corroborate our theoretical findings.

- **[A Brain Cell Type Resource Created by Large Language Models and a Multi-Agent AI System for Collaborative Community Annotation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17064)**  `arXiv:2510.17064`  
  _Rongbin Li, Wenbo Chen, Zhao Li, Rodrigo Munoz-Castaneda, Jinbo Li, Neha S. Maurya, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Single-cell RNA sequencing has transformed our ability to identify diverse cell types and their transcriptomic signatures. However, annotating these signatures-especially those involving poorly characterized genes-remains a major challenge. Traditional methods, such as Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA), depend on well-curated annotations and often perform poorly in these contexts. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising alternative but struggle to represent complex biological knowledge within structured ontologies. To address this, we present BRAINCELL-AID (BRAINCELL-AID:this https URL), a novel multi-agent AI system that integrates free-text descriptions with ontology labels to enable more accurate and robust gene set annotation. By incorporating retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), we developed a robust agentic workflow that refines predictions using relevant PubMed literature, reducing hallucinations and enhancing interpretability. Using this workflow, we achieved correct annotations for 77% of mouse gene sets among their top predictions. Applying this approach, we annotated 5,322 brain cell clusters from the comprehensive mouse brain cell atlas generated by the BRAIN Initiative Cell Census Network, enabling novel insights into brain cell function by identifying region-specific gene co-expression patterns and inferring functional roles of gene ensembles. BRAINCELL-AID also identifies Basal Ganglia-related cell types with neurologically meaningful descriptions. Hence, we create a valuable resource to support community-driven cell type annotation.

  Large language models (LLMs) often produce fluent reasoning steps while violating simple mathematical or logical constraints. We introduce MedRule-KG, a compact typed knowledge graph coupled with a symbolic verifier, designed to enforce mathematically interpretable rules in reasoning tasks. MedRule-KG encodes entities, relations, and three domain-inspired rules, while the verifier checks predictions and applies minimal corrections to guarantee consistency. On a 90-example FDA-derived benchmark, grounding in MedRule-KG improves exact match (EM) from 0.767 to 0.900, and adding the verifier yields 1.000 EM while eliminating rule violations entirely. We demonstrate how MedRule-KG provides a general scaffold for safe mathematical reasoning, discuss ablations, and release code and data to encourage reproducibility.

  Since the rapid expansion of large language models (LLMs), people have begun to rely on them for information retrieval. While traditional search engines display ranked lists of sources shaped by search engine optimization (SEO), advertising, and personalization, LLMs typically provide a synthesized response that feels singular and authoritative. While both approaches carry risks of bias and omission, LLMs may amplify the effect by collapsing multiple perspectives into one answer, reducing users ability or inclination to compare alternatives. This concentrates power over information in a few LLM vendors whose systems effectively shape what is remembered and what is overlooked. As a result, certain narratives, individuals or groups, may be disproportionately suppressed, while others are disproportionately elevated. Over time, this creates a new threat: the gradual erasure of those with limited digital presence, and the amplification of those already prominent, reshaping collective memory. To address these concerns, this paper presents a concept of the Right To Be Remembered (RTBR) which encompasses minimizing the risk of AI-driven information omission, embracing the right of fair treatment, while ensuring that the generated content would be maximally truthful.

  Improving the reasoning capabilities of embodied agents is crucial for robots to complete complex human instructions in long-view manipulation tasks successfully. Despite the success of large language models and vision language models based on Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) in planning tasks, they continue facing challenges in performing long-horizon manipulation tasks in complex real-world environments, owing to their restricted common sense and reasoning capabilities. Considering that aligning general-purpose vision language models to robotic planning tasks via supervised fine-tuning suffers from poor generalization and insufficient physical understanding, we propose RoboGPT-R1, a two-stage fine-tuning framework for embodied planning. In this framework, supervised training acquires foundational knowledge through expert sequences, followed by RL to address the model's shortcomings in visual-spatial understanding and reasoning. To achieve physical understanding and action sequence consistency in multi-step reasoning tasks, we design a rule-based reward function that simultaneously considers long-horizon performance and action constraint in the environment. The reasoning model, trained on Qwen2.5-VL-3B, significantly outperforms the larger-scale model, GPT-4o-mini, by 21.33% and surpasses other work trained on Qwen2.5-VL-7B by 20.33% on the EmbodiedBench benchmark.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms are highly sensitive to reward function specification, which remains a central challenge limiting their broad applicability. We present ARM-FM: Automated Reward Machines via Foundation Models, a framework for automated, compositional reward design in RL that leverages the high-level reasoning capabilities of foundation models (FMs). Reward machines (RMs) -- an automata-based formalism for reward specification -- are used as the mechanism for RL objective specification, and are automatically constructed via the use of FMs. The structured formalism of RMs yields effective task decompositions, while the use of FMs enables objective specifications in natural language. Concretely, we (i) use FMs to automatically generate RMs from natural language specifications; (ii) associate language embeddings with each RM automata-state to enable generalization across tasks; and (iii) provide empirical evidence of ARM-FM's effectiveness in a diverse suite of challenging environments, including evidence of zero-shot generalization.

  Why do thinking language models like DeepSeek R1 outperform their base counterparts? Despite consistent performance gains, it remains unclear to what extent thinking models learn entirely new reasoning capabilities or repurpose pre-existing base model ones. In this work, we propose a hybrid model where we activate reasoning mechanisms in base models at the right time to elicit thinking-model-level reasoning chains, implying that thinking models exploit already existing capabilities. To ground our analysis, we introduce an unsupervised, bottom-up approach for uncovering human-interpretable reasoning behaviors in thinking models. This approach provides an unbiased method to discover reasoning behaviors without imposing manual or LLM-derived assumptions. Across three base and four thinking models, using GSM8K and MATH500, our hybrid model recovers up to 91% of the performance gap to thinking models without any weight updates while steering only 12% of tokens. Concretely, our empirical setup provides a simple, causal way to test the effectiveness of existing reasoning mechanisms in base models by invoking them directly and measuring the resulting task performance. More broadly, these results reframe our understanding of how thinking models are trained: pre-training is when models acquire most of their reasoning mechanisms, and post-training teaches efficient deployment of these mechanisms at the right time, enabling efficient use of their inference-time compute.

  Case definitions are essential for effectively communicating public health threats. However, the absence of a standardized, machine-readable format poses significant challenges to interoperability, epidemiological research, the exchange of qualitative data, and the effective application of computational analysis methods, including artificial intelligence (AI). This complicates comparisons and collaborations across organizations and regions, limits data integration, and hinders technological innovation in public health. To address these issues, we propose the first open, machine-readable format for representing case and syndrome definitions. Additionally, we introduce the first comprehensive dataset of standardized case definitions and tools to convert existing human-readable definitions into machine-readable formats. We also provide an accessible online platform for browsing, analyzing, and contributing new definitions, available atthis https URL. The Open Syndrome Definition format enables consistent, scalable use of case definitions across systems, unlocking AI's potential to strengthen public health preparedness and response.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Existing safety evaluation methods for large language models (LLMs) suffer from inherent limitations, including evaluator bias and detection failures arising from model homogeneity, which collectively undermine the robustness of risk evaluation processes. This paper seeks to re-examine the risk evaluation paradigm by introducing a theoretical framework that reconstructs the underlying risk concept space. Specifically, we decompose the latent risk concept space into three mutually exclusive subspaces: the explicit risk subspace (encompassing direct violations of safety guidelines), the implicit risk subspace (capturing potential malicious content that requires contextual reasoning for identification), and the non-risk subspace. Furthermore, we propose RADAR, a multi-agent collaborative evaluation framework that leverages multi-round debate mechanisms through four specialized complementary roles and employs dynamic update mechanisms to achieve self-evolution of risk concept distributions. This approach enables comprehensive coverage of both explicit and implicit risks while mitigating evaluator bias. To validate the effectiveness of our framework, we construct an evaluation dataset comprising 800 challenging cases. Extensive experiments on our challenging testset and public benchmarks demonstrate that RADAR significantly outperforms baseline evaluation methods across multiple dimensions, including accuracy, stability, and self-evaluation risk sensitivity. Notably, RADAR achieves a 28.87% improvement in risk identification accuracy compared to the strongest baseline evaluation method.

  AI scientists are emerging computational systems that serve as collaborative partners in discovery. These systems remain difficult to build because they are bespoke, tied to rigid workflows, and lack shared environments that unify tools, data, and analyses into a common ecosystem. In genomics, unified ecosystems have transformed research by enabling interoperability, reuse, and community-driven development; AI scientists require comparable infrastructure. We present ToolUniverse, an ecosystem for building AI scientists from any language or reasoning model across open- and closed-weight models. ToolUniverse standardizes how AI scientists identify and call tools by providing more than 600 machine learning models, datasets, APIs, and scientific packages for data analysis, knowledge retrieval, and experimental design. It automatically refines tool interfaces for correct use by AI scientists, generates new tools from natural language descriptions, iteratively optimizes tool specifications, and composes tools into agentic workflows. In a case study of hypercholesterolemia, ToolUniverse was used to create an AI scientist to identify a potent analog of a drug with favorable predicted properties.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Prediction of consumer behavior is one of the important purposes in marketing, cognitive neuroscience, and human-computer interaction. The electroencephalography (EEG) data can help analyze the decision process by providing detailed information about the brain's neural activity. In this research, a comparative approach is utilized for predicting consumer behavior by EEG data. In the first step, the features of the EEG data from the NeuMa dataset were extracted and cleaned. For the Graph Neural Network (GNN) models, the brain connectivity features were created. Different machine learning models, such as classical models and Graph Neural Networks, are used and compared. The GNN models with different architectures are implemented to have a comprehensive comparison; furthermore, a wide range of classical models, such as ensemble models, are applied, which can be very helpful to show the difference and performance of each model on the dataset. Although the results did not show a significant difference overall, the GNN models generally performed better in some basic criteria where classical models were not satisfactory. This study not only shows that combining EEG signal analysis and machine learning models can provide an approach to deeper understanding of consumer behavior, but also provides a comprehensive comparison between the machine learning models that have been widely used in previous studies in the EEG-based neuromarketing such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), and the models which are not used or rarely used in the field, like Graph Neural Networks.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have emphasized the critical role of fine-tuning (FT) techniques in adapting LLMs to specific tasks, especially when retraining from scratch is computationally infeasible. Fine-tuning enables LLMs to leverage task- or domain-specific data, producing models that more effectively meet the requirements of targeted applications. However, conventional FT approaches often suffer from catastrophic forgetting and suboptimal data efficiency, limiting their real-world applicability. To address these challenges, this paper proposes \textbf{DEAL}, a novel framework that integrates Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) with a continuous fine-tuning strategy. By incorporating knowledge retention and adaptive parameter update modules, the framework mitigates the limitations of existing FT methods while maintaining efficiency. Experiments on 15 diverse datasets show that DEAL consistently outperforms baseline methods, yielding substantial gains in task accuracy and resource efficiency. These findings demonstrate the potential of our approach to advance continual adaptation in LLMs by enhancing task performance while improving resource efficiency.

  While Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly envisioned as intelligent assistants for personalized learning, systematic head-to-head evaluations in authentic learning scenarios remain scarce. This study presents an empirical comparison of three state-of-the-art LLMs on a tutoring task simulating a realistic learning setting. Using a dataset containing a student's responses to ten mixed-format questions with correctness labels, each model was asked to (i) analyze the quiz to identify underlying knowledge components, (ii) infer the student's mastery profile, and (iii) generate targeted guidance for improvement. To mitigate subjectivity and evaluator bias, Gemini was employed as a virtual judge to perform pairwise comparisons across multiple dimensions: accuracy, clarity, actionability, and appropriateness. Results analyzed via the Bradley-Terry model reveal that GPT-4o is generally preferred, producing feedback that is more informative and better structured than its counterparts, whereas DeepSeek-V3 and GLM-4.5 demonstrate intermittent strengths but lower consistency. These findings highlight the feasibility of deploying LLMs as advanced teaching assistants for individualized support and provide methodological insights for subsequent empirical research on LLM-driven personalized learning.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Test-time compute has led to remarkable success in the large language model (LLM) community, particularly for complex tasks, where longer chains of thought (CoTs) are generated to enhance reasoning capabilities. However, growing evidence reveals that such reasoning models often produce CoTs plagued by excessive redundancy, including unnecessary verification steps and repetitive reasoning shifts. The root cause lies in post-training of them that overly rely on outcome reward paradigms, as the data of process reward paradigms, which regulate intermediate reasoning steps, is difficult to construct at scale. To address this, we propose PI, a novel framework for Test-time Prompt Intervention. PI provides an interface to dynamically guide and regulate reasoning paths during inference through timely (When module) and proper (How module) interventions and post-intervention sampling (Which module). This allows human problem-solving expertise and cognitive science principles to be seamlessly integrated into LLMs' reasoning processes, enhancing controllability and interpretability. Extensive experiments across multiple models and datasets demonstrate that PI significantly shortens CoTs while reducing hallucination, yielding more concise and reliable reasoning.

  We introduce Traffic-R1, a 3B-parameter foundation model with human-like reasoning for Traffic signal control (TSC), developed via self-exploration and iterative reinforcement of LLM with expert guidance in a simulated traffic environment. Compared with traditional reinforcement learning and recent LLM-based methods, Traffic-R1 offers three main advantages: zero-shot generalization, transferring unchanged to new road networks and out-of-distribution incidents by leveraging internal traffic-control policies and reasoning; a compact 3B-parameter design that supports real-time inference on mobile-class chips for edge deployment; and an explainable TSC process that enables multi-intersection coordination through communication and an asynchronous communication network. Extensive benchmarks show Traffic-R1 outperforms strong baselines and training-intensive RL controllers. In production, the model now manages signals affecting over 55,000 drivers daily, reduces average queue lengths by more than 5%, and halves operator workload. Our model is available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Test-time scaling (TTS) enhances the performance of large language models (LLMs) by allocating additional compute resources during inference. However, existing research primarily investigates TTS in single-stage tasks; while many real-world problems are multi-stage complex tasks, composed of a sequence of heterogeneous subtasks with each subtask requires LLM of specific capability. Therefore, we study a novel problem: the test-time compute-optimal scaling in multi-stage complex tasks, aiming to select suitable models and allocate budgets per subtask to maximize overall performance. TTS in multi-stage tasks introduces two fundamental challenges: (i) The combinatorial search space of model and budget allocations, combined with the high cost of inference, makes brute-force search impractical. (ii) The optimal model and budget allocations across subtasks are interdependent, increasing the complexity of the compute-optimal search. To address this gap, we conduct extensive pilot experiments on four tasks across six datasets, deriving three empirical insights characterizing the behavior of LLMs in multi-stage complex tasks. Informed by these insights, we propose AgentTTS, an LLM-agent-based framework that autonomously searches for compute-optimal allocations through iterative feedback-driven interactions with the execution environment. Experimental results demonstrate that AgentTTS significantly outperforms traditional and other LLM-based baselines in search efficiency, and shows improved robustness to varying training set sizes and enhanced interpretability.

  The injection molding industry faces critical challenges in preserving and transferring field knowledge, particularly as experienced workers retire and multilingual barriers hinder effective communication. This study introduces IM-Chat, a multi-agent framework based on large language models (LLMs), designed to facilitate knowledge transfer in injection molding. IM-Chat integrates both limited documented knowledge (e.g., troubleshooting tables, manuals) and extensive field data modeled through a data-driven process condition generator that infers optimal manufacturing settings from environmental inputs such as temperature and humidity, enabling robust and context-aware task resolution. By adopting a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) strategy and tool-calling agents within a modular architecture, IM-Chat ensures adaptability without the need for fine-tuning. Performance was assessed across 100 single-tool and 60 hybrid tasks for GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, and GPT-3.5-turbo by domain experts using a 10-point rubric focused on relevance and correctness, and was further supplemented by automated evaluation using GPT-4o guided by a domain-adapted instruction prompt. The evaluation results indicate that more capable models tend to achieve higher accuracy, particularly in complex, tool-integrated scenarios. In addition, compared with the fine-tuned single-agent LLM, IM-Chat demonstrated superior accuracy, particularly in quantitative reasoning, and greater scalability in handling multiple information sources. Overall, these findings demonstrate the viability of multi-agent LLM systems for industrial knowledge workflows and establish IM-Chat as a scalable and generalizable approach to AI-assisted decision support in manufacturing.

  Data science aims to extract insights from data to support decision-making processes. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been increasingly used as assistants for data science, by suggesting ideas, techniques and small code snippets, or for the interpretation of results and reporting. Proper automation of some data-science activities is now promised by the rise of LLM agents, i.e., AI systems powered by an LLM equipped with additional affordances--such as code execution and knowledge bases--that can perform self-directed actions and interact with digital environments. In this paper, we survey the evaluation of LLM assistants and agents for data science. We find (1) a dominant focus on a small subset of goal-oriented activities, largely ignoring data management and exploratory activities; (2) a concentration on pure assistance or fully autonomous agents, without considering intermediate levels of human-AI collaboration; and (3) an emphasis on human substitution, therefore neglecting the possibility of higher levels of automation thanks to task transformation.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Learning to collaborate with previously unseen partners is a fundamental generalization challenge in multi-agent learning, known as Ad Hoc Teamwork (AHT). Existing AHT approaches often adopt a two-stage pipeline, where first, a fixed population of teammates is generated with the idea that they should be representative of the teammates that will be seen at deployment time, and second, an AHT agent is trained to collaborate well with agents in the population. To date, the research community has focused on designing separate algorithms for each stage. This separation has led to algorithms that generate teammates with limited coverage of possible behaviors, and that ignore whether the generated teammates are easy to learn from for the AHT agent. Furthermore, algorithms for training AHT agents typically treat the set of training teammates as static, thus attempting to generalize to previously unseen partner agents without assuming any control over the set of training teammates. This paper presents a unified framework for AHT by reformulating the problem as an open-ended learning process between an AHT agent and an adversarial teammate generator. We introduce ROTATE, a regret-driven, open-ended training algorithm that alternates between improving the AHT agent and generating teammates that probe its deficiencies. Experiments across diverse two-player environments demonstrate that ROTATE significantly outperforms baselines at generalizing to an unseen set of evaluation teammates, thus establishing a new standard for robust and generalizable teamwork.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Despite their strengths, large language models (LLMs) often fail to communicate their confidence accurately, making it difficult to assess when they might be wrong and limiting their reliability. In this work, we demonstrate that reasoning models that engage in extended chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning exhibit superior performance not only in problem-solving but also in accurately expressing their confidence. Specifically, we benchmark six reasoning models across six datasets and find that they achieve strictly better confidence calibration than their non-reasoning counterparts in 33 out of the 36 settings. Our detailed analysis reveals that these gains in calibration stem from the slow thinking behaviors of reasoning models (e.g., exploring alternative approaches and backtracking) which enable them to adjust their confidence dynamically throughout their CoT, making it progressively more accurate. In particular, we find that reasoning models become increasingly better calibrated as their CoT unfolds, a trend not observed in non-reasoning models. Moreover, removing slow thinking behaviors from the CoT leads to a significant drop in calibration. Lastly, we show that non-reasoning models also demonstrate enhanced calibration when simply guided to slow think via in-context learning, fully isolating slow thinking as the source of the calibration gains.

  Preference datasets are essential for incorporating human preferences into pre-trained language models, playing a key role in the success of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback. However, these datasets often demonstrate conflicting alignment objectives, leading to increased vulnerability to jailbreak attacks and challenges in adapting downstream tasks to prioritize specific alignment objectives without negatively impacting others. In this work, we introduce a novel statistical metric, Alignment Dimension Conflict, to quantify the degree of conflict within preference datasets. We then present \texttt{Hummer} and its fine-grained variant, \texttt{Hummer-F}, as innovative pairwise preference datasets with reduced-conflict alignment objectives. \texttt{Hummer} is built based on UltraFeedback and is enhanced by AI feedback from GPT-4, marking as the first preference dataset aimed at reducing the competition between alignment objectives. Furthermore, we develop reward models, HummerRM and HummerRM-F, which employ a hybrid sampling approach to balance diverse alignment objectives effectively. This sampling method positions HummerRM as an ideal model for domain-specific further fine-tuning and reducing vulnerabilities to attacks.

  We present Hubble, a suite of fully open-source large language models (LLMs) for the scientific study of LLM memorization. Hubble models come in standard and perturbed variants: standard models are pretrained on a large English corpus, and perturbed models are trained in the same way but with controlled insertion of text (e.g., book passages, biographies, and test sets) designed to emulate key memorization risks. Our core release includes 8 models -- standard and perturbed models with 1B or 8B parameters, pretrained on 100B or 500B tokens -- establishing that memorization risks are determined by the frequency of sensitive data relative to size of the training corpus (i.e., a password appearing once in a smaller corpus is memorized better than the same password in a larger corpus). Our release also includes 6 perturbed models with text inserted at different pretraining phases, showing that sensitive data without continued exposure can be forgotten. These findings suggest two best practices for addressing memorization risks: to dilute sensitive data by increasing the size of the training corpus, and to order sensitive data to appear earlier in training. Beyond these general empirical findings, Hubble enables a broad range of memorization research; for example, analyzing the biographies reveals how readily different types of private information are memorized. We also demonstrate that the randomized insertions in Hubble make it an ideal testbed for membership inference and machine unlearning, and invite the community to further explore, benchmark, and build upon our work.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards has emerged as a powerful technique for enhancing the complex reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, these methods are fundamentally constrained by the ''learning cliff'' phenomenon: when faced with problems far beyond their current capabilities, models consistently fail, yielding a persistent zero-reward signal. In policy optimization algorithms like GRPO, this collapses the advantage calculation to zero, rendering these difficult problems invisible to the learning gradient and stalling progress. To overcome this, we introduce Scaf-GRPO (Scaffolded Group Relative Policy Optimization), a progressive training framework that strategically provides minimal guidance only when a model's independent learning has plateaued. The framework first diagnoses learning stagnation and then intervenes by injecting tiered in-prompt hints, ranging from abstract concepts to concrete steps, enabling the model to construct a valid solution by itself. Extensive experiments on challenging mathematics benchmarks demonstrate Scaf-GRPO's effectiveness, boosting the pass@1 score of the Qwen2.5-Math-7B model on the AIME24 benchmark by a relative 44.3% over a vanilla GRPO baseline. This result demonstrates our framework provides a robust and effective methodology for unlocking a model's ability to solve problems previously beyond its reach, a critical step towards extending the frontier of autonomous reasoning in LLM.

  Synthetic data has become a cornerstone for scaling large language models, yet its multilingual use remains bottlenecked by translation-based prompts. This strategy inherits English-centric framing and style and neglects cultural dimensions, ultimately constraining model generalization. We argue that the overlooked prompt space-the very inputs that define training distributions-offers a more powerful lever for improving multilingual performance. We introduce a lightweight framework for prompt-space optimization, where translated prompts are systematically transformed for Naturalness, Cultural Adaptation, and Difficulty Enhancement. Using an off-the-shelf multilingual LLM, we apply these transformations to prompts for 12 languages spanning 7 families. Under identical data conditions, our approaches achieve substantial and consistent downstream improvements over the translation-only baseline: +4.7% on Global-MMLU accuracy, +2.4% on Flores XCometXL and +35.3% wins in preferences on mArenaHard. We establish prompt-space optimization as a simple yet powerful paradigm for building multilingual LLMs that are more robust, culturally grounded, and globally capable.

  We study model merging as a practical alternative to conventional adaptation strategies for code-mixed NLP. Starting from a multilingual base model, we: (i) perform continued pre-training (CPT) on unlabeled code-mixed text to obtain an adapted checkpoint, (ii) merge checkpoint with the base model, and (iii) fine-tune (FT) on the downstream task data. We evaluate our approach for sentence classification (sentiment and hate speech) task in English-Hindi (En-Hi) and English-Spanish (En-Es) using XLM-R and Llama-3.2-1B models. Our results show that merged models consistently outperform full fine-tuning and CPT->FT. We observe gains of 2--5 points in F1 over full fine-tuning and ~1-2 points over CPT->FT, indicating that unlabeled data is leveraged more effectively via merging than via CPT alone. Zero-/few-shot prompting with larger LLMs (e.g., Llama-3.3-70B) lags behind fine-tuned and merged checkpoints, underscoring limits of in-context learning for code-mixed inputs. We further test cross-pair transfer by training on En-Hi and evaluating on En-Ta and En-Ml: merged checkpoints transfer more strongly than monolingual-English baselines (e.g., TV/TIES variants reaching 0.65-0.68 F1 vs 0.61-0.63 for full fine-tuning), suggesting that code-mixed knowledge is a more reliable substrate for low-resource pairs. We conclude with adaptation recipes matched to common data regimes (labeled only; labeled+unlabeled; transfer-only) and discuss limitations and scaling considerations for broader tasks and larger models.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Speculative Decoding (SD) accelerates large language model inference by employing a small draft model to generate predictions, which are then verified by a larger target model. The effectiveness of SD hinges on the alignment between these models, which is typically enhanced by Knowledge Distillation (KD). However, conventional KD methods aim to minimize the KL divergence between the draft and target models across all tokens, a goal that is misaligned with the true objective of SD, which is to maximize token acceptance rate. Therefore, draft models often struggle to fully assimilate the target model's knowledge due to capacity constraints, leading to suboptimal performance. To address this challenge, we propose AdaSPEC, a novel method that incorporates selective token filtering into the KD process. AdaSPEC utilizes a reference model to identify and filter out difficult-to-fit tokens, enabling the distillation of a draft model that better aligns with the target model on simpler tokens. This approach improves the overall token acceptance rate without compromising generation quality. We evaluate AdaSPEC across diverse tasks, including arithmetic reasoning, instruction-following, coding, and summarization, using model configurations of 31M/1.4B and 350M/2.7B parameters. Our results demonstrate that AdaSPEC consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art DistillSpec method, achieving higher acceptance rates across all tasks (up to 15\%).

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The long chain-of-thought (LongCoT) capability is central to the recent breakthroughs achieved by large language models in complex reasoning tasks. However, the accompanying issue of ''underthinking'', where models exhibit shallow reasoning by frequently switching thoughts without sufficient exploration, limits both performance and token efficiency. To address this problem, we propose a simple yet effective reasoning strategy: the SmartSwitch inference framework. This framework can be easily integrated into any large language model as a plug-and-play solution, continuously monitoring the model's reasoning process to detect underthinking and guide it toward deeper exploration of promising but overlooked thoughts. Specifically, the perception module identifies points where thoughts switch and evaluates the potential of the preceding thought using an off-the-shelf process reward model (PRM). If a high-potential thought is found to be prematurely abandoned, the intervention module interrupts the ongoing inference, backtracks to the point before the switch, and inserts a "deepening prompt" to encourage further exploration along that promising path. Extensive experiments on challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly enhances the performance of various large language models of different sizes.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Model (LLM) conditioning refers to instructing an LLM to generate content in accordance with the norms and values of a specific culture, beliefs of a particular political orientation, or any desired text-specified semantic conditioning. Unfortunately, prompt engineering does not ensure that LLMs behave in accordance with a desired conditioning due to the inductive bias of the pre-training and alignment datasets. Prior works have focused on fine-tuning LLMs by directly conditioning the LoRA weights; however, such methods introduce a large number of parameters. As a remedy, we propose Zhyper, a parameter-efficient factorized hypernetwork framework that generates context-aware LoRA adapters from textual descriptions. Experiments on multiple benchmarks show that Zhyper achieves competitive performance with up to 26x fewer parameters than the state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, we extend Zhyper to cultural alignment, demonstrating improved generalization to out-of-domain settings and a better capturing of fine-grained contextual values.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The accessibility of legal information remains a constant challenge, particularly for laypersons seeking to understand and apply complex institutional texts. While the European Union provides open access to legislation, parliamentary responses, and regulatory documents, these resources can be challenging for laypeople to explore. In this paper, we introduce EUDial, a proactive multi-turn dialogue dataset constructed from 204 blogs curated by the Citizens' Enquiries Unit (AskEP) of the European Parliamentary Research Service. EUDial contains 880 dialogue turns (averaging 4.3 turns per dialogue), where each dialogue includes initial questions, structured answers, and follow-up questions. Beyond dataset construction, we propose the LexGuide framework that leverages retrieval-augmented generation with hierarchical topic organization to structure dialogue progression, ensuring both comprehensive coverage of legal aspects and coherence across conversational turns. The results demonstrate that proactive, structured navigation closes the gap between the availability of legal information and citizen comprehension, establishing EUDial and LexGuide as practical resources for advancing proactive legal dialogue systems.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Prompting is a common approach for leveraging LMs in zero-shot settings. However, the underlying mechanisms that enable LMs to perform diverse tasks without task-specific supervision remain poorly understood. Studying the relationship between prompting and the quality of internal representations can shed light on how pre-trained embeddings may support in-context task solving. In this empirical study, we conduct a series of probing experiments on prompt embeddings, analyzing various combinations of prompt templates for zero-shot classification. Our findings show that while prompting affects the quality of representations, these changes do not consistently correlate with the relevance of the prompts to the target task. This result challenges the assumption that more relevant prompts necessarily lead to better representations. We further analyze potential factors that may contribute to this unexpected behavior.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Human communication is motivated: people speak, write, and create content with a particular communicative intent in mind. As a result, information that large language models (LLMs) and AI agents process is inherently framed by humans' intentions and incentives. People are adept at navigating such nuanced information: we routinely identify benevolent or self-serving motives in order to decide what statements to trust. For LLMs to be effective in the real world, they too must critically evaluate content by factoring in the motivations of the source -- for instance, weighing the credibility of claims made in a sales pitch. In this paper, we undertake a comprehensive study of whether LLMs have this capacity for motivational vigilance. We first employ controlled experiments from cognitive science to verify that LLMs' behavior is consistent with rational models of learning from motivated testimony, and find they successfully discount information from biased sources in a human-like manner. We then extend our evaluation to sponsored online adverts, a more naturalistic reflection of LLM agents' information ecosystems. In these settings, we find that LLMs' inferences do not track the rational models' predictions nearly as closely -- partly due to additional information that distracts them from vigilance-relevant considerations. However, a simple steering intervention that boosts the salience of intentions and incentives substantially increases the correspondence between LLMs and the rational model. These results suggest that LLMs possess a basic sensitivity to the motivations of others, but generalizing to novel real-world settings will require further improvements to these models.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present CoSense-LLM, an edge-first framework that turns continuous multimodal sensor streams (for example Wi-Fi CSI, IMU, audio, RFID, and lightweight vision) into compact, verifiable semantic tokens and coordinates with large language models under explicit latency, energy, bandwidth, and privacy constraints. CoSense-LLM has four parts: (i) SenseFusion, a lightweight encoder that aligns sensor embeddings with language and compresses them into short discrete code sequences; (ii) Edge-RAG, a local hybrid retrieval layer that grounds generation in site specific policies and notes; (iii) PromptRouter, a cost and uncertainty aware policy that selects edge only generation, edge plus retrieval, or compact cloud escalation; and (iv) Secure Execution, an auditable redaction path that enforces data minimization so raw waveforms never leave the device. The system works with modern serving optimizations, including paged or streaming KV caches, FlashAttention style kernels, speculative decoding, and quantized LoRA adapters, and supports on device personalization and federated updates under non IID drift. Across home, office, and clinic deployments, CoSense-LLM delivers grounded explanations while meeting tight service level objectives: it sustains sub second (p95) end to end latency on edge dominant paths, reduces inter tier token and bandwidth costs by preferring local retrieval grounded responses, and preserves privacy by transmitting only discrete codes and redacted metadata. Ablations show that Edge-RAG improves factual consistency and reduces contradictions, calibrated uncertainty enables selective abstention and controlled escalations, and KV plus decoding accelerators lower energy per decision. The results support an edge first design that treats semantics, privacy, and predictable latency as co equal goals for large model deployments in interference prone environments.

  Recent reasoning Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable problem-solving abilities but often generate long thinking traces whose utility is unclear. Our work aims to improve their efficiency, enabling them to reach high performance without overthinking. First, we analyze the entropy of token probabilities in reasoning traces. Across three models, we observe a consistent U-shaped entropy pattern: high entropy on easy problems despite high accuracy, low entropy on problems with medium difficulty, and high entropy on hard problems reflecting uncertainty. Specifically, we notice 22--25\% entropy reduction from easy to medium difficulty regions, suggesting an {overthinking} phenomenon on easy instances. Building on these insights, we introduce \textbf{DiffAdapt}, a lightweight framework that selects Easy/Normal/Hard inference strategies per question based on their difficulty and reasoning trace entropy. Each inference strategy consists of a fixed prompt, temperature and maximum token length. In contrast to existing efficiency optimization methods, our approach does not fine-tune base LLM but a small probe that classifies LLM's final hidden state, allowing inexpensive adaptation. We comprehensively evaluate our method on five models and eight benchmarks. Our method achieves comparable or improved accuracy while reducing token usage by up to 22.4\%, establishing a practical path toward compute-efficient reasoning.

  Transformer models have significantly advanced the field of emotion recognition. However, there are still open challenges when exploring open-ended queries for Large Language Models (LLMs). Although current models offer good results, automatic emotion analysis in open texts presents significant challenges, such as contextual ambiguity, linguistic variability, and difficulty interpreting complex emotional expressions. These limitations make the direct application of generalist models difficult. Accordingly, this work compares the effectiveness of fine-tuning and prompt engineering in emotion detection in three distinct scenarios: (i) performance of fine-tuned pre-trained models and general-purpose LLMs using simple prompts; (ii) effectiveness of different emotion prompt designs with LLMs; and (iii) impact of emotion grouping techniques on these models. Experimental tests attain metrics above 70% with a fine-tuned pre-trained model for emotion recognition. Moreover, the findings highlight that LLMs require structured prompt engineering and emotion grouping to enhance their performance. These advancements improve sentiment analysis, human-computer interaction, and understanding of user behavior across various domains.

  Retrieval-augmented generation has emerged as one of the most effective approaches for code completion, particularly when context from a surrounding repository is essential. However, incorporating context significantly extends sequence length, leading to slower inference - a critical limitation for interactive settings such as IDEs. In this work, we introduce LlavaCode, a framework that compresses code into compact, semantically rich representations interpretable by code LLM, enhancing generation quality while reducing the retrieved context to only a few compressed single-token vectors. Using a small projector module we can significantly increase the EM and ES metrics of coding model with negligible latency increase. Our experiments demonstrate that compressed context enables 20-38% reduction in Time-to-First-Token (TTFT) on line completion tasks compared to full-RAG pipelines.

  With social media growth, users employ stylistic fonts and font-like emoji to express individuality, creating visually appealing text that remains human-readable. However, these fonts introduce hidden vulnerabilities in NLP models: while humans easily read stylistic text, models process these characters as distinct tokens, causing interference. We identify this human-model perception gap and propose a style-based attack, Style Attack Disguise (SAD). We design two sizes: light for query efficiency and strong for superior attack performance. Experiments on sentiment classification and machine translation across traditional models, LLMs, and commercial services demonstrate SAD's strong attack performance. We also show SAD's potential threats to multimodal tasks including text-to-image and text-to-speech generation.

  In the era of social networks and rapid misinformation spread, news analysis remains a critical task. Detecting fake news across multiple languages, particularly beyond English, poses significant challenges. Cross-lingual news comparison offers a promising approach to verify information by leveraging external sources in different languages (Chen and Shu, 2024). However, existing datasets for cross-lingual news analysis (Chen et al., 2022a) were manually curated by journalists and experts, limiting their scalability and adaptability to new languages. In this work, we address this gap by introducing a scalable, explainable crowdsourcing pipeline for cross-lingual news similarity assessment. Using this pipeline, we collected a novel dataset CrossNews-UA of news pairs in Ukrainian as a central language with linguistically and contextually relevant languages-Polish, Russian, and English. Each news pair is annotated for semantic similarity with detailed justifications based on the 4W criteria (Who, What, Where, When). We further tested a range of models, from traditional bag-of-words, Transformer-based architectures to large language models (LLMs). Our results highlight the challenges in multilingual news analysis and offer insights into models performance.

  With the increasing adoption of large language models (LLMs), ensuring their alignment with social norms has become a critical concern. While prior research has examined bias detection in various languages, there remains a significant gap in resources addressing social biases within Persian cultural contexts. In this work, we introduce PBBQ, a comprehensive benchmark dataset designed to evaluate social biases in Persian LLMs. Our benchmark, which encompasses 16 cultural categories, was developed through questionnaires completed by 250 diverse individuals across multiple demographics, in close collaboration with social science experts to ensure its validity. The resulting PBBQ dataset contains over 37,000 carefully curated questions, providing a foundation for the evaluation and mitigation of bias in Persian language models. We benchmark several open-source LLMs, a closed-source model, and Persian-specific fine-tuned models on PBBQ. Our findings reveal that current LLMs exhibit significant social biases across Persian culture. Additionally, by comparing model outputs to human responses, we observe that LLMs often replicate human bias patterns, highlighting the complex interplay between learned representations and culturalthis http URLacceptance of the paper, our PBBQ dataset will be publicly available for use in future work.

  _Danni Liu, Jan Niehues_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Fine-tuning multilingual foundation models on specific languages often induces catastrophic forgetting, degrading performance on languages unseen in fine-tuning. While this phenomenon is widely-documented, the literature presents fragmented results about when forgetting occurs. To address this ambiguity, we conduct a systematic empirical study using machine translation as a testbed to identify the conditions that trigger catastrophic forgetting in multilingual fine-tuning. Through controlled experiments across different model architectures, data scales, and fine-tuning approaches, we reveal that the relative scale between model and data size is a primary determinant of forgetting. Moreover, we demonstrate that a model's instruction-following ability is more critical for retaining multilingual knowledge than its architecture. Contrary to assumptions, parameter-efficient fine-tuning offers no clear advantage over full fine-tuning in mitigating forgetting. Lastly, we show that cross-lingual alignment can mitigate forgetting while also facilitating positive transfer to unseen target languages.

  Large language model (LLM) routers improve the efficiency of multi-model systems by directing each query to the most appropriate model while leveraging the diverse strengths of heterogeneous LLMs. Most existing approaches frame routing as a classification problem based solely on the input query. While this reduces overhead by avoiding inference across all models, it overlooks valuable information that could be gleaned from potential outputs and fails to capture implicit intent or contextual nuances that often emerge only during response generation. These limitations can result in suboptimal routing decisions, particularly for complex or ambiguous queries that require deeper semantic understanding. To address this challenge, we propose Lookahead, a routing framework that "foresees" potential model outputs by predicting their latent representations and uses these predictions to guide model selection, thus enabling more informed routing without full inference. Within this framework, we implement two approaches based on causal and masked language models. Empirical evaluations across seven public benchmarks - spanning instruction following, mathematical reasoning, and code generation - show that Lookahead consistently outperforms existing routing baselines, achieving an average performance gain of 7.7% over the state-of-the-art.

  Transformer language models typically operate with a fixed-length context window, which has grown in step with large-scale pretraining datasets. In the BabyLM Challenge, however, many past submissions have defaulted to using much shorter sequence lengths. We examine the impact of sequence length on BabyLM pretraining, to answer the simple question: what sequence length should we be using when training Baby LMs? Using 100M-word training data and fixed compute budgets, we compare 125M-parameter Mamba and OPT models, finding that although longer is often better, the optimal length depends on both task and architecture. Shorter sequences are sufficient for grammatical generalization tasks whereas longer contexts benefit morphological analogical reasoning tasks.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Although membership inference attacks (MIAs) and machine-generated text detection target different goals, identifying training samples and synthetic texts, their methods often exploit similar signals based on a language model's probability distribution. Despite this shared methodological foundation, the two tasks have been independently studied, which may lead to conclusions that overlook stronger methods and valuable insights developed in the other task. In this work, we theoretically and empirically investigate the transferability, i.e., how well a method originally developed for one task performs on the other, between MIAs and machine text detection. For our theoretical contribution, we prove that the metric that achieves the asymptotically highest performance on both tasks is the same. We unify a large proportion of the existing literature in the context of this optimal metric and hypothesize that the accuracy with which a given method approximates this metric is directly correlated with its transferability. Our large-scale empirical experiments, including 7 state-of-the-art MIA methods and 5 state-of-the-art machine text detectors across 13 domains and 10 generators, demonstrate very strong rank correlation (rho > 0.6) in cross-task performance. We notably find that Binoculars, originally designed for machine text detection, achieves state-of-the-art performance on MIA benchmarks as well, demonstrating the practical impact of the transferability. Our findings highlight the need for greater cross-task awareness and collaboration between the two research communities. To facilitate cross-task developments and fair evaluations, we introduce MINT, a unified evaluation suite for MIAs and machine-generated text detection, with implementation of 15 recent methods from both tasks.

  Training computer-use agents requires massive amounts of GUI interaction data, but manually annotating action trajectories at scale is prohibitively expensive. We present VideoAgentTrek, a scalable pipeline that automatically mines training data from publicly available screen-recorded videos at web scale, eliminating the need for manual annotation. Our approach addresses a key challenge: raw videos contain implicit demonstrations but lack explicit action labels. To solve this, we develop Video2Action, an inverse dynamics module (IDM) with two components: (1) a video grounding model that detects and localizes GUI actions with precise temporal boundaries and context, and (2) an action-content recognizer that extracts structured parameters like click coordinates and typed text with high fidelity. Applied to 39,000 YouTube tutorial videos, our pipeline generates 1.52 million interaction steps automatically. We leverage this data through continued pretraining followed by supervised fine-tuning. On OSWorld-Verified, our approach improves task success rates from 9.3% (SFT-only baseline) to 15.8%, a 70% relative improvement. On AgentNetBench, step accuracy increases from 64.1% to 69.3%. Our results demonstrate that passive internet videos can be transformed into high-quality supervision for computer-use agents, providing a scalable alternative to expensive manual annotation.

  Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) encode rich factual knowledge via cross-modal pre-training, yet their static representations struggle to maintain an accurate understanding of time-sensitive factual knowledge. Existing benchmarks remain constrained by static designs, inadequately evaluating LMMs' ability to understand time-sensitive knowledge. To address this gap, we propose MINED, a comprehensive benchmark that evaluates temporal awareness along 6 key dimensions and 11 challenging tasks: cognition, awareness, trustworthiness, understanding, reasoning, and robustness. MINED is constructed from Wikipedia by two professional annotators, containing 2,104 time-sensitive knowledge samples spanning six knowledge types. Evaluating 15 widely used LMMs on MINED shows that Gemini-2.5-Pro achieves the highest average CEM score of 63.07, while most open-source LMMs still lack time understanding ability. Meanwhile, LMMs perform best on organization knowledge, whereas their performance is weakest on sport. To address these challenges, we investigate the feasibility of updating time-sensitive knowledge in LMMs through knowledge editing methods and observe that LMMs can effectively update knowledge via knowledge editing methods in single editing scenarios.

  To bridge the gap between performance-oriented benchmarks and the evaluation of cognitively inspired models, we introduce BLiSS 1.0, a Benchmark of Learner Interlingual Syntactic Structure. Our benchmark operationalizes a new paradigm of selective tolerance, testing whether a model finds a naturalistic learner error more plausible than a matched, artificial error within the same sentence. Constructed from over 2.8 million naturalistic learner sentences, BLiSS provides 136,867 controlled triplets (corrected, learner, artificial) for this purpose. Experiments on a diverse suite of models demonstrate that selective tolerance is a distinct capability from standard grammaticality, with performance clustering strongly by training paradigm. This validates BLiSS as a robust tool for measuring how different training objectives impact a model's alignment with the systematic patterns of human language acquisition.

  This paper describes the DFKI-MLT submission to the WMT-SLT 2022 sign language translation (SLT) task from Swiss German Sign Language (video) into German (text). State-of-the-art techniques for SLT use a generic seq2seq architecture with customized input embeddings. Instead of word embeddings as used in textual machine translation, SLT systems use features extracted from video frames. Standard approaches often do not benefit from temporal features. In our participation, we present a system that learns spatio-temporal feature representations and translation in a single model, resulting in a real end-to-end architecture expected to better generalize to new data sets. Our best system achieved $5\pm1$ BLEU points on the development set, but the performance on the test dropped to $0.11\pm0.06$ BLEU points.

  Identifying which text spans refer to entities -- mention detection -- is both foundational for information extraction and a known performance bottleneck. We introduce ToMMeR, a lightweight model (<300K parameters) probing mention detection capabilities from early LLM layers. Across 13 NER benchmarks, ToMMeR achieves 93\% recall zero-shot, with over 90\% precision using an LLM as a judge showing that ToMMeR rarely produces spurious predictions despite high recall. Cross-model analysis reveals that diverse architectures (14M-15B parameters) converge on similar mention boundaries (DICE >75\%), confirming that mention detection emerges naturally from language modeling. When extended with span classification heads, ToMMeR achieves near SOTA NER performance (80-87\% F1 on standard benchmarks). Our work provides evidence that structured entity representations exist in early transformer layers and can be efficiently recovered with minimal parameters.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Sign language translation (SLT) is typically trained with text in a single spoken language, which limits scalability and cross-language generalization. Earlier approaches have replaced gloss supervision with text-based sentence embeddings, but up to now, these remain tied to a specific language and modality. In contrast, here we employ language-agnostic, multimodal embeddings trained on text and speech from multiple languages to supervise SLT, enabling direct multilingual translation. To address data scarcity, we propose a coupled augmentation method that combines multilingual target augmentations (i.e. translations into many languages) with video-level perturbations, improving model robustness. Experiments show consistent BLEURT gains over text-only sentence embedding supervision, with larger improvements in low-resource settings. Our results demonstrate that language-agnostic embedding supervision, combined with coupled augmentation, provides a scalable and semantically robust alternative to traditional SLT training.

Unfortunately, gloss labelled sign language data is usually not available at scale and, when available, gloss annotations widely differ from dataset to dataset. We present a novel approach using sentence embeddings of the target sentences at training time that take the role of glosses. The new kind of supervision does not need any manual annotation but it is learned on raw textual data. As our approach easily facilitates multilinguality, we evaluate it on datasets covering German (PHOENIX-2014T) and American (How2Sign) sign languages and experiment with mono- and multilingual sentence embeddings and translation systems. Our approach significantly outperforms other gloss-free approaches, setting the new state-of-the-art for data sets where glosses are not available and when no additional SLT datasets are used for pretraining, diminishing the gap between gloss-free and gloss-dependent systems.

  Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models, the state-of-the-art in large-scale AI, achieve high quality by sparsely activating parameters. However, their reliance on routing between a few monolithic experts via a top-k mechanism creates a "quality cliff", offering only a few coarse-grained operating points. This inflexibility forces a difficult trade-off between cost and quality, preventing adaptation to diverse Service Level Objectives (SLOs) and leading to significant resource over-provisioning.This paper introduces MoE-Prism, a model-system co-design that transforms rigid MoE models into elastic services. Our methodology is divided into two phases. First, an \emph{Offline Refactoring Engine} systematically deconstructs monolithic experts into fine-grained "sub-experts." This engine employs a partitioning optimization solver that uses a metaheuristic-based approach to group neurons, preserving functional locality without requiring retraining. Second, an \emph{Online Scheduling Engine} leverages this new elasticity through QoS-aware scheduling. It implements specialized policies to solve complex system problems, including maximizing throughput in cloud deployments and managing latency-optimized offloading for memory-constrained devices. Our evaluation across three different MoE models shows that MoE-Prismprovides over 4 times more distinct, stable operating points than the baseline. This allows an AI service to dynamically improve throughput by up to 19.9\% under a strict latency budget or reduce latency by up to 10.36\% under limited resources. MoE-Prism provides the critical "control knob" to bridge the model-system gap, enabling the next generation of adaptive, efficient, and QoS-aware AI services.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reasoning over long contexts is essential for large language models. While reinforcement learning (RL) enhances short-context reasoning by inducing "Aha" moments in chain-of-thought, the advanced thinking patterns required for long-context reasoning remain largely unexplored, and high-difficulty RL data are scarce. In this paper, we introduce LoongRL, a data-driven RL method for advanced long-context reasoning. Central to LoongRL is KeyChain, a synthesis approach that transforms short multi-hop QA into high-difficulty long-context tasks by inserting UUID chains that hide the true question among large collections of distracting documents. Solving these tasks requires the model to trace the correct chain step-by-step, identify the true question, retrieve relevant facts and reason over them to answer correctly. RL training on KeyChain data induces an emergent plan-retrieve-reason-recheck reasoning pattern that generalizes far beyond training length. Models trained at 16K effectively solve 128K tasks without prohibitive full-length RL rollout costs. On Qwen2.5-7B and 14B, LoongRL substantially improves long-context multi-hop QA accuracy by +23.5% and +21.1% absolute gains. The resulting LoongRL-14B reaches a score of 74.2, rivaling much larger frontier models such as o3-mini (74.5) and DeepSeek-R1 (74.9). It also improves long-context retrieval, passes all 128K needle-in-a-haystack stress tests, and preserves short-context reasoning capabilities.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The creation of high-quality datasets to improve Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning remains a significant challenge, as current methods often suffer from generating low-quality/incorrect answers and limited information richness from available data sources. To address this, we propose AgenticMath, a novel agentic pipeline for generating high-quality mathematical question-answer pairs to enhance the supervised fine-tuning of LLMs. Our method operates through four stages: (1) Seed Question Filter that selects questions with high information richness, complexity, and clarity; (2) an Agentic Question Rephrase step that employs a multi-agent system to generate diverse, logically consistent paraphrases; (3) an Answer Augment step where rewrite answers using chain-of-thought reasoning to enhance numerical and logical correctness, without reliance on human-provided labels; and (4) a final Question and Answer Evaluation that retains only the most superior pairs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, fine-tuning 3B-8B parameter LLMs on AgenticMath generated datasets (comprising only 30-60K math samples) achieves competitive or superior performance on diverse in domain and out-of-domain mathematical reasoning benchmarks compared to baselines trained on much more data (e.g., 400K or 2.3M samples). Our work demonstrates that targeted, high-quality data generation is a more efficient path to improving mathematical reasoning in LLMs than large-scale, low-quality alternatives.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present M3-SLU, a new multimodal large language model (MLLM) benchmark for evaluating multi-speaker, multi-turn spoken language understanding. While recent models show strong performance in speech and text comprehension, they still struggle with speaker-attributed reasoning, the ability to understand who said what and when in natural conversations. M3-SLU is built from four open corpora (CHiME-6, MELD, MultiDialog, and AMI) and comprises over 12,000 validated instances with paired audio, transcripts, and metadata. It includes two tasks: (1) Speaker-Attributed Question Answering and (2) Speaker Attribution via Utterance Matching. We provide baseline results for both cascaded pipelines and end-to-end MLLMs, evaluated using an LLM-as-Judge and accuracy metrics. Results show that while models can capture what was said, they often fail to identify who said it, revealing a key gap in speaker-aware dialogue understanding. M3-SLU offers as a challenging benchmark to advance research in speaker-aware multimodal understanding.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In conversation, humans use multimodal cues, such as speech, gestures, and gaze, to manage turn-taking. While linguistic and acoustic features are informative, gestures provide complementary cues for modeling these transitions. To study this, we introduce DnD Gesture++, an extension of the multi-party DnD Gesture corpus enriched with 2,663 semantic gesture annotations spanning iconic, metaphoric, deictic, and discourse types. Using this dataset, we model turn-taking prediction through a Mixture-of-Experts framework integrating text, audio, and gestures. Experiments show that incorporating semantically guided gestures yields consistent performance gains over baselines, demonstrating their complementary role in multimodal turn-taking.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Removing Personally Identifiable Information (PII) from clinical notes in Electronic Health Records (EHRs) is essential for research and AI development. While Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful, their high computational costs and the data privacy risks of API-based services limit their use, especially in low-resource settings. To address this, we developed LOGICAL (Local Obfuscation by GLINER for Impartial Context-Aware Lineage), an efficient, locally deployable PII removal system built on a fine-tuned Generalist and Lightweight Named Entity Recognition (GLiNER) model. We used 1515 clinical documents from a psychiatric hospital's EHR system. We defined nine PII categories for removal. A modern-gliner-bi-large-v1.0 model was fine-tuned on 2849 text instances and evaluated on a test set of 376 instances using character-level precision, recall, and F1-score. We compared its performance against Microsoft Azure NER, Microsoft Presidio, and zero-shot prompting with Gemini-Pro-2.5 and Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct. The fine-tuned GLiNER model achieved superior performance, with an overall micro-average F1-score of 0.980, significantly outperforming Gemini-Pro-2.5 (F1-score: 0.845). LOGICAL correctly sanitised 95% of documents completely, compared to 64% for the next-best solution. The model operated efficiently on a standard laptop without a dedicated GPU. However, a 2% entity-level false negative rate underscores the need for human-in-the-loop validation across all tested systems. Fine-tuned, specialised transformer models like GLiNER offer an accurate, computationally efficient, and secure solution for PII removal from clinical notes. This "sanitisation at the source" approach is a practical alternative to resource-intensive LLMs, enabling the creation of de-identified datasets for research and AI development while preserving data privacy, particularly in resource-constrained environments.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We propose integration of reasoning into speech large language models (speechLLMs) for the end-to-end slot-filling task. Inspired by the recent development of reasoning LLMs, we use a chain-of-thought framework to decompose the slot-filling task into multiple reasoning steps, create a reasoning dataset and apply the supervised fine-tuning strategy to a speechLLM. We distinguish between regular and reasoning speechLLMs and experiment with different types and sizes of LLMs as their text foundation models. We demonstrate performance improvements by introducing reasoning (intermediate) steps. However, we show that a reasoning textual LLM developed mainly for math, logic and coding domains might be inferior as a foundation model for a reasoning speechLLM. We further show that hybrid speechLLMs, built on a hybrid text foundation LLM and fine-tuned to preserve both direct and reasoning modes of operation, have better performance than those fine-tuned employing only one mode of operation.

  Text summarization is a crucial task that requires the simultaneous optimization of multiple objectives, including consistency, coherence, relevance, and fluency, which presents considerable challenges. Although large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance, enhanced by reinforcement learning (RL), few studies have focused on optimizing the multi-objective problem of summarization through RL based on LLMs. In this paper, we introduce hypervolume optimization (HVO), a novel optimization strategy that dynamically adjusts the scores between groups during the reward process in RL by using the hypervolume method. This method guides the model's optimization to progressively approximate the pareto front, thereby generating balanced summaries across multiple objectives. Experimental results on several representative summarization datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms group relative policy optimization (GRPO) in overall scores and shows more balanced performance across different dimensions. Moreover, a 7B foundation model enhanced by HVO performs comparably to GPT-4 in the summarization task, while maintaining a shorter generation length. Our code is publicly available atthis https URL

  The increasing reliance on natural language generation (NLG) models, particularly large language models, has raised concerns about the reliability and accuracy of their outputs. A key challenge is hallucination, where models produce plausible but incorrect information. As a result, hallucination detection has become a critical task. In this work, we introduce a comprehensive hallucination taxonomy with 11 categories across various NLG tasks and propose the HAllucination Detection (HAD) modelsthis https URL, which integrate hallucination detection, span-level identification, and correction into a single inference process. Trained on an elaborate synthetic dataset of about 90K samples, our HAD models are versatile and can be applied to various NLG tasks. We also carefully annotate a test set for hallucination detection, called HADTest, which contains 2,248 samples. Evaluations on in-domain and out-of-domain test sets show that our HAD models generally outperform the existing baselines, achieving state-of-the-art results on HaluEval, FactCHD, and FaithBench, confirming their robustness and versatility.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Multimodal Models encode extensive factual knowledge in their pre-trained weights. However, its knowledge remains static and limited, unable to keep pace with real-world developments, which hinders continuous knowledge acquisition. Effective knowledge injection thus becomes critical, involving two goals: knowledge adaptation (injecting new knowledge) and knowledge retention (preserving old knowledge). Existing methods often struggle to learn new knowledge and suffer from catastrophic forgetting. To address this, we propose KORE, a synergistic method of KnOwledge-oRientEd augmentations and constraints for injecting new knowledge into large multimodal models while preserving old knowledge. Unlike general text or image data augmentation, KORE automatically converts individual knowledge items into structured and comprehensive knowledge to ensure that the model accurately learns new knowledge, enabling accurate adaptation. Meanwhile, KORE stores previous knowledge in the covariance matrix of LMM's linear layer activations and initializes the adapter by projecting the original weights into the matrix's null space, defining a fine-tuning direction that minimizes interference with previous knowledge, enabling powerful retention. Extensive experiments on various LMMs, including LLaVA-v1.5-7B, LLaVA-v1.5-13B, and Qwen2.5-VL-7B, show that KORE achieves superior new knowledge injection performance and effectively mitigates catastrophic forgetting.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Current large language models (LLMs) often suffer from hallucination issues, i,e, generating content that appears factual but is actually unreliable. A typical hallucination detection pipeline involves response decomposition (i.e., claim extraction), query generation, evidence collection (i.e., search or retrieval), and claim verification. However, existing methods exhibit limitations in the first two stages, such as context loss during claim extraction and low specificity in query generation, resulting in degraded performance across the hallucination detection pipeline. In this work, we introduce JointCQthis https URL, a joint claim-and-query generation framework designed to construct an effective and efficient claim-query generator. Our framework leverages elaborately designed evaluation criteria to filter synthesized training data, and finetunes a language model for joint claim extraction and query generation, providing reliable and informative inputs for downstream search and verification. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms previous methods on multiple open-domain QA hallucination detection benchmarks, advancing the goal of more trustworthy and transparent language model systems.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Since the introduction of the Model Context Protocol (MCP), the number of available tools for Large Language Models (LLMs) has increased significantly. These task-specific tool sets offer an alternative to general-purpose tools such as web browsers, while being easier to develop and maintain than GUIs. However, current general-purpose agents predominantly rely on web browsers for interacting with the environment. Here, we introduce TheMCPCompany, a benchmark for evaluating tool-calling agents on tasks that involve interacting with various real-world services. We use the REST APIs of these services to create MCP servers, which include over 18,000 tools. We also provide manually annotated ground-truth tools for each task. In our experiments, we use the ground truth tools to show the potential of tool-calling agents for both improving performance and reducing costs assuming perfect tool retrieval. Next, we explore agent performance using tool retrieval to study the real-world practicality of tool-based agents. While all models with tool retrieval perform similarly or better than browser-based agents, smaller models cannot take full advantage of the available tools through retrieval. On the other hand, GPT-5's performance with tool retrieval is very close to its performance with ground-truth tools. Overall, our work shows that the most advanced reasoning models are effective at discovering tools in simpler environments, but seriously struggle with navigating complex enterprise environments. TheMCPCompany reveals that navigating tens of thousands of tools and combining them in non-trivial ways to solve complex problems is still a challenging task for current models and requires both better reasoning and better retrieval models.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Difficulty-controllable question generation for reading comprehension has gained significant attention in the field of education as a fundamental tool for adaptive learning support. Although several neural question generation methods have recently succeeded in controlling difficulty, conventional approaches still face two major limitations. First, they cannot directly generate multiple-choice questions, which are the most widely used question type in educational contexts. Second, they are not explicitly trained to optimize the accuracy of difficulty control, leaving room for further improvement in difficulty controllability. To address these limitations, this study proposes a novel difficulty-controllable multiple-choice question generation method for reading comprehension which leverages a large language model trained using a direct preference optimization technique to improve the accuracy of difficulty control.

  Understanding and reasoning over complex spreadsheets remain fundamental challenges for large language models (LLMs), which often struggle with accurately capturing the complex structure of tables and ensuring reasoning correctness. In this work, we propose SheetBrain, a neuro-symbolic dual workflow agent framework designed for accurate reasoning over tabular data, supporting both spreadsheet question answering and manipulation tasks. SheetBrain comprises three core modules: an understanding module, which produces a comprehensive overview of the spreadsheet - including sheet summary and query-based problem insight to guide reasoning; an execution module, which integrates a Python sandbox with preloaded table-processing libraries and an Excel helper toolkit for effective multi-turn reasoning; and a validation module, which verifies the correctness of reasoning and answers, triggering re-execution when necessary. We evaluate SheetBrain on multiple public tabular QA and manipulation benchmarks, and introduce SheetBench, a new benchmark targeting large, multi-table, and structurally complex spreadsheets. Experimental results show that SheetBrain significantly improves accuracy on both existing benchmarks and the more challenging scenarios presented in SheetBench.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Existing linguistic knowledge bases such as URIEL+ provide valuable geographic, genetic and typological distances for cross-lingual transfer but suffer from two key limitations. One, their one-size-fits-all vector representations are ill-suited to the diverse structures of linguistic data, and two, they lack a principled method for aggregating these signals into a single, comprehensive score. In this paper, we address these gaps by introducing a framework for type-matched language distances. We propose novel, structure-aware representations for each distance type: speaker-weighted distributions for geography, hyperbolic embeddings for genealogy, and a latent variables model for typology. We unify these signals into a robust, task-agnostic composite distance. In selecting transfer languages, our representations and composite distances consistently improve performance across a wide range of NLP tasks, providing a more principled and effective toolkit for multilingual research.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) has created a diverse ecosystem of models with highly varying performance and costs, necessitating effective query routing to balance performance and expense. Current routing systems often rely on a centralized external router trained on a fixed set of LLMs, making them inflexible and prone to poor performance since the small router can not fully understand the knowledge boundaries of different LLMs. We introduce DiSRouter (Distributed Self-Router), a novel paradigm that shifts from centralized control to distributed routing. In DiSRouter, a query traverses a network of LLM agents, each independently deciding whether to answer or route to other agents based on its own self-awareness, its ability to judge its competence. This distributed design offers superior flexibility, scalability, and generalizability. To enable this, we propose a two-stage Self-Awareness Training pipeline that enhances each LLM's self-awareness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DiSRouter significantly outperforms existing routing methods in utility across various scenarios, effectively distinguishes between easy and hard queries, and shows strong generalization to out-of-domain tasks. Our work validates that leveraging an LLM's intrinsic self-awareness is more effective than external assessment, paving the way for more modular and efficient multi-agent systems.

  Evaluating conversational AI systems that use external tools is challenging, as errors can arise from complex interactions among user, agent, and tools. While existing evaluation methods assess either user satisfaction or agents' tool-calling capabilities, they fail to capture critical errors in multi-turn tool-augmented dialogues-such as when agents misinterpret tool results yet appear satisfactory to users. We introduce TRACE, a benchmark of systematically synthesized tool-augmented conversations covering diverse error cases, and SCOPE, an evaluation framework that automatically discovers diverse error patterns and evaluation rubrics in tool-augmented dialogues. Experiments show SCOPE significantly outperforms the baseline, particularly on challenging cases where user satisfaction signals are misleading.

  This paper presents a question answering system that operates exclusively on a knowledge graph retrieval without relying on retrieval augmented generation (RAG) with large language models (LLMs). Instead, a small paraphraser model is used to paraphrase the entity relationship edges retrieved from querying the knowledge graph. The proposed pipeline is divided into two main stages. The first stage involves pre-processing a document to generate sets of question-answer (QA) pairs. The second stage converts these QAs into a knowledge graph from which graph-based retrieval is performed using embeddings and fuzzy techniques. The graph is queried, re-ranked, and paraphrased to generate a final answer. This work includes an evaluation using LLM-as-a-judge on the CRAG benchmark, which resulted in accuracies of 71.9% and 54.4% using LLAMA-3.2 and GPT-3.5-Turbo, respectively.

  LLMs often fail to handle temporal knowledge conflicts--contradictions arising when facts evolve over time within their training data. Existing studies evaluate this phenomenon through benchmarks built on structured knowledge bases like Wikidata, but they focus on widely-covered, easily-memorized popular entities and lack the dynamic structure needed to fairly evaluate LLMs with different knowledge cut-off dates. We introduce evolveQA, a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate LLMs on temporally evolving knowledge, constructed from 3 real-world, time-stamped corpora: AWS updates, Azure changes, and WHO disease outbreak reports. Our framework identifies naturally occurring knowledge evolution and generates questions with gold answers tailored to different LLM knowledge cut-off dates. Through extensive evaluation of 12 open and closed-source LLMs across 3 knowledge probing formats, we demonstrate significant performance drops of up to 31% on evolveQA compared to static knowledge questions.

  Multi-hop retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a promising strategy for complex reasoning, yet existing iterative prompting approaches remain inefficient. They often regenerate predictable token sequences at every step and rely on stochastic stopping, leading to excessive token usage and unstable termination. We propose TSSS (Think Straight, Stop Smart), a structured multi-hop RAG framework designed for efficiency. TSSS introduces (i) a template-based reasoning that caches recurring prefixes and anchors sub-queries to the main question, reducing token generation cost while promoting stable reasoning, and (ii) a retriever-based terminator, which deterministically halts reasoning once additional sub-queries collapse into repetition. This separation of structured reasoning and termination control enables both faster inference and more reliable answers. On HotpotQA, 2WikiMultiHop, and MuSiQue, TSSS achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and competitive efficiency among RAG-CoT approaches, highlighting its effectiveness in efficiency-constrained scenarios such as on-device inference.

  With the proliferation of the internet and the rapid advancement of Artificial Intelligence, leading technology companies face an urgent annual demand for a considerable number of software and algorithm engineers. To efficiently and effectively identify high-potential candidates from thousands of applicants, these firms have established a multi-stage selection process, which crucially includes a standardized hiring evaluation designed to assess job-specific competencies. Motivated by the demonstrated prowess of Large Language Models (LLMs) in coding and reasoning tasks, this paper investigates a critical question: Can LLMs successfully pass these hiring evaluations? To this end, we conduct a comprehensive examination of a widely used professional assessment questionnaire. We employ state-of-the-art LLMs to generate responses and subsequently evaluate their performance. Contrary to any prior expectation of LLMs being ideal engineers, our analysis reveals a significant inconsistency between the model-generated answers and the company-referenced solutions. Our empirical findings lead to a striking conclusion: All evaluated LLMs fails to pass the hiring evaluation.

  Tibetan, one of the major low-resource languages in Asia, presents unique linguistic and sociocultural characteristics that pose both challenges and opportunities for AI research. Despite increasing interest in developing AI systems for underrepresented languages, Tibetan has received limited attention due to a lack of accessible data resources, standardized benchmarks, and dedicated tools. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of the current state of Tibetan AI in the AI domain, covering textual and speech data resources, NLP tasks, machine translation, speech recognition, and recent developments in LLMs. We systematically categorize existing datasets and tools, evaluate methods used across different tasks, and compare performance where possible. We also identify persistent bottlenecks such as data sparsity, orthographic variation, and the lack of unified evaluation metrics. Additionally, we discuss the potential of cross-lingual transfer, multi-modal learning, and community-driven resource creation. This survey aims to serve as a foundational reference for future work on Tibetan AI research and encourages collaborative efforts to build an inclusive and sustainable AI ecosystem for low-resource languages.

  This paper investigates how large language models (LLMs) behave when faced with discrepancies between their parametric knowledge and conflicting information contained in a prompt. Building on prior question-answering (QA) research, we extend the investigation of knowledge conflicts to the realm of code generation. We propose a domain-agnostic framework for constructing and interpreting such conflicts, along with a novel evaluation method and dataset tailored to code conflict scenarios. Our experiments indicate that sufficiently large LLMs encode the notion of a knowledge conflict in their parameters, enabling us to detect knowledge conflicts with up to \textbf{80.65\%} accuracy. Building on these insights, we show that activation-level steering can achieve up to a \textbf{12.6\%} improvement in steering success over a random baseline. However, effectiveness depends critically on balancing model size, task domain, and steering direction. The experiment code and data will be made publicly available after acceptance.

  _Suswitha Pericharla, Daniel B. Hier, Tayo Obafemi-Ajayi_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Effective biomedical data integration depends on automated term normalization, the mapping of natural language biomedical terms to standardized identifiers. This linking of terms to identifiers is essential for semantic interoperability. Large language models (LLMs) show promise for this task but perform unevenly across terminologies. We evaluated both memorization (training-term performance) and generalization (validation-term performance) across multiple biomedical ontologies. Fine-tuning Llama 3.1 8B revealed marked differences by terminology. GO mappings showed strong memorization gains (up to 77% improvement in term-to-identifier accuracy), whereas HPO showed minimal improvement. Generalization occurred only for protein-gene (GENE) mappings (13.9% gain), while fine-tuning for HPO and GO yielded negligible transfer. Baseline accuracy varied by model scale, with GPT-4o outperforming both Llama variants for all terminologies. Embedding analyses showed tight semantic alignment between gene symbols and protein names but weak alignment between terms and identifiers for GO or HPO, consistent with limited lexicalization. Fine-tuning success depended on two interacting factors: identifier popularity and lexicalization. Popular identifiers were more likely encountered during pretraining, enhancing memorization. Lexicalized identifiers, such as gene symbols, enabled semantic generalization. By contrast, arbitrary identifiers in GO and HPO constrained models to rote learning. These findings provide a predictive framework for when fine-tuning enhances factual recall versus when it fails due to sparse or non-lexicalized identifiers.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in human-AI interactions, their social reasoning capabilities in interpersonal contexts are critical. We introduce SCRIPTS, a 1k-dialogue dataset in English and Korean, sourced from movie scripts. The task involves evaluating models' social reasoning capability to infer the interpersonal relationships (e.g., friends, sisters, lovers) between speakers in each dialogue. Each dialogue is annotated with probabilistic relational labels (Highly Likely, Less Likely, Unlikely) by native (or equivalent) Korean and English speakers from Korea and the U.S. Evaluating nine models on our task, current proprietary LLMs achieve around 75-80% on the English dataset, whereas their performance on Korean drops to 58-69%. More strikingly, models select Unlikely relationships in 10-25% of their responses. Furthermore, we find that thinking models and chain-of-thought prompting, effective for general reasoning, provide minimal benefits for social reasoning and occasionally amplify social biases. Our findings reveal significant limitations in current LLMs' social reasoning capabilities, highlighting the need for efforts to develop socially-aware language models.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Oversensitivity occurs when language models defensively reject prompts that are actually benign. This behavior not only disrupts user interactions but also obscures the boundary between harmful and harmless content. Existing benchmarks rely on static datasets that degrade overtime as models evolve, leading to data contamination and diminished evaluative power. To address this, we develop a framework that dynamically generates model-specific challenging datasets, capturing emerging defensive patterns and aligning with each model's unique behavior. Building on this approach, we construct OVERBENCH, a benchmark that aggregates these datasets across diverse LLM families, encompassing 450,000 samples from 25 models. OVERBENCH provides a dynamic and evolving perspective on oversensitivity, allowing for continuous monitoring of defensive triggers as models advance, highlighting vulnerabilities that static datasets overlook.

  Evaluating progress in large language models (LLMs) is often constrained by the challenge of verifying responses, limiting assessments to tasks like mathematics, programming, and short-form question-answering. However, many real-world applications require evaluating LLMs in processing professional documents, synthesizing information, and generating comprehensive reports in response to user queries. We introduce ProfBench: a set of over 7000 response-criterion pairs as evaluated by human-experts with professional knowledge across Physics PhD, Chemistry PhD, Finance MBA and Consulting MBA. We build robust and affordable LLM-Judges to evaluate ProfBench rubrics, by mitigating self-enhancement bias and reducing the cost of evaluation by 2-3 orders of magnitude, to make it fair and accessible to the broader community. Our findings reveal that ProfBench poses significant challenges even for state-of-the-art LLMs, with top-performing models like GPT-5-high achieving only 65.9\% overall performance. Furthermore, we identify notable performance disparities between proprietary and open-weight models and provide insights into the role that extended thinking plays in addressing complex, professional-domain tasks.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Long-horizon agentic search requires iteratively exploring the web over long trajectories and synthesizing information across many sources, and is the foundation for enabling powerful applications like deep research systems. In this work, we show that popular agentic search frameworks struggle to scale to long trajectories primarily due to context limitations-they accumulate long, noisy content, hit context window and tool budgets, or stop early. Then, we introduce SLIM (Simple Lightweight Information Management), a simple framework that separates retrieval into distinct search and browse tools, and periodically summarizes the trajectory, keeping context concise while enabling longer, more focused searches. On long-horizon tasks, SLIM achieves comparable performance at substantially lower cost and with far fewer tool calls than strong open-source baselines across multiple base models. Specifically, with o3 as the base model, SLIM achieves 56% on BrowseComp and 31% on HLE, outperforming all open-source frameworks by 8 and 4 absolute points, respectively, while incurring 4-6x fewer tool calls. Finally, we release an automated fine-grained trajectory analysis pipeline and error taxonomy for characterizing long-horizon agentic search frameworks; SLIM exhibits fewer hallucinations than prior systems. We hope our analysis framework and simple tool design inform future long-horizon agents.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Evaluating the creative capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in complex tasks often requires human assessments that are difficult to scale. We introduce a novel, scalable methodology for evaluating LLM story generation by analyzing underlying social structures in narratives as signed character networks. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we conduct a large-scale comparative analysis using networks from over 1,200 stories, generated by four leading LLMs (GPT-4o, GPT-4o mini, Gemini 1.5 Pro, and Gemini 1.5 Flash) and a human-written corpus. Our findings, based on network properties like density, clustering, and signed edge weights, show that LLM-generated stories consistently exhibit a strong bias toward tightly-knit, positive relationships, which aligns with findings from prior research using human assessment. Our proposed approach provides a valuable tool for evaluating limitations and tendencies in the creative storytelling of current and future LLMs.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The rapid spread of misinformation on online platforms undermines trust among individuals and hinders informed decision making. This paper shows an explainable and computationally efficient pipeline to detect misinformation using transformer-based pretrained language models (PLMs). We optimize both RoBERTa and DistilBERT using a two-step strategy: first, we freeze the backbone and train only the classification head; then, we progressively unfreeze the backbone layers while applying layer-wise learning rate decay. On two real-world benchmark datasets, COVID Fake News and FakeNewsNet GossipCop, we test the proposed approach with a unified protocol of preprocessing and stratified splits. To ensure transparency, we integrate the Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) at the token level to present token-level rationales and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) at the global feature attribution level. It demonstrates that DistilBERT achieves accuracy comparable to RoBERTa while requiring significantly less computational resources. This work makes two key contributions: (1) it quantitatively shows that a lightweight PLM can maintain task performance while substantially reducing computational cost, and (2) it presents an explainable pipeline that retrieves faithful local and global justifications without compromising performance. The results suggest that PLMs combined with principled fine-tuning and interpretability can be an effective framework for scalable, trustworthy misinformation detection.

  Multimodal Large Languages models have been progressing from uni-modal understanding toward unifying visual, audio and language modalities, collectively termed omni models. However, the correlation between uni-modal and omni-modal remains unclear, which requires comprehensive evaluation to drive omni model's intelligence evolution. In this work, we propose a novel, high quality and diversity omni model benchmark, MultiModal All in One Benchmark (MMAO-Bench), which effectively assesses both uni-modal and omni-modal understanding capabilities. The benchmark consists of 1880 human curated samples, across 44 task types, and a innovative multi-step open-ended question type that better assess complex reasoning tasks. Experimental result shows the compositional law between cross-modal and uni-modal performance and the omni-modal capability manifests as a bottleneck effect on weak models, while exhibiting synergistic promotion on strong models.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models often display undesirable behaviors embedded in their internal representations, undermining fairness, inconsistency drift, amplification of harmful content, and the propagation of unwanted patterns during extended dialogue and conversations. Although training-time or data-centric methods attempt to reduce these effects, they are computationally expensive, irreversible once deployed, and slow to adapt to new conversational contexts. Pruning-based methods provide a flexible and transparent way to reduce bias by adjusting the neurons responsible for certain behaviors. However, most existing approaches are static; once a neuron is removed, the model loses the ability to adapt when the conversation or context changes. To address this, we propose a dynamic, reversible, pruning-based framework that detects context-aware neuron activations and applies adaptive masking to modulate their influence during generation. Our inference-time solution provides fine-grained, memory-aware mitigation with knowledge-preserved, more coherent behavior across multilingual single- and multi-turn dialogues, enabling dynamic fairness control in real-world conversational AI.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  High-quality pre-training data is crutial for large language models, where quality captures factual reliability and semantic value, and diversity ensures broad coverage and distributional heterogeneity. Existing approaches typically rely on single or multiple-dimensional score-based selection. However, directly selecting top-scored data often degrades performance, and sampling from a broader range is required to recover results. The above non-monotonicity between dataset scores and downstream benchmark results reveals a fundamental bias: score-based methods collapse correlated dimensions, causing top-scored data to appear high-quality while systematically overlooking diversity. We argue that ensuring diversity requires decomposing correlated metrics into orthogonal feature dimensions, from which the top-scored data can be directly selected. Therefore, we proposed the Orthogonal Diversity-Aware Selection (ODiS) algorithm, which preserves both quality and diversity during data selection. First, ODiS evaluates data from multiple dimensions, covering language quality, knowledge quality, and comprehension difficulty. The multi-dimensional scores are then decorrelated via Principal Component Analysis (PCA), yielding orthogonal evaluation dimensions. For each dimension, a Roberta-based scorer is trained to regress the data onto PCA-projected scores, enabling scalable inference on large corpora. Finally, ODiS constructs the training dataset by selecting top-scored data within each orthogonal dimension, thereby ensuring both quality and diversity. Empirical results show that ODiS-selected data exhibit less than 2\% inter-dimension overlap, confirming orthogonality between dimensions. More importantly, models trained with ODiS-selected data significantly outperform other baselines on downstream benchmarks, highlighting the necessity of orthogonal, diversity-aware data selection for LLMs.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Social media platforms such as Twitter (now X) provide rich data for analyzing public discourse, especially during crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the brevity, informality, and noise of social media short texts often hinder the effectiveness of traditional topic modeling, producing incoherent or redundant topics that are often difficult to interpret. To address these challenges, we have developed \emph{TM-Rephrase}, a model-agnostic framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to rephrase raw tweets into more standardized and formal language prior to topic modeling. Using a dataset of 25,027 COVID-19-related Twitter posts, we investigate the effects of two rephrasing strategies, general- and colloquial-to-formal-rephrasing, on multiple topic modeling methods. Results demonstrate that \emph{TM-Rephrase} improves three metrics measuring topic modeling performance (i.e., topic coherence, topic uniqueness, and topic diversity) while reducing topic redundancy of most topic modeling algorithms, with the colloquial-to-formal strategy yielding the greatest performance gains and especially for the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) algorithm. This study contributes to a model-agnostic approach to enhancing topic modeling in public health related social media analysis, with broad implications for improved understanding of public discourse in health crisis as well as other important domains.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Despite widespread deployment of Large Language Models, systematic evaluation of instruction-following capabilities remains challenging. While comprehensive benchmarks exist, focused assessments that quickly diagnose specific instruction adherence patterns are valuable. As newer models may be trained on existing benchmarks, novel evaluation approaches are needed to assess genuine capabilities rather than memorized performance. This paper presents a streamlined evaluation framework using twenty carefully designed prompts to assess LLM instruction-following across diverse task categories. We demonstrate this framework through a large-scale empirical study conducted on October 14, 2025, testing 256 verified working models from 331 available via OpenRouter. To ensure methodological rigor and prevent selection bias, we first verified each model's basic functionality before inclusion. Unlike large-scale benchmarks requiring extensive computational resources, our approach offers a practical diagnostic tool researchers and practitioners can readily apply. Our methodology builds upon verifiable instructions while introducing a compact test suite balancing comprehensiveness with efficiency. Each prompt targets distinct aspects of instruction following, including format compliance, content constraints, logical sequencing, and multi-step task execution. We evaluate models from major providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Meta, Mistral) and emerging implementations (Qwen, DeepSeek, community models), providing comparative performance analysis. Our findings reveal consistent failure modes and identify specific instruction types posing particular challenges. This work contributes both a practical evaluation tool and one of the most comprehensive empirical analyses of instruction-following capabilities across the contemporary LLM landscape.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advancements in natural language processing, particularly with large language models (LLMs), are transforming how scientists engage with the literature. While the adoption of LLMs is increasing, concerns remain regarding potential information biases and computational costs. Rather than LLMs, I developed a framework to evaluate the feasibility of precise, rapid, and cost-effective information retrieval from extensive geoscience literature using freely available small language models (MiniLMs). A curated corpus of approximately 77 million high-quality sentences, extracted from 95 leading peer-reviewed geoscience journals such as Geophysical Research Letters and Earth and Planetary Science Letters published during years 2000 to 2024, was constructed. MiniLMs enable a computationally efficient approach for extracting relevant domain-specific information from these corpora through semantic search techniques and sentence-level indexing. This approach, unlike LLMs such as ChatGPT-4 that often produces generalized responses, excels at identifying substantial amounts of expert-verified information with established, multi-disciplinary sources, especially for information with quantitative findings. Furthermore, by analyzing emotional tone via sentiment analysis and topical clusters through unsupervised clustering within sentences, MiniLM provides a powerful tool for tracking the evolution of conclusions, research priorities, advancements, and emerging questions within geoscience communities. Overall, MiniLM holds significant potential within the geoscience community for applications such as fact and image retrievals, trend analyses, contradiction analyses, and educational purposes.

  Entity Linking involves detecting and linking entity mentions in natural language texts to a knowledge graph. Traditional methods use a two-step process with separate models for entity recognition and disambiguation, which can be computationally intensive and less effective. We propose a fine-tuned model that jointly integrates entity recognition and disambiguation in a unified framework. Furthermore, our approach leverages large language models to enrich the context of entity mentions, yielding better performance in entity disambiguation. We evaluated our approach on benchmark datasets and compared with several baselines. The evaluation results show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on out-of-domain datasets.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) and their multimodal variants can now process visual inputs, including images of text. This raises an intriguing question: can we compress textual inputs by feeding them as images to reduce token usage while preserving performance? In this paper, we show that visual text representations are a practical and surprisingly effective form of input compression for decoder LLMs. We exploit the idea of rendering long text inputs as a single image and provide it directly to the model. This leads to dramatically reduced number of decoder tokens required, offering a new form of input compression. Through experiments on two distinct benchmarks RULER (long-context retrieval) and CNN/DailyMail (document summarization) we demonstrate that this text-as-image method yields substantial token savings (often nearly half) without degrading task performance.

  Cardiovascular diseases are becoming increasingly prevalent in modern society, with a profound impact on global health and well-being. These Cardiovascular disorders are complex and multifactorial, influenced by genetic predispositions, lifestyle choices, and diverse socioeconomic and clinical factors. Information about these interrelated factors is dispersed across multiple types of textual data, including patient narratives, medical records, and scientific literature. Natural language processing (NLP) has emerged as a powerful approach for analysing such unstructured data, enabling healthcare professionals and researchers to gain deeper insights that may transform the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of cardiac disorders. This review provides a comprehensive overview of NLP research in cardiology from 2014 to 2025. We systematically searched six literature databases for studies describing NLP applications across a range of cardiovascular diseases. After a rigorous screening process, we identified 265 relevant articles. Each study was analysed across multiple dimensions, including NLP paradigms, cardiology-related tasks, disease types, and data sources. Our findings reveal substantial diversity within these dimensions, reflecting the breadth and evolution of NLP research in cardiology. A temporal analysis further highlights methodological trends, showing a progression from rule-based systems to large language models. Finally, we discuss key challenges and future directions, such as developing interpretable LLMs and integrating multimodal data. To the best of our knowledge, this review represents the most comprehensive synthesis of NLP research in cardiology to date.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) owe much of their stellar performance to expansive input contexts, yet such verbosity inflates monetary costs, carbon footprint, and inference-time latency. Much of this overhead manifests from the redundant low-utility tokens present in typical prompts, as only a fraction of tokens typically carries the majority of the semantic weight. We address this inefficiency by introducing FrugalPrompt, a novel prompt compression framework for LLMs, which retains only the most semantically significant tokens. Leveraging two state-of-the-art token attribution methods, GlobEnc and DecompX, we assign salience scores to every token in an input sequence, rank them to preserve the top-k% tokens in their original order, and obtain a sparse frugalized prompt. We evaluate the approach across four NLP tasks: Sentiment Analysis, Commonsense QA, Summarization, and Mathematical Reasoning, using a suite of frontier LLMs. For the first three tasks, a 20% prompt reduction incurs only a marginal loss in task performance, demonstrating that contemporary LLMs can reconstruct elided context from high-salience cues. In contrast, performance on mathematical reasoning deteriorates sharply, reflecting a stronger dependence on complete token continuity. Further analysis with bottom-k% and random-k% tokens reveals asymmetric performance patterns that may suggest potential task contamination effects, wherein models may resort to shallow memorized patterns from pretraining exposure for conventional NLP tasks. We posit that our work contributes to a more nuanced understanding of LLM behavior in performance-efficiency trade-offs, and delineate the boundary between tasks tolerant to contextual sparsity and those requiring exhaustive context.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Self-correction of large language models (LLMs) emerges as a critical component for enhancing their reasoning performance. Although various self-correction methods have been proposed, a comprehensive evaluation of these methods remains largely unexplored, and the question of whether LLMs can truly correct themselves is a matter of significant interest and concern. In this study, we introduce CorrectBench, a benchmark developed to evaluate the effectiveness of self-correction strategies, including intrinsic, external, and fine-tuned approaches, across three tasks: commonsense reasoning, mathematical reasoning, and code generation. Our findings reveal that: 1) Self-correction methods can improve accuracy, especially for complex reasoning tasks; 2) Mixing different self-correction strategies yields further improvements, though it reduces efficiency; 3) Reasoning LLMs (e.g., DeepSeek-R1) have limited optimization under additional self-correction methods and have high time costs. Interestingly, a comparatively simple chain-of-thought (CoT) baseline demonstrates competitive accuracy and efficiency. These results underscore the potential of self-correction to enhance LLM's reasoning performance while highlighting the ongoing challenge of improving their efficiency. Consequently, we advocate for further research focused on optimizing the balance between reasoning capabilities and operational efficiency. Project Page:this https URL

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs) have emerged as a promising alternative to autoregressive (AR) LLMs, leveraging denoising-based generation to enable inherent parallelism. Even more and more open-sourced dLLM models emerge, yet their widespread adoption remains constrained by the lack of a standardized and efficient inference framework. We present dInfer, an efficient and extensible framework for dLLM inference. dInfer decomposes the inference pipeline into four modular components--model, diffusion iteration manager, decoding strategy, and KV-cache manager--and integrates novel algorithms for each component alongside system-level optimizations. Through this combination of algorithmic innovations and system enhancements, dInfer achieves substantial efficiency gains without compromising output quality on LLaDA-MoE. At batch size 1, it surpasses 1,100 tokens per second on HumanEval and averages over 800 tokens per second across six benchmarks on $8\times$ H800 GPUs. Compared to prior systems, dInfer delivers a $10\times$ speedup over Fast-dLLM while maintaining similar model performance. Even compared to the AR model (with a comparable number of activation parameters and performance) QWen2.5-3B, which is highly optimized with the latest vLLM inference engine, dInfer still delivers a $2$-$3\times$ speedup. The implementation of dInfer is open-sourced atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The promotion of academic papers has become an important means of enhancing research visibility. However, existing automated methods struggle limited storytelling, insufficient aesthetic quality, and constrained self-adjustment, making it difficult to achieve efficient and engaging dissemination. At the heart of those challenges is a simple principle: \emph{there is no way to improve it when you cannot evaluate it right}. To address this, we introduce \textbf{EvoPresent}, a self-improvement agent framework that unifies coherent narratives, aesthetic-aware designs, and realistic presentation delivery via virtual characters. Central to EvoPresent is \textbf{PresAesth}, a multi-task reinforcement learning (RL) aesthetic model that provides reliable aesthetic scoring, defect adjustment, and comparative feedback, enabling iterative self-improvement even under limited aesthetic training data. To systematically evaluate the methods, we introduce \textbf{EvoPresent Benchmark}, a comprehensive benchmark comprising: \textit{Presentation Generation Quality}, built on 650 top-tier AI conference papers with multimodal resources (slides, videos and scripts) to assess both content and design; and \textit{Aesthetic Awareness}, consisting of 2,000 slide pairs with varying aesthetic levels, supporting joint training and evaluation on scoring, defect adjustment, and comparison. Our findings highlight that (i) High-quality feedback is essential for agent self-improvement, while initial capability alone does not guarantee effective self-correction. (ii) Automated generation pipelines exhibit a trade-off between visual design and content construction. (iii) Multi-task RL training shows stronger generalization in aesthetic awareness tasks.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in decision-making contexts, but when they present answers without signaling low confidence, users may unknowingly act on erroneous outputs. Prior work shows that LLMs maintain internal uncertainty signals, yet their expressed confidence is often miscalibrated and poorly discriminates between correct and incorrect answers. We investigate whether supervised fine-tuning can improve models' ability to communicate uncertainty and whether such improvements generalize across tasks and domains. We fine-tune LLMs on datasets spanning general knowledge, mathematics, and open-ended trivia, and evaluate two metacognitive tasks: (1) single-question confidence estimation, where the model assigns a numeric certainty to its answer, and (2) pairwise confidence comparison, where the model selects which of two answers it is more likely to answer correctly. We assess generalization to unseen domains, including medical and legal reasoning. Results show that fine-tuning improves calibration (alignment between stated confidence and accuracy) and discrimination (higher confidence for correct vs. incorrect responses) within and across domains. However, gains are task-specific: training on single-question calibration does not transfer to pairwise comparison, and vice versa. Multitask fine-tuning yields broader gains, lowering calibration error and strengthening discrimination in out-of-domain evaluations. This suggests that uncertainty communication in LLMs is trainable but requires multitask training to generalize effectively.

  _Ali Khairallah, Arkaitz Zubiaga_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce ALHD, the first large-scale comprehensive Arabic dataset explicitly designed to distinguish between human- and LLM-generated texts. ALHD spans three genres (news, social media, reviews), covering both MSA and dialectal Arabic, and contains over 400K balanced samples generated by three leading LLMs and originated from multiple human sources, which enables studying generalizability in Arabic LLM-genearted text detection. We provide rigorous preprocessing, rich annotations, and standardized balanced splits to support reproducibility. In addition, we present, analyze and discuss benchmark experiments using our new dataset, in turn identifying gaps and proposing future research directions. Benchmarking across traditional classifiers, BERT-based models, and LLMs (zero-shot and few-shot) demonstrates that fine-tuned BERT models achieve competitive performance, outperforming LLM-based models. Results are however not always consistent, as we observe challenges when generalizing across genres; indeed, models struggle to generalize when they need to deal with unseen patterns in cross-genre settings, and these challenges are particularly prominent when dealing with news articles, where LLM-generated texts resemble human texts in style, which opens up avenues for future research. ALHD establishes a foundation for research related to Arabic LLM-detection and mitigating risks of misinformation, academic dishonesty, and cyber threats.

- **[Evaluation Framework for Highlight Explanations of Context Utilisation in Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02629)**  `arXiv:2510.02629`

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Context utilisation, the ability of Language Models (LMs) to incorporate relevant information from the provided context when generating responses, remains largely opaque to users, who cannot determine whether models draw from parametric memory or provided context, nor identify which specific context pieces inform the response. Highlight explanations (HEs) offer a natural solution as they can point the exact context pieces and tokens that influenced model outputs. However, no existing work evaluates their effectiveness in accurately explaining context utilisation. We address this gap by introducing the first gold standard HE evaluation framework for context attribution, using controlled test cases with known ground-truth context usage, which avoids the limitations of existing indirect proxy evaluations. To demonstrate the framework's broad applicability, we evaluate four HE methods -- three established techniques and MechLight, a mechanistic interpretability approach we adapt for this task -- across four context scenarios, four datasets, and five LMs. Overall, we find that MechLight performs best across all context scenarios. However, all methods struggle with longer contexts and exhibit positional biases, pointing to fundamental challenges in explanation accuracy that require new approaches to deliver reliable context utilisation explanations at scale.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) Large Language Models (LLM) fundamentally rely on high-quality training data. While data selection and data synthesis are two common strategies to improve data quality, existing approaches often face limitations in static dataset curation that fail to adapt to evolving model capabilities. In this paper, we introduce Middo, a self-evolving Model-informed dynamic data optimization framework that uses model-aware data selection and context-preserving data refinement. Unlike conventional one-off filtering/synthesis methods, our framework establishes a closed-loop optimization system: (1) A self-referential diagnostic module proactively identifies suboptimal samples through tri-axial model signals - loss patterns (complexity), embedding cluster dynamics (diversity), and self-alignment scores (quality); (2) An adaptive optimization engine then transforms suboptimal samples into pedagogically valuable training points while preserving semantic integrity; (3) This optimization process continuously evolves with model capability through dynamic learning principles. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our Middo consistently enhances the quality of seed data and boosts LLM's performance with improving accuracy by 7.15% on average while maintaining the original dataset scale. This work establishes a new paradigm for sustainable LLM training through dynamic human-AI co-evolution of data and models. Our datasets, models, and code are publicly available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Balancing performance and efficiency is a central challenge in large language model (LLM) advancement. GPT-5 addresses this with test-time routing, dynamically assigning queries to either an efficient or a high-capacity model during inference. In this work, we present Avengers-Pro, a test-time routing framework that ensembles LLMs of varying capacities and efficiencies, providing a unified solution for all performance-efficiency tradeoffs. The Avengers-Pro embeds and clusters incoming queries, then routes each to the most suitable model based on a performance-efficiency score. Across 6 challenging benchmarks and 8 leading models -- including GPT-5-medium, Gemini-2.5-pro, and Claude-opus-4.1 -- Avengers-Pro achieves state-of-the-art results: by varying a performance-efficiency trade-off parameter, it can surpass the strongest single model (GPT-5-medium) by +7% in average accuracy. Moreover, it can match the average accuracy of the strongest single model at 27% lower cost, and reach ~90% of that performance at 63% lower cost. Last but not least, it achieves a Pareto frontier, consistently yielding the highest accuracy for any given cost, and the lowest cost for any given accuracy, among all single models.

  _Ju-Chieh Chou, Jiawei Zhou, Karen Livescu_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Textless spoken language models (SLMs) are generative models of speech that do not rely on text supervision. Most textless SLMs learn to predict the next semantic token, a discrete representation of linguistic content, and rely on a separate vocoder to add acoustic information to the generated speech. Such models have no access to acoustic context and no built-in control over acoustic details. In this work, we propose to jointly model linguistic and acoustic information by generating semantic tokens and a continuous real-valued representation of the acoustic frame. We use a flow-matching objective to predict the continuous vector conditioned on the semantic tokens. We study the design space of this approach and find that predicting multiple future semantic tokens helps preserve linguistic information. Our approach achieves comparable performance to existing models in terms of linguistic likelihood benchmarks, while providing better acoustic detail in prompted generation.

  _Sameer Panwar_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper introduces DeCAL, a new method for tokenwise compression. DeCAL uses an encoder-decoder language model pretrained with denoising to learn to produce high-quality, general-purpose compressed representations from the encoder. DeCAL applies small modifications to the encoder, with the emphasis on maximizing compression quality, even at the expense of compute. We show that DeCAL at 2x compression can match uncompressed on several downstream tasks, with usually only a minor dropoff in metrics up to 8x compression, among question-answering, summarization, and multi-vector retrieval tasks. DeCAL offers significant savings where pre-computed dense representations can be utilized, and we believe the approach can be further developed to be more broadly applicable.

  Transformer-based Language Models' computation and memory overhead increase quadratically as a function of sequence length. The quadratic cost poses challenges when employing LLMs for processing long sequences. In this work, we introduce \ourmodelacronym~(Extend at Test-Time), method for extending the context length of short context Transformer-based LLMs, with constant memory requirement and linear computation overhead. ETT enable the extension of the context length at test-time by efficient fine-tuning the model's parameters on the input context, chunked into overlapping small subsequences. We evaluate ETT on LongBench by extending the context length of GPT-Large and Phi-2 up to 32 times, increasing from 1k to 32k tokens. This results in up to a 30 percent improvement in the model's accuracy. We also study how context can be stored in LLM's weights effectively and efficiently. Through a detailed ablation study, we examine which Transformer modules are most beneficial to fine-tune at test-time. Interestingly, we find that fine-tuning the second layer of the FFNs is more effective than full fine-tuning, leading to a further improvement in the models' accuracy.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Machine unlearning techniques aim to mitigate unintended memorization in large language models (LLMs). However, existing approaches predominantly focus on the explicit removal of isolated facts, often overlooking latent inferential dependencies and the non-deterministic nature of knowledge within LLMs. Consequently, facts presumed forgotten may persist implicitly through correlated information. To address these challenges, we propose a knowledge unlearning evaluation framework that more accurately captures the implicit structure of real-world knowledge by representing relevant factual contexts as knowledge graphs with associated confidence scores. We further develop an inference-based evaluation protocol leveraging powerful LLMs as judges; these judges reason over the extracted knowledge subgraph to determine unlearning success. Our LLM judges utilize carefully designed prompts and are calibrated against human evaluations to ensure their trustworthiness and stability. Extensive experiments on our newly constructed benchmark demonstrate that our framework provides a more realistic and rigorous assessment of unlearning performance. Moreover, our findings reveal that current evaluation strategies tend to overestimate unlearning effectiveness. Our code is publicly available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in learning algorithms, evaluations, and optimization tasks. Recent studies have shown that using LLM-based optimizers to automatically optimize model prompts, demonstrations, predictions themselves, or other components can significantly enhance the performance of AI systems, as demonstrated by frameworks such as DSPy and TextGrad. However, optimizers built on language models themselves are usually designed by humans with manual design choices; optimizers themselves are not optimized. Moreover, these optimizers are general purpose by design, to be useful to a broad audience, and are not tailored for specific tasks. To address these challenges, we propose metaTextGrad, which focuses on designing a meta-optimizer to further enhance existing optimizers and align them to be good optimizers for a given task. Our approach consists of two key components: a meta prompt optimizer and a meta structure optimizer. The combination of these two significantly improves performance across multiple benchmarks, achieving an average absolute performance improvement of up to 6% compared to the best baseline.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The surge of user-generated online content presents a wealth of insights into customer preferences and market trends. However, the highly diverse, complex, and context-rich nature of such contents poses significant challenges to traditional opinion mining approaches. To address this, we introduce Online Opinion Mining Benchmark (OOMB), a novel dataset and evaluation protocol designed to assess the ability of large language models (LLMs) to mine opinions effectively from diverse and intricate online environments. OOMB provides extensive (entity, feature, opinion) tuple annotations and a comprehensive opinion-centric summary that highlights key opinion topics within each content, thereby enabling the evaluation of both the extractive and abstractive capabilities of models. Through our proposed benchmark, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of which aspects remain challenging and where LLMs exhibit adaptability, to explore whether they can effectively serve as opinion miners in realistic online scenarios. This study lays the foundation for LLM-based opinion mining and discusses directions for future research in this field.

  _Chihan Huang, Hao Tang_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Although autoregressive models have dominated language modeling in recent years, there has been a growing interest in exploring alternative paradigms to the conventional next-token prediction framework. Diffusion-based language models have emerged as a compelling alternative due to their powerful parallel generation capabilities and inherent editability. However, these models are often constrained by fixed-length generation. A promising direction is to combine the strengths of both paradigms, segmenting sequences into blocks, modeling autoregressive dependencies across blocks while leveraging discrete diffusion to estimate the conditional distribution within each block given the preceding context. Nevertheless, their practical application is often hindered by two key limitations: rigid fixed-length outputs and a lack of flexible control mechanisms. In this work, we address the critical limitations of fixed granularity and weak controllability in current large diffusion language models. We propose CtrlDiff, a dynamic and controllable semi-autoregressive framework that adaptively determines the size of each generation block based on local semantics using reinforcement learning. Furthermore, we introduce a classifier-guided control mechanism tailored to discrete diffusion, which significantly reduces computational overhead while facilitating efficient post-hoc conditioning without retraining. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CtrlDiff sets a new standard among hybrid diffusion models, narrows the performance gap to state-of-the-art autoregressive approaches, and enables effective conditional text generation across diverse tasks.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Context lengths for models have grown rapidly, from thousands to millions of tokens in just a few years. The extreme context sizes of modern long-context models have made it difficult to construct realistic long-context benchmarks -- not only due to the cost of collecting million-context tasks but also in identifying realistic scenarios that require significant contexts. We identify code comprehension and repair as a natural testbed and challenge task for long-context models and introduce LongCodeBench (LCB), a benchmark to test LLM coding abilities in long-context scenarios. Our benchmark tests both the comprehension and repair capabilities of LCLMs in realistic and important settings by drawing from real-world GitHub issues and constructing QA (LongCodeQA) and bug fixing (LongSWE-Bench) tasks. We carefully stratify the complexity of our benchmark, enabling us to evaluate models across different scales -- ranging from Qwen2.5 14B Instruct to Google's flagship Gemini model. We find that long-context remains a weakness for all models, with performance drops such as from 29% to 3% for Claude 3.5 Sonnet, or from 70.2% to 40% for Qwen2.5.

  In recent developments, deep learning methodologies applied to Natural Language Processing (NLP) have revealed a paradox: They improve performance but demand considerable data and resources for their training. Alternatively, quantum computing exploits the principles of quantum mechanics to overcome the computational limitations of current methodologies, thereby establishing an emerging field known as quantum natural language processing (QNLP). This domain holds the potential to attain a quantum advantage in the processing of linguistic structures, surpassing classical models in both efficiency and accuracy. In this paper, it is proposed to categorise QNLP models based on quantum computing principles, architecture, and computational approaches. This paper attempts to provide a survey on how quantum meets language by mapping state-of-the-art in this area, embracing quantum encoding techniques for classical data, QNLP models for prevalent NLP tasks, and quantum optimisation techniques for hyper parameter tuning. The landscape of quantum computing approaches applied to various NLP tasks is summarised by showcasing the specific QNLP methods used, and the popularity of these methods is indicated by their count. From the findings, it is observed that QNLP approaches are still limited to small data sets, with only a few models explored extensively, and there is increasing interest in the application of quantum computing to natural language processing tasks.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This tutorial on adaptation of LLMs is designed to address the growing demand for models that go beyond the static capabilities of generic LLMs by providing an overview of dynamic, domain-specific, and task-adaptive LLM adaptation techniques. While general LLMs have demonstrated strong generalization across a variety of tasks, they often struggle to perform well in specialized domains such as finance, healthcare, and code generation for underrepresented languages. Additionally, their static nature limits their ability to evolve with the changing world, and they are often extremely large in size, making them impractical and costly to deploy at scale. As a result, the adaptation of LLMs has drawn much attention since the birth of LLMs and is of core importance, both for industry, which focuses on serving its targeted users, and academia, which can greatly benefit from small but powerful LLMs. To address this gap, this tutorial aims to provide an overview of the LLM adaptation techniques. We start with an introduction to LLM adaptation, from both the data perspective and the model perspective. We then emphasize how the evaluation metrics and benchmarks are different from other techniques. After establishing the problems, we explore various adaptation techniques. We categorize adaptation techniques into two main families. The first is parametric knowledge adaptation, which focuses on updating the parametric knowledge within LLMs. Additionally, we will discuss real-time adaptation techniques, including model editing, which allows LLMs to be updated dynamically in production environments. The second kind of adaptation is semi-parametric knowledge adaptation, where the goal is to update LLM parameters to better leverage external knowledge or tools through techniques like retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and agent-based systems.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper establishes a benchmark for evaluating tool-calling capabilities of large language models (LLMs) on multi-step geospatial tasks relevant to commercial GIS practitioners. We assess eight commercial LLMs (Claude Sonnet 3.5 and 4, Claude Haiku 3.5, Gemini 2.0 Flash, Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview, GPT-4o, GPT-4.1 and o4-mini) using a simple tool-calling agent equipped with 23 geospatial functions. Our benchmark comprises tasks in four categories of increasing complexity, with both solvable and intentionally unsolvable tasks to test rejection accuracy. We develop a LLM-as-Judge evaluation framework to compare agent solutions against reference solutions. Results show o4-mini and Claude 3.5 Sonnet achieve the best overall performance, OpenAI's GPT-4.1, GPT-4o and Google's Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview do not fall far behind, but the last two are more efficient in identifying unsolvable tasks. Claude Sonnet 4, due its preference to provide any solution rather than reject a task, proved to be less accurate. We observe significant differences in token usage, with Anthropic models consuming more tokens than competitors. Common errors include misunderstanding geometrical relationships, relying on outdated knowledge, and inefficient data manipulation. The resulting benchmark set, evaluation framework, and data generation pipeline are released as open-source resources (available atthis https URL), providing one more standardized method for the ongoing evaluation of LLMs for GeoAI.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce Spire, a speech-augmented language model (LM) capable of both translating and transcribing speech input from English into 10 other languages as well as translating text input in both language directions. Spire integrates the speech modality into an existing multilingual LM via speech discretization and continued pre-training using only 42.5K hours of speech. In particular, we adopt the pretraining framework of multilingual LMs and treat discretized speech input as an additional translation language. This approach not only equips the model with speech capabilities, but also preserves its strong text-based performance. We achieve this using significantly less data than existing speech LMs, demonstrating that discretized speech input integration as an additional language is feasible during LM adaptation. We make our code and models available to the community.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized product recommenders, yet their susceptibility to adversarial manipulation poses critical challenges, particularly in real-world commercial applications. Our approach is the first one to tap into human psychological principles, seamlessly modifying product descriptions, making such manipulations hard to detect. In this work, we investigate cognitive biases as black-box adversarial strategies, drawing parallels between their effects on LLMs and human purchasing behavior. Through extensive evaluation across models of varying scale, we find that certain biases, such as social proof, consistently boost product recommendation rate and ranking, while others, like scarcity and exclusivity, surprisingly reduce visibility. Our results demonstrate that cognitive biases are deeply embedded in state-of-the-art LLMs, leading to highly unpredictable behavior in product recommendations and posing significant challenges for effective mitigation.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reward Models (RMs) are crucial to aligning large language models (LLMs), but the degree to which an RM specialized to one task (e.g. writing) generalizes to new tasks (e.g. math) is often not known a priori, often making using only one fixed RM to train LLMs suboptimal. However, optimizing LLMs with multiple RMs simultaneously can incur a prohibitively high computational cost and lead to conflicting signals from different RMs that may degrade performance. To address these challenges, we introduce LASeR (Learning to Adaptively Select Rewards), which frames reward model selection as a multi-armed bandit problem, efficiently and iteratively training LLMs using multiple RMs by selecting the most well-suited RM for each instance. On commonsense and math reasoning tasks, we show that LASeR boosts iterative LLM training, improving the absolute average accuracy of Llama-3-8B over three datasets by 2.67% over an ensemble of RM scores while also showing superior efficiency (e.g., a 2x speedup). Moreover, on WildChat (open-ended instruction-following tasks), LASeR leads to a 72.69% AlpacaEval win rate over the RM score ensemble baseline. Extending to long-context generation, LASeR improves by 2.96 F1 points (avg.) on single-document QA tasks and 2.97 F1 points on few-shot learning over the RM score ensemble baseline with best-of-n sampling.

  _Tao Yuan, Xuefei Ning, Dong Zhou, Zhijie Yang, Shiyao Li, Minghui Zhuang, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  State-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) are now claiming remarkable supported context lengths of 256k or even more. In contrast, the average context lengths of mainstream benchmarks are insufficient (5k-21k), and they suffer from potential knowledge leakage and inaccurate metrics, resulting in biased evaluation. This paper introduces LV-Eval, a challenging long-context benchmark with five length levels (16k, 32k, 64k, 128k, and 256k) reaching up to 256k words. LV-Eval features two main tasks, single-hop QA and multi-hop QA, comprising 11 bilingual datasets. The design of LV-Eval has incorporated three key techniques, namely confusing facts insertion, keyword and phrase replacement, and keyword-recall-based metric design. The advantages of LV-Eval include controllable evaluation across different context lengths, challenging test instances with confusing facts, mitigated knowledge leakage, and more objective evaluations. We evaluate 15 LLMs on LV-Eval and conduct ablation studies on the benchmarking techniques. The results reveal that: (i) Moonshot-v1 and recent large-scale open-source models, such as Qwen-2.5-72B and Llama-3.1-70B, achieve the highest performance on LV-Eval, particularly at lengths below 64k. (ii) Models exhibit distinct score trends. For example, GLM-4-9B-128k, Yi-6B-200k, and Llama3-8B-1M exhibit a relatively gentle degradation of performance, but their absolute performances may not necessarily be higher than those of LLMs with shorter context lengths. (iii) LLMs' performances can significantly degrade in the presence of confusing information, especially in the pressure test of "needle in a haystack". (iv) Issues related to knowledge leakage and inaccurate metrics introduce bias in evaluation, and these concerns are alleviated in LV-Eval.

  We introduce ITTO, a challenging new benchmark suite for evaluating and diagnosing the capabilities and limitations of point tracking methods. Our videos are sourced from existing datasets and egocentric real-world recordings, with high-quality human annotations collected through a multi-stage pipeline. ITTO captures the motion complexity, occlusion patterns, and object diversity characteristic of real-world scenes -- factors that are largely absent in current benchmarks. We conduct a rigorous analysis of state-of-the-art tracking methods on ITTO, breaking down performance along key axes of motion complexity. Our findings reveal that existing trackers struggle with these challenges, particularly in re-identifying points after occlusion, highlighting critical failure modes. These results point to the need for new modeling approaches tailored to real-world dynamics. We envision ITTO as a foundation testbed for advancing point tracking and guiding the development of more robust tracking algorithms.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Monocular depth estimation is an important task with rapid progress, but how to evaluate it remains an open question, as evidenced by a lack of standardization in existing literature and a large selection of evaluation metrics whose trade-offs and behaviors are not well understood. This paper contributes a novel, quantitative analysis of existing metrics in terms of their sensitivity to various types of perturbations of ground truth, emphasizing comparison to human judgment. Our analysis reveals that existing metrics are severely under-sensitive to curvature perturbation such as making flat surfaces wavy. To remedy this, we introduce a new metric based on relative surface normals, along with new depth visualization tools and a principled method to create composite metrics with better human alignment.

  Recent advances in multimodal models have demonstrated remarkable text-guided image editing capabilities, with systems like GPT-4o and Nano-Banana setting new benchmarks. However, the research community's progress remains constrained by the absence of large-scale, high-quality, and openly accessible datasets built from real images. We introduce Pico-Banana-400K, a comprehensive 400K-image dataset for instruction-based image editing. Our dataset is constructed by leveraging Nano-Banana to generate diverse edit pairs from real photographs in the OpenImages collection. What distinguishes Pico-Banana-400K from previous synthetic datasets is our systematic approach to quality and diversity. We employ a fine-grained image editing taxonomy to ensure comprehensive coverage of edit types while maintaining precise content preservation and instruction faithfulness through MLLM-based quality scoring and careful curation. Beyond single turn editing, Pico-Banana-400K enables research into complex editing scenarios. The dataset includes three specialized subsets: (1) a 72K-example multi-turn collection for studying sequential editing, reasoning, and planning across consecutive modifications; (2) a 56K-example preference subset for alignment research and reward model training; and (3) paired long-short editing instructions for developing instruction rewriting and summarization capabilities. By providing this large-scale, high-quality, and task-rich resource, Pico-Banana-400K establishes a robust foundation for training and benchmarking the next generation of text-guided image editing models.

  Vision-Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate impressive zero-shot generalization through large-scale image-text pretraining, yet their performance can drop once the deployment distribution diverges from the training distribution. To address this, Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) methods update models using unlabeled target data. However, existing approaches often ignore two key challenges: prototype degradation in long-tailed distributions and confusion between semantically similar classes. To tackle these issues, we propose \textbf{C}lass-Aware \textbf{P}rototype \textbf{L}earning with \textbf{N}egative \textbf{C}ontrast(\textbf{CPL-NC}), a lightweight TTA framework designed specifically for VLMs to enhance generalization under distribution shifts. CPL-NC introduces a \textit{Class-Aware Prototype Cache} Module that dynamically adjusts per-class capacity based on test-time frequency and activation history, with a rejuvenation mechanism for inactive classes to retain rare-category knowledge. Additionally, a \textit{Negative Contrastive Learning} Mechanism identifies and constrains hard visual-textual negatives to improve class separability. The framework employs asymmetric optimization, refining only textual prototypes while anchoring on stable visual features. Experiments on 15 benchmarks show that CPL-NC consistently outperforms prior TTA methods across both ResNet-50 and ViT-B/16 backbones.

  This paper introduces OmniMotion-X, a versatile multimodal framework for whole-body human motion generation, leveraging an autoregressive diffusion transformer in a unified sequence-to-sequence manner. OmniMotion-X efficiently supports diverse multimodal tasks, including text-to-motion, music-to-dance, speech-to-gesture, and global spatial-temporal control scenarios (e.g., motion prediction, in-betweening, completion, and joint/trajectory-guided synthesis), as well as flexible combinations of these tasks. Specifically, we propose the use of reference motion as a novel conditioning signal, substantially enhancing the consistency of generated content, style, and temporal dynamics crucial for realistic animations. To handle multimodal conflicts, we introduce a progressive weak-to-strong mixed-condition training strategy. To enable high-quality multimodal training, we construct OmniMoCap-X, the largest unified multimodal motion dataset to date, integrating 28 publicly available MoCap sources across 10 distinct tasks, standardized to the SMPL-X format at 30 fps. To ensure detailed and consistent annotations, we render sequences into videos and use GPT-4o to automatically generate structured and hierarchical captions, capturing both low-level actions and high-level semantics. Extensive experimental evaluations confirm that OmniMotion-X significantly surpasses existing methods, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance across multiple multimodal tasks and enabling the interactive generation of realistic, coherent, and controllable long-duration motions.

  Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) is a critical technique for deploying deep neural networks on resource-constrained devices. However, existing methods often face two major challenges: the highly non-uniform distribution of activations and the static, mismatched codebooks used in weight quantization. To address these challenges, we propose Adaptive Distribution-aware Quantization (ADQ), a mixed-precision quantization framework that employs a differentiated strategy. The core of ADQ is a novel adaptive weight quantization scheme comprising three key innovations: (1) a quantile-based initialization method that constructs a codebook closely aligned with the initial weight distribution; (2) an online codebook adaptation mechanism based on Exponential Moving Average (EMA) to dynamically track distributional shifts; and (3) a sensitivity-informed strategy for mixed-precision allocation. For activations, we integrate a hardware-friendly non-uniform-to-uniform mapping scheme. Comprehensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our method. On ImageNet, ADQ enables a ResNet-18 to achieve 71.512% Top-1 accuracy with an average bit-width of only 2.81 bits, outperforming state-of-the-art methods under comparable conditions. Furthermore, detailed ablation studies on CIFAR-10 systematically demonstrate the individual contributions of each innovative component, validating the rationale and effectiveness of our design.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Extracting the true dynamical variables of a system from high-dimensional video is challenging due to distracting visual factors such as background motion, occlusions, and texture changes. We propose LyTimeT, a two-phase framework for interpretable variable extraction that learns robust and stable latent representations of dynamical systems. In Phase 1, LyTimeT employs a spatio-temporal TimeSformer-based autoencoder that uses global attention to focus on dynamically relevant regions while suppressing nuisance variation, enabling distraction-robust latent state learning and accurate long-horizon video prediction. In Phase 2, we probe the learned latent space, select the most physically meaningful dimensions using linear correlation analysis, and refine the transition dynamics with a Lyapunov-based stability regularizer to enforce contraction and reduce error accumulation during roll-outs. Experiments on five synthetic benchmarks and four real-world dynamical systems, including chaotic phenomena, show that LyTimeT achieves mutual information and intrinsic dimension estimates closest to ground truth, remains invariant under background perturbations, and delivers the lowest analytical mean squared error among CNN-based (TIDE) and transformer-only baselines. Our results demonstrate that combining spatio-temporal attention with stability constraints yields predictive models that are not only accurate but also physically interpretable.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Presentation attacks represent a critical security threat where adversaries use fake biometric data, such as face, fingerprint, or iris images, to gain unauthorized access to protected systems. Various presentation attack detection (PAD) systems have been designed leveraging deep learning (DL) models to mitigate this type of threat. Despite their effectiveness, most of the DL models function as black boxes - their decisions are opaque to their users. The purpose of explainability techniques is to provide detailed information about the reason behind the behavior or decision of DL models. In particular, visual explanation is necessary to better understand the decisions or predictions of DL-based PAD systems and determine the key regions due to which a biometric image is considered real or fake by the system. In this work, a novel technique, Ensemble-CAM, is proposed for providing visual explanations for the decisions made by deep learning-based face PAD systems. Our goal is to improve DL-based face PAD systems by providing a better understanding of their behavior. Our provided visual explanations will enhance the transparency and trustworthiness of DL-based face PAD systems.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Unpaired image-to-image translation has emerged as a crucial technique in medical imaging, enabling cross-modality synthesis, domain adaptation, and data augmentation without costly paired datasets. Yet, existing approaches often distort fine curvilinear structures, such as microvasculature, undermining both diagnostic reliability and quantitative analysis. This limitation is consequential in ophthalmic and vascular imaging, where subtle morphological changes carry significant clinical meaning. We propose Curvilinear Structure-preserving Translation (CST), a general framework that explicitly preserves fine curvilinear structures during unpaired translation by integrating structure consistency into the training. Specifically, CST augments baseline models with a curvilinear extraction module for topological supervision. It can be seamlessly incorporated into existing methods. We integrate it into CycleGAN and UNSB as two representative backbones. Comprehensive evaluation across three imaging modalities: optical coherence tomography angiography, color fundus and X-ray coronary angiography demonstrates that CST improves translation fidelity and achieves state-of-the-art performance. By reinforcing geometric integrity in learned mappings, CST establishes a principled pathway toward curvilinear structure-aware cross-domain translation in medical imaging.

  Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) achieve strong performance on vision-language tasks, yet their visual processing is opaque. Most black-box evaluations measure task accuracy, but reveal little about underlying mechanisms. Drawing on cognitive psychology, we adapt classic visual search paradigms -- originally developed to study human perception -- to test whether MLLMs exhibit the ``pop-out'' effect, where salient visual features are detected independently of distractor set size. Using controlled experiments targeting colour, size and lighting features, we find that advanced MLLMs exhibit human-like pop-out effects in colour or size-based disjunctive (single feature) search, as well as capacity limits for conjunctive (multiple feature) search. We also find evidence to suggest that MLLMs, like humans, incorporate natural scene priors such as lighting direction into object representations. We reinforce our findings using targeted fine-tuning and mechanistic interpretability analyses. Our work shows how visual search can serve as a cognitively grounded diagnostic tool for evaluating perceptual capabilities in MLLMs.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Despite remarkable progress in driving world models, their potential for autonomous systems remains largely untapped: the world models are mostly learned for world simulation and decoupled from trajectory planning. While recent efforts aim to unify world modeling and planning in a single framework, the synergistic facilitation mechanism of world modeling for planning still requires further exploration. In this work, we introduce a new driving paradigm named Policy World Model (PWM), which not only integrates world modeling and trajectory planning within a unified architecture, but is also able to benefit planning using the learned world knowledge through the proposed action-free future state forecasting scheme. Through collaborative state-action prediction, PWM can mimic the human-like anticipatory perception, yielding more reliable planning performance. To facilitate the efficiency of video forecasting, we further introduce a dynamically enhanced parallel token generation mechanism, equipped with a context-guided tokenizer and an adaptive dynamic focal loss. Despite utilizing only front camera input, our method matches or exceeds state-of-the-art approaches that rely on multi-view and multi-modal inputs.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) achieves real-time photorealistic novel view synthesis, yet struggles with complex scenes due to over-reconstruction artifacts, manifesting as local blurring and needle-shape distortions. While recent approaches attribute these issues to insufficient splitting of large-scale Gaussians, we identify two fundamental limitations: gradient magnitude dilution during densification and the primitive frozen phenomenon, where essential Gaussian densification is inhibited in complex regions while suboptimally scaled Gaussians become trapped in local optima. To address these challenges, we introduce ReAct-GS, a method founded on the principle of re-activation. Our approach features: (1) an importance-aware densification criterion incorporating $\alpha$-blending weights from multiple viewpoints to re-activate stalled primitive growth in complex regions, and (2) a re-activation mechanism that revitalizes frozen primitives through adaptive parameter perturbations. Comprehensive experiments across diverse real-world datasets demonstrate that ReAct-GS effectively eliminates over-reconstruction artifacts and achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard novel view synthesis metrics while preserving intricate geometric details. Additionally, our re-activation mechanism yields consistent improvements when integrated with other 3D-GS variants such as Pixel-GS, demonstrating its broad applicability.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  General-purpose large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate strong capabilities in generating detailed descriptions for natural images. However, their performance in the medical domain remains suboptimal, even for relatively straightforward tasks, primarily due to the lack of large-scale, high-quality, specialized medical imaging datasets and the neglect of the diagnostic process that progresses from coarse to fine-grained. To address the first issue, we construct the CT-RATE-VQA dataset, which has 84K QA pairs. For the second issue, we propose MedReason-R1, a medical VLM with explicit reasoning process for disease diagnosis. MedReason-R1 incorporates a novel strategy that embeds zoom-in disease region-of-interest areas into the image, highlighting the crucial role of both global localization and disease-specific details in enhancing the model's diagnostic performance. Furthermore, we introduce the GRPO reinforcement learning framework to MedReason-R1, which enables effective reasoning without relying on costly manual annotations. Compared to recent general-purpose and medical VLMs, MedReason-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance in CT disease diagnosis while retaining generalization.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Existing Moment Retrieval methods face three critical bottlenecks: (1) data scarcity forces models into shallow keyword-feature associations; (2) boundary ambiguity in transition regions between adjacent events; (3) insufficient discrimination of fine-grained semantics (e.g., distinguishing ``kicking" vs. ``throwing" a ball). In this paper, we propose a zero-external-dependency Augmented Moment Retrieval framework, AMR, designed to overcome local optima caused by insufficient data annotations and the lack of robust boundary and semantic discrimination capabilities. AMR is built upon two key insights: (1) it resolves ambiguous boundary information and semantic confusion in existing annotations without additional data (avoiding costly manual labeling), and (2) it preserves boundary and semantic discriminative capabilities enhanced by training while generalizing to real-world scenarios, significantly improving performance. Furthermore, we propose a two-stage training framework with cold-start and distillation adaptation. The cold-start stage employs curriculum learning on augmented data to build foundational boundary/semantic awareness. The distillation stage introduces dual query sets: Original Queries maintain DETR-based localization using frozen Base Queries from the cold-start model, while Active Queries dynamically adapt to real-data distributions. A cross-stage distillation loss enforces consistency between Original and Base Queries, preventing knowledge forgetting while enabling real-world generalization. Experiments on multiple benchmarks show that AMR achieves improved performance over prior state-of-the-art approaches.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multi-agent collaboration enhances the perception capabilities of individual agents through information sharing. However, in real-world applications, differences in sensors and models across heterogeneous agents inevitably lead to domain gaps during collaboration. Existing approaches based on adaptation and reconstruction fail to support pragmatic heterogeneous collaboration due to two key limitations: (1) Intrusive retraining of the encoder or core modules disrupts the established semantic consistency among agents; and (2) accommodating new agents incurs high computational costs, limiting scalability. To address these challenges, we present a novel Generative Communication mechanism (GenComm) that facilitates seamless perception across heterogeneous multi-agent systems through feature generation, without altering the original network, and employs lightweight numerical alignment of spatial information to efficiently integrate new agents at minimal cost. Specifically, a tailored Deformable Message Extractor is designed to extract spatial message for each collaborator, which is then transmitted in place of intermediate features. The Spatial-Aware Feature Generator, utilizing a conditional diffusion model, generates features aligned with the ego agent's semantic space while preserving the spatial information of the collaborators. These generated features are further refined by a Channel Enhancer before fusion. Experiments conducted on the OPV2V-H, DAIR-V2X and V2X-Real datasets demonstrate that GenComm outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving an 81\% reduction in both computational cost and parameter count when incorporating new agents.

  _Nathana√´l Cuvelle--Magar, St√©phane Mallat_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  A considerable amount of research in harmonic analysis has been devoted to non-linear estimators of signals contaminated by additive Gaussian noise. They are implemented by thresholding coefficients in a frame, which provide a sparse signal representation, or by minimising their $\ell^1$ norm. However, sparse estimators in frames are not sufficiently rich to adapt to complex signal regularities. For cartoon images whose edges are piecewise $\bf C^\alpha$ curves, wavelet, curvelet and Xlet frames are suboptimal if the Lipschitz exponent $\alpha \leq 2$ is an unknown parameter. Deep convolutional neural networks have recently obtained much better numerical results, which reach the minimax asymptotic bounds for all $\alpha$. Wavelet scattering coefficients have been introduced as simplified convolutional neural network models. They are computed by transforming the modulus of wavelet coefficients with a second wavelet transform. We introduce a denoising estimator by jointly minimising and maximising the $\ell^1$ norms of different subsets of scattering coefficients. We prove that these $\ell^1$ norms capture different types of geometric image regularity. Numerical experiments show that this denoising estimator reaches the minimax asymptotic bound for cartoon images for all Lipschitz exponents $\alpha \leq 2$. We state this numerical result as a mathematical conjecture. It provides a different harmonic analysis approach to suppress noise from signals, and to specify the geometric regularity of functions. It also opens a mathematical bridge between harmonic analysis and denoising estimators with deep convolutional network.

  Vision-language models (VLMs) have recently shown remarkable zero-shot performance in medical image understanding, yet their grounding ability, the extent to which textual concepts align with visual evidence, remains underexplored. In the medical domain, however, reliable grounding is essential for interpretability and clinical adoption. In this work, we present the first systematic benchmark for evaluating cross-modal interpretability in chest X-rays across seven CLIP-style VLM variants. We generate visual explanations using cross-attention and similarity-based localization maps, and quantitatively assess their alignment with radiologist-annotated regions across multiple pathologies. Our analysis reveals that: (1) while all VLM variants demonstrate reasonable localization for large and well-defined pathologies, their performance substantially degrades for small or diffuse lesions; (2) models that are pretrained on chest X-ray-specific datasets exhibit improved alignment compared to those trained on general-domain data. (3) The overall recognition ability and grounding ability of the model are strongly correlated. These findings underscore that current VLMs, despite their strong recognition ability, still fall short in clinically reliable grounding, highlighting the need for targeted interpretability benchmarks before deployment in medical practice.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Image Forgery Localization (IFL) is a crucial task in image forensics, aimed at accurately identifying manipulated or tampered regions within an image at the pixel level. Existing methods typically generate a single deterministic localization map, which often lacks the precision and reliability required for high-stakes applications such as forensic analysis and security surveillance. To enhance the credibility of predictions and mitigate the risk of errors, we introduce an advanced Conditional Bernoulli Diffusion Model (CBDiff). Given a forged image, CBDiff generates multiple diverse and plausible localization maps, thereby offering a richer and more comprehensive representation of the forgery distribution. This approach addresses the uncertainty and variability inherent in tampered regions. Furthermore, CBDiff innovatively incorporates Bernoulli noise into the diffusion process to more faithfully reflect the inherent binary and sparse properties of forgery masks. Additionally, CBDiff introduces a Time-Step Cross-Attention (TSCAttention), which is specifically designed to leverage semantic feature guidance with temporal steps to improve manipulation detection. Extensive experiments on eight publicly benchmark datasets demonstrate that CBDiff significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, highlighting its strong potential for real-world deployment.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) demonstrate strong video understanding by attending to visual tokens relevant to textual queries. To directly adapt this for localization in a training-free manner, we cast video reasoning segmentation as a video QA task and extract attention maps via rollout mechanism. However, raw attention maps are noisy and poorly aligned with object regions. We propose Decomposed Attention Fusion (DecAF), which refines these maps through two mechanisms: (1) contrastive object-background fusion and (2) complementary video-frame fusion. This method suppresses irrelevant activations and enhances object-focused cues, enabling direct conversion of attention maps into coarse segmentation masks. In addition, we introduce attention-guided SAM2 prompting for obtaining fine-grained masks. Unlike existing methods that jointly train MLLMs with SAM, our method operates entirely without retraining. DecAF outperforms training-free methods and achieves performance comparable to training-based methods on both referring and reasoning VOS benchmarks. The code will be available atthis https URL.

  Millions of clinical ECGs exist only as paper scans, making them unusable for modern automated diagnostics. We introduce a fully automated, modular framework that converts scanned or photographed ECGs into digital signals, suitable for both clinical and research applications. The framework is validated on 37,191 ECG images with 1,596 collected at Akershus University Hospital, where the algorithm obtains a mean signal-to-noise ratio of 19.65 dB on scanned papers with common artifacts. It is further evaluated on the Emory Paper Digitization ECG Dataset, comprising 35,595 images, including images with perspective distortion, wrinkles, and stains. The model improves on the state-of-the-art in all subcategories. The full software is released as open-source, promoting reproducibility and further development. We hope the software will contribute to unlocking retrospective ECG archives and democratize access to AI-driven diagnostics.

  This paper investigates methods for estimating uncertainty in semantic segmentation predictions derived from satellite imagery. Estimating uncertainty for segmentation presents unique challenges compared to standard image classification, requiring scalable methods producing per-pixel estimates. While most research on this topic has focused on scene understanding or medical imaging, this work benchmarks existing methods specifically for remote sensing and Earth observation applications. Our evaluation focuses on the practical utility of uncertainty measures, testing their ability to identify prediction errors and noise-corrupted input image regions. Experiments are conducted on two remote sensing datasets, PASTIS and ForTy, selected for their differences in scale, geographic coverage, and label confidence. We perform an extensive evaluation featuring several models, such as Stochastic Segmentation Networks and ensembles, in combination with a number of neural architectures and uncertainty metrics. We make a number of practical recommendations based on our findings.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multi-modal co-learning is emerging as an effective paradigm in machine learning, enabling models to collaboratively learn from different modalities to enhance single-modality predictions. Earth Observation (EO) represents a quintessential domain for multi-modal data analysis, wherein diverse remote sensors collect data to sense our planet. This unprecedented volume of data introduces novel challenges. Specifically, the access to the same sensor modalities at both training and inference stages becomes increasingly complex based on real-world constraints affecting remote sensing platforms. In this context, multi-modal co-learning presents a promising strategy to leverage the vast amount of sensor-derived data available at the training stage to improve single-modality models for inference-time deployment. Most current research efforts focus on designing customized solutions for either particular downstream tasks or specific modalities available at the inference stage. To address this, we propose a novel multi-modal co-learning framework capable of generalizing across various tasks without targeting a specific modality for inference. Our approach combines contrastive and modality discriminative learning together to guide single-modality models to structure the internal model manifold into modality-shared and modality-specific information. We evaluate our framework on four EO benchmarks spanning classification and regression tasks across different sensor modalities, where only one of the modalities available during training is accessible at inference time. Our results demonstrate consistent predictive improvements over state-of-the-art approaches from the recent machine learning and computer vision literature, as well as EO-specific methods. The obtained findings validate our framework in the single-modality inference scenarios across a diverse range of EO applications.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Feed-forward surround-view autonomous driving scene reconstruction offers fast, generalizable inference ability, which faces the core challenge of ensuring generalization while elevating novel view quality. Due to the surround-view with minimal overlap regions, existing methods typically fail to ensure geometric consistency and reconstruction quality for novel views. To tackle this tension, we claim that geometric information must be learned explicitly, and the resulting features should be leveraged to guide the elevating of semantic quality in novel views. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{Visual Gaussian Driving (VGD)}, a novel feed-forward end-to-end learning framework designed to address this challenge. To achieve generalizable geometric estimation, we design a lightweight variant of the VGGT architecture to efficiently distill its geometric priors from the pre-trained VGGT to the geometry branch. Furthermore, we design a Gaussian Head that fuses multi-scale geometry tokens to predict Gaussian parameters for novel view rendering, which shares the same patch backbone as the geometry branch. Finally, we integrate multi-scale features from both geometry and Gaussian head branches to jointly supervise a semantic refinement model, optimizing rendering quality through feature-consistent learning. Experiments on nuScenes demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both objective metrics and subjective quality under various settings, which validates VGD's scalability and high-fidelity surround-view reconstruction.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  RGB cameras excel at capturing rich texture details with high spatial resolution, whereas event cameras offer exceptional temporal resolution and a high dynamic range (HDR). Leveraging their complementary strengths can substantially enhance object tracking under challenging conditions, such as high-speed motion, HDR environments, and dynamic background interference. However, a significant spatio-temporal asymmetry exists between these two modalities due to their fundamentally different imaging mechanisms, hindering effective multi-modal integration. To address this issue, we propose {Hierarchical Asymmetric Distillation} (HAD), a multi-modal knowledge distillation framework that explicitly models and mitigates spatio-temporal asymmetries. Specifically, HAD proposes a hierarchical alignment strategy that minimizes information loss while maintaining the student network's computational efficiency and parameter compactness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HAD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, and comprehensive ablation studies further validate the effectiveness and necessity of each designed component. The code will be released soon.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Text-to-image (T2I) models offer great potential for creating virtually limitless synthetic data, a valuable resource compared to fixed and finite real datasets. Previous works evaluate the utility of synthetic data from T2I models on three key desiderata: quality, diversity, and consistency. While prompt engineering is the primary means of interacting with T2I models, the systematic impact of prompt complexity on these critical utility axes remains underexplored. In this paper, we first conduct synthetic experiments to motivate the difficulty of generalization w.r.t. prompt complexity and explain the observed difficulty with theoretical derivations. Then, we introduce a new evaluation framework that can compare the utility of real data and synthetic data, and present a comprehensive analysis of how prompt complexity influences the utility of synthetic data generated by commonly used T2I models. We conduct our study across diverse datasets, including CC12M, ImageNet-1k, and DCI, and evaluate different inference-time intervention methods. Our synthetic experiments show that generalizing to more general conditions is harder than the other way round, since the former needs an estimated likelihood that is not learned by diffusion models. Our large-scale empirical experiments reveal that increasing prompt complexity results in lower conditional diversity and prompt consistency, while reducing the synthetic-to-real distribution shift, which aligns with the synthetic experiments. Moreover, current inference-time interventions can augment the diversity of the generations at the expense of moving outside the support of real data. Among those interventions, prompt expansion, by deliberately using a pre-trained language model as a likelihood estimator, consistently achieves the highest performance in both image diversity and aesthetics, even higher than that of real data.

  Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have recently gained attention due to their competitive performance on multiple downstream tasks, achieved by following user-input instructions. However, VLMs still exhibit several limitations in visual reasoning, such as difficulties in identifying relations (e.g., spatial, temporal, and among objects), understanding temporal sequences (e.g., frames), and counting objects. In this work, we go beyond score-level benchmark evaluations of VLMs by investigating the underlying causes of their failures and proposing a targeted approach to improve their reasoning capabilities. We study the reasoning skills of seven state-of-the-art VLMs in the counting task under controlled experimental conditions. Our experiments show that VLMs are highly sensitive to the number and type of objects, their spatial arrangement, and the co-occurrence of distractors. A layer-wise analysis reveals that errors are due to incorrect mapping of the last-layer representation into the output space. Our targeted training shows that fine-tuning just the output layer improves accuracy by up to 21%. We corroborate these findings by achieving consistent improvements on real-world datasets.

  Pairwise camera pose estimation from sparsely overlapping image pairs remains a critical and unsolved challenge in 3D vision. Most existing methods struggle with image pairs that have small or no overlap. Recent approaches attempt to address this by synthesizing intermediate frames using video interpolation and selecting key frames via a self-consistency score. However, the generated frames are often blurry due to small overlap inputs, and the selection strategies are slow and not explicitly aligned with pose estimation. To solve these cases, we propose Hybrid Video Generation (HVG) to synthesize clearer intermediate frames by coupling a video interpolation model with a pose-conditioned novel view synthesis model, where we also propose a Feature Matching Selector (FMS) based on feature correspondence to select intermediate frames appropriate for pose estimation from the synthesized results. Extensive experiments on Cambridge Landmarks, ScanNet, DL3DV-10K, and NAVI demonstrate that, compared to existing SOTA methods, PoseCrafter can obviously enhance the pose estimation performances, especially on examples with small or no overlap.

  Large vision-language models (VLMs) commonly process images at native or high resolution to remain effective across tasks. This inflates visual tokens ofter to 97-99% of total tokens, resulting in high compute and latency, even when low-resolution images would suffice. We introduce \emph{CARES}-a \textbf{C}ontext-\textbf{A}ware \textbf{R}esolution \textbf{S}elector, a lightweight preprocessing module that, given an image-query pair, predicts the \emph{minimal} sufficient input resolution. CARES uses a compact VLM (350M) to extract features and predict when a target pretrained VLM's response converges to its peak ability to answer correctly. Though trained as a discrete classifier over a set of optional resolutions, CARES interpolates continuous resolutions at inference for fine-grained control. Across five multimodal benchmarks spanning documents and natural images, as well as diverse target VLMs, CARES preserves task performance while reducing compute by up to 80%.

  _Chen Li, Huiying Xu, Changxin Gao, Zeyu Wang, Yun Liu, Xinzhong Zhu_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Single-source Domain Generalized Object Detection (SDGOD), as a cutting-edge research topic in computer vision, aims to enhance model generalization capability in unseen target domains through single-source domain training. Current mainstream approaches attempt to mitigate domain discrepancies via data augmentation techniques. However, due to domain shift and limited domain-specific knowledge, models tend to fall into the pitfall of spurious correlations. This manifests as the model's over-reliance on simplistic classification features (e.g., color) rather than essential domain-invariant representations like object contours. To address this critical challenge, we propose the Cauvis (Causal Visual Prompts) method. First, we introduce a Cross-Attention Prompts module that mitigates bias from spurious features by integrating visual prompts with cross-attention. To address the inadequate domain knowledge coverage and spurious feature entanglement in visual prompts for single-domain generalization, we propose a dual-branch adapter that disentangles causal-spurious features while achieving domain adaptation via high-frequency feature extraction. Cauvis achieves state-of-the-art performance with 15.9-31.4% gains over existing domain generalization methods on SDGOD datasets, while exhibiting significant robustness advantages in complex interference environments.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Most satellite images have systematically missing pixels (i.e., missing data not at random (MNAR)) due to factors such as clouds. If not addressed, these missing pixels can lead to representation bias in automated feature extraction models. In this work, we show that spurious association between the label and the number of missing values in methane plume detection can cause the model to associate the coverage (i.e., the percentage of valid pixels in an image) with the label, subsequently under-detecting plumes in low-coverage images. We evaluate multiple imputation approaches to remove the dependence between the coverage and a label. Additionally, we propose a weighted resampling scheme during training that removes the association between the label and the coverage by enforcing class balance in each coverage bin. Our results show that both resampling and imputation can significantly reduce the representation bias without hurting balanced accuracy, precision, or recall. Finally, we evaluate the capability of the debiased models using these techniques in an operational scenario and demonstrate that the debiased models have a higher chance of detecting plumes in low-coverage images.

  _Zhuoyang Xie, Yibo Zhao, Hui Huang, Riwei Wang, Zan Gao_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Monocular 3D human pose estimation remains a fundamentally ill-posed inverse problem due to the inherent depth ambiguity in 2D-to-3D lifting. While contemporary video-based methods leverage temporal context to enhance spatial reasoning, they operate under a critical paradigm limitation: processing each sequence in isolation, thereby failing to exploit the strong structural regularities and repetitive motion patterns that pervade human movement across sequences. This work introduces the Pattern Reuse Graph Convolutional Network (PRGCN), a novel framework that formalizes pose estimation as a problem of pattern retrieval and adaptation. At its core, PRGCN features a graph memory bank that learns and stores a compact set of pose prototypes, encoded as relational graphs, which are dynamically retrieved via an attention mechanism to provide structured priors. These priors are adaptively fused with hard-coded anatomical constraints through a memory-driven graph convolution, ensuring geometrical plausibility. To underpin this retrieval process with robust spatiotemporal features, we design a dual-stream hybrid architecture that synergistically combines the linear-complexity, local temporal modeling of Mamba-based state-space models with the global relational capacity of self-attention. Extensive evaluations on Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP benchmarks demonstrate that PRGCN establishes a new state-of-the-art, achieving an MPJPE of 37.1mm and 13.4mm, respectively, while exhibiting enhanced cross-domain generalization capability. Our work posits that the long-overlooked mechanism of cross-sequence pattern reuse is pivotal to advancing the field, shifting the paradigm from per-sequence optimization towards cumulative knowledge learning.

  Recent advancements in artificial intelligence have created transformative capabilities in image synthesis and generation, enabling diverse research fields to innovate at revolutionary speed and spectrum. In this study, we leverage this generative power to introduce a new paradigm for accelerating Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), introducing a shift from image reconstruction to proactive predictive imaging. Despite being a cornerstone of modern patient care, MRI's lengthy acquisition times limit clinical throughput. Our novel framework addresses this challenge by first predicting a target contrast image, which then serves as a data-driven prior for reconstructing highly under-sampled data. This informative prior is predicted by a generative model conditioned on diverse data sources, such as other contrast images, previously scanned images, acquisition parameters, patient information. We demonstrate this approach with two key applications: (1) reconstructing FLAIR images using predictions from T1w and/or T2w scans, and (2) reconstructing T1w images using predictions from previously acquired T1w scans. The framework was evaluated on internal and multiple public datasets (total 14,921 scans; 1,051,904 slices), including multi-channel k-space data, for a range of high acceleration factors (x4, x8 and x12). The results demonstrate that our prediction-prior reconstruction method significantly outperforms other approaches, including those with alternative or no prior information. Through this framework we introduce a fundamental shift from image reconstruction towards a new paradigm of predictive imaging.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Despite significant advancements in deep classification techniques and in-lab automatic optical inspection models for long-tailed or highly imbalanced data, applying these approaches to real-world IC defect classification tasks remains challenging. This difficulty stems from two primary factors. First, real-world conditions, such as the high yield-rate requirements in the IC industry, result in data distributions that are far more skewed than those found in general public imbalanced datasets. Consequently, classifiers designed for open imbalanced datasets often fail to perform effectively in real-world scenarios. Second, real-world samples exhibit a mix of class-specific attributes and class-agnostic, domain-related features. This complexity adds significant difficulty to the classification process, particularly for highly imbalanced datasets. To address these challenges, this paper introduces the IC-Defect-14 dataset, a large, highly imbalanced IC defect image dataset sourced from AOI systems deployed in real-world IC production lines. This dataset is characterized by its unique "intra-class clusters" property, which presents two major challenges: large intra-class diversity and high inter-class similarity. These characteristics, rarely found simultaneously in existing public datasets, significantly degrade the performance of current state-of-the-art classifiers for highly imbalanced data. To tackle this challenge, we propose ReCAME-Net, which follows a multi-expert classifier framework and integrates a regional channel attention module, metric learning losses, a hard category mining strategy, and a knowledge distillation procedure. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that ReCAME-Net outperforms previous state-of-the-art models on the IC-Defect-14 dataset while maintaining comparable performance and competitiveness on general public datasets.

  With the spread of e-commerce, the logistics market is growing around the world. Therefore, improving the efficiency of warehouse operations is essential. To achieve this, various approaches have been explored, and among them, the use of digital twins is gaining attention. To make this approach possible, it is necessary to accurately collect the positions of workers in a warehouse and reflect them in a virtual space. However, a single camera has limitations in its field of view, therefore sensing with multiple cameras is necessary. In this study, we explored a method to track workers using 19 wide-angle cameras installed on the ceiling, looking down at the floor of the logistics warehouse. To understand the relationship between the camera coordinates and the actual positions in the warehouse, we performed alignment based on the floor surface. However, due to the characteristics of wide-angle cameras, significant distortion occurs at the edges of the image, particularly in the vertical direction. To address this, the detected worker positions from each camera were aligned based on foot positions, reducing the effects of image distortion, and enabling accurate position alignment across cameras. As a result, we confirmed an improvement of over 20% in tracking accuracy. Furthermore, we compared multiple methods for utilizing appearance features and validated the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

  Vision-language models (VLMs) are essential to Embodied AI, enabling robots to perceive, reason, and act in complex environments. They also serve as the foundation for the recent Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models. Yet most evaluations of VLMs focus on single-view settings, leaving their ability to integrate multi-view information underexplored. At the same time, multi-camera setups are increasingly standard in robotic platforms, as they provide complementary perspectives to mitigate occlusion and depth ambiguity. Whether VLMs can effectively leverage such multi-view inputs for robotic reasoning therefore remains an open question. To bridge this gap, we introduce MV-RoboBench, a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the multi-view spatial reasoning capabilities of VLMs in robotic manipulation. MV-RoboBench consists of 1.7k manually curated QA items across eight subtasks, divided into two primary categories: spatial understanding and robotic execution. We evaluate a diverse set of existing VLMs, including both open-source and closed-source models, along with enhanced versions incorporating CoT-inspired techniques. The results show that state-of-the-art models remain far below human performance, underscoring the substantial challenges VLMs face in multi-view robotic perception. Additionally, our analysis uncovers two key findings: (i) spatial intelligence and robotic task execution are positively correlated in multi-view robotic scenarios; and (ii) strong performance on existing general-purpose single-view spatial understanding benchmarks does not reliably translate to success in the robotic spatial tasks assessed by our benchmark. We release MV-RoboBench as an open resource to foster progress in spatially grounded VLMs and VLAs, providing not only data but also a standardized evaluation protocol for multi-view embodied reasoning.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have emerged as a powerful tool for 3D scene representation and novel view synthesis, protecting their intellectual property (IP) from unauthorized use is becoming increasingly crucial. In this work, we aim to protect the IP of NeRFs by injecting adversarial perturbations that disrupt their unauthorized applications. However, perturbing the 3D geometry of NeRFs can easily deform the underlying scene structure and thus substantially degrade the rendering quality, which has led existing attempts to avoid geometric perturbations or restrict them to explicit spaces like meshes. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a learnable sensitivity to quantify the spatially varying impact of geometric perturbations on rendering quality. Building upon this, we propose AegisRF, a novel framework that consists of a Perturbation Field, which injects adversarial perturbations into the pre-rendering outputs (color and volume density) of NeRF models to fool an unauthorized downstream target model, and a Sensitivity Field, which learns the sensitivity to adaptively constrain geometric perturbations, preserving rendering quality while disrupting unauthorized use. Our experimental evaluations demonstrate the generalized applicability of AegisRF across diverse downstream tasks and modalities, including multi-view image classification and voxel-based 3D localization, while maintaining high visual fidelity.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Mobile Phone Agents (MPAs) have emerged as a promising research direction due to their broad applicability across diverse scenarios. While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) serve as the foundation for MPAs, their effectiveness in handling multiple mobile phone tasks simultaneously remains limited. Although multitask supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is widely adopted for multitask learning, existing approaches struggle to determine optimal training data compositions for peak performance. To address this challenge, we propose DaMo (Data Mixture Optimizer) - a novel solution employing a trainable network that predicts optimal data mixtures by forecasting downstream task performance for any given dataset ratio. To support comprehensive evaluation, we introduce PhoneAgentBench, the first specialized benchmark to evaluate MLLMs on multimodal mobile phone tasks, comprising 1235 QA pairs spanning diverse real-world industrial mobile application scenarios. Demonstrating strong predictive capability (R^2=0.81) in small-scale pilot experiments, DaMo efficiently extrapolates optimal data mixing configurations. Our results show DaMo achieves a 3.38% performance improvement on PhoneAgentBench compared to alternative methods. Furthermore, extensive experiments across established benchmarks including BFCL-v3, MME-Reasoning, MME-Perception, and OCRBench reveal DaMo's superior generalization, outperforming other approaches by 2.57% in terms of average score. When used solely for MLLM optimization on the BFCL-v3 task, DaMo improves the metrics by 12.47% than other methods. Notably, DaMo maintains robust scalability, preserving its effectiveness when applied to other model architectures. The code and dataset are available atthis https URL

  _Ying Dai, Wei Yu Chen_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper presents a novel training-free framework for open-vocabulary image segmentation and object recognition (OVSR), which leverages EfficientNetB0, a convolutional neural network, for unsupervised segmentation and CLIP, a vision-language model, for open-vocabulary object recognition. The proposed framework adopts a two stage pipeline: unsupervised image segmentation followed by segment-level recognition via vision-language alignment. In the first stage, pixel-wise features extracted from EfficientNetB0 are decomposed using singular value decomposition to obtain latent representations, which are then clustered using hierarchical clustering to segment semantically meaningful regions. The number of clusters is adaptively determined by the distribution of singular values. In the second stage, the segmented regions are localized and encoded into image embeddings using the Vision Transformer backbone of CLIP. Text embeddings are precomputed using CLIP's text encoder from category-specific prompts, including a generic something else prompt to support open set recognition. The image and text embeddings are concatenated and projected into a shared latent feature space via SVD to enhance cross-modal alignment. Recognition is performed by computing the softmax over the similarities between the projected image and text embeddings. The proposed method is evaluated on standard benchmarks, including COCO, ADE20K, and PASCAL VOC, achieving state-of-the-art performance in terms of Hungarian mIoU, precision, recall, and F1-score. These results demonstrate the effectiveness, flexibility, and generalizability of the proposed framework.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Decoding images from fMRI often involves mapping brain activity to CLIP's final semantic layer. To capture finer visual details, many approaches add a parameter-intensive VAE-based pipeline. However, these approaches overlook rich object information within CLIP's intermediate layers and contradicts the brain's functionally hierarchical. We introduce BrainMCLIP, which pioneers a parameter-efficient, multi-layer fusion approach guided by human visual system's functional hierarchy, eliminating the need for such a separate VAE pathway. BrainMCLIP aligns fMRI signals from functionally distinct visual areas (low-/high-level) to corresponding intermediate and final CLIP layers, respecting functional hierarchy. We further introduce a Cross-Reconstruction strategy and a novel multi-granularity loss. Results show BrainMCLIP achieves highly competitive performance, particularly excelling on high-level semantic metrics where it matches or surpasses SOTA(state-of-the-art) methods, including those using VAE pipelines. Crucially, it achieves this with substantially fewer parameters, demonstrating a reduction of 71.7\%(Table.\ref{tab:compare_clip_vae}) compared to top VAE-based SOTA methods, by avoiding the VAE pathway. By leveraging intermediate CLIP features, it effectively captures visual details often missed by CLIP-only approaches, striking a compelling balance between semantic accuracy and detail fidelity without requiring a separate VAE pipeline.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Crowd localization plays a crucial role in visual scene understanding towards predicting each pedestrian location in a crowd, thus being applicable to various downstream tasks. However, existing approaches suffer from significant performance degradation due to discrepancies in head scale distributions (scale shift) between training and testing data, a challenge known as domain generalization (DG). This paper aims to comprehend the nature of scale shift within the context of domain generalization for crowd localization models. To this end, we address four critical questions: (i) How does scale shift influence crowd localization in a DG scenario? (ii) How can we quantify this influence? (iii) What causes this influence? (iv) How to mitigate the influence? Initially, we conduct a systematic examination of how crowd localization performance varies with different levels of scale shift. Then, we establish a benchmark, ScaleBench, and reproduce 20 advanced DG algorithms to quantify the influence. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the limitations of existing algorithms and underscore the importance and complexity of scale shift, a topic that remains insufficiently explored. To deepen our understanding, we provide a rigorous theoretical analysis on scale shift. Building on these insights, we further propose an effective algorithm called Causal Feature Decomposition and Anisotropic Processing (Catto) to mitigate the influence of scale shift in DG settings. Later, we also provide extensive analytical experiments, revealing four significant insights for future research. Our results emphasize the importance of this novel and applicable research direction, which we term Scale Shift Domain Generalization.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Accurate, detailed, and regularly updated bathymetry, coupled with complex semantic content, is essential for under-mapped shallow-water environments facing increasing climatological and anthropogenic pressures. However, existing approaches that derive either depth or seabed classes from remote sensing imagery treat these tasks in isolation, forfeiting the mutual benefits of their interaction and hindering the broader adoption of deep learning methods. To address these limitations, we introduce Seabed-Net, a unified multi-task framework that simultaneously predicts bathymetry and pixel-based seabed classification from remote sensing imagery of various resolutions. Seabed-Net employs dual-branch encoders for bathymetry estimation and pixel-based seabed classification, integrates cross-task features via an Attention Feature Fusion module and a windowed Swin-Transformer fusion block, and balances objectives through dynamic task uncertainty weighting. In extensive evaluations at two heterogeneous coastal sites, it consistently outperforms traditional empirical models and traditional machine learning regression methods, achieving up to 75\% lower RMSE. It also reduces bathymetric RMSE by 10-30\% compared to state-of-the-art single-task and multi-task baselines and improves seabed classification accuracy up to 8\%. Qualitative analyses further demonstrate enhanced spatial consistency, sharper habitat boundaries, and corrected depth biases in low-contrast regions. These results confirm that jointly modeling depth with both substrate and seabed habitats yields synergistic gains, offering a robust, open solution for integrated shallow-water mapping.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Handwritten signature verification is a crucial aspect of identity authentication, with applications in various domains such as finance and e-commerce. However, achieving high accuracy in signature verification remains challenging due to intra-user variability and the risk of forgery. This paper introduces a novel approach for dynamic signature verification: the Temporal-Spatial Graph Attention Transformer (TS-GATR). TS-GATR combines the Graph Attention Network (GAT) and the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) to model both spatial and temporal dependencies in signature data. TS-GATR enhances verification performance by representing signatures as graphs, where each node captures dynamic features (e.g. position, velocity, pressure), and by using attention mechanisms to model their complex relationships. The proposed method further employs a Dual-Graph Attention Transformer (DGATR) module, which utilizes k-step and k-nearest neighbor adjacency graphs to model local and global spatial features, respectively. To capture long-term temporal dependencies, the model integrates GRU, thereby enhancing its ability to learn dynamic features during signature verification. Comprehensive experiments conducted on benchmark datasets such as MSDS and DeepSignDB show that TS-GATR surpasses current state-of-the-art approaches, consistently achieving lower Equal Error Rates (EER) across various scenarios.

  Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable progress, yet their large scale often renders them impractical for resource-constrained environments. This paper introduces Unified Reinforcement and Imitation Learning (RIL), a novel and efficient training algorithm designed to create powerful, lightweight VLMs. RIL distinctively combines the strengths of reinforcement learning with adversarial imitation learning. This enables smaller student VLMs not only to mimic the sophisticated text generation of large teacher models but also to systematically improve their generative capabilities through reinforcement signals. Key to our imitation framework is an LLM-based discriminator that adeptly distinguishes between student and teacher outputs, complemented by guidance from multiple large teacher VLMs to ensure diverse learning. This unified learning strategy, leveraging both reinforcement and imitation, empowers student models to achieve significant performance gains, making them competitive with leading closed-source VLMs. Extensive experiments on diverse vision-language benchmarks demonstrate that RIL significantly narrows the performance gap with state-of-the-art open- and closed-source VLMs and, in several instances, surpasses them.

  Mistake analysis in procedural activities is a critical area of research with applications spanning industrial automation, physical rehabilitation, education and human-robot collaboration. This paper reviews vision-based methods for detecting and predicting mistakes in structured tasks, focusing on procedural and executional errors. By leveraging advancements in computer vision, including action recognition, anticipation and activity understanding, vision-based systems can identify deviations in task execution, such as incorrect sequencing, use of improper techniques, or timing errors. We explore the challenges posed by intra-class variability, viewpoint differences and compositional activity structures, which complicate mistake detection. Additionally, we provide a comprehensive overview of existing datasets, evaluation metrics and state-of-the-art methods, categorizing approaches based on their use of procedural structure, supervision levels and learning strategies. Open challenges, such as distinguishing permissible variations from true mistakes and modeling error propagation are discussed alongside future directions, including neuro-symbolic reasoning and counterfactual state modeling. This work aims to establish a unified perspective on vision-based mistake analysis in procedural activities, highlighting its potential to enhance safety, efficiency and task performance across diverse domains.

  Alzheimer disease is a severe brain disorder that causes harm in various brain areas and leads to memory damage. The limited availability of labeled medical data poses a significant challenge for accurate Alzheimer disease detection. There is a critical need for effective methods to improve the accuracy of Alzheimer disease detection, considering the scarcity of labeled data, the complexity of the disease, and the constraints related to data privacy. To address this challenge, our study leverages the power of big data in the form of pre-trained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) within the framework of Few-Shot Learning (FSL) and ensemble learning. We propose an ensemble approach based on a Prototypical Network (ProtoNet), a powerful method in FSL, integrating various pre-trained CNNs as encoders. This integration enhances the richness of features extracted from medical images. Our approach also includes a combination of class-aware loss and entropy loss to ensure a more precise classification of Alzheimer disease progression levels. The effectiveness of our method was evaluated using two datasets, the Kaggle Alzheimer dataset and the ADNI dataset, achieving an accuracy of 99.72% and 99.86%, respectively. The comparison of our results with relevant state-of-the-art studies demonstrated that our approach achieved superior accuracy and highlighted its validity and potential for real-world applications in early Alzheimer disease detection.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have achieved strong performance in semantic alignment, yet they still struggle with generating the correct number of objects specified in prompts. Existing approaches typically incorporate auxiliary counting networks as external critics to enhance numeracy. However, since these critics must provide gradient guidance during generation, they are restricted to regression-based models that are inherently differentiable, thus excluding detector-based models with superior counting ability, whose count-via-enumeration nature is non-differentiable. To overcome this limitation, we propose Detector-to-Differentiable (D2D), a novel framework that transforms non-differentiable detection models into differentiable critics, thereby leveraging their superior counting ability to guide numeracy generation. Specifically, we design custom activation functions to convert detector logits into soft binary indicators, which are then used to optimize the noise prior at inference time with pre-trained T2I models. Our extensive experiments on SDXL-Turbo, SD-Turbo, and Pixart-DMD across four benchmarks of varying complexity (low-density, high-density, and multi-object scenarios) demonstrate consistent and substantial improvements in object counting accuracy (e.g., boosting up to 13.7% on D2D-Small, a 400-prompt, low-density benchmark), with minimal degradation in overall image quality and computational overhead.

  _Zhang Nengbo, Ho Hann Woei_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Accurate and efficient recognition of Micro Air Vehicle (MAV) motion is essential for enabling real-time perception and coordination in autonomous aerial swarm. However, most existing approaches rely on large, computationally intensive models that are unsuitable for resource-limited MAV platforms, which results in a trade-off between recognition accuracy and inference speed. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a lightweight MAV action recognition framework, MobiAct, designed to achieve high accuracy with low computational cost. Specifically, MobiAct adopts MobileNetV4 as the backbone network and introduces a Stage-wise Orthogonal Knowledge Distillation (SOKD) strategy to effectively transfer MAV motion features from a teacher network (ResNet18) to a student network, thereby enhancing knowledge transfer efficiency. Furthermore, a parameter-free attention mechanism is integrated into the architecture to improve recognition accuracy without increasing model complexity. In addition, a hybrid loss training strategy is developed to combine multiple loss objectives, which ensures stable and robust optimization during training. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed MobiAct achieves low-energy and low-computation MAV action recognition, while maintaining the fastest action decoding speed among compared methods. Across all three self-collected datasets, MobiAct achieves an average recognition accuracy of 92.12%, while consuming only 136.16 pJ of energy and processing recognition at a rate of 8.84 actions per second. Notably, MobiAct decodes actions up to 2 times faster than the leading method, with highly comparable recognition accuracy, highlighting its superior efficiency in MAV action recognition.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR) must handle complex degradations and inherent reconstruction ambiguities. While generative models have improved perceptual quality, a key trade-off remains with computational cost. One-step diffusion models offer speed but often produce structural inaccuracies due to distillation artifacts. To address this, we propose a novel SR framework that enhances a one-step diffusion model using a ControlNet mechanism for semantic edge guidance. This integrates edge information to provide dynamic structural control during single-pass inference. We also introduce a hybrid loss combining L2, LPIPS, and an edge-aware AME loss to optimize for pixel accuracy, perceptual quality, and geometric precision. Experiments show our method effectively improves structural integrity and realism while maintaining the efficiency of one-step generation, achieving a superior balance between output quality and inference speed. The results of test datasets will be published atthis https URLand the related code will be published atthis https URL.

  We present a survey on 4D generation and reconstruction, a fast-evolving subfield of computer graphics whose developments have been propelled by recent advances in neural fields, geometric and motion deep learning, as well 3D generative artificial intelligence (GenAI). While our survey is not the first of its kind, we build our coverage of the domain from a unique and distinctive perspective of 4D representations\/}, to model 3D geometry evolving over time while exhibiting motion and interaction. Specifically, instead of offering an exhaustive enumeration of many works, we take a more selective approach by focusing on representative works to highlight both the desirable properties and ensuing challenges of each representation under different computation, application, and data scenarios. The main take-away message we aim to convey to the readers is on how to select and then customize the appropriate 4D representations for their tasks. Organizationally, we separate the 4D representations based on three key pillars: geometry, motion, and interaction. Our discourse will not only encompass the most popular representations of today, such as neural radiance fields (NeRFs) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), but also bring attention to relatively under-explored representations in the 4D context, such as structured models and long-range motions. Throughout our survey, we will reprise the role of large language models (LLMs) and video foundational models (VFMs) in a variety of 4D applications, while steering our discussion towards their current limitations and how they can be addressed. We also provide a dedicated coverage on what 4D datasets are currently available, as well as what is lacking, in driving the subfield forward. Project page:this https URL

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Collaborative perception enhances the reliability and spatial coverage of autonomous vehicles by sharing complementary information across vehicles, offering a promising solution to long-tail scenarios that challenge single-vehicle perception. However, the bandwidth constraints of vehicular networks make transmitting the entire feature map impractical. Recent methods, therefore, adopt a foreground-centric paradigm, transmitting only predicted foreground-region features while discarding the background, which encodes essential context. We propose FadeLead, a foreground-centric framework that overcomes this limitation by learning to encapsulate background context into compact foreground features during training. At the core of our design is a curricular learning strategy that leverages background cues early on but progressively prunes them away, forcing the model to internalize context into foreground representations without transmitting background itself. Extensive experiments on both simulated and real-world benchmarks show that FadeLead outperforms prior methods under different bandwidth settings, underscoring the effectiveness of context-enriched foreground sharing.

  Space objects in Geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO) present significant detection challenges in optical imaging due to weak signals, complex stellar backgrounds, and environmental interference. In this paper, we enhance high-frequency features of GEO targets while suppressing background noise at the single-frame level through wavelet transform. Building on this, we propose a multi-frame temporal trajectory completion scheme centered on the Hungarian algorithm for globally optimal cross-frame matching. To effectively mitigate missing and false detections, a series of key steps including temporal matching and interpolation completion, temporal-consistency-based noise filtering, and progressive trajectory refinement are designed in the post-processing pipeline. Experimental results on the public SpotGEO dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, achieving an F_1 score of 90.14%.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  3D object detection is essential for autonomous driving. As an emerging sensor, 4D imaging radar offers advantages as low cost, long-range detection, and accurate velocity measurement, making it highly suitable for object detection. However, its sparse point clouds and low resolution limit object geometric representation and hinder multi-modal fusion. In this study, we introduce SFGFusion, a novel camera-4D imaging radar detection network guided by surface fitting. By estimating quadratic surface parameters of objects from image and radar data, the explicit surface fitting model enhances spatial representation and cross-modal interaction, enabling more reliable prediction of fine-grained dense depth. The predicted depth serves two purposes: 1) in an image branch to guide the transformation of image features from perspective view (PV) to a unified bird's-eye view (BEV) for multi-modal fusion, improving spatial mapping accuracy; and 2) in a surface pseudo-point branch to generate dense pseudo-point cloud, mitigating the radar point sparsity. The original radar point cloud is also encoded in a separate radar branch. These two point cloud branches adopt a pillar-based method and subsequently transform the features into the BEV space. Finally, a standard 2D backbone and detection head are used to predict object labels and bounding boxes from BEV features. Experimental results show that SFGFusion effectively fuses camera and 4D radar features, achieving superior performance on the TJ4DRadSet and view-of-delft (VoD) object detection benchmarks.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in dynamic scene reconstruction have significantly benefited from 3D Gaussian Splatting, yet existing methods show inconsistent performance across diverse scenes, indicating no single approach effectively handles all dynamic challenges. To overcome these limitations, we propose Mixture of Experts for Dynamic Gaussian Splatting (MoE-GS), a unified framework integrating multiple specialized experts via a novel Volume-aware Pixel Router. Our router adaptively blends expert outputs by projecting volumetric Gaussian-level weights into pixel space through differentiable weight splatting, ensuring spatially and temporally coherent results. Although MoE-GS improves rendering quality, the increased model capacity and reduced FPS are inherent to the MoE architecture. To mitigate this, we explore two complementary directions: (1) single-pass multi-expert rendering and gate-aware Gaussian pruning, which improve efficiency within the MoE framework, and (2) a distillation strategy that transfers MoE performance to individual experts, enabling lightweight deployment without architectural changes. To the best of our knowledge, MoE-GS is the first approach incorporating Mixture-of-Experts techniques into dynamic Gaussian splatting. Extensive experiments on the N3V and Technicolor datasets demonstrate that MoE-GS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods with improved efficiency.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advancements in driving world models enable controllable generation of high-quality RGB videos or multimodal videos. Existing methods primarily focus on metrics related to generation quality and controllability. However, they often overlook the evaluation of downstream perception tasks, which are $\mathbf{really\ crucial}$ for the performance of autonomous driving. Existing methods usually leverage a training strategy that first pretrains on synthetic data and finetunes on real data, resulting in twice the epochs compared to the baseline (real data only). When we double the epochs in the baseline, the benefit of synthetic data becomes negligible. To thoroughly demonstrate the benefit of synthetic data, we introduce Dream4Drive, a novel synthetic data generation framework designed for enhancing the downstream perception tasks. Dream4Drive first decomposes the input video into several 3D-aware guidance maps and subsequently renders the 3D assets onto these guidance maps. Finally, the driving world model is fine-tuned to produce the edited, multi-view photorealistic videos, which can be used to train the downstream perception models. Dream4Drive enables unprecedented flexibility in generating multi-view corner cases at scale, significantly boosting corner case perception in autonomous driving. To facilitate future research, we also contribute a large-scale 3D asset dataset named DriveObj3D, covering the typical categories in driving scenarios and enabling diverse 3D-aware video editing. We conduct comprehensive experiments to show that Dream4Drive can effectively boost the performance of downstream perception models under various training epochs.

  _Takehiro Aoshima, Yusuke Shinohara, Park Byeongseon_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reward-based fine-tuning of video diffusion models is an effective approach to improve the quality of generated videos, as it can fine-tune models without requiring real-world video datasets. However, it can sometimes be limited to specific performances because conventional reward functions are mainly aimed at enhancing the quality across the whole generated video sequence, such as aesthetic appeal and overall consistency. Notably, the temporal consistency of the generated video often suffers when applying previous approaches to image-to-video (I2V) generation tasks. To address this limitation, we propose Video Consistency Distance (VCD), a novel metric designed to enhance temporal consistency, and fine-tune a model with the reward-based fine-tuning framework. To achieve coherent temporal consistency relative to a conditioning image, VCD is defined in the frequency space of video frame features to capture frame information effectively through frequency-domain analysis. Experimental results across multiple I2V datasets demonstrate that fine-tuning a video generation model with VCD significantly enhances temporal consistency without degrading other performance compared to the previous method.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  While multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant progress in recent years, the issue of hallucinations remains a major challenge. To mitigate this phenomenon, existing solutions either introduce additional data for further training or incorporate external or internal information during inference. However, these approaches inevitably introduce extra computational costs. In this paper, we observe that hallucinations in MLLMs are strongly associated with insufficient attention allocated to visual tokens. In particular, the presence of redundant visual tokens disperses the model's attention, preventing it from focusing on the most informative ones. As a result, critical visual cues are often under-attended, which in turn exacerbates the occurrence of hallucinations. Building on this observation, we propose \textbf{PruneHal}, a training-free, simple yet effective method that leverages adaptive KV cache pruning to enhance the model's focus on critical visual information, thereby mitigating hallucinations. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to apply token pruning for hallucination mitigation in MLLMs. Notably, our method don't require additional training and incurs nearly no extra inference cost. Moreover, PruneHal is model-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated with different decoding strategies, including those specifically designed for hallucination mitigation. We evaluate PruneHal on several widely used hallucination evaluation benchmarks using four mainstream MLLMs, achieving robust and outstanding results that highlight the effectiveness and superiority of our method. Our code will be publicly available.

  Malaria, which primarily spreads with the bite of female anopheles mosquitos, often leads to death of people - specifically children in the age-group of 0-5 years. Clinical experts identify malaria by observing RBCs in blood smeared images with a microscope. Lack of adequate professional knowledge and skills, and most importantly manual involvement may cause incorrect diagnosis. Therefore, computer aided automatic diagnosis stands as a preferred substitute. In this paper, well-demonstrated deep networks have been applied to extract deep intrinsic features from blood cell images and thereafter classify them as malaria infected or healthy cells. Among the six deep convolutional networks employed in this work viz. AlexNet, XceptionNet, VGG-19, Residual Attention Network, DenseNet-121 and Custom-CNN. Residual Attention Network and XceptionNet perform relatively better than the rest on a publicly available malaria cell image dataset. They yield an average accuracy of 97.28% and 97.55% respectively, that surpasses other related methods on the same dataset. These findings highly encourage the reality of deep learning driven method for automatic and reliable detection of malaria while minimizing direct manual involvement.

  Human team tactics emerge from each player's individual perspective and their ability to anticipate, interpret, and adapt to teammates' intentions. While advances in video understanding have improved the modeling of team interactions in sports, most existing work relies on third-person broadcast views and overlooks the synchronous, egocentric nature of multi-agent learning. We introduce X-Ego-CS, a benchmark dataset consisting of 124 hours of gameplay footage from 45 professional-level matches of the popular e-sports game Counter-Strike 2, designed to facilitate research on multi-agent decision-making in complex 3D environments. X-Ego-CS provides cross-egocentric video streams that synchronously capture all players' first-person perspectives along with state-action trajectories. Building on this resource, we propose Cross-Ego Contrastive Learning (CECL), which aligns teammates' egocentric visual streams to foster team-level tactical situational awareness from an individual's perspective. We evaluate CECL on a teammate-opponent location prediction task, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing an agent's ability to infer both teammate and opponent positions from a single first-person view using state-of-the-art video encoders. Together, X-Ego-CS and CECL establish a foundation for cross-egocentric multi-agent benchmarking in esports. More broadly, our work positions gameplay understanding as a testbed for multi-agent modeling and tactical learning, with implications for spatiotemporal reasoning and human-AI teaming in both virtual and real-world domains.

  Breast cancer is a leading cause of death among women worldwide, emphasizing the need for early detection and accurate diagnosis. As such Ultrasound Imaging, a reliable and cost-effective tool, is used for this purpose, however the sensitive nature of medical data makes it challenging to develop accurate and private artificial intelligence models. A solution is Federated Learning as it is a promising technique for distributed machine learning on sensitive medical data while preserving patient privacy. However, training on non-Independent and non-Identically Distributed (non-IID) local datasets can impact the accuracy and generalization of the trained model, which is crucial for accurate tumour boundary delineation in BC segmentation. This study aims to tackle this challenge by applying the Federated Proximal (FedProx) method to non-IID Ultrasonic Breast Cancer Imaging datasets. Moreover, we focus on enhancing tumour segmentation accuracy by incorporating a modified U-Net model with attention mechanisms. Our approach resulted in a global model with 96% accuracy, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method in enhancing tumour segmentation accuracy while preserving patient privacy. Our findings suggest that FedProx has the potential to be a promising approach for training precise machine learning models on non-IID local medical datasets.

  In the realm of medical diagnostics, rapid advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) have significantly yielded remarkable improvements in brain tumor segmentation. Encoder-Decoder architectures, such as U-Net, have played a transformative role by effectively extracting meaningful representations in 3D brain tumor segmentation from Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. However, standard U-Net models encounter challenges in accurately delineating tumor regions, especially when dealing with irregular shapes and ambiguous boundaries. Additionally, training robust segmentation models on high-resolution MRI data, such as the BraTS datasets, necessitates high computational resources and often faces challenges associated with class imbalance. This study proposes the integration of the attention mechanism into the 3D U-Net model, enabling the model to capture intricate details and prioritize informative regions during the segmentation process. Additionally, a tumor detection algorithm based on digital image processing techniques is utilized to address the issue of imbalanced training data and mitigate bias. This study aims to enhance the performance of brain tumor segmentation, ultimately improving the reliability of diagnosis. The proposed model is thoroughly evaluated and assessed on the BraTS 2020 dataset using various performance metrics to accomplish this goal. The obtained results indicate that the model outperformed related studies, exhibiting dice of 0.975, specificity of 0.988, and sensitivity of 0.995, indicating the efficacy of the proposed model in improving brain tumor segmentation, offering valuable insights for reliable diagnosis in clinical settings.

  In recent years, there has been a growing interest in developing effective alignment pipelines to generate unified representations from different modalities for multi-modal fusion and generation. As an important component of Human-Centric applications, Human Pose representations are critical in many downstream tasks, such as Human Pose Estimation, Action Recognition, Human-Computer Interaction, Object tracking, etc. Human Pose representations or embeddings can be extracted from images, 2D keypoints, 3D skeletons, mesh models, and lots of other modalities. Yet, there are limited instances where the correlation among all of those representations has been clearly researched using a contrastive paradigm. In this paper, we propose UniHPR, a unified Human Pose Representation learning pipeline, which aligns Human Pose embeddings from images, 2D and 3D human poses. To align more than two data representations at the same time, we propose a novel singular value-based contrastive learning loss, which better aligns different modalities and further boosts performance. To evaluate the effectiveness of the aligned representation, we choose 2D and 3D Human Pose Estimation (HPE) as our evaluation tasks. In our evaluation, with a simple 3D human pose decoder, UniHPR achieves remarkable performance metrics: MPJPE 49.9mm on the Human3.6M dataset and PA-MPJPE 51.6mm on the 3DPW dataset with cross-domain evaluation. Meanwhile, we are able to achieve 2D and 3D pose retrieval with our unified human pose representations in Human3.6M dataset, where the retrieval error is 9.24mm in MPJPE.

  While vision-language models (VLMs) have advanced into detailed image description, evaluation remains a challenge. Standard metrics (e.g. CIDEr, SPICE) were designed for short texts and tuned to recognize errors that are now uncommon, such as object misidentification. In contrast, long texts require sensitivity to attribute and relation attachments and scores that localize errors to particular text spans. In this work, we introduce PoSh, a metric for detailed image description that uses scene graphs as structured rubrics to guide LLMs-as-a-Judge, producing aggregate scores grounded in fine-grained errors (e.g. mistakes in compositional understanding). PoSh is replicable, interpretable and a better proxy for human raters than existing metrics (including GPT4o-as-a-Judge). To validate PoSh, we introduce a challenging new dataset, DOCENT. This novel benchmark contains artwork, paired with expert-written references, and model-generated descriptions, augmented with granular and coarse judgments of their quality from art history students. Thus, DOCENT enables evaluating both detailed image description metrics and detailed image description itself in a challenging new domain. We show that PoSh achieves stronger correlations (+0.05 Spearman $\rho$) with the human judgments in DOCENT than the best open-weight alternatives, is robust to image type (using CapArena, an existing dataset of web imagery) and is a capable reward function, outperforming standard supervised fine-tuning. Then, using PoSh, we characterize the performance of open and closed models in describing the paintings, sketches and statues in DOCENT and find that foundation models struggle to achieve full, error-free coverage of images with rich scene dynamics, establishing a demanding new task to gauge VLM progress. Through both PoSh and DOCENT, we hope to enable advances in important areas such as assistive text generation.

  Text-to-video diffusion models have enabled high-quality video synthesis, yet often fail to generate temporally coherent and physically plausible motion. A key reason is the models' insufficient understanding of complex motions that natural videos often entail. Recent works tackle this problem by aligning diffusion model features with those from pretrained video encoders. However, these encoders mix video appearance and dynamics into entangled features, limiting the benefit of such alignment. In this paper, we propose a motion-centric alignment framework that learns a disentangled motion subspace from a pretrained video encoder. This subspace is optimized to predict ground-truth optical flow, ensuring it captures true motion dynamics. We then align the latent features of a text-to-video diffusion model to this new subspace, enabling the generative model to internalize motion knowledge and generate more plausible videos. Our method improves the physical commonsense in a state-of-the-art video diffusion model, while preserving adherence to textual prompts, as evidenced by empirical evaluations on VideoPhy, VideoPhy2, VBench, and VBench-2.0, along with a user study.

  Longitudinal analysis of sequential radiological images is hampered by a fundamental data challenge: how to effectively model a sequence of high-resolution images captured at irregular time intervals. This data structure contains indispensable spatial and temporal cues that current methods fail to fully exploit. Models often compromise by either collapsing spatial information into vectors or applying spatio-temporal models that are computationally inefficient and incompatible with non-uniform time steps. We address this challenge with Time-Aware $\Delta$t-Mamba3D, a novel state-space architecture adapted for longitudinal medical imaging. Our model simultaneously encodes irregular inter-visit intervals and rich spatio-temporal context while remaining computationally efficient. Its core innovation is a continuous-time selective scanning mechanism that explicitly integrates the true time difference between exams into its state transitions. This is complemented by a multi-scale 3D neighborhood fusion module that robustly captures spatio-temporal relationships. In a comprehensive breast cancer risk prediction benchmark using sequential screening mammogram exams, our model shows superior performance, improving the validation c-index by 2-5 percentage points and achieving higher 1-5 year AUC scores compared to established variants of recurrent, transformer, and state-space models. Thanks to its linear complexity, the model can efficiently process long and complex patient screening histories of mammograms, forming a new framework for longitudinal image analysis.

  We present a two-phase vision-language QA system for autonomous driving that answers high-level perception, prediction, and planning questions. In Phase-1, a large multimodal LLM (Qwen2.5-VL-32B) is conditioned on six-camera inputs, a short temporal window of history, and a chain-of-thought prompt with few-shot exemplars. A self-consistency ensemble (multiple sampled reasoning chains) further improves answer reliability. In Phase-2, we augment the prompt with nuScenes scene metadata (object annotations, ego-vehicle state, etc.) and category-specific question instructions (separate prompts for perception, prediction, planning tasks). In experiments on a driving QA benchmark, our approach significantly outperforms the baseline Qwen2.5 models. For example, using 5 history frames and 10-shot prompting in Phase-1 yields 65.1% overall accuracy (vs.62.61% with zero-shot); applying self-consistency raises this to 66.85%. Phase-2 achieves 67.37% overall. Notably, the system maintains 96% accuracy under severe visual corruption. These results demonstrate that carefully engineered prompts and contextual grounding can greatly enhance high-level driving QA with pretrained vision-language models.

  Earth observation involves collecting, analyzing, and processing an ever-growing mass of data. Automatically harvesting information is crucial for addressing significant societal, economic, and environmental challenges, ranging from environmental monitoring to urban planning and disaster management. However, the high dimensionality of these data poses challenges in terms of sparsity, inefficiency, and the curse of dimensionality, which limits the effectiveness of machine learning models. Dimensionality reduction (DR) techniques, specifically feature extraction, address these challenges by preserving essential data properties while reducing complexity and enhancing tasks such as data compression, cleaning, fusion, visualization, anomaly detection, and prediction. This review provides a handbook for leveraging DR across the RS data value chain and identifies opportunities for under-explored DR algorithms and their application in future research.

  While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at holistic understanding, they struggle in capturing the dense world with complex scenes, requiring fine-grained analysis of intricate details and object inter-relationships. Region-level MLLMs have been a promising step. However, previous attempts are generally optimized to understand given regions in isolation, neglecting crucial global contexts. To address this, we introduce Grasp Any Region (GAR) for comprehen- sive region-level visual understanding. Empowered by an effective RoI-aligned feature replay technique, GAR supports (1) precise perception by leveraging necessary global contexts, and (2) modeling interactions between multiple prompts. Together, it then naturally achieves (3) advanced compositional reasoning to answer specific free-form questions about any region, shifting the paradigm from passive description to active dialogue. Moreover, we construct GAR-Bench, which not only provides a more accurate evaluation of single-region comprehension, but also, more importantly, measures interactions and complex reasoning across multiple regions. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that GAR-1B not only maintains the state-of-the-art captioning capabilities, e.g., outperforming DAM-3B +4.5 on DLC-Bench, but also excels at modeling relationships between multiple prompts with advanced comprehension capabilities, even surpassing InternVL3-78B on GAR-Bench-VQA. More importantly, our zero-shot GAR-8B even outperforms in-domain VideoRefer-7B on VideoRefer-BenchQ, indicating its strong capabilities can be easily transferred to videos.

  Video tracking aims at finding the specific target in subsequent frames given its initial state. Due to the varying granularity of target states across different tasks, most existing trackers are tailored to a single task and heavily rely on custom-designed modules within the individual task, which limits their generalization and leads to redundancy in both model design and parameters. To unify video tracking tasks, we present SAM 2++, a unified model towards tracking at any granularity, including masks, boxes, and points. First, to extend target granularity, we design task-specific prompts to encode various task inputs into general prompt embeddings, and a unified decoder to unify diverse task results into a unified form pre-output. Next, to satisfy memory matching, the core operation of tracking, we introduce a task-adaptive memory mechanism that unifies memory across different granularities. Finally, we introduce a customized data engine to support tracking training at any granularity, producing a large and diverse video tracking dataset with rich annotations at three granularities, termed Tracking-Any-Granularity, which represents a comprehensive resource for training and benchmarking on unified tracking. Comprehensive experiments on multiple benchmarks confirm that SAM 2++ sets a new state of the art across diverse tracking tasks at different granularities, establishing a unified and robust tracking framework.

  The original CLIP text encoder is limited by a maximum input length of 77 tokens, which hampers its ability to effectively process long texts and perform fine-grained semantic understanding. In addition, the CLIP text encoder lacks support for multilingual inputs. All these limitations significantly restrict its applicability across a broader range of tasks. Recent studies have attempted to replace the CLIP text encoder with an LLM-based embedder to enhance its ability in processing long texts, multilingual understanding, and fine-grained semantic comprehension. However, because the representation spaces of LLMs and the vision-language space of CLIP are pretrained independently without alignment priors, direct alignment using contrastive learning can disrupt the intrinsic vision-language alignment in the CLIP image encoder, leading to an underutilization of the knowledge acquired during pre-training. To address this challenge, we propose ProCLIP, a curriculum learning-based progressive vision-language alignment framework to effectively align the CLIP image encoder with an LLM-based embedder. Specifically, ProCLIP first distills knowledge from CLIP's text encoder into the LLM-based embedder to leverage CLIP's rich pretrained knowledge while establishing initial alignment between the LLM embedder and CLIP image encoder. Subsequently, ProCLIP further aligns the CLIP image encoder with the LLM-based embedder through image-text contrastive tuning, employing self-distillation regularization to avoid overfitting. To achieve a more effective alignment, instance semantic alignment loss and embedding structure alignment loss are employed during representation inheritance and contrastive tuning.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advancements in vision transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated that larger models often achieve superior performance. However, training these models remains computationally intensive and costly. To address this challenge, we introduce ScaleNet, an efficient approach for scaling ViT models. Unlike conventional training from scratch, ScaleNet facilitates rapid model expansion with negligible increases in parameters, building on existing pretrained models. This offers a cost-effective solution for scaling up ViTs. Specifically, ScaleNet achieves model expansion by inserting additional layers into pretrained ViTs, utilizing layer-wise weight sharing to maintain parameters efficiency. Each added layer shares its parameter tensor with a corresponding layer from the pretrained model. To mitigate potential performance degradation due to shared weights, ScaleNet introduces a small set of adjustment parameters for each layer. These adjustment parameters are implemented through parallel adapter modules, ensuring that each instance of the shared parameter tensor remains distinct and optimized for its specific function. Experiments on the ImageNet-1K dataset demonstrate that ScaleNet enables efficient expansion of ViT models. With a 2$\times$ depth-scaled DeiT-Base model, ScaleNet achieves a 7.42% accuracy improvement over training from scratch while requiring only one-third of the training epochs, highlighting its efficiency in scaling ViTs. Beyond image classification, our method shows significant potential for application in downstream vision areas, as evidenced by the validation in object detection task.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The vulnerability of deep neural networks (DNNs) has been preliminarily verified. Existing black-box adversarial attacks usually require multi-round interaction with the model and consume numerous queries, which is impractical in the real-world and hard to scale to recently emerged Video-LLMs. Moreover, no attack in the video domain directly leverages feature maps to shift the clean-video feature space. We therefore propose FeatureFool, a stealthy, video-domain, zero-query black-box attack that utilizes information extracted from a DNN to alter the feature space of clean videos. Unlike query-based methods that rely on iterative interaction, FeatureFool performs a zero-query attack by directly exploiting DNN-extracted information. This efficient approach is unprecedented in the video domain. Experiments show that FeatureFool achieves an attack success rate above 70\% against traditional video classifiers without any queries. Benefiting from the transferability of the feature map, it can also craft harmful content and bypass Video-LLM recognition. Additionally, adversarial videos generated by FeatureFool exhibit high quality in terms of SSIM, PSNR, and Temporal-Inconsistency, making the attack barely perceptible. This paper may contain violent or explicit content.

  Autonomous driving world models are expected to work effectively across three core dimensions: state, action, and reward. Existing models, however, are typically restricted to limited state modalities, short video sequences, imprecise action control, and a lack of reward awareness. In this paper, we introduce OmniNWM, an omniscient panoramic navigation world model that addresses all three dimensions within a unified framework. For state, OmniNWM jointly generates panoramic videos of RGB, semantics, metric depth, and 3D occupancy. A flexible forcing strategy enables high-quality long-horizon auto-regressive generation. For action, we introduce a normalized panoramic Plucker ray-map representation that encodes input trajectories into pixel-level signals, enabling highly precise and generalizable control over panoramic video generation. Regarding reward, we move beyond learning reward functions with external image-based models: instead, we leverage the generated 3D occupancy to directly define rule-based dense rewards for driving compliance and safety. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OmniNWM achieves state-of-the-art performance in video generation, control accuracy, and long-horizon stability, while providing a reliable closed-loop evaluation framework through occupancy-grounded rewards.

  Personalized image generative models are highly proficient at synthesizing images from text or a single image, yet they lack explicit control for composing objects from specific parts of multiple source images without user specified masks or annotations. To address this, we introduce Chimera, a personalized image generation model that generates novel objects by combining specified parts from different source images according to textual instructions. To train our model, we first construct a dataset from a taxonomy built on 464 unique (part, subject) pairs, which we term semantic atoms. From this, we generate 37k prompts and synthesize the corresponding images with a high-fidelity text-to-image model. We train a custom diffusion prior model with part-conditional guidance, which steers the image-conditioning features to enforce both semantic identity and spatial layout. We also introduce an objective metric PartEval to assess the fidelity and compositional accuracy of generation pipelines. Human evaluations and our proposed metric show that Chimera outperforms other baselines by 14% in part alignment and compositional accuracy and 21% in visual quality.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent 3D feed-forward models, such as the Visual Geometry Grounded Transformer (VGGT), have shown strong capability in inferring 3D attributes of static scenes. However, since they are typically trained on static datasets, these models often struggle in real-world scenarios involving complex dynamic elements, such as moving humans or deformable objects like umbrellas. To address this limitation, we introduce PAGE-4D, a feedforward model that extends VGGT to dynamic scenes, enabling camera pose estimation, depth prediction, and point cloud reconstruction -- all without post-processing. A central challenge in multi-task 4D reconstruction is the inherent conflict between tasks: accurate camera pose estimation requires suppressing dynamic regions, while geometry reconstruction requires modeling them. To resolve this tension, we propose a dynamics-aware aggregator that disentangles static and dynamic information by predicting a dynamics-aware mask -- suppressing motion cues for pose estimation while amplifying them for geometry reconstruction. Extensive experiments show that PAGE-4D consistently outperforms the original VGGT in dynamic scenarios, achieving superior results in camera pose estimation, monocular and video depth estimation, and dense point map reconstruction.

  In recent years, large-scale generative models for visual content (\textit{e.g.,} images, videos, and 3D objects/scenes) have made remarkable progress. However, training large-scale video generation models remains particularly challenging and resource-intensive due to cross-modal text-video alignment, the long sequences involved, and the complex spatiotemporal dependencies. To address these challenges, we present a training framework that optimizes four pillars: (i) data processing, (ii) model architecture, (iii) training strategy, and (iv) infrastructure for large-scale video generation models. These optimizations delivered significant efficiency gains and performance improvements across all stages of data preprocessing, video compression, parameter scaling, curriculum-based pretraining, and alignment-focused post-training. Our resulting model, MUG-V 10B, matches recent state-of-the-art video generators overall and, on e-commerce-oriented video generation tasks, surpasses leading open-source baselines in human evaluations. More importantly, we open-source the complete stack, including model weights, Megatron-Core-based large-scale training code, and inference pipelines for video generation and enhancement. To our knowledge, this is the first public release of large-scale video generation training code that exploits Megatron-Core to achieve high training efficiency and near-linear multi-node scaling, details are available inthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We propose a rubric-guided, pseudo-labeled, and prompt-driven zero-shot video summarization framework that bridges large language models with structured semantic reasoning. A small subset of human annotations is converted into high-confidence pseudo labels and organized into dataset-adaptive rubrics defining clear evaluation dimensions such as thematic relevance, action detail, and narrative progression. During inference, boundary scenes, including the opening and closing segments, are scored independently based on their own descriptions, while intermediate scenes incorporate concise summaries of adjacent segments to assess narrative continuity and redundancy. This design enables the language model to balance local salience with global coherence without any parameter tuning. Across three benchmarks, the proposed method achieves stable and competitive results, with F1 scores of 57.58 on SumMe, 63.05 on TVSum, and 53.79 on QFVS, surpassing zero-shot baselines by +0.85, +0.84, and +0.37, respectively. These outcomes demonstrate that rubric-guided pseudo labeling combined with contextual prompting effectively stabilizes LLM-based scoring and establishes a general, interpretable, and training-free paradigm for both generic and query-focused video summarization.

  Semantic occupancy has emerged as a powerful representation in world models for its ability to capture rich spatial semantics. However, most existing occupancy world models rely on static and fixed embeddings or grids, which inherently limit the flexibility of perception. Moreover, their "in-place classification" over grids exhibits a potential misalignment with the dynamic and continuous nature of realthis http URLthis paper, we propose SparseWorld, a novel 4D occupancy world model that is flexible, adaptive, and efficient, powered by sparse and dynamic queries. We propose a Range-Adaptive Perception module, in which learnable queries are modulated by the ego vehicle states and enriched with temporal-spatial associations to enable extended-range perception. To effectively capture the dynamics of the scene, we design a State-Conditioned Forecasting module, which replaces classification-based forecasting with regression-guided formulation, precisely aligning the dynamic queries with the continuity of the 4D environment. In addition, We specifically devise a Temporal-Aware Self-Scheduling training strategy to enable smooth and efficient training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SparseWorld achieves state-of-the-art performance across perception, forecasting, and planning tasks. Comprehensive visualizations and ablation studies further validate the advantages of SparseWorld in terms of flexibility, adaptability, and efficiency. The code is available atthis https URL.

  Video generation models have achieved remarkable progress, particularly excelling in realistic scenarios; however, their performance degrades notably in imaginative scenarios. These prompts often involve rarely co-occurring concepts with long-distance semantic relationships, falling outside training distributions. Existing methods typically apply test-time scaling for improving video quality, but their fixed search spaces and static reward designs limit adaptability to imaginative scenarios. To fill this gap, we propose ImagerySearch, a prompt-guided adaptive test-time search strategy that dynamically adjusts both the inference search space and reward function according to semantic relationships in the prompt. This enables more coherent and visually plausible videos in challenging imaginative settings. To evaluate progress in this direction, we introduce LDT-Bench, the first dedicated benchmark for long-distance semantic prompts, consisting of 2,839 diverse concept pairs and an automated protocol for assessing creative generation capabilities. Extensive experiments show that ImagerySearch consistently outperforms strong video generation baselines and existing test-time scaling approaches on LDT-Bench, and achieves competitive improvements on VBench, demonstrating its effectiveness across diverse prompt types. We will release LDT-Bench and code to facilitate future research on imaginative video generation.

  Chest X-ray classification is vital yet resource-intensive, typically demanding extensive annotated data for accurate diagnosis. Foundation models mitigate this reliance, but how many labeled samples are required remains unclear. We systematically evaluate the use of power-law fits to predict the training size necessary for specific ROC-AUC thresholds. Testing multiple pathologies and foundation models, we find XrayCLIP and XraySigLIP achieve strong performance with significantly fewer labeled examples than a ResNet-50 baseline. Importantly, learning curve slopes from just 50 labeled cases accurately forecast final performance plateaus. Our results enable practitioners to minimize annotation costs by labeling only the essential samples for targeted performance.

  A comprehensive understanding of animal behavior ecology depends on scalable approaches to quantify and interpret complex, multidimensional behavioral patterns. Traditional field observations are often limited in scope, time-consuming, and labor-intensive, hindering the assessment of behavioral responses across landscapes. To address this, we present kabr-tools (Kenyan Animal Behavior Recognition Tools), an open-source package for automated multi-species behavioral monitoring. This framework integrates drone-based video with machine learning systems to extract behavioral, social, and spatial metrics from wildlife footage. Our pipeline leverages object detection, tracking, and behavioral classification systems to generate key metrics, including time budgets, behavioral transitions, social interactions, habitat associations, and group composition dynamics. Compared to ground-based methods, drone-based observations significantly improved behavioral granularity, reducing visibility loss by 15% and capturing more transitions with higher accuracy and continuity. We validate kabr-tools through three case studies, analyzing 969 behavioral sequences, surpassing the capacity of traditional methods for data capture and annotation. We found that, like Plains zebras, vigilance in Grevy's zebras decreases with herd size, but, unlike Plains zebras, habitat has a negligible impact. Plains and Grevy's zebras exhibit strong behavioral inertia, with rare transitions to alert behaviors and observed spatial segregation between Grevy's zebras, Plains zebras, and giraffes in mixed-species herds. By enabling automated behavioral monitoring at scale, kabr-tools offers a powerful tool for ecosystem-wide studies, advancing conservation, biodiversity research, and ecological monitoring.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this paper, we propose a weakly supervised semantic segmentation approach for food images which takes advantage of the zero-shot capabilities and promptability of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) along with the attention mechanisms of Vision Transformers (ViTs). Specifically, we use class activation maps (CAMs) from ViTs to generate prompts for SAM, resulting in masks suitable for food image segmentation. The ViT model, a Swin Transformer, is trained exclusively using image-level annotations, eliminating the need for pixel-level annotations during training. Additionally, to enhance the quality of the SAM-generated masks, we examine the use of image preprocessing techniques in combination with single-mask and multi-mask SAM generation strategies. The methodology is evaluated on the FoodSeg103 dataset, generating an average of 2.4 masks per image (excluding background), and achieving an mIoU of 0.54 for the multi-mask scenario. We envision the proposed approach as a tool to accelerate food image annotation tasks or as an integrated component in food and nutrition tracking applications.

  While editing directly from life, photographers have found it too difficult to see simultaneously both the blue and the sky. Photographer and curator, Szarkowski insightfully revealed one of the notable gaps between general and aesthetic visual understanding: while the former focuses on identifying the factual element in an image (sky), the latter transcends such object identification, viewing it instead as an aesthetic component--a pure color block (blue). Such fundamental distinctions between general (detection, localization, etc.) and aesthetic (color, lighting, composition, etc.) visual understanding present a significant challenge for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Although some recent works have made initial explorations, they are often limited to general and basic aesthetic commonsense. As a result, they frequently fall short in real-world scenarios (Fig. 1), which require extensive expertise--including photographic techniques, photo pre/post-processing knowledge, and more, to provide a detailed analysis and description. To fundamentally enhance the aesthetics understanding of MLLMs, we first introduce a novel dataset, PhotoCritique, derived from extensive discussions among professional photographers and enthusiasts, and characterized by the large scale, expertise, and diversity. Then, to better learn visual aesthetics from PhotoCritique, we furthur propose a novel model, PhotoEye, featuring a languageguided multi-view vision fusion mechanism to understand image aesthetics from multiple perspectives. Finally, we present a novel benchmark, PhotoBench, a comprehensive and professional benchmark for aesthetic visual understanding. On existing benchmarks and PhotoBench, our model demonstrates clear advantages over existing models.

  The modeling of complicated time-evolving physical dynamics from partial observations is a long-standing challenge. Particularly, observations can be sparsely distributed in a seemingly random or unstructured manner, making it difficult to capture highly nonlinear features in a variety of scientific and engineering problems. However, existing data-driven approaches are often constrained by fixed spatial and temporal discretization. While some researchers attempt to achieve spatio-temporal continuity by designing novel strategies, they either overly rely on traditional numerical methods or fail to truly overcome the limitations imposed by discretization. To address these, we propose CoPS, a purely data-driven methods, to effectively model continuous physics simulation from partial observations. Specifically, we employ multiplicative filter network to fuse and encode spatial information with the corresponding observations. Then we customize geometric grids and use message-passing mechanism to map features from original spatial domain to the customized grids. Subsequently, CoPS models continuous-time dynamics by designing multi-scale graph ODEs, while introducing a Markov-based neural auto-correction module to assist and constrain the continuous extrapolations. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that CoPS advances the state-of-the-art methods in space-time continuous modeling across various scenarios.

  Universal domain adaptation (UniDA) transfers knowledge from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain, where label spaces may differ and the target domain may contain private classes. Previous UniDA methods primarily focused on visual space alignment but often struggled with visual ambiguities due to content differences, which limited their robustness and generalizability. To overcome this, we introduce a novel approach that leverages the strong \textit{zero-shot capabilities} of recent vision-language foundation models (VLMs) like CLIP, concentrating solely on label space alignment to enhance adaptation stability. CLIP can generate task-specific classifiers based only on label names. However, adapting CLIP to UniDA is challenging because the label space is not fully known in advance. In this study, we first utilize generative vision-language models to identify unknown categories in the target domain. Noise and semantic ambiguities in the discovered labels -- such as those similar to source labels (e.g., synonyms, hypernyms, hyponyms) -- complicate label alignment. To address this, we propose a training-free label-space alignment method for UniDA (\ours). Our method aligns label spaces instead of visual spaces by filtering and refining noisy labels between the domains. We then construct a \textit{universal classifier} that integrates both shared knowledge and target-private class information, thereby improving generalizability under domain shifts. The results reveal that the proposed method considerably outperforms existing UniDA techniques across key DomainBed benchmarks, delivering an average improvement of \textcolor{blue}{+7.9\%}in H-score and \textcolor{blue}{+6.1\%} in H$^3$-score. Furthermore, incorporating self-training further enhances performance and achieves an additional (\textcolor{blue}{+1.6\%}) increment in both H- and H$^3$-scores.

  Test-time adaptation (TTA) enhances the zero-shot robustness under distribution shifts by leveraging unlabeled test data during inference. Despite notable advances, several challenges still limit its broader applicability. First, most methods rely on backpropagation or iterative optimization, which limits scalability and hinders real-time deployment. Second, they lack explicit modeling of class-conditional feature distributions. This modeling is crucial for producing reliable decision boundaries and calibrated predictions, but it remains underexplored due to the lack of both source data and supervision at test time. In this paper, we propose ADAPT, an Advanced Distribution-Aware and backPropagation-free Test-time adaptation method. We reframe TTA as a Gaussian probabilistic inference task by modeling class-conditional likelihoods using gradually updated class means and a shared covariance matrix. This enables closed-form, training-free inference. To correct potential likelihood bias, we introduce lightweight regularization guided by CLIP priors and a historical knowledge bank. ADAPT requires no source data, no gradient updates, and no full access to target data, supporting both online and transductive settings. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance under a wide range of distribution shifts with superior scalability and robustness.

  Recent advancements in LiDAR-based 3D object detection have significantly accelerated progress toward the realization of fully autonomous driving in real-world environments. Despite achieving high detection performance, most of the approaches still rely on a VGG-based or ResNet-based backbone for feature exploration, which increases the model complexity. Lightweight backbone design is well-explored for 2D object detection, but research on 3D object detection still remains limited. In this work, we introduce Dense Backbone, a lightweight backbone that combines the benefits of high processing speed, lightweight architecture, and robust detection accuracy. We adapt multiple SoTA 3d object detectors, such as PillarNet, with our backbone and show that with our backbone, these models retain most of their detection capability at a significantly reduced computational cost. To our knowledge, this is the first dense-layer-based backbone tailored specifically for 3D object detection from point cloud data. DensePillarNet, our adaptation of PillarNet, achieves a 29% reduction in model parameters and a 28% reduction in latency with just a 2% drop in detection accuracy on the nuScenes test set. Furthermore, Dense Backbone's plug-and-play design allows straightforward integration into existing architectures, requiring no modifications to other network components.

  Depth estimation is a fundamental task in 3D computer vision, crucial for applications such as 3D reconstruction, free-viewpoint rendering, robotics, autonomous driving, and AR/VR technologies. Traditional methods relying on hardware sensors like LiDAR are often limited by high costs, low resolution, and environmental sensitivity, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios. Recent advances in vision-based methods offer a promising alternative, yet they face challenges in generalization and stability due to either the low-capacity model architectures or the reliance on domain-specific and small-scale datasets. The emergence of scaling laws and foundation models in other domains has inspired the development of "depth foundation models": deep neural networks trained on large datasets with strong zero-shot generalization capabilities. This paper surveys the evolution of deep learning architectures and paradigms for depth estimation across the monocular, stereo, multi-view, and monocular video settings. We explore the potential of these models to address existing challenges and provide a comprehensive overview of large-scale datasets that can facilitate their development. By identifying key architectures and training strategies, we aim to highlight the path towards robust depth foundation models, offering insights into their future research and applications.

  In spite of the remarkable potential of Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) in image generation, the desired properties and optimal design of the autoencoders have been underexplored. In this work, we analyze the role of autoencoders in LDMs and identify three key properties: latent smoothness, perceptual compression quality, and reconstruction quality. We demonstrate that existing autoencoders fail to simultaneously satisfy all three properties, and propose Variational Masked AutoEncoders (VMAEs), taking advantage of the hierarchical features maintained by Masked AutoEncoders. We integrate VMAEs into the LDM framework, introducing Latent Diffusion Models with Masked AutoEncoders (LDMAEs). Our code is available atthis https URL.

  We conduct an extensive study on the state of calibration under real-world dataset shift for image classification. Our work provides important insights on the choice of post-hoc and in-training calibration techniques, and yields practical guidelines for all practitioners interested in robust calibration under shift. We compare various post-hoc calibration methods, and their interactions with common in-training calibration strategies (e.g., label smoothing), across a wide range of natural shifts, on eight different classification tasks across several imaging domains. We find that: (i) simultaneously applying entropy regularisation and label smoothing yield the best calibrated raw probabilities under dataset shift, (ii) post-hoc calibrators exposed to a small amount of semantic out-of-distribution data (unrelated to the task) are most robust under shift, (iii) recent calibration methods specifically aimed at increasing calibration under shifts do not necessarily offer significant improvements over simpler post-hoc calibration methods, (iv) improving calibration under shifts often comes at the cost of worsening in-distribution calibration. Importantly, these findings hold for randomly initialised classifiers, as well as for those finetuned from foundation models, the latter being consistently better calibrated compared to models trained from scratch. Finally, we conduct an in-depth analysis of ensembling effects, finding that (i) applying calibration prior to ensembling (instead of after) is more effective for calibration under shifts, (ii) for ensembles, OOD exposure deteriorates the ID-shifted calibration trade-off, (iii) ensembling remains one of the most effective methods to improve calibration robustness and, combined with finetuning from foundation models, yields best calibration results overall.

  _Jonas Klotz, Tom Burgert, Beg√ºm Demir_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The development of explainable artificial intelligence (xAI) methods for scene classification problems has attracted great attention in remote sensing (RS). Most xAI methods and the related evaluation metrics in RS are initially developed for natural images considered in computer vision (CV), and their direct usage in RS may not be suitable. To address this issue, in this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of explanation methods and metrics in the context of RS image scene classification. In detail, we methodologically and experimentally analyze ten explanation metrics spanning five categories (faithfulness, robustness, localization, complexity, randomization), applied to five established feature attribution methods (Occlusion, LIME, GradCAM, LRP, and DeepLIFT) across three RS datasets. Our methodological analysis identifies key limitations in both explanation methods and metrics. The performance of perturbation-based methods, such as Occlusion and LIME, heavily depends on perturbation baselines and spatial characteristics of RS scenes. Gradient-based approaches like GradCAM struggle when multiple labels are present in the same image, while some relevance propagation methods (LRP) can distribute relevance disproportionately relative to the spatial extent of classes. Analogously, we find limitations in evaluation metrics. Faithfulness metrics share the same problems as perturbation-based methods. Localization metrics and complexity metrics are unreliable for classes with a large spatial extent. In contrast, robustness metrics and randomization metrics consistently exhibit greater stability. Our experimental results support these methodological findings. Based on our analysis, we provide guidelines for selecting explanation methods, metrics, and hyperparameters in the context of RS image scene classification.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  LiDAR-based world models offer more structured and geometry-aware representations than their image-based counterparts. However, existing LiDAR world models are narrowly trained; each model excels only in the domain for which it was built. Can we develop LiDAR world models that exhibit strong transferability across multiple domains? We conduct the first systematic domain transfer study across three demanding scenarios: (i) outdoor to indoor generalization, (ii) sparse-beam & dense-beam adaptation, and (iii) non-semantic to semantic transfer. Given different amounts of fine-tuning data, our experiments show that a single pre-trained model can achieve up to 11% absolute improvement (83% relative) over training from scratch and outperforms training from scratch in 30/36 of our comparisons. This transferability of dynamic learning significantly reduces the reliance on manually annotated data for semantic occupancy forecasting: our method exceed the previous semantic occupancy forecasting models with only 5% of the labeled training data required by prior models. We also observed inefficiencies of current LiDAR world models, mainly through their under-compression of LiDAR data and inefficient training objectives. To address this, we propose a latent conditional flow matching (CFM)-based frameworks that achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction accuracy using only half the training data and a compression ratio 6 times higher than that of prior methods. Our model achieves SOTA performance on future-trajectory-conditioned semantic occupancy forecasting while being 23x more computationally efficient (a 28x FPS speedup); and achieves SOTA performance on semantic occupancy forecasting while being 2x more computationally efficient (a 1.1x FPS speedup).

  Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have begun to demonstrate robust reasoning capabilities on general tasks, yet their application in the medical domain remains in its early stages. Constructing chain-of-thought (CoT) training data is essential for bolstering the reasoning abilities of medical MLLMs. However, existing approaches exhibit a deficiency in offering a comprehensive framework for searching and evaluating effective reasoning paths towards critical diagnosis. To address this challenge, we propose Mentor-Intern Collaborative Search (MICS), a novel reasoning-path searching scheme to generate rigorous and effective medical CoT data. MICS first leverages mentor models to initialize the reasoning, one step at a time, then prompts each intern model to continue the thinking along those initiated paths, and finally selects the optimal reasoning path according to the overall reasoning performance of multiple intern models. The reasoning performance is determined by an MICS-Score, which assesses the quality of generated reasoning paths. Eventually, we construct MMRP, a multi-task medical reasoning dataset with ranked difficulty, and Chiron-o1, a new medical MLLM devised via a curriculum learning strategy, with robust visual question-answering and generalizable reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Chiron-o1, trained on our CoT dataset constructed using MICS, achieves state-of-the-art performance across a list of medical visual question answering and reasoning benchmarks.

  Multimodal models have demonstrated powerful capabilities in complex tasks requiring multimodal alignment, including zero-shot classification and cross-modal retrieval. However, existing models typically rely on millions of paired multimodal samples, which are prohibitively expensive or infeasible to obtain in many domains. In this work, we explore the feasibility of building multimodal models with limited amount of paired data by aligning pretrained unimodal foundation models. We show that high-quality alignment is possible with as few as tens of thousands of paired samples$\unicode{x2013}$less than $1\%$ of the data typically used in the field. To achieve this, we introduce STRUCTURE, an effective regularization technique that preserves the neighborhood geometry of the latent space of unimodal encoders. Additionally, we show that aligning last layers is often suboptimal and demonstrate the benefits of aligning the layers with the highest representational similarity across modalities. These two components can be readily incorporated into existing alignment methods, yielding substantial gains across 24 zero-shot image classification and retrieval benchmarks, with average relative improvement of $51.6\%$ in classification and $91.8\%$ in retrieval tasks. Our results highlight the effectiveness and broad applicability of our framework for limited-sample multimodal learning and offer a promising path forward for resource-constrained domains.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  It is a challenging problem to reproduce rich spatial details while maintaining temporal consistency in real-world video super-resolution (Real-VSR), especially when we leverage pre-trained generative models such as stable diffusion (SD) for realistic details synthesis. Existing SD-based Real-VSR methods often compromise spatial details for temporal coherence, resulting in suboptimal visual quality. We argue that the key lies in how to effectively extract the degradation-robust temporal consistency priors from the low-quality (LQ) input video and enhance the video details while maintaining the extracted consistency priors. To achieve this, we propose a Dual LoRA Learning (DLoRAL) paradigm to train an effective SD-based one-step diffusion model, achieving realistic frame details and temporal consistency simultaneously. Specifically, we introduce a Cross-Frame Retrieval (CFR) module to aggregate complementary information across frames, and train a Consistency-LoRA (C-LoRA) to learn robust temporal representations from degraded inputs. After consistency learning, we fix the CFR and C-LoRA modules and train a Detail-LoRA (D-LoRA) to enhance spatial details while aligning with the temporal space defined by C-LoRA to keep temporal coherence. The two phases alternate iteratively for optimization, collaboratively delivering consistent and detail-rich outputs. During inference, the two LoRA branches are merged into the SD model, allowing efficient and high-quality video restoration in a single diffusion step. Experiments show that DLoRAL achieves strong performance in both accuracy and speed. Code and models are available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Paucity of medical data severely limits the generalizability of diagnostic ML models, as the full spectrum of disease variability can not be represented by a small clinical dataset. To address this, diffusion models (DMs) have been considered as a promising avenue for synthetic image generation and augmentation. However, they frequently produce medically inaccurate images, deteriorating the model performance. Expert domain knowledge is critical for synthesizing images that correctly encode clinical information, especially when data is scarce and quality outweighs quantity. Existing approaches for incorporating human feedback, such as reinforcement learning (RL) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), rely on robust reward functions or demand labor-intensive expert evaluations. Recent progress in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) reveals their strong visual reasoning capabilities, making them adept candidates as evaluators. In this work, we propose a novel framework, coined MAGIC (Medically Accurate Generation of Images through AI-Expert Collaboration), that synthesizes clinically accurate skin disease images for data augmentation. Our method creatively translates expert-defined criteria into actionable feedback for image synthesis of DMs, significantly improving clinical accuracy while reducing the direct human workload. Experiments demonstrate that our method greatly improves the clinical quality of synthesized skin disease images, with outputs aligning with dermatologist assessments. Additionally, augmenting training data with these synthesized images improves diagnostic accuracy by +9.02% on a challenging 20-condition skin disease classification task, and by +13.89% in the few-shot setting.

  _Bimal Kumar Ray_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Many studies have been conducted to solve the problem of approximating a digital boundary by piece straight-line segments for the further processing required in computer vision applications. The authors of these studies compared their schemes to determine the best one. The initial measure used to assess the goodness of fit of a polygonal approximation was the figure of merit. Later,it was noted that this measure was not an appropriate metric for a valid reason which is why Rosin-through mathematical analysis-introduced a measure called merit. However,this measure involves an optimal scheme of polygonal approximation,so it is time-consuming to compute it to assess the goodness of fit of an approximation. This led many researchers to use a weighted figure of merit as a substitute for Rosin's measure to compare sub optimal schemes. An attempt is made in this communication to investigate whether the two measures-weighted figure of merit and Rosin's measure-are related so that one can be used instead of the other, and toward this end, theoretical analysis, experimental investigation and statistical analysis are carried out. The mathematical formulas for the weighted figure of merit and Rosin's measure are analyzed, and through proof of theorems,it is found that the two measures are theoretically independent of each other. The graphical analysis of experiments carried out using a public dataset supports the results of the theoretical analysis. The statistical analysis via Pearson's correlation coefficient and non-linear correlation measure also revealed that the two measures are uncorrelated. This analysis leads one to conclude that if a suboptimal scheme is found to be better (worse) than some other suboptimal scheme,as indicated by Rosin's measure,then the same conclusion cannot be drawn using a weighted figure of merit,so one cannot use a weighted figure of merit instead of Rosin's measure.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Previous research has investigated the application of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in understanding 3D scenes by interpreting them as videos. These approaches generally depend on comprehensive 3D data inputs, such as point clouds or reconstructed Bird's-Eye View (BEV) maps. In our research, we advance this field by enhancing the capability of MLLMs to understand and reason in 3D spaces directly from video data, without the need for additional 3D input. We propose a novel and efficient method called the Video-3D Geometry Large Language Model (VG LLM). Our approach utilizes a 3D visual geometry encoder to extract 3D prior information from video sequences. This information is then integrated with visual tokens and input into the MLLM. Extensive experiments have shown that our method has achieved substantial improvements in various tasks related to 3D scene understanding and spatial reasoning, all directly learned from video sources. Impressively, our 4B model, which does not rely on explicit 3D data inputs, achieves competitive results compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, and even surpasses the Gemini-1.5-Pro in the VSI-Bench evaluations.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Handwritten Mathematical Expression Recognition (HMER) remains a persistent challenge in Optical Character Recognition (OCR) due to the inherent freedom of symbol layouts and variability in handwriting styles. Prior methods have faced performance bottlenecks by proposing isolated architectural modifications, making them difficult to integrate coherently into a unified framework. Meanwhile, recent advances in pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong cross-task generalization, offering a promising foundation for developing unified solutions. In this paper, we introduce Uni-MuMER, which fully fine-tunes a VLM for the HMER task without modifying its architecture, effectively injecting domain-specific knowledge into a generalist framework. Our method integrates three data-driven tasks: Tree-Aware Chain-of-Thought (Tree-CoT) for structured spatial reasoning, Error-Driven Learning (EDL) for reducing confusion among visually similar characters, and Symbol Counting (SC) for improving recognition consistency in long expressions. Experiments on the CROHME and HME100K datasets show that Uni-MuMER achieves super state-of-the-art performance, outperforming the best lightweight specialized model SSAN by 16.31\% and the top-performing VLM Gemini2.5-flash by 24.42\% under zero-shot setting.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Occupancy prediction aims to estimate the 3D spatial distribution of occupied regions along with their corresponding semantic labels. Existing vision-based methods perform well on daytime benchmarks but struggle in nighttime scenarios due to limited visibility and challenging lighting conditions. To address these challenges, we propose LIAR, a novel framework that learns illumination-affined representations. LIAR first introduces Selective Low-light Image Enhancement (SLLIE), which leverages the illumination priors from daytime scenes to adaptively determine whether a nighttime image is genuinely dark or sufficiently well-lit, enabling more targeted global enhancement. Building on the illumination maps generated by SLLIE, LIAR further incorporates two illumination-aware components: 2D Illumination-guided Sampling (2D-IGS) and 3D Illumination-driven Projection (3D-IDP), to respectively tackle local underexposure and overexposure. Specifically, 2D-IGS modulates feature sampling positions according to illumination maps, assigning larger offsets to darker regions and smaller ones to brighter regions, thereby alleviating feature degradation in underexposed areas. Subsequently,3D-IDP enhances semantic understanding in overexposed regions by constructing illumination intensity fields and supplying refined residual queries to the BEV context refinement process. Extensive experiments on both real and synthetic datasets demonstrate the superior performance of LIAR under challenging nighttime scenarios.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Spiking Neural Networks promise brain-inspired and energy-efficient computation by transmitting information through binary (0/1) spikes. Yet, their performance still lags behind that of artificial neural networks, often assumed to result from information loss caused by sparse and binary activations. In this work, we challenge this long-standing assumption and reveal a previously overlooked frequency bias: spiking neurons inherently suppress high-frequency components and preferentially propagate low-frequency information. This frequency-domain imbalance, we argue, is the root cause of degraded feature representation in SNNs. Empirically, on Spiking Transformers, adopting Avg-Pooling (low-pass) for token mixing lowers performance to 76.73% on Cifar-100, whereas replacing it with Max-Pool (high-pass) pushes the top-1 accuracy to 79.12%. Accordingly, we introduce Max-Former that restores high-frequency signals through two frequency-enhancing operators: (1) extra Max-Pool in patch embedding, and (2) Depth-Wise Convolution in place of self-attention. Notably, Max-Former attains 82.39% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet using only 63.99M parameters, surpassing Spikformer (74.81%, 66.34M) by +7.58%. Extending our insight beyond transformers, our Max-ResNet-18 achieves state-of-the-art performance on convolution-based benchmarks: 97.17% on CIFAR-10 and 83.06\% on CIFAR-100. We hope this simple yet effective solution inspires future research to explore the distinctive nature of spiking neural networks. Code is available:this https URL.

  3D visual illusion is a perceptual phenomenon where a two-dimensional plane is manipulated to simulate three-dimensional spatial relationships, making a flat artwork or object look three-dimensional in the human visual system. In this paper, we reveal that the machine visual system is also seriously fooled by 3D visual illusions, including monocular and binocular depth estimation. In order to explore and analyze the impact of 3D visual illusion on depth estimation, we collect a large dataset containing almost 3k scenes and 200k images to train and evaluate SOTA monocular and binocular depth estimation methods. We also propose a 3D visual illusion depth estimation framework that uses common sense from the vision language model to adaptively fuse depth from binocular disparity and monocular depth. Experiments show that SOTA monocular, binocular, and multi-view depth estimation approaches are all fooled by various 3D visual illusions, while our method achieves SOTA performance.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this paper we tackle a fundamental question: "Can we train latent diffusion models together with the variational auto-encoder (VAE) tokenizer in an end-to-end manner?" Traditional deep-learning wisdom dictates that end-to-end training is often preferable when possible. However, for latent diffusion transformers, it is observed that end-to-end training both VAE and diffusion-model using standard diffusion-loss is ineffective, even causing a degradation in final performance. We show that while diffusion loss is ineffective, end-to-end training can be unlocked through the representation-alignment (REPA) loss -- allowing both VAE and diffusion model to be jointly tuned during the training process. Despite its simplicity, the proposed training recipe (REPA-E) shows remarkable performance; speeding up diffusion model training by over 17x and 45x over REPA and vanilla training recipes, respectively. Interestingly, we observe that end-to-end tuning with REPA-E also improves the VAE itself; leading to improved latent space structure and downstream generation performance. In terms of final performance, our approach sets a new state-of-the-art; achieving FID of 1.12 and 1.69 with and without classifier-free guidance on ImageNet 256 x 256.

  Real-time wildlife detection in drone imagery supports critical ecological and conservation monitoring. However, standard detection models like YOLO often fail to generalize across locations and struggle with rare species, limiting their use in automated drone deployments. We present MMLA, a novel multi-environment, multi-species, low-altitude drone dataset collected across three sites (Ol Pejeta Conservancy and Mpala Research Centre in Kenya, and The Wilds in Ohio), featuring six species (zebras, giraffes, onagers, and African wild dogs). The dataset contains 811K annotations from 37 high-resolution videos. Baseline YOLO models show performance disparities across locations while fine-tuning YOLOv11m on MMLA improves mAP50 to 82%, a 52-point gain over baseline. Our results underscore the need for diverse training data to enable robust animal detection in autonomous drone systems.

  We introduce the task of grounded article generation with the goal of creating a Wikipedia-style article from multiple diverse videos about real-world events -- from natural disasters to political elections -- where all the information in the article is supported by video evidence. Videos are intuitive sources for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), but most contemporary RAG workflows focus heavily on text while existing methods for video-based summarization focus on low-level scene understanding rather than high-level event semantics. To close this gap, we introduce WikiVideo, a benchmark consisting of expert-written articles and densely annotated videos that provide evidence for articles' claims, facilitating the integration of video into RAG pipelines and enabling the creation of in-depth content that is grounded in multimodal sources. We further propose Collaborative Article Generation (CAG), a novel interactive method for article creation from multiple videos. CAG leverages an iterative interaction between an r1-style reasoning model and a VideoLLM to draw higher-level inferences about the target event than is possible with VideoLLMs alone, which fixate on low-level visual features. We benchmark state-of-the-art VideoLLMs and CAG in both oracle retrieval and RAG settings and find that CAG consistently outperforms alternative methods, while suggesting intriguing avenues for future work.

  Inspired by DeepSeek-R1's success in eliciting reasoning abilities through rule-based reinforcement learning (RL), we introduce Video-R1 as the first attempt to systematically explore the R1 paradigm for incentivizing video reasoning within multimodal large language models (MLLMs). However, directly applying RL training with the GRPO algorithm to video reasoning presents two primary challenges: (i) a lack of temporal modeling for video reasoning, and (ii) the scarcity of high-quality video-reasoning data. To address these issues, we first propose the T-GRPO algorithm, which encourages models to utilize temporal information in videos for reasoning. Additionally, instead of relying solely on video data, we incorporate high-quality image-reasoning data into the training process. We have constructed two datasets: Video-R1-CoT-165k for SFT cold start and Video-R1-260k for RL training, both comprising image and video data. Experimental results demonstrate that Video-R1 achieves significant improvements on video reasoning benchmarks such as VideoMMMU and VSI-Bench, as well as on general video benchmarks including MVBench and TempCompass, etc. Notably, Video-R1-7B attains a 37.1% accuracy on video spatial reasoning benchmark VSI-bench, surpassing the commercial proprietary model GPT-4o.

  Open-Vocabulary object detectors can generalize to an unrestricted set of categories through simple textual prompting. However, adapting these models to rare classes or reinforcing their abilities on multiple specialized domains remains essential. While recent methods rely on monolithic adaptation strategies with a single set of weights, we embrace modular deep learning. We introduce DitHub, a framework designed to build and maintain a library of efficient adaptation modules. Inspired by Version Control Systems, DitHub manages expert modules as branches that can be fetched and merged as needed. This modular approach allows us to conduct an in-depth exploration of the compositional properties of adaptation modules, marking the first such study in Object Detection. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the ODinW-13 benchmark and ODinW-O, a newly introduced benchmark designed to assess class reappearance.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Unified generative models have shown remarkable performance in text and image generation. For image synthesis tasks, they adopt straightforward text-to-image (T2I) generation. However, direct T2I generation limits the models in handling complex compositional instructions, which frequently occur in real-world scenarios. Although this issue is vital, existing works mainly focus on improving the basic image generation capability of the models. While such improvements help to some extent, they still fail to adequately resolve the problem. Inspired by Chain of Thought (CoT) solving complex problems step by step, this work aims to introduce CoT into unified generative models to address the challenges of complex image generation that direct T2I generation cannot effectively solve, thereby endowing models with enhanced image generation ability. To achieve this, we first propose Functionality-oriented eXperts (FoXperts), an expert-parallel architecture in our model FoX, which assigns experts by function. FoXperts disentangles potential conflicts in mainstream modality-oriented designs and provides a solid foundation for CoT. When introducing CoT, the first question is how to design it for complex image generation. To this end, we emulate a human-like artistic workflow -- planning, acting, reflection, and correction -- and propose the Multimodal Chain of Thought (MCoT) approach, as the data involves both text and image. To address the subsequent challenge -- designing an effective MCoT training paradigm -- we develop a multi-task joint training scheme that equips the model with all capabilities required for each MCoT step in a disentangled manner. This paradigm avoids the difficulty of collecting consistent multi-step data tuples. Extensive experiments show that FoX consistently outperforms existing unified models on various T2I benchmarks, delivering notable improvements in complex image generation.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multimodal learning (MML) is significantly constrained by modality imbalance, leading to suboptimal performance in practice. While existing approaches primarily focus on balancing the learning of different modalities to address this issue, they fundamentally overlook the inherent disproportion in model classification ability, which serves as the primary cause of this phenomenon. In this paper, we propose a novel multimodal learning approach to dynamically balance the classification ability of weak and strong modalities by incorporating the principle of boosting. Concretely, we first propose a sustained boosting algorithm in multimodal learning by simultaneously optimizing the classification and residual errors. Subsequently, we introduce an adaptive classifier assignment strategy to dynamically facilitate the classification performance of the weak modality. Furthermore, we theoretically analyze the convergence property of the cross-modal gap function, ensuring the effectiveness of the proposed boosting scheme. To this end, the classification ability of strong and weak modalities is expected to be balanced, thereby mitigating the imbalance issue. Empirical experiments on widely used datasets reveal the superiority of our method through comparison with various state-of-the-art (SOTA) multimodal learning baselines.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present FLARE, a feed-forward model designed to infer high-quality camera poses and 3D geometry from uncalibrated sparse-view images (i.e., as few as 2-8 inputs), which is a challenging yet practical setting in real-world applications. Our solution features a cascaded learning paradigm with camera pose serving as the critical bridge, recognizing its essential role in mapping 3D structures onto 2D image planes. Concretely, FLARE starts with camera pose estimation, whose results condition the subsequent learning of geometric structure and appearance, optimized through the objectives of geometry reconstruction and novel-view synthesis. Utilizing large-scale public datasets for training, our method delivers state-of-the-art performance in the tasks of pose estimation, geometry reconstruction, and novel view synthesis, while maintaining the inference efficiency (i.e., less than 0.5 seconds).

  Perceptual constancy is the ability to maintain stable perceptions of objects despite changes in sensory input, such as variations in distance, angle, or lighting. This ability is crucial for visual understanding in a dynamic world. Here, we explored such ability in current Vision Language Models (VLMs). In this study, we evaluated 155 VLMs using 236 experiments across three domains: color, size, and shape constancy. The experiments included single-image and video adaptations of classic cognitive tasks, along with novel tasks in in-the-wild conditions. We found significant variability in VLM performance across these domains, with model performance in shape constancy clearly dissociated from that of color and size constancy.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent agentic language models increasingly need to interact with real-world environments that contain tightly intertwined visual and textual information, often through raw camera pixels rather than separately processed images and tokenized text. This shift highlights the need for a unified perception paradigm. To investigate this idea, we explore Perceive Everything as Pixels (PEAP) and introduce PixelWorld, a benchmark that renders natural-language, tabular, mathematical, and diagrammatic inputs into a shared pixel space. Experiments across multiple benchmarks show that PEAP achieves comparable performance to token-based approaches on semantic understanding tasks, suggesting that vision transformers can partially capture global textual semantics without explicit tokenization. In contrast, reasoning-intensive tasks such as mathematics and code show notable performance degradation, although Chain-of-Thought prompting helps mitigate this gap by compensating for missing symbolic structure. We further find that when visual and textual information are closely integrated, representing everything as pixels simplifies preprocessing and avoids cross-modal misalignment. PixelWorld thus provides a systematic and practical framework for evaluating unified vision--language models and facilitates further exploration of pixel-based multimodal learning.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The recent surge in high-quality visual instruction tuning samples from closed-source vision-language models (VLMs) such as GPT-4V has accelerated the release of open-source VLMs across various model sizes. However, scaling VLMs to improve performance using larger models brings significant computational challenges, especially for deployment on resource-constrained devices like mobile platforms and robots. To address this, we propose VLsI: Verbalized Layers-to-Interactions, a new VLM family in 2B and 7B model sizes, which prioritizes efficiency without compromising accuracy. VLsI leverages a unique, layer-wise distillation process, introducing intermediate "verbalizers" that map features from each layer to natural language space, allowing smaller VLMs to flexibly align with the reasoning processes of larger VLMs. This approach mitigates the training instability often encountered in output imitation and goes beyond typical final-layer tuning by aligning the small VLMs' layer-wise progression with that of the large ones. We validate VLsI across ten challenging vision-language benchmarks, achieving notable performance gains (11.0% for 2B and 17.4% for 7B) over GPT-4V without the need for model scaling, merging, or architectural changes.

  _Shengjing Tian, Xiantong Zhao, Yuhao Bian, Yinan Han, Bin Liu_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this study, we delve into the robustness of neural network-based LiDAR point cloud tracking models under adversarial attacks, a critical aspect often overlooked in favor of performance enhancement. These models, despite incorporating advanced architectures like Transformer or Bird's Eye View (BEV), tend to neglect robustness in the face of challenges such as adversarial attacks, domain shifts, or data corruption. We instead focus on the robustness of the tracking models under the threat of adversarial attacks. We begin by establishing a unified framework for conducting adversarial attacks within the context of 3D object tracking, which allows us to thoroughly investigate both white-box and black-box attack strategies. For white-box attacks, we tailor specific loss functions to accommodate various tracking paradigms and extend existing methods such as FGSM, C\&W, and PGD to the point cloud domain. In addressing black-box attack scenarios, we introduce a novel transfer-based approach, the Target-aware Perturbation Generation (TAPG) algorithm, with the dual objectives of achieving high attack performance and maintaining low perceptibility. This method employs a heuristic strategy to enforce sparse attack constraints and utilizes random sub-vector factorization to bolster transferability. Our experimental findings reveal a significant vulnerability in advanced tracking methods when subjected to both black-box and white-box attacks, underscoring the necessity for incorporating robustness against adversarial attacks into the design of LiDAR point cloud tracking models. Notably, compared to existing methods, the TAPG also strikes an optimal balance between the effectiveness of the attack and the concealment of the perturbations.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We propose ComDrive: the first comfort-oriented end-to-end autonomous driving system to generate temporally consistent and comfortable trajectories. Recent studies have demonstrated that imitation learning-based planners and learning-based trajectory scorers can effectively generate and select safety trajectories that closely mimic expert demonstrations. However, such trajectory planners and scorers face the challenge of generating temporally inconsistent and uncomfortable trajectories. To address these issues, ComDrive first extracts 3D spatial representations through sparse perception, which then serves as conditional inputs. These inputs are used by a Conditional Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM)-based motion planner to generate temporally consistent multi-modal trajectories. A dual-stream adaptive trajectory scorer subsequently selects the most comfortable trajectory from these candidates to control the vehicle. Experiments demonstrate that ComDrive achieves state-of-the-art performance in both comfort and safety, outperforming UniAD by 17% in driving comfort and reducing collision rates by 25% compared to SparseDrive.

  Understanding the hidden mechanisms behind human's visual perception is a fundamental question in neuroscience. To that end, investigating into the neural responses of human mind activities, such as functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), has been a significant research vehicle. However, analyzing fMRI signals is challenging, costly, daunting, and demanding for professional training. Despite remarkable progress in fMRI analysis, existing approaches are limited to generating 2D images and far away from being biologically meaningful and practically useful. Under this insight, we propose to generate visually plausible and functionally more comprehensive 3D outputs decoded from brain signals, enabling more sophisticated modeling of fMRI data. Conceptually, we reformulate this task as a {\em fMRI conditioned 3D object generation} problem. We design a novel 3D object representation learning method, Brain3D, that takes as input the fMRI data of a subject who was presented with a 2D image, and yields as output the corresponding 3D object images. The key capabilities of this model include tackling the noises with high-level semantic signals and a two-stage architecture design for progressive high-level information integration. Extensive experiments validate the superior capability of our model over previous state-of-the-art 3D object generation methods. Importantly, we show that our model captures the distinct functionalities of each region of human vision system as well as their intricate interplay relationships, aligning remarkably with the established discoveries in neuroscience. Further, preliminary evaluations indicate that Brain3D can successfully identify the disordered brain regions in simulated scenarios, such as V1, V2, V3, V4, and the medial temporal lobe (MTL) within the human visual system.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  One-class classification (OCC) aims to train a classifier solely on target data and attracts increasing attention due to its applicability in practice. Despite OCC has obtained many advances, it still lacks the effective OCC loss functions for deep learning. In this paper, a novel logarithmic barrier function based OCC loss (LBL) that assigns large gradients to margin samples and thus derives more compact hypersphere is first proposed by approximating the OCC objective smoothly. But the optimization of LBL may be instability especially when samples lie on the boundary leading to the infinity value. To address this issue, a smoother LBLSig loss is further proposed by utilizing a unilateral relaxation Sigmoid function. Experiments on different networks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed LBL and LBLSig. The source code can be found atthis https URL.

  Planning with world models offers a powerful paradigm for robotic control. Conventional approaches train a model to predict future frames conditioned on current frames and actions, which can then be used for planning. However, the objective of predicting future pixels is often at odds with the actual planning objective; strong pixel reconstruction does not always correlate with good planning decisions. This paper posits that instead of reconstructing future frames as pixels, world models only need to predict task-relevant semantic information about the future. For such prediction the paper poses world modeling as a visual question answering problem about semantic information in future frames. This perspective allows world modeling to be approached with the same tools underlying vision language models. Thus vision language models can be trained as "semantic" world models through a supervised finetuning process on image-action-text data, enabling planning for decision-making while inheriting many of the generalization and robustness properties from the pretrained vision-language models. The paper demonstrates how such a semantic world model can be used for policy improvement on open-ended robotics tasks, leading to significant generalization improvements over typical paradigms of reconstruction-based action-conditional world modeling.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The rapid escalation of computational requirements for training large-scale language models has reinforced structural asymmetries between high-capacity jurisdictions and countries in the Global South. This paper examines the technical and fiscal feasibility of sovereign-scale language model training in Brazil and Mexico under conditions of constrained hardware access, energy availability, and fiscal ceilings. Using a dual-axis design that varies accelerator generation (NVIDIA H100 vs. A100) and training duration (90 vs. 150 days), we estimate compute demand, energy consumption, capital expenditures, and regulatory compatibility for the training of a 10-trillion-token model. Our findings show that while all configurations remain below export-control and electrical infrastructure thresholds, fiscal viability is determined by hardware efficiency. H100-based scenarios achieve training feasibility at a total cost of 8-14 million USD, while A100 deployments require 19-32 million USD due to higher energy and hardware demand. We argue that extending training timelines should be treated as a policy lever to mitigate hardware constraints, enabling the production of usable, auditable, and locally aligned models without competing at the global frontier. This study contributes to the discourse on AI compute governance and technological sovereignty by highlighting context-sensitive strategies that allow middle-income countries to establish sustainable and strategically sufficient AI capabilities.

- **[Transformers are almost optimal metalearners for linear classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19797)**  `arXiv:2510.19797`  
  _Roey Magen, Gal Vardi_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Transformers have demonstrated impressive in-context learning (ICL) capabilities, raising the question of whether they can serve as metalearners that adapt to new tasks using only a small number of in-context examples, without any further training. While recent theoretical work has studied transformers' ability to perform ICL, most of these analyses do not address the formal metalearning setting, where the objective is to solve a collection of related tasks more efficiently than would be possible by solving each task individually. In this paper, we provide the first theoretical analysis showing that a simplified transformer architecture trained via gradient descent can act as a near-optimal metalearner in a linear classification setting. We consider a natural family of tasks where each task corresponds to a class-conditional Gaussian mixture model, with the mean vectors lying in a shared $k$-dimensional subspace of $R^d$. After training on a sufficient number of such tasks, we show that the transformer can generalize to a new task using only $O(k / R^4)$ in-context examples, where $R$ denotes the signal strength at test time. This performance (almost) matches that of an optimal learner that knows exactly the shared subspace and significantly outperforms any learner that only has access to the in-context data, which requires $\Omega(d / R^4)$ examples to generalize. Importantly, our bounds on the number of training tasks and examples per task needed to achieve this result are independent of the ambient dimension $d$.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Suppose Alice trains an open-weight language model and Bob uses a blackbox derivative of Alice's model to produce text. Can Alice prove that Bob is using her model, either by querying Bob's derivative model (query setting) or from the text alone (observational setting)? We formulate this question as an independence testing problem--in which the null hypothesis is that Bob's model or text is independent of Alice's randomized training run--and investigate it through the lens of palimpsestic memorization in language models: models are more likely to memorize data seen later in training, so we can test whether Bob is using Alice's model using test statistics that capture correlation between Bob's model or text and the ordering of training examples in Alice's training run. If Alice has randomly shuffled her training data, then any significant correlation amounts to exactly quantifiable statistical evidence against the null hypothesis, regardless of the composition of Alice's training data. In the query setting, we directly estimate (via prompting) the likelihood Bob's model gives to Alice's training examples and order; we correlate the likelihoods of over 40 fine-tunes of various Pythia and OLMo base models ranging from 1B to 12B parameters with the base model's training data order, achieving a p-value on the order of at most 1e-8 in all but six cases. In the observational setting, we try two approaches based on estimating 1) the likelihood of Bob's text overlapping with spans of Alice's training examples and 2) the likelihood of Bob's text with respect to different versions of Alice's model we obtain by repeating the last phase (e.g., 1%) of her training run on reshuffled data. The second approach can reliably distinguish Bob's text from as little as a few hundred tokens; the first does not involve any retraining but requires many more tokens (several hundred thousand) to achieve high power.

  Data-driven methods offer efficient and robust solutions for analyzing complex dynamical systems but rely on the assumption of I.I.D. data, driving the development of generalization techniques for handling environmental differences. These techniques, however, are limited by their dependence on environment labels, which are often unavailable during training due to data acquisition challenges, privacy concerns, and environmental variability, particularly in large public datasets and privacy-sensitive domains. In response, we propose DynaInfer, a novel method that infers environment specifications by analyzing prediction errors from fixed neural networks within each training round, enabling environment assignments directly from data. We prove our algorithm effectively solves the alternating optimization problem in unlabeled scenarios and validate it through extensive experiments across diverse dynamical systems. Results show that DynaInfer outperforms existing environment assignment techniques, converges rapidly to true labels, and even achieves superior performance when environment labels are available.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Sparse fine-tuning techniques adapt LLMs to downstream tasks by only tuning a sparse subset of model parameters. However, the effectiveness of sparse adaptation depends on optimally selecting the model parameters to be fine-tuned. In this work, we introduce a novel sparse fine-tuning technique named GaLLoP: Gradient-based Sparse Learning on Low-Magnitude Parameters, which fine-tunes only those model parameters which have the largest gradient magnitudes on downstream tasks and the smallest pre-trained magnitudes, intuitively prioritizing parameters that are highly task-relevant, but minimally disruptive to pre-trained knowledge. Our experimentation with LLaMA3 8B and Gemma 2B as base models shows that GaLLoP consistently improves or matches the in-distribution as well as out-of-distribution performance obtained via the usage of other leading parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques, including LoRA, DoRA, and SAFT. Our analysis demonstrates that GaLLoP mitigates catastrophic forgetting and memorization of task data, as important pre-trained parameters remain unchanged, and stabilizes performance relative to other fine-tuning techniques, robustly generalizing across most random seeds.

  Diffusion Models have become a cornerstone of modern generative AI for their exceptional generation quality and controllability. However, their inherent \textit{multi-step iterations} and \textit{complex backbone networks} lead to prohibitive computational overhead and generation latency, forming a major bottleneck for real-time applications. Although existing acceleration techniques have made progress, they still face challenges such as limited applicability, high training costs, or quality degradation.Against this backdrop, \textbf{Diffusion Caching} offers a promising training-free, architecture-agnostic, and efficient inference paradigm. Its core mechanism identifies and reuses intrinsic computational redundancies in the diffusion process. By enabling feature-level cross-step reuse and inter-layer scheduling, it reduces computation without modifying model parameters. This paper systematically reviews the theoretical foundations and evolution of Diffusion Caching and proposes a unified framework for its classification and analysis.Through comparative analysis of representative methods, we show that Diffusion Caching evolves from \textit{static reuse} to \textit{dynamic prediction}. This trend enhances caching flexibility across diverse tasks and enables integration with other acceleration techniques such as sampling optimization and model distillation, paving the way for a unified, efficient inference framework for future multimodal and interactive applications. We argue that this paradigm will become a key enabler of real-time and efficient generative AI, injecting new vitality into both theory and practice of \textit{Efficient Generative Intelligence}.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Counterfactual explanations (CFXs) provide human-understandable justifications for model predictions, enabling actionable recourse and enhancing interpretability. To be reliable, CFXs must avoid regions of high predictive uncertainty, where explanations may be misleading or inapplicable. However, existing methods often neglect uncertainty or lack principled mechanisms for incorporating it with formal guarantees. We propose CONFEX, a novel method for generating uncertainty-aware counterfactual explanations using Conformal Prediction (CP) and Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP). CONFEX explanations are designed to provide local coverage guarantees, addressing the issue that CFX generation violates exchangeability. To do so, we develop a novel localised CP procedure that enjoys an efficient MILP encoding by leveraging an offline tree-based partitioning of the input space. This way, CONFEX generates CFXs with rigorous guarantees on both predictive uncertainty and optimality. We evaluate CONFEX against state-of-the-art methods across diverse benchmarks and metrics, demonstrating that our uncertainty-aware approach yields robust and plausible explanations.

  _Qilin Ye, Deqing Fu, Robin Jia, Vatsal Sharan_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Transformers often fail to learn generalizable algorithms, instead relying on brittle heuristics. Using graph connectivity as a testbed, we explain this phenomenon both theoretically and empirically. We consider a simplified Transformer architecture, the disentangled Transformer, and prove that an $L$-layer model has capacity to solve for graphs with diameters up to exactly $3^L$, implementing an algorithm equivalent to computing powers of the adjacency matrix. We analyze the training-dynamics, and show that the learned strategy hinges on whether most training instances are within this model capacity. Within-capacity graphs (diameter $\leq 3^L$) drive the learning of a correct algorithmic solution while beyond-capacity graphs drive the learning of a simple heuristic based on node degrees. Finally, we empirically demonstrate that restricting training data within a model's capacity leads to both standard and disentangled transformers learning the exact algorithm rather than the degree-based heuristic.

  We present a novel framework for leveraging synthetic ICU time-series data not only to train but also to rigorously and trustworthily evaluate predictive models, both at the population level and within fine-grained demographic subgroups. Building on prior diffusion and VAE-based generators (TimeDiff, HealthGen, TimeAutoDiff), we introduce \textit{Enhanced TimeAutoDiff}, which augments the latent diffusion objective with distribution-alignment penalties. We extensively benchmark all models on MIMIC-III and eICU, on 24-hour mortality and binary length-of-stay tasks. Our results show that Enhanced TimeAutoDiff reduces the gap between real-on-synthetic and real-on-real evaluation (``TRTS gap'') by over 70\%, achieving $\Delta_{TRTS} \leq 0.014$ AUROC, while preserving training utility ($\Delta_{TSTR} \approx 0.01$). Crucially, for 32 intersectional subgroups, large synthetic cohorts cut subgroup-level AUROC estimation error by up to 50\% relative to small real test sets, and outperform them in 72--84\% of subgroups. This work provides a practical, privacy-preserving roadmap for trustworthy, granular model evaluation in critical care, enabling robust and reliable performance analysis across diverse patient populations without exposing sensitive EHR data, contributing to the overall trustworthiness of Medical AI.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The recent boom of large pre-trained models witnesses remarkable success in developing foundation models (FMs) for time series forecasting. Despite impressive performance across diverse downstream forecasting tasks, existing time series FMs possess massive network architectures and require substantial pre-training on large-scale datasets, which significantly hinders their deployment in resource-constrained environments. In response to this growing tension between versatility and affordability, we propose SEMPO, a novel lightweight foundation model that requires pretraining on relatively small-scale data, yet exhibits strong general time series forecasting. Concretely, SEMPO comprises two key modules: 1) energy-aware SpEctral decomposition module, that substantially improves the utilization of pre-training data by modeling not only the high-energy frequency signals but also the low-energy yet informative frequency signals that are ignored in current methods; and 2) Mixture-of-PrOmpts enabled Transformer, that learns heterogeneous temporal patterns through small dataset-specific prompts and adaptively routes time series tokens to prompt-based experts for parameter-efficient model adaptation across different datasets and domains. Equipped with these modules, SEMPO significantly reduces both pre-training data scale and model size, while achieving strong generalization. Extensive experiments on two large-scale benchmarks covering 16 datasets demonstrate the superior performance of SEMPO in both zero-shot and few-shot forecasting scenarios compared with state-of-the-art methods.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Transformer language models generate text autoregressively, making inference latency proportional to the number of tokens generated. Speculative decoding reduces this latency without sacrificing output quality, by leveraging a small draft model to propose tokens that the larger target model verifies in parallel. In practice, however, there may exist a set of potential draft models- ranging from faster but less inaccurate, to slower yet more reliable. We introduce Hierarchical Speculative Decoding (HSD), an algorithm that stacks these draft models into a hierarchy, where each model proposes tokens, and the next larger model verifies them in a single forward pass, until finally the target model verifies tokens. We derive an expression for the expected latency of any such hierarchy and show that selecting the latency-optimal hierarchy can be done in polynomial time. Empirically, HSD gives up to 1.2x speed-up over the best single-draft baseline, demonstrating the practicality of our algorithm in reducing generation latency beyond previous techniques.

  Memory-efficient training of deep neural networks has become increasingly important as models grow larger while deployment environments impose strict resource constraints. We propose TraDy, a novel transfer learning scheme leveraging two key insights: layer importance for updates is architecture-dependent and determinable a priori, while dynamic stochastic channel selection provides superior gradient approximation compared to static approaches. We introduce a dynamic channel selection approach that stochastically resamples channels between epochs within preselected layers. Extensive experiments demonstrate TraDy achieves state-of-the-art performance across various downstream tasks and architectures while maintaining strict memory constraints, achieving up to 99% activation sparsity, 95% weight derivative sparsity, and 97% reduction in FLOPs for weight derivative computation.

  _Konstantin Hess, Dennis Frauen, Mihaela van der Schaar, Stefan Feuerriegel_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Estimating heterogeneous treatment effects (HTEs) in time-varying settings is particularly challenging, as the probability of observing certain treatment sequences decreases exponentially with longer prediction horizons. Thus, the observed data contain little support for many plausible treatment sequences, which creates severe overlap problems. Existing meta-learners for the time-varying setting typically assume adequate treatment overlap, and thus suffer from exploding estimation variance when the overlap is low. To address this problem, we introduce a novel overlap-weighted orthogonal (WO) meta-learner for estimating HTEs that targets regions in the observed data with high probability of receiving the interventional treatment sequences. This offers a fully data-driven approach through which our WO-learner can counteract instabilities as in existing meta-learners and thus obtain more reliable HTE estimates. Methodologically, we develop a novel Neyman-orthogonal population risk function that minimizes the overlap-weighted oracle risk. We show that our WO-learner has the favorable property of Neyman-orthogonality, meaning that it is robust against misspecification in the nuisance functions. Further, our WO-learner is fully model-agnostic and can be applied to any machine learning model. Through extensive experiments with both transformer and LSTM backbones, we demonstrate the benefits of our novel WO-learner.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) is a widely used method for parameter-efficient finetuning. However, existing LoRA variants lack mechanisms to explicitly disambiguate task-relevant information within the learned low-rank subspace, potentially limiting downstream performance. We propose Factorized Variational Autoencoder LoRA (FVAE-LoRA), which leverages a VAE to learn two distinct latent spaces. Our novel Evidence Lower Bound formulation explicitly promotes factorization between the latent spaces, dedicating one latent space to task-salient features and the other to residual information. Extensive experiments on text, audio, and image tasks demonstrate that FVAE-LoRA consistently outperforms standard LoRA. Moreover, spurious correlation evaluations confirm that FVAE-LoRA better isolates task-relevant signals, leading to improved robustness under distribution shifts.

  Evacuation simulation is essential for building safety design, ensuring properly planned evacuation routes. However, traditional evacuation simulation relies heavily on refined modeling with extensive parameters, making it challenging to adopt such methods in a rapid iteration process in early design stages. Thus, this study proposes DiffEvac, a novel method to learn building evacuation patterns based on Generative Models (GMs), for efficient evacuation simulation and enhanced safety design. Initially, a dataset of 399 diverse functional layouts and corresponding evacuation heatmaps of buildings was established. Then, a decoupled feature representation is proposed to embed physical features like layouts and occupant density for GMs. Finally, a diffusion model based on image prompts is proposed to learn evacuation patterns from simulated evacuation heatmaps. Compared to existing research using Conditional GANs with RGB representation, DiffEvac achieves up to a 37.6% improvement in SSIM, 142% in PSNR, and delivers results 16 times faster, thereby cutting simulation time to 2 minutes. Case studies further demonstrate that the proposed method not only significantly enhances the rapid design iteration and adjustment process with efficient evacuation simulation but also offers new insights and technical pathways for future safety optimization in intelligent building design. The research implication is that the approach lowers the modeling burden, enables large-scale what-if exploration, and facilitates coupling with multi-objective design tools.

  Precise outbreak forecasting of infectious diseases is essential for effective public health responses and epidemic control. The increased availability of machine learning (ML) methods for time-series forecasting presents an enticing avenue to enhance outbreak forecasting. Though the COVID-19 outbreak demonstrated the value of applying ML models to predict epidemic profiles, using ML models to forecast endemic diseases remains underexplored. In this work, we present ForecastNet-XCL (an ensemble model based on XGBoost+CNN+BiLSTM), a deep learning hybrid framework designed to addresses this gap by creating accurate multi-week RSV forecasts up to 100 weeks in advance based on climate and temporal data, without access to real-time surveillance on RSV. The framework combines high-resolution feature learning with long-range temporal dependency capturing mechanisms, bolstered by an autoregressive module trained on climate-controlled lagged relations. Stochastic inference returns probabilistic intervals to inform decision-making. Evaluated across 34 U.S. states, ForecastNet-XCL reliably outperformed statistical baselines, individual neural nets, and conventional ensemble methods in both within- and cross-state scenarios, sustaining accuracy over extended forecast horizons. Training on climatologically diverse datasets enhanced generalization furthermore, particularly in locations having irregular or biennial RSV patterns. ForecastNet-XCL's efficiency, performance, and uncertainty-aware design make it a deployable early-warning tool amid escalating climate pressures and constrained surveillance resources.

  AI methods are increasingly shaping pharmaceutical drug discovery. However, their translation to industrial applications remains limited due to their reliance on public datasets, lacking scale and diversity of proprietary pharmaceutical data. Federated learning (FL) offers a promising approach to integrate private data into privacy-preserving, collaborative model training across data silos. This federated data access complicates important data-centric tasks such as estimating dataset diversity, performing informed data splits, and understanding the structure of the combined chemical space. To address this gap, we investigate how well federated clustering methods can disentangle and represent distributed molecular data. We benchmark three approaches, Federated kMeans (Fed-kMeans), Federated Principal Component Analysis combined with Fed-kMeans (Fed-PCA+Fed-kMeans), and Federated Locality-Sensitive Hashing (Fed-LSH), against their centralized counterparts on eight diverse molecular datasets. Our evaluation utilizes both, standard mathematical and a chemistry-informed evaluation metrics, SF-ICF, that we introduce in this work. The large-scale benchmarking combined with an in-depth explainability analysis shows the importance of incorporating domain knowledge through chemistry-informed metrics, and on-client explainability analyses for federated diversity analysis on molecular data.

  We revisit the problem of controlling linear systems with quadratic cost under unknown dynamics with model-based reinforcement learning. Traditional methods like Optimism in the Face of Uncertainty and Thompson Sampling, rooted in multi-armed bandits (MABs), face practical limitations. In contrast, we propose an alternative based on the Confusing Instance (CI) principle, which underpins regret lower bounds in MABs and discrete Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) and is central to the Minimum Empirical Divergence (MED) family of algorithms, known for their asymptotic optimality in various settings. By leveraging the structure of LQR policies along with sensitivity and stability analysis, we develop MED-LQ. This novel control strategy extends the principles of CI and MED beyond small-scale settings. Our benchmarks on a comprehensive control suite demonstrate that MED-LQ achieves competitive performance in various scenarios while highlighting its potential for broader applications in large-scale MDPs.

  Existing Bayesian Optimization (BO) methods typically balance exploration and exploitation to optimize costly objective functions. However, these methods often suffer from a significant one-step bias, which may lead to convergence towards local optima and poor performance in complex or high-dimensional tasks. Recently, Black-Box Optimization (BBO) has achieved success across various scientific and engineering domains, particularly when function evaluations are costly and gradients are unavailable. Motivated by this, we propose the Reinforced Energy-Based Model for Bayesian Optimization (REBMBO), which integrates Gaussian Processes (GP) for local guidance with an Energy-Based Model (EBM) to capture global structural information. Notably, we define each Bayesian Optimization iteration as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and use Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) for adaptive multi-step lookahead, dynamically adjusting the depth and direction of exploration to effectively overcome the limitations of traditional BO methods. We conduct extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world benchmarks, confirming the superior performance of REBMBO. Additional analyses across various GP configurations further highlight its adaptability and robustness.

  Online Internet platforms require sophisticated marketing strategies to optimize user retention and platform revenue -- a classical resource allocation problem. Traditional solutions adopt a two-stage pipeline: machine learning (ML) for predicting individual treatment effects to marketing actions, followed by operations research (OR) optimization for decision-making. This paradigm presents two fundamental technical challenges. First, the prediction-decision misalignment: Conventional ML methods focus solely on prediction accuracy without considering downstream optimization objectives, leading to improved predictive metrics that fail to translate to better decisions. Second, the bias-variance dilemma: Observational data suffers from multiple biases (e.g., selection bias, position bias), while experimental data (e.g., randomized controlled trials), though unbiased, is typically scarce and costly -- resulting in high-variance estimates. We propose Bi-level Decision-Focused Causal Learning (Bi-DFCL) that systematically addresses these challenges. First, we develop an unbiased estimator of OR decision quality using experimental data, which guides ML model training through surrogate loss functions that bridge discrete optimization gradients. Second, we establish a bi-level optimization framework that jointly leverages observational and experimental data, solved via implicit differentiation. This novel formulation enables our unbiased OR estimator to correct learning directions from biased observational data, achieving optimal bias-variance tradeoff. Extensive evaluations on public benchmarks, industrial marketing datasets, and large-scale online A/B tests demonstrate the effectiveness of Bi-DFCL, showing statistically significant improvements over state-of-the-art. Currently, Bi-DFCL has been deployed at Meituan, one of the largest online food delivery platforms in the world.

  Recent work has demonstrated state-of-the-art results in large language model (LLM) hallucination detection and mitigation through consistency-based approaches which involve aggregating multiple responses sampled from a single LLM for a given prompt. These approaches help offset limitations stemming from the imperfect data on which LLMs are trained, which includes biases and under-representation of information required at deployment time among other limitations which can lead to hallucinations. We show that extending these single-model consistency methods to combine responses from multiple LLMs with different training data, training schemes and model architectures can result in substantial further improvements in hallucination detection and mitigation capabilities beyond their single-model consistency counterparts. We evaluate this \emph{consortium consistency} approach across many model teams from a pool of 15 LLMs and explore under what conditions it is beneficial to team together different LLMs in this manner. Further, we show that these performance improvements often come with reduced inference costs, offsetting a significant drawback with single-model consistency methods.

  In the era of large language models (LLMs), weight-activation quantization helps fit models on edge device by reducing memory and compute bit-widths. However, three challenges persist for energy constrained hardware: (1) even after quantization, multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations remain unavoidable and continue to dominate energy consumption; (2) dequantization (or per-tensor/channel rescaling) introduces extra arithmetic and data movement, increasing latency and energy; (3) uniform parameters bit widths clip salient values-while intra-channel mixed precision is generally impractical on current matrix hardware and memory. In contrast, brain-inspired Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), owing to their binary spike-based information representation and the Integrate-and-Fire (IF) paradigm, naturally support mixed-precision storage and energy-efficient computation by replacing complex MACs with temporal Accumulate (ACCs). Motivated by this property, we propose SpikeQuant, which selectively applies mixed-precision quantization to activations with salient values and re-encodes them into binary spike counts, thereby enabling dynamic mixed storage of different bitwidths. Furthermore, by embedding the quantization scale into the threshold of the IF mechanism, our approach performs energy-efficient linear transformations on weights and activations while avoiding explicit dequantization. Experimental results demonstrate that SpikeQuant consistently achieves near-FP16 perplexity under W4A4 quantization while reducing energy cost by up to 4.6 times compared to existing methods, highlighting its effectiveness for accurate and energy-efficient LLM deployment.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) on CPU-based edge devices is crucial for enabling on-device intelligence and expanding AI accessibility. However, it remains challenging due to limited memory and computational resources. During edge inference, memory usage and latency are the primary bottlenecks. Although weight quantization can effectively reduce memory consumption, existing hardware-friendly approaches often rely on uniform quantization, which poorly fits weight distributions and incurs high dequantization overhead at low bit widths. To address these limitations, we propose ELUTQ, an efficient quantization framework introducing a novel quantization format, Hierarchical Linear Quantization (HLQ). HLQ better captures the statistical characteristics of weights without increasing the computational cost of Bit-serial LUT-based GEMM operations, thereby eliminating dequantization overhead. It is orthogonal to existing quantization algorithms and can be seamlessly integrated into various quantization pipelines. For efficient on-device deployment, ELUTQ provides optimized CPU kernels for end-to-end inference. Experiments show that for LLaMA3-8B, HLQ reduces perplexity by about 8% at 3-bit and 85% at 2-bit precision under post-training quantization, completing quantization within one hour. With efficient finetuning, HLQ further improves 2-bit performance within two hours. In terms of inference efficiency, our 2-bit LLaMA2-7B achieves over 25 tokens/s on an Apple M2 chip (4 threads, batch size = 1).

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advancements in graph unlearning models have enhanced model utility by preserving the node representation essentially invariant, while using gradient ascent on the forget set to achieve unlearning. However, this approach causes a drastic degradation in model utility during the unlearning process due to the rapid divergence speed of gradient ascent. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{INPO}, an \textbf{I}nfluence-aware \textbf{N}egative \textbf{P}reference \textbf{O}ptimization framework that focuses on slowing the divergence speed and improving the robustness of the model utility to the unlearning process. Specifically, we first analyze that NPO has slower divergence speed and theoretically propose that unlearning high-influence edges can reduce impact of unlearning. We design an influence-aware message function to amplify the influence of unlearned edges and mitigate the tight topological coupling between the forget set and the retain set. The influence of each edge is quickly estimated by a removal-based method. Additionally, we propose a topological entropy loss from the perspective of topology to avoid excessive information loss in the local structure during unlearning. Extensive experiments conducted on five real-world datasets demonstrate that INPO-based model achieves state-of-the-art performance on all forget quality metrics while maintaining the model's utility.

  _Julian Schulz_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As AI systems approach dangerous capability levels where inability safety cases become insufficient, we need alternative approaches to ensure safety. This paper presents a roadmap for constructing safety cases based on chain-of-thought (CoT) monitoring in reasoning models and outlines our research agenda. We argue that CoT monitoring might support both control and trustworthiness safety cases. We propose a two-part safety case: (1) establishing that models lack dangerous capabilities when operating without their CoT, and (2) ensuring that any dangerous capabilities enabled by a CoT are detectable by CoT monitoring. We systematically examine two threats to monitorability: neuralese and encoded reasoning, which we categorize into three forms (linguistic drift, steganography, and alien reasoning) and analyze their potential drivers. We evaluate existing and novel techniques for maintaining CoT faithfulness. For cases where models produce non-monitorable reasoning, we explore the possibility of extracting a monitorable CoT from a non-monitorable CoT. To assess the viability of CoT monitoring safety cases, we establish prediction markets to aggregate forecasts on key technical milestones influencing their feasibility.

  Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) is an effective approach for aligning protein language models with experimental design goals. However, DPO faces a scalability bottleneck: the number of possible training pairs grows quadratically with the number of labeled sequences, leading to prohibitive training times even for modestly sized datasets. We introduce g-DPO, a framework that (i) uses sequence space clustering to prune redundant pairs while preserving training signal, and (ii) amortizes likelihood computations with group-based approximations. Across three protein engineering tasks, g-DPO maintains in-silico and in-vitro performance that is statistically indistinguishable from standard DPO, while converging 1.8 to 3.7 times faster, with greater gains expected as the size of the dataset increases.

  The modified universality hypothesis proposed by Jones et al. (2022) suggests that adversarially robust models trained for a given task are highly similar. We revisit the hypothesis and test its generality. While we verify Jones' main claim of high representational similarity in specific settings, results are not consistent across different datasets. We also discover that predictive behavior does not converge with increasing robustness and thus is not universal. We find that differing predictions originate in the classification layer, but show that more universal predictive behavior can be achieved with simple retraining of the classifiers. Overall, our work points towards partial universality of neural networks in specific settings and away from notions of strict universality.

  Learning to infer the conditional posterior model is a key step for robust meta-learning. This paper presents a new Bayesian meta-learning approach called Neural Variational Dropout Processes (NVDPs). NVDPs model the conditional posterior distribution based on a task-specific dropout; a low-rank product of Bernoulli experts meta-model is utilized for a memory-efficient mapping of dropout rates from a few observed contexts. It allows for a quick reconfiguration of a globally learned and shared neural network for new tasks in multi-task few-shot learning. In addition, NVDPs utilize a novel prior conditioned on the whole task data to optimize the conditional \textit{dropout} posterior in the amortized variational inference. Surprisingly, this enables the robust approximation of task-specific dropout rates that can deal with a wide range of functional ambiguities and uncertainties. We compared the proposed method with other meta-learning approaches in the few-shot learning tasks such as 1D stochastic regression, image inpainting, and classification. The results show the excellent performance of NVDPs.

  Large language models trained on vast corpora inherently risk memorizing sensitive or harmful content, which may later resurface in their outputs. Prevailing unlearning methods generally rely on gradient ascent and its variants to lower the probability of specific target responses. However, we find that this strategy induces a critical side effect: probability mass is redistributed into high-likelihood regions, often corresponding to semantically related rephrasings of the targets. We refer to this as the squeezing effect, which explains why many methods yield merely spurious unlearning, a problem further obscured by automated metrics (e.g., ROUGE, truth ratio) that misreport actual success. To address this, we propose a bootstrapping (BS) framework that explicitly links the squeezing effect with the model's own high-confidence generations, namely its model beliefs. Since model beliefs inherently capture the very high-likelihood regions where probability mass is squeezed, incorporating them into the unlearning objective directly counters the squeezing effect. By jointly suppressing both target responses and model beliefs, BS-T (token) attenuates high-probability tokens, whereas BS-S (sequence) removes entire high-confidence generations, together achieving more thorough forgetting while preserving utility. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks with various model families confirm the effectiveness of our approach.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Ensuring fairness in machine learning models is a critical challenge. Existing debiasing methods often compromise performance, rely on static correction strategies, and struggle with data sparsity, particularly within minority groups. Furthermore, their utilization of sensitive attributes is often suboptimal, either depending excessively on complete attribute labeling or disregarding these attributes entirely. To overcome these limitations, we propose FairNet, a novel framework for dynamic, instance-level fairness correction. FairNet integrates a bias detector with conditional low-rank adaptation (LoRA), which enables selective activation of the fairness correction mechanism exclusively for instances identified as biased, and thereby preserve performance on unbiased instances. A key contribution is a new contrastive loss function for training the LoRA module, specifically designed to minimize intra-class representation disparities across different sensitive groups and effectively address underfitting in minority groups. The FairNet framework can flexibly handle scenarios with complete, partial, or entirely absent sensitive attribute labels. Theoretical analysis confirms that, under moderate TPR/FPR for the bias detector, FairNet can enhance the performance of the worst group without diminishing overall model performance, and potentially yield slight performance improvements. Comprehensive empirical evaluations across diverse vision and language benchmarks validate the effectiveness of FairNet.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Spectral bias, the tendency of neural networks to learn low-frequency features first, is a well-known issue with many training algorithms for physics-informed neural networks (PINNs). To overcome this issue, we propose IFeF-PINN, an algorithm for iterative training of PINNs with Fourier-enhanced features. The key idea is to enrich the latent space using high-frequency components through Random Fourier Features. This creates a two-stage training problem: (i) estimate a basis in the feature space, and (ii) perform regression to determine the coefficients of the enhanced basis functions. For an underlying linear model, it is shown that the latter problem is convex, and we prove that the iterative training scheme converges. Furthermore, we empirically establish that Random Fourier Features enhance the expressive capacity of the network, enabling accurate approximation of high-frequency PDEs. Through extensive numerical evaluation on classical benchmark problems, the superior performance of our method over state-of-the-art algorithms is shown, and the improved approximation across the frequency domain is illustrated.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In the field of large language model (LLM) compression, singular value decomposition (SVD) is a widely studied and adopted low-rank decomposition technique. Since SVD operates exclusively on linear modules, and these modules in LLMs are separated by nonlinear components, SVD can only be applied independently to each linear module. Under a global compression ratio constraint, determining the appropriate rank for different linear modules becomes a critical problem. Existing approaches, such as heuristic algorithms and mask-based training, have made progress in addressing this challenge. However, these methods still suffer from several limitations: heuristic algorithms explore the solution space within restricted regions, while mask-based training struggles to efficiently capture the relationship between singular value spectra and trainable parameters. More importantly, current methods overlook the key property that the gain function is non-smooth at a compression ratio of 1, which often leads the training process to suboptimal local minima. To address these issues, we propose an Adaptive Rank Allocation (ARA) method. Specifically, (1) ARA introduces a dedicated mask design that enables efficient mapping and updating between retained ranks and trainable parameters; and (2) it employs an additional loss function to guide parameter selection toward globally optimal solutions. Experimental results demonstrate that ARA achieves state-of-the-art performance. On the LLaMA2-7B model with a 80\% compression ratio, ARA reduces perplexity on WikiText2 from 8.38 to 6.42 and improves average zero-shot task accuracy by 9.72 percentage points compared with uniform compression. These results highlight the effectiveness of our method for rank allocation in SVD-based LLM compression.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) faces a critical bottleneck in their immense size, necessitating efficient compression techniques. While Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is a promising approach, existing SVD-based methods treat the entire parameter matrix uniformly, overlooking that SVD approximation errors vary significantly across different matrix parts, which often leads to suboptimal compression. To address this, we propose \textbf{C}olumn-\textbf{P}reserving \textbf{S}ingular \textbf{V}alue \textbf{D}ecomposition (CPSVD), a novel method that refines SVD-based LLM compression by intelligently segmenting the parameter matrix. Unlike traditional SVD, CPSVD identifies and directly preserves matrix columns with high decomposition errors, applying SVD only to columns with low decomposition errors, while precisely determining the optimal balance point between these two strategies to minimize error. Furthermore, leveraging the inherent heterogeneity in decomposition errors across different matrices within an LLM, CPSVD adaptively allocates non-uniform compression rates to modules within that layer, while adhering to a target layer-wise compression ratio, thereby further enhancing compression performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CPSVD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art SVD-based LLM compression methods, achieving lower perplexity and higher accuracy on zero-shot tasks.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Pre-training Graph Foundation Models (GFMs) on text-attributed graphs (TAGs) is central to web-scale applications such as search, recommendation, and knowledge discovery. However, existing CLIP-style graph-text aligners face two key limitations: they assume strict one-to-one correspondences between nodes and texts, overlooking the inherent many-to-many relations in real-world graphs; and they rely on static alignment objectives that cannot adapt to varying data quality, making them brittle under noisy supervision. Together, these limitations expose a core dilemma: embracing expressive many-to-many alignment amplifies noise, while reverting to strict one-to-one strategies sacrifices semantic diversity and fails to handle inherently mismatched pairs. To address these challenges, we propose ADAligner, a dynamic, quality-aware graph-text alignment framework that dynamically adjusts between expressive many-to-many and conservative one-to-one objectives according to supervision quality. ADAligner estimates batch-level alignment reliability in real time and adapts its optimization accordingly, promoting soft, subgraph-level many-to-many alignment when supervision is clean, while emphasizing reliable one-to-one alignment by dynamically filtering low-confidence pairs under noise. Theoretically, we prove that this dynamic mechanism forms a stable negative feedback process, ensuring convergence and robustness. Comprehensive experiments on nine diverse TAG datasets demonstrate that ADAligner consistently outperforms prior graph-text aligners on zero-/few-shot node classification, link prediction and cross-modal retrieval tasks. It maintains strong robustness under noisy supervision and accelerates pre-training by approximately 2 to 3 times compared to multimodal baselines, establishing a scalable and reliable foundation for graph-text representation learning in real-world web environments.

  Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) is a powerful framework used to address a wide range of NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems, often solved by Branch and Bound (B&B). A key factor influencing the performance of B&B solvers is the variable selection heuristic governing branching decisions. Recent contributions have sought to adapt reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms to the B&B setting to learn optimal branching policies, through Markov Decision Processes (MDP) inspired formulations, and ad hoc convergence theorems and algorithms. In this work, we introduce BBMDP, a principled vanilla MDP formulation for variable selection in B&B, allowing to leverage a broad range of RL algorithms for the purpose of learning optimal B\&B heuristics. Computational experiments validate our model empirically, as our branching agent outperforms prior state-of-the-art RL agents on four standard MILP benchmarks.

  Time-series foundation models (TSFMs) achieve strong forecast accuracy, yet accuracy alone does not determine practical value. The form of a forecast -- point, quantile, parametric, or trajectory ensemble -- fundamentally constrains which operational tasks it can support. We survey recent TSFMs and find that two-thirds produce only point or parametric forecasts, while many operational tasks require trajectory ensembles that preserve temporal dependence. We establish when forecast types can be converted and when they cannot: trajectory ensembles convert to simpler forms via marginalization without additional assumptions, but the reverse requires imposing temporal dependence through copulas or conformal methods. We prove that marginals cannot determine path-dependent event probabilities -- infinitely many joint distributions share identical marginals but yield different answers to operational questions. We map six fundamental forecasting tasks to minimal sufficient forecast types and provide a task-aligned evaluation framework. Our analysis clarifies when forecast type, not accuracy, differentiates practical utility.

  In this technical report, we present the Ring-linear model series, specifically including Ring-mini-linear-2.0 and Ring-flash-linear-2.0. Ring-mini-linear-2.0 comprises 16B parameters and 957M activations, while Ring-flash-linear-2.0 contains 104B parameters and 6.1B activations. Both models adopt a hybrid architecture that effectively integrates linear attention and softmax attention, significantly reducing I/O and computational overhead in long-context inference scenarios. Compared to a 32 billion parameter dense model, this series reduces inference cost to 1/10, and compared to the original Ring series, the cost is also reduced by over 50%. Furthermore, through systematic exploration of the ratio between different attention mechanisms in the hybrid architecture, we have identified the currently optimal model structure. Additionally, by leveraging our self-developed high-performance FP8 operator library-linghe, overall training efficiency has been improved by 50%. Benefiting from the high alignment between the training and inference engine operators, the models can undergo long-term, stable, and highly efficient optimization during the reinforcement learning phase, consistently maintaining SOTA performance across multiple challenging complex reasoning benchmarks.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Machine learning models are essential for decision-making and risk assessment, requiring highly reliable predictions in terms of both discrimination and calibration. While calibration often receives less attention, it is crucial for critical decisions, such as those in clinical predictions. We introduce a novel calibration pipeline that leverages an ensemble of calibration functions trained on clusters of learned representations of the input samples to enhance overall calibration. This approach not only improves the calibration score of various methods from 82.28% up to 100% but also introduces a unique matching metric that ensures model selection optimizes both discrimination and calibration. Our generic scheme adapts to any underlying representation, clustering, calibration methods and metric, offering flexibility and superior performance across commonly used calibration methods.

  Monitoring species distribution is vital for conservation efforts, enabling the assessment of environmental impacts and the development of effective preservation strategies. Traditional data collection methods, including citizen science, offer valuable insights but remain limited in coverage and completeness. Species Distribution Modelling (SDM) helps address these gaps by using occurrence data and environmental variables to predict species presence across large regions. In this study, we enhance SDM accuracy for frogs (Anura) by applying deep learning and data imputation techniques using data from the "EY - 2022 Biodiversity Challenge." Our experiments show that data balancing significantly improved model performance, reducing the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) from 189 to 29 in frog counting tasks. Feature selection identified key environmental factors influencing occurrence, optimizing inputs while maintaining predictive accuracy. The multimodal ensemble model, integrating land cover, NDVI, and other environmental inputs, outperformed individual models and showed robust generalization across unseen regions. The fusion of image and tabular data improved both frog counting and habitat classification, achieving 84.9% accuracy with an AUC of 0.90. This study highlights the potential of multimodal learning and data preprocessing techniques such as balancing and imputation to improve predictive ecological modeling when data are sparse or incomplete, contributing to more precise and scalable biodiversity monitoring.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Discrete diffusion models offer a promising alternative to autoregressive generation through parallel decoding, but they suffer from a sampling wall: once categorical sampling occurs, rich distributional information collapses into one-hot vectors and cannot be propagated across steps, forcing subsequent steps to operate with limited information. To mitigate this problem, we introduce Loopholing, a novel and simple mechanism that preserves this information via a deterministic latent pathway, leading to Loopholing Discrete Diffusion Models (LDDMs). Trained efficiently with a self-conditioning strategy, LDDMs achieve substantial gains-reducing generative perplexity by up to 61% over prior baselines, closing (and in some cases surpassing) the gap with autoregressive models, and producing more coherent text. Applied to reasoning tasks, LDDMs also improve performance on arithmetic benchmarks such as Countdown and Game of 24. These results also indicate that loopholing mitigates idle steps and oscillations, providing a scalable path toward high-quality non-autoregressive text generation.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  State-space models (SSMs) have emerged as efficient alternatives to Transformers for sequence modeling, offering superior scalability through recurrent structures. However, their training remains costly and the ecosystem around them is far less mature than that of Transformers. Moreover, the structural heterogeneity between SSMs and Transformers makes it challenging to efficiently distill knowledge from pretrained attention models. In this work, we propose Cross-architecture distillation via Attention Bridge (CAB), a novel data-efficient distillation framework that efficiently transfers attention knowledge from Transformer teachers to state-space student models. Unlike conventional knowledge distillation that transfers knowledge only at the output level, CAB enables token-level supervision via a lightweight bridge and flexible layer-wise alignment, improving both efficiency and transferability. We further introduce flexible layer-wise alignment strategies to accommodate architectural discrepancies between teacher and student. Extensive experiments across vision and language domains demonstrate that our method consistently improves the performance of state-space models, even under limited training data, outperforming both standard and cross-architecture distillation methods. Our findings suggest that attention-based knowledge can be efficiently transferred to recurrent models, enabling rapid utilization of Transformer expertise for building a stronger SSM community.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel at learning from structured data, yet fairness in regression tasks remains underexplored. Existing approaches mainly target classification and representation-level debiasing, which cannot fully address the continuous nature of node-level regression. We propose FnRGNN, a fairness-aware in-processing framework for GNN-based node regression that applies interventions at three levels: (i) structure-level edge reweighting, (ii) representation-level alignment via MMD, and (iii) prediction-level normalization through Sinkhorn-based distribution matching. This multi-level strategy ensures robust fairness under complex graph topologies. Experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that FnRGNN reduces group disparities without sacrificing performance. Code is available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Humans possess an innate ability to group objects by similarity, a cognitive mechanism that clustering algorithms aim to emulate. Recent advances in community detection have enabled the discovery of configurations -- valid hierarchical clusterings across multiple resolution scales -- without requiring labeled data. In this paper, we formally characterize these configurations and identify similar emergent structures in register tokens within Vision Transformers. Unlike register tokens, configurations exhibit lower redundancy and eliminate the need for ad hoc selection. They can be learned through unsupervised or self-supervised methods, yet their selection or composition remains specific to the downstream task and input. Building on these insights, we introduce GraMixC, a plug-and-play module that extracts configurations, aligns them using our Reverse Merge/Split (RMS) technique, and fuses them via attention heads before forwarding them to any downstream predictor. On the DSN1 16S rRNA cultivation-media prediction task, GraMixC improves the R2 score from 0.6 to 0.9 across multiple methods, setting a new state of the art. We further validate GraMixC on standard tabular benchmarks, where it consistently outperforms single-resolution and static-feature baselines.

  _Yiyu Qian, Su Nguyen, Chao Chen, Qinyue Zhou, Liyuan Zhao_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Deep reinforcement learning (RL) achieves remarkable performance but lacks interpretability, limiting trust in policy behavior. The existing SILVER framework (Li, Siddique, and Cao 2025) explains RL policy via Shapley-based regression but remains restricted to low-dimensional, binary-action domains. We propose SILVER with RL-guided labeling, an enhanced variant that extends SILVER to multi-action and high-dimensional environments by incorporating the RL policy's own action outputs into the boundary points identification. Our method first extracts compact feature representations from image observations, performs SHAP-based feature attribution, and then employs RL-guided labeling to generate behaviorally consistent boundary datasets. Surrogate models, such as decision trees and regression-based functions, are subsequently trained to interpret RL policy's decision structure. We evaluate the proposed framework on two Atari environments using three deep RL algorithms and conduct human-subject study to assess the clarity and trustworthiness of the derived interpretable policy. Results show that our approach maintains competitive task performance while substantially improving transparency and human understanding of agent behavior. This work advances explainable RL by transforming SILVER into a scalable and behavior-aware framework for interpreting deep RL agents in high-dimensional, multi-action settings.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Interpretable reinforcement learning policies are essential for high-stakes decision-making, yet optimizing decision tree policies in Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) remains challenging. We propose SPOT, a novel method for computing decision tree policies, which formulates the optimization problem as a mixed-integer linear program (MILP). To enhance efficiency, we employ a reduced-space branch-and-bound approach that decouples the MDP dynamics from tree-structure constraints, enabling efficient parallel search. This significantly improves runtime and scalability compared to previous methods. Our approach ensures that each iteration yields the optimal decision tree. Experimental results on standard benchmarks demonstrate that SPOT achieves substantial speedup and scales to larger MDPs with a significantly higher number of states. The resulting decision tree policies are interpretable and compact, maintaining transparency without compromising performance. These results demonstrate that our approach simultaneously achieves interpretability and scalability, delivering high-quality policies an order of magnitude faster than existing approaches.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Time series foundation models (TSFMs) are a class of potentially powerful, general-purpose tools for time series forecasting and related temporal tasks, but their behavior is strongly shaped by subtle inductive biases in their design. Rather than developing a new model and claiming that it is better than existing TSFMs, e.g., by winning on existing well-established benchmarks, our objective is to understand how the various ``knobs'' of the training process affect model quality. Using a mix of theory and controlled empirical evaluation, we identify several design choices (patch size, embedding choice, training objective, etc.) and show how they lead to implicit biases in fundamental model properties (temporal behavior, geometric structure, how aggressively or not the model regresses to the mean, etc.); and we show how these biases can be intuitive or very counterintuitive, depending on properties of the model and data. We also illustrate in a case study on outlier handling how multiple biases can interact in complex ways; and we discuss implications of our results for learning the bitter lesson and building TSFMs.

  Infants discover categories, detect novelty, and adapt to new contexts without supervision -- a challenge for current machine learning. We present a brain-inspired perspective on configurations, a finite-resolution clustering framework that uses a single resolution parameter and attraction-repulsion dynamics to yield hierarchical organization, novelty sensitivity, and flexible adaptation. To evaluate these properties, we introduce mheatmap, which provides proportional heatmaps and a reassignment algorithm to fairly assess multi-resolution and dynamic behavior. Across datasets, configurations are competitive on standard clustering metrics, achieve 87% AUC in novelty detection, and show 35% better stability during dynamic category evolution. These results position configurations as a principled computational model of early cognitive categorization and a step toward brain-inspired AI.

  Knowledge distillation (KD) techniques have emerged as a powerful tool for transferring expertise from complex teacher models to lightweight student models, particularly beneficial for deploying high-performance models in resource-constrained devices. This approach has been successfully applied to graph neural networks (GNNs), harnessing their expressive capabilities to generate node embeddings that capture structural and feature-related information. In this study, we depart from the conventional KD approach by exploring the potential of collaborative learning among GNNs. In the absence of a pre-trained teacher model, we show that relatively simple and shallow GNN architectures can synergetically learn efficient models capable of performing better during inference, particularly in tackling multiple tasks. We propose a collaborative learning framework where ensembles of student GNNs mutually teach each other throughout the training process. We introduce an adaptive logit weighting unit to facilitate efficient knowledge exchange among models and an entropy enhancement technique to improve mutual learning. These components dynamically empower the models to adapt their learning strategies during training, optimizing their performance for downstream tasks. Extensive experiments conducted on three datasets each for node and graph classification demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The analogy to heat diffusion has enhanced our understanding of information flow in graphs and inspired the development of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). However, most diffusion-based GNNs emulate passive heat diffusion, which still suffers from over-smoothing and limits their ability to capture global graph information. Inspired by the heat death of the universe, which posits that energy distribution becomes uniform over time in a closed system, we recognize that, without external input, node representations in a graph converge to identical feature vectors as diffusion progresses. To address this issue, we propose the Active Diffusion-based Graph Neural Network (ADGNN). ADGNN achieves active diffusion by integrating multiple external information sources that dynamically influence the diffusion process, effectively overcoming the over-smoothing problem. Furthermore, our approach realizes true infinite diffusion by directly calculating the closed-form solution of the active diffusion iterative formula. This allows nodes to preserve their unique characteristics while efficiently gaining comprehensive insights into the graph's global structure. We evaluate ADGNN against several state-of-the-art GNN models across various graph tasks. The results demonstrate that ADGNN significantly improves both accuracy and efficiency, highlighting its effectiveness in capturing global graph information and maintaining node distinctiveness.

  _Runzhe Wu, Ankur Samanta, Ayush Jain, Scott Fujimoto, Jeongyeol Kwon, Ben Kretzu, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multi-task post-training of large language models (LLMs) is typically performed by mixing datasets from different tasks and optimizing them jointly. This approach implicitly assumes that all tasks contribute gradients of similar magnitudes; when this assumption fails, optimization becomes biased toward large-gradient tasks. In this paper, however, we show that this assumption fails in RL post-training: certain tasks produce significantly larger gradients, thus biasing updates toward those tasks. Such gradient imbalance would be justified only if larger gradients implied larger learning gains on the tasks (i.e., larger performance improvements) -- but we find this is not true. Large-gradient tasks can achieve similar or even much lower learning gains than small-gradient ones. Further analyses reveal that these gradient imbalances cannot be explained by typical training statistics such as training rewards or advantages, suggesting that they arise from the inherent differences between tasks. This cautions against naive dataset mixing and calls for future work on principled gradient-level corrections for LLMs.

  Integration of diverse data will be a pivotal step towards improving scientific explorations in many disciplines. This work establishes a vision-language model (VLM) that encodes videos with text input in order to classify various behaviors of a mouse existing in and engaging with their environment. Importantly, this model produces a behavioral vector over time for each subject and for each session the subject undergoes. The output is a valuable dataset that few programs are able to produce with as high accuracy and with minimal user input. Specifically, we use the open-source Qwen2.5-VL model and enhance its performance through prompts, in-context learning (ICL) with labeled examples, and frame-level preprocessing. We found that each of these methods contributes to improved classification, and that combining them results in strong F1 scores across all behaviors, including rare classes like freezing and fleeing, without any model fine-tuning. Overall, this model will support interdisciplinary researchers studying mouse behavior by enabling them to integrate diverse behavioral features, measured across multiple time points and environments, into a comprehensive dataset that can address complex research questions.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In contrast to the classic formulation of partial monitoring, linear partial monitoring can model infinite outcome spaces, while imposing a linear structure on both the losses and the observations. This setting can be viewed as a generalization of linear bandits where loss and feedback are decoupled in a flexible manner. In this work, we address a nonstochastic (adversarial), finite-actions version of the problem through a simple instance of the exploration-by-optimization method that is amenable to efficient implementation. We derive regret bounds that depend on the game structure in a more transparent manner than previous theoretical guarantees for this paradigm. Our bounds feature instance-specific quantities that reflect the degree of alignment between observations and losses, and resemble known guarantees in the stochastic setting. Notably, they achieve the standard $\sqrt{T}$ rate in easy (locally observable) games and $T^{2/3}$ in hard (globally observable) games, where $T$ is the time horizon. We instantiate these bounds in a selection of old and new partial information settings subsumed by this model, and illustrate that the achieved dependence on the game structure can be tight in interesting cases.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Catastrophic forgetting is a common issue in model fine-tuning, especially when the downstream domain contains limited labeled data or differs greatly from the pre-training distribution. Existing parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods operate in the weight space by modifying or augmenting the pre-trained model's parameters, which can yield models overly specialized to the available downstream data. To mitigate the risk of overwriting pre-trained knowledge and enhance robustness, we propose to fine-tune the pre-trained model in the feature space. Two new fine-tuning methods are proposed: LoRFA (Low-Rank Feature Adaptation) and VeFA (Vector-Based Feature Adaptation). Feature space adaptation is inspired by the idea of effect equivalence modeling (EEM) of downstream lurking variables causing distribution shifts, which posits that unobserved factors can be represented as the total equivalent amount on observed features. By compensating for the effects of downstream lurking variables via a lightweight feature-level transformation, the pre-trained representations can be preserved, which improves model generalization under distribution shift. We evaluate LoRFA and VeFA versus LoRA on image classification, NLU, and NLG, covering both standard fine-tuning metrics and robustness. Feature space adaptation achieves comparable fine-tuning results and consistently stronger robustness.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As machine learning models are increasingly fine-tuned on synthetic data, there is a critical risk of subtle misalignments spreading through interconnected AI systems. This paper investigates subliminal corruption, which we define as undesirable traits are transmitted through semantically neutral data, bypassing standard safety checks. While this phenomenon has been identified, a quantitative understanding of its dynamics is missing. To address this gap, we present a systematic study of the scaling laws, thresholds, and mechanisms of subliminal corruption using a teacher-student setup with GPT-2. Our experiments reveal three key findings: (1) subliminal corruption causes behavioral crossover, degrading the model's overall alignment, not just the targeted trait; (2) alignment fails in a sharp phase transition at a critical threshold of poisoned data, rather than degrading gradually; and (3) interpretability analysis shows the corruption mechanism mimics the model's natural fine-tuning process, making it difficult to detect. These results demonstrate a critical vulnerability in AI systems that rely on synthetic data and highlight the need for new safety protocols that can account for latent threats.

  _Ziyi Zhang, Shaogang Ren, Xiaoning Qian, Nick Duffield_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Granger causality is widely used for causal structure discovery in complex systems from multivariate time series data. Traditional Granger causality tests based on linear models often fail to detect even mild non-linear causal relationships. Therefore, numerous recent studies have investigated non-linear Granger causality methods, achieving improved performance. However, these methods often rely on two key assumptions: causal sufficiency and known interventional targets. Causal sufficiency assumes the absence of latent confounders, yet their presence can introduce spurious correlations. Moreover, real-world time series data usually come from heterogeneous environments, without prior knowledge of interventions. Therefore, in practice, it is difficult to distinguish intervened environments from non-intervened ones, and even harder to identify which variables or timesteps are affected. To address these challenges, we propose Invariant Granger Causality (InvarGC), which leverages cross-environment heterogeneity to mitigate the effects of latent confounding and to distinguish intervened from non-intervened environments with edge-level granularity, thereby recovering invariant causal relations. In addition, we establish the identifiability under these conditions. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the competitive performance of our approach compared to state-of-the-art methods.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) replace scalar weights with per-edge vectors of basis coefficients, thereby boosting expressivity and accuracy but at the same time resulting in a multiplicative increase in parameters and memory. We propose MetaCluster, a framework that makes KANs highly compressible without sacrificing accuracy. Specifically, a lightweight meta-learner, trained jointly with the KAN, is used to map low-dimensional embedding to coefficient vectors, shaping them to lie on a low-dimensional manifold that is amenable to clustering. We then run K-means in coefficient space and replace per-edge vectors with shared centroids. Afterwards, the meta-learner can be discarded, and a brief fine-tuning of the centroid codebook recovers any residual accuracy loss. The resulting model stores only a small codebook and per-edge indices, exploiting the vector nature of KAN parameters to amortize storage across multiple coefficients. On MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100, across standard KANs and ConvKANs using multiple basis functions, MetaCluster achieves a reduction of up to 80$\times$ in parameter storage, with no loss in accuracy. Code will be released upon publication.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Curriculum learning (CL) - ordering training data from easy to hard - has become a popular strategy for improving reasoning in large language models (LLMs). Yet prior work employs disparate difficulty metrics and training setups, leaving open fundamental questions: When does curriculum help? Which direction - forward or reverse - is better? And does the answer depend on what we measure? We address these questions through a unified offline evaluation framework that decomposes curriculum difficulty into five complementary dimensions: Problem Difficulty, Model Surprisal, Confidence Margin, Predictive Uncertainty, and Decision Variability. Through controlled post-training experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks with Llama3.1-8B, Mistral-7B, and Gemma3-4B, we find that (i) no curriculum strategy dominates universally - the relative effectiveness of forward versus reverse CL depends jointly on model capability and task complexity; (ii) even within a single metric, samples at different difficulty levels produce distinct gains depending on task demands; and (iii) task-aligned curricula focus on shaping the model's final representations and generalization, whereas inner-state curricula modulate internal states such as confidence and uncertainty. Our findings challenge the notion of a universal curriculum strategy and offer actionable guidance across model and task regimes, with some metrics indicating that prioritizing decision-uncertain samples can further enhance learning outcomes.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Transferring the optimal learning rate from small to large neural networks can enable efficient training at scales where hyperparameter tuning is otherwise prohibitively expensive. To this end, the Maximal Update Parameterization (muP) proposes a learning rate scaling designed to keep the update dynamics of internal representations stable across different model widths. However, the scaling rules of muP rely on strong assumptions, particularly about the geometric alignment of a layer's inputs with both its weights and gradient updates. In this large-scale empirical investigation, we show that these assumptions hold only briefly at the start of training in the practical setups where learning rate transfer is most valuable, such as LLM training. For the remainder of training it is weight decay rather than muP that correctly stabilizes the update dynamics of internal representations across widths, facilitating learning rate transfer. This suggests muP's scaling primarily acts as a form of implicit learning rate warmup, allowing us to largely replace it with modified warmup schedules. Together these findings fundamentally challenge prevailing beliefs about learning rate transfer and can explain empirical practice such as why muP requires the independent weight decay variant for successful transfer.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Federated Learning (FL) enables decentralized model training across multiple clients without exposing local data, but its distributed feature makes it vulnerable to backdoor attacks. Despite early FL backdoor attacks modifying entire models, recent studies have explored the concept of backdoor-critical (BC) layers, which poison the chosen influential layers to maintain stealthiness while achieving high effectiveness. However, existing BC layers approaches rely on rule-based selection without consideration of the interrelations between layers, making them ineffective and prone to detection by advanced defenses. In this paper, we propose POLAR (POlicy-based LAyerwise Reinforcement learning), the first pipeline to creatively adopt RL to solve the BC layer selection problem in layer-wise backdoor attack. Different from other commonly used RL paradigm, POLAR is lightweight with Bernoulli sampling. POLAR dynamically learns an attack strategy, optimizing layer selection using policy gradient updates based on backdoor success rate (BSR) improvements. To ensure stealthiness, we introduce a regularization constraint that limits the number of modified layers by penalizing large attack footprints. Extensive experiments demonstrate that POLAR outperforms the latest attack methods by up to 40% against six state-of-the-art (SOTA) defenses.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Decision trees are prized for their interpretability and strong performance on tabular data. Yet, their reliance on simple axis-aligned linear splits often forces deep, complex structures to capture non-linear feature effects, undermining human comprehension of the constructed tree. To address this limitation, we propose a novel generalization of a decision tree, the Shape Generalized Tree (SGT), in which each internal node applies a learnable axis-aligned shape function to a single feature, enabling rich, non-linear partitioning in one split. As users can easily visualize each node's shape function, SGTs are inherently interpretable and provide intuitive, visual explanations of the model's decision mechanisms. To learn SGTs from data, we propose ShapeCART, an efficient induction algorithm for SGTs. We further extend the SGT framework to bivariate shape functions (S$^2$GT) and multi-way trees (SGT$_K$), and present Shape$^2$CART and ShapeCART$_K$, extensions to ShapeCART for learning S$^2$GTs and SGT$_K$s, respectively. Experiments on various datasets show that SGTs achieve superior performance with reduced model size compared to traditional axis-aligned linear trees.

  Current medical practice depends on standardized treatment frameworks and empirical methodologies that neglect individual patient variations, leading to suboptimal health outcomes. We develop a comprehensive system integrating Large Language Models (LLMs), Conditional Tabular Generative Adversarial Networks (CTGAN), T-learner counterfactual models, and contextual bandit approaches to provide customized, data-informed clinical recommendations. The approach utilizes LLMs to process unstructured medical narratives into structured datasets (93.2% accuracy), uses CTGANs to produce realistic synthetic patient data (55% accuracy via two-sample verification), deploys T-learners to forecast patient-specific treatment responses (84.3% accuracy), and integrates prior-informed contextual bandits to enhance online therapeutic selection by effectively balancing exploration of new possibilities with exploitation of existing knowledge. Testing on stage III colon cancer datasets revealed that our KernelUCB approach obtained 0.60-0.61 average reward scores across 5,000 rounds, exceeding other reference methods.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Nonlinear PDE solvers require fine space-time discretizations and local linearizations, leading to high memory cost and slow runtimes. Neural operators such as FNOs and DeepONets offer fast single-shot inference by learning function-to-function mappings and truncating high-frequency components, but they suffer from poor out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization, often failing on inputs outside the training distribution. We propose an adversarial teacher-student distillation framework in which a differentiable numerical solver supervises a compact neural operator while a PGD-style active sampling loop searches for worst-case inputs under smoothness and energy constraints to expand the training set. Using differentiable spectral solvers enables gradient-based adversarial search and stabilizes sample mining. Experiments on Burgers and Navier-Stokes systems demonstrate that adversarial distillation substantially improves OOD robustness while preserving the low parameter cost and fast inference of neural operators.

  Existing parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods primarily fall into two categories: addition-based and selective in-situ adaptation. The former, such as LoRA, introduce additional modules to adapt the model to downstream tasks, offering strong memory efficiency. However, their representational capacity is often limited, making them less suitable for fine-grained adaptation. In contrast, the latter directly fine-tunes a carefully chosen subset of the original model parameters, allowing for more precise and effective adaptation, but at the cost of significantly increased memory consumption. To reconcile this trade-off, we propose NeuroAda, a novel PEFT method that enables fine-grained model finetuning while maintaining high memory efficiency. Our approach first identifies important parameters (i.e., connections within the network) as in selective adaptation, and then introduces bypass connections for these selected parameters. During finetuning, only the bypass connections are updated, leaving the original model parameters frozen. Empirical results on 23+ tasks spanning both natural language generation and understanding demonstrate that NeuroAda achieves state-of-the-art performance with as little as $\leq \textbf{0.02}\%$ trainable parameters, while reducing CUDA memory usage by up to 60%. We release our code here:this https URL.

  _Shuofeng Zhang, Ard Louis_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  A wide variety of generalization measures have been applied to deep neural networks (DNNs). Although obtaining tight bounds remains challenging, such measures are often assumed to reproduce qualitative generalization trends. In this position paper, we argue that many post-mortem generalization measures -- those computed on trained networks -- are \textbf{fragile}: small training modifications that barely affect the underlying DNN can substantially change a measure's value, trend, or scaling behavior. For example, minor hyperparameter changes, such as learning rate adjustments or switching between SGD variants can reverse the slope of a learning curve in widely used generalization measures like the path norm. We also identify subtler forms of fragility. For instance, the PAC-Bayes origin measure is regarded as one of the most reliable, and is indeed less sensitive to hyperparameter tweaks than many other measures. However, it completely fails to capture differences in data complexity across learning curves. This data fragility contrasts with the function-based marginal-likelihood PAC-Bayes bound, which does capture differences in data-complexity, including scaling behavior, in learning curves, but which is not a post-mortem measure. Beyond demonstrating that many bounds -- such as path, spectral and Frobenius norms, flatness proxies, and deterministic PAC-Bayes surrogates -- are fragile, this position paper also argues that developers of new measures should explicitly audit them for fragility.

  _Zhiheng Xi, Xin Guo, Yang Nan, Enyu Zhou, Junrui Shen, Wenxiang Chen, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reinforcement learning (RL) has recently become the core paradigm for aligning and strengthening large language models (LLMs). Yet, applying RL in off-policy settings--where stale data from past policies are used for training--improves sample efficiency, but remains challenging: policy entropy declines sharply, optimization often becomes unstable and may even collapse. Through theoretical and empirical analysis, we identify two key insights: (i) an imbalance in optimization, where negative-advantage samples dominate the policy gradient, suppressing useful behaviors and risking gradient explosions; and (ii) the derived Entropy-Clip Rule, which reveals that the fixed clipping mechanism in PPO-like objectives systematically blocks entropy-increasing updates, thereby driving the policy toward over-exploitation at the expense of exploration. Building on these insights, we propose BAlanced Policy Optimization with Adaptive Clipping (BAPO), a simple yet effective method that dynamically adjusts clipping bounds to adaptively re-balance positive and negative contributions, preserve entropy, and stabilize RL optimization. Across diverse off-policy scenarios--including sample replay and partial rollout--BAPO achieves fast, stable, and data-efficient training. On AIME 2024 and AIME 2025 benchmarks, our 7B BAPO model surpasses open-source counterparts such as SkyWork-OR1-7B, while our 32B BAPO model not only achieves state-of-the-art results among models of the same scale but also outperforms leading proprietary systems like o3-mini and Gemini-2.5-Flash-Thinking.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Modeling and predicting the dynamics of complex multiscale systems remains a significant challenge due to their inherent nonlinearities and sensitivity to initial conditions, as well as limitations of traditional machine learning methods that fail to capture high frequency behaviours. To overcome these difficulties, we propose three approaches for multiscale learning. The first leverages the Partition of Unity (PU) method, integrated with neural networks, to decompose the dynamics into local components and directly predict both macro- and micro-scale behaviors. The second applies the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to extract dominant modes that explicitly separate macro- and micro-scale dynamics. Since full access to the data matrix is rarely available in practice, we further employ a Sparse High-Order SVD to reconstruct multiscale dynamics from limited measurements. Together, these approaches ensure that both coarse and fine dynamics are accurately captured, making the framework effective for real-world applications involving complex, multi-scale phenomena and adaptable to higher-dimensional systems with incomplete observations, by providing an approximation and interpretation in all time scales present in the phenomena under study.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) or verifiable rewards (RLVR), the standard paradigm for aligning LLMs or building recent SOTA reasoning models, is highly sensitive to noise from inconsistent or erroneous rewards. Yet, the interaction between such noise and widely used group-based policy optimization methods remains underexplored. We introduce a noise-robust Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and Done Right GRPO (this http URL) framework that explicitly models reward corruption as Bernoulli noise. Our method applies noise correction after estimating reward flip probabilities to debias the learning signal, yielding provably unbiased gradient estimates. Theoretical analysis shows that group-based methods inherently mitigate individual-level noise, and our correction strategy amplifies this robustness. Empirically, we observe consistent improvements across math and code tasks when applying our noise correction to standard reward model usage, with particular gains of up to 6.7 percentage points in accuracy on math tasks and 1.5 on code tasks under realistic reward model conditions. This work bridges label-noise correction from supervised learning with modern RLHF, offering both theoretical insights and a practical algorithm for noisy real-world deployment.

  The recent widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) and machine learning in general has sparked research interest in exploring the possibilities of deploying these models on smaller devices such as laptops and mobile phones. This creates a need for frameworks and approaches that are capable of taking advantage of on-device hardware. The MLX framework was created to address this need. It is a framework optimized for machine learning (ML) computations on Apple silicon devices, facilitating easier research, experimentation, and prototyping.This paper presents a performance evaluation of MLX, focusing on inference latency of transformer models. We compare the performance of different transformer architecture implementations in MLX with their Pytorch counterparts. For this research we create a framework called MLX-transformers which includes different transformer implementations in MLX and downloads the model checkpoints in pytorch and converts it to the MLX format. By leveraging the advanced architecture and capabilities of Apple Silicon, MLX-Transformers enables seamless execution of transformer models directly sourced from Hugging Face, eliminating the need for checkpoint conversion often required when porting models between frameworks.Our study benchmarks different transformer models on two Apple Silicon macbook devices against an NVIDIA CUDA GPU. Specifically, we compare the inference latency performance of models with the same parameter sizes and checkpoints. We evaluate the performance of BERT, RoBERTa, and XLM-RoBERTa models, with the intention of extending future work to include models of different modalities, thus providing a more comprehensive assessment of MLX's capabilities. The results highlight MLX's potential in enabling efficient and more accessible on-device ML applications within Apple's ecosystem.

  A reliable foundation model of functional neuroimages is critical to promote clinical applications where the performance of current AI models is significantly impeded by a limited sample size. To that end, tremendous efforts have been made to pretraining large models on extensive unlabeled fMRI data using scalable self-supervised learning. Since self-supervision is not necessarily aligned with the brain-to-outcome relationship, most foundation models are suboptimal to the downstream task, such as predicting disease outcomes. By capitalizing on rich environmental variables and demographic data along with an unprecedented amount of functional neuroimages, we form the brain modeling as a multitask learning and present a scalable model architecture for (i) multitask pretraining by tokenizing multiple brain-environment interactions (BEI) and (ii) semi-supervised finetuning by assigning pseudo-labels of pretrained BEI. We have evaluated our foundation model on a variety of applications, including sex prediction, human behavior recognition, and disease early diagnosis of Autism, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and {Schizophrenia}, where promising results indicate the great potential to facilitate current neuroimaging applications in clinical routines.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  AI inference scaling is often tuned through 1D heuristics (a fixed reasoning passes) or 2D bivariate trade-offs (e.g., performance vs. compute), which fail to consider cost and latency constraints. We introduce a 3D optimization framework that jointly calibrates accuracy, cost, and latency within a unified decision space, enabling constraints-aware inference scaling. Using Monte Carlo simulations across three representative scenarios and nine simulated large language models, we evaluate four optimization methods to address the 3D multi-objective optimization (MOO) problem. Framing inference scaling in MOO shapes a feasible space that 1D and 2D optimizations fail to capture, enabling environmentadaptive selection of the inference scaling k. Results show that knee-point optimization achieves the best balance, while accuracy-maximization remains favorable when precision is prioritized. The framework establishes a theoretical foundation for deployment-aware inference scaling across diverse operational contexts.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Learning disentangled representations in sequential data is a key goal in deep learning, with broad applications in vision, audio, and time series. While real-world data involves multiple interacting semantic factors over time, prior work has mostly focused on simpler two-factor static and dynamic settings, primarily because such settings make data collection easier, thereby overlooking the inherently multi-factor nature of real-world data. We introduce the first standardized benchmark for evaluating multi-factor sequential disentanglement across six diverse datasets spanning video, audio, and time series. Our benchmark includes modular tools for dataset integration, model development, and evaluation metrics tailored to multi-factor analysis. We additionally propose a post-hoc Latent Exploration Stage to automatically align latent dimensions with semantic factors, and introduce a Koopman-inspired model that achieves state-of-the-art results. Moreover, we show that Vision-Language Models can automate dataset annotation and serve as zero-shot disentanglement evaluators, removing the need for manual labels and human intervention. Together, these contributions provide a robust and scalable foundation for advancing multi-factor sequential disentanglement.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promising capabilities for tackling complex reasoning tasks, including optimization problems. However, existing methods either rely on prompt engineering, which leads to poor generalization across problem types, or require costly supervised training. We introduce SolverLLM, a training-free framework that leverages test-time scaling to solve diverse optimization problems. Rather than solving directly, SolverLLM generates mathematical formulations and translates them into solver-ready code, guided by a novel Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) strategy. To enhance the search process, we modify classical MCTS with (1) dynamic expansion for adaptive formulation generation, (2) prompt backpropagation to guide exploration via outcome-driven feedback, and (3) uncertainty backpropagation to incorporate reward reliability into decision-making. Experiments on six standard benchmark datasets demonstrate that SolverLLM outperforms both prompt-based and learning-based baselines, achieving strong generalization without additional training.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Masked graph modeling (MGM) is a promising approach for molecular representation learning (MRL).However, extending the success of re-mask decoding from 2D to 3D MGM is non-trivial, primarily due to two conflicting challenges: avoiding 2D structure leakage to the decoder, while still providing sufficient 2D context for reconstructing re-masked atoms. To address these challenges, we propose 3D-GSRD: a 3D Molecular Graph Auto-Encoder with Selective Re-mask Decoding. The core innovation of 3D-GSRD lies in its Selective Re-mask Decoding(SRD), which re-masks only 3D-relevant information from encoder representations while preserving the 2D graph structures. This SRD is synergistically integrated with a 3D Relational-Transformer(3D-ReTrans) encoder alongside a structure-independent decoder. We analyze that SRD, combined with the structure-independent decoder, enhances the encoder's role in MRL. Extensive experiments show that 3D-GSRD achieves strong downstream performance, setting a new state-of-the-art on 7 out of 8 targets in the widely used MD17 molecular property prediction benchmark.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reinforcement learning (RL) has recently proven effective at scaling chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning in large language models on tasks with verifiable answers. However, extending RL to more general non-verifiable tasks, typically in the format of human preference pairs, remains both challenging and underexplored. In this work, we propose Dual-Weighted Reinforcement Learning (DWRL), a new framework for preference modeling that integrates CoT reasoning with the Bradley-Terry (BT) model via a dual-weighted RL objective that preserves preference-modeling inductive bias. DWRL approximates the maximum-likelihood objective of the BT model with two complementary weights: an instance-wise misalignment weight, which emphasizes under-trained pairs misaligned with human preference, and a group-wise (self-normalized) conditional preference score, which promotes promising thoughts. In this paper, we apply DWRL to preference modeling by training generative preference models (GPMs) to first generate a thought and then predict the human preference score. Across multiple benchmarks and model scales (Llama3 and Qwen2.5), DWRL consistently outperforms both GPM baselines and scalar models, while producing coherent, interpretable thoughts. In summary, our results position DWRL as a general framework for reasoning-enhanced preference learning beyond verifiable tasks.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Widespread LLM adoption has introduced characteristic repetitive phraseology, termed "slop," which degrades output quality and makes AI-generated text immediately recognizable. We present Antislop, a comprehensive framework providing tools to both detect and eliminate these overused patterns. Our approach combines three innovations: (1) The Antislop Sampler, which uses backtracking to suppress unwanted strings at inference time without destroying vocabulary; (2) An automated pipeline that profiles model-specific slop against human baselines and generates training data; (3) Final Token Preference Optimization (FTPO), a novel fine-tuning method that operates on individual tokens, surgically adjusting logits wherever a banned pattern has appeared in an inference trace. We demonstrate that some slop patterns appear over 1,000x more frequently in LLM output than human text. The Antislop Sampler successfully suppresses 8,000+ patterns while maintaining quality, whereas token banning becomes unusable at just 2,000. Most importantly, FTPO achieves 90% slop reduction while maintaining or improving performance in cross-domain evals including GSM8K, MMLU, and creative writing tasks. In contrast, DPO suffers significant degradation in writing quality and lexical diversity despite achieving weaker suppression. We release all code and results under MIT license:this https URL.

  _Shikuang Deng, Jiayuan Zhang, Yuhang Wu, Ting Chen, Shi Gu_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Hebbian learning is a biological principle that intuitively describes how neurons adapt their connections through repeated stimuli. However, when applied to machine learning, it suffers serious issues due to the unconstrained updates of the connections and the lack of accounting for feedback mediation. Such shortcomings limit its effective scaling to complex network architectures and tasks. To this end, here we introduce the Structural Projection Hebbian Representation (SPHeRe), a novel unsupervised learning method that integrates orthogonality and structural information preservation through a local auxiliary nonlinear block. The loss for structural information preservation backpropagates to the input through an auxiliary lightweight projection that conceptually serves as feedback mediation while the orthogonality constraints account for the boundedness of updating magnitude. Extensive experimental results show that SPHeRe achieves SOTA performance among unsupervised synaptic plasticity approaches on standard image classification benchmarks, including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet. Furthermore, the method exhibits strong effectiveness in continual learning and transfer learning scenarios, and image reconstruction tasks show the robustness and generalizability of the extracted features. This work demonstrates the competitiveness and potential of Hebbian unsupervised learning rules within modern deep learning frameworks, demonstrating the possibility of efficient and biologically inspired learning algorithms without the strong dependence on strict backpropagation.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The growing integration of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) models into high-stakes domains such as healthcare and scientific research calls for models that are not only accurate but also interpretable. Among the existing explainable methods, counterfactual explanations offer interpretability by identifying minimal changes to inputs that would alter a model's prediction, thus providing deeper insights. However, current counterfactual generation methods suffer from critical limitations, including gradient vanishing, discontinuous latent spaces, and an overreliance on the alignment between learned and true decision boundaries. To overcome these limitations, we propose LeapFactual, a novel counterfactual explanation algorithm based on conditional flow matching. LeapFactual generates reliable and informative counterfactuals, even when true and learned decision boundaries diverge. Following a model-agnostic approach, LeapFactual is not limited to models with differentiable loss functions. It can even handle human-in-the-loop systems, expanding the scope of counterfactual explanations to domains that require the participation of human annotators, such as citizen science. We provide extensive experiments on benchmark and real-world datasets showing that LeapFactual generates accurate and in-distribution counterfactual explanations that offer actionable insights. We observe, for instance, that our reliable counterfactual samples with labels aligning to ground truth can be beneficially used as new training data to enhance the model. The proposed method is broadly applicable and enhances both scientific knowledge discovery and non-expert interpretability.

  _Priyobrata Mondal, Faizanuddin Ansari, Swagatam Das_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Class imbalance, where certain classes have insufficient data, poses a critical challenge for robust classification, often biasing models toward majority classes. Distribution calibration offers a promising avenue to address this by estimating more accurate class distributions. In this work, we propose Rebalancing with Calibrated Sub-classes (RCS) - a novel distribution calibration framework for robust imbalanced classification. RCS aims to fuse statistical information from the majority and intermediate class distributions via a weighted mixture of Gaussian components to estimate minority class parameters more accurately. An encoder-decoder network is trained to preserve structural relationships in imbalanced datasets and prevent feature disentanglement. Post-training, encoder-extracted feature vectors are leveraged to generate synthetic samples guided by the calibrated distributions. This fusion-based calibration effectively mitigates overgeneralization by incorporating neighborhood distribution information rather than relying solely on majority-class statistics. Extensive experiments on diverse image, text, and tabular datasets demonstrate that RCS consistently outperforms several baseline and state-of-the-art methods, highlighting its effectiveness and broad applicability in addressing real-world imbalanced classification challenges.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Graph few-shot learning has attracted increasing attention due to its ability to rapidly adapt models to new tasks with only limited labeled nodes. Despite the remarkable progress made by existing graph few-shot learning methods, several key limitations remain. First, most current approaches rely on predefined and unified graph filters (e.g., low-pass or high-pass filters) to globally enhance or suppress node frequency signals. Such fixed spectral operations fail to account for the heterogeneity of local topological structures inherent in real-world graphs. Moreover, these methods often assume that the support and query sets are drawn from the same distribution. However, under few-shot conditions, the limited labeled data in the support set may not sufficiently capture the complex distribution of the query set, leading to suboptimal generalization. To address these challenges, we propose GRACE, a novel Graph few-shot leaRning framework that integrates Adaptive spectrum experts with Cross-sEt distribution calibration techniques. Theoretically, the proposed approach enhances model generalization by adapting to both local structural variations and cross-set distribution calibration. Empirically, GRACE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across a wide range of experimental settings. Our code can be found here.

  Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs) have achieved strong generative performance, yet their inductive biases remain largely implicit. In this work, we aim to build inductive biases into the training and sampling of diffusion models to better accommodate the target distribution of the data to model. We introduce an anisotropic noise operator that shapes these biases by replacing the isotropic forward covariance with a structured, frequency-diagonal covariance. This operator unifies band-pass masks and power-law weightings, allowing us to emphasize or suppress designated frequency bands, while keeping the forward process Gaussian. We refer to this as spectrally anisotropic Gaussian diffusion (SAGD). In this work, we derive the score relation for anisotropic covariances and show that, under full support, the learned score converges to the true data score as $t\!\to\!0$, while anisotropy reshapes the probability-flow path from noise to data. Empirically, we show the induced anisotropy outperforms standard diffusion across several vision datasets, and enables selective omission: learning while ignoring known corruptions confined to specific bands. Together, these results demonstrate that carefully designed anisotropic forward noise provides a simple, yet principled, handle to tailor inductive bias in DPMs.

  Transportation remains a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, highlighting the urgency of transitioning toward sustainable alternatives such as electric vehicles (EVs). Yet, uneven spatial distribution and irregular utilization of charging infrastructure create challenges for both power grid stability and investment planning. This study introduces TW-GCN, a spatio-temporal forecasting framework that combines Graph Convolutional Networks with temporal architectures to predict EV charging demand in Tennessee, United States (U.S.). We utilize real-world traffic flows, weather conditions, and proprietary data provided by one of the largest EV infrastructure company in the U.S. to capture both spatial dependencies and temporal dynamics. Extensive experiments across varying lag horizons, clustering strategies, and sequence lengths reveal that mid-horizon (3-hour) forecasts achieve the best balance between responsiveness and stability, with 1DCNN consistently outperforming other temporal models. Regional analysis shows disparities in predictive accuracy across East, Middle, and West Tennessee, reflecting how station density, population, and local demand variability shape model performance. The proposed TW-GCN framework advances the integration of data-driven intelligence into EV infrastructure planning, supporting both sustainable mobility transitions and resilient grid management.

  Predicting precipitation maps is a highly complex spatiotemporal modeling task, critical for mitigating the impacts of extreme weather events. Short-term precipitation forecasting, or nowcasting, requires models that are not only accurate but also computationally efficient for real-time applications. Current methods, such as token-based autoregressive models, often suffer from flawed inductive biases and slow inference, while diffusion models can be computationally intensive. To address these limitations, we introduce BlockGPT, a generative autoregressive transformer using batched tokenization (Block) method that predicts full two-dimensional fields (frames) at each time step. Conceived as a model-agnostic paradigm for video prediction, BlockGPT factorizes space-time by using self-attention within each frame and causal attention across frames; in this work, we instantiate it for precipitation nowcasting. We evaluate BlockGPT on two precipitation datasets, viz. KNMI (Netherlands) and SEVIR (U.S.), comparing it to state-of-the-art baselines including token-based (NowcastingGPT) and diffusion-based (DiffCast+Phydnet) models. The results show that BlockGPT achieves superior accuracy, event localization as measured by categorical metrics, and inference speeds up to 31x faster than comparable baselines.

  Accurately simulating physics is crucial across scientific domains, with applications spanning from robotics to materials science. While traditional mesh-based simulations are precise, they are often computationally expensive and require knowledge of physical parameters, such as material properties. In contrast, data-driven approaches like Graph Network Simulators (GNSs) offer faster inference but suffer from two key limitations: Firstly, they must be retrained from scratch for even minor variations in physical parameters, and secondly they require labor-intensive data collection for each new parameter setting. This is inefficient, as simulations with varying parameters often share a common underlying latent structure. In this work, we address these challenges by learning this shared structure through meta-learning, enabling fast adaptation to new physical parameters without retraining. To this end, we propose a novel architecture that generates a latent representation by encoding graph trajectories using conditional neural processes (CNPs). To mitigate error accumulation over time, we combine CNPs with a novel neural operator architecture. We validate our approach, Meta Neural Graph Operator (MaNGO), on several dynamics prediction tasks with varying material properties, demonstrating superior performance over existing GNS methods. Notably, MaNGO achieves accuracy on unseen material properties close to that of an oracle model.

  When used in high-stakes settings, AI systems are expected to produce decisions that are transparent, interpretable, and auditable, a requirement increasingly expected by regulations. Decision trees such as CART provide clear and verifiable rules, but they are restricted to structured tabular data and cannot operate directly on unstructured inputs such as text. In practice, large language models (LLMs) are widely used for such data, yet prompting strategies such as chain-of-thought or prompt optimization still rely on free-form reasoning, limiting their ability to ensure trustworthy behaviors. We present the Agentic Classification Tree (ACT), which extends decision-tree methodology to unstructured inputs by formulating each split as a natural-language question, refined through impurity-based evaluation and LLM feedback via TextGrad. Experiments on text benchmarks show that ACT matches or surpasses prompting-based baselines while producing transparent and interpretable decision paths.

  Signal Temporal Logic (STL) inference seeks to extract human-interpretable rules from time-series data, but existing methods lack formal confidence guarantees for the inferred rules. Conformal prediction (CP) is a technique that can provide statistical correctness guarantees, but is typically applied as a post-training wrapper without improving model learning. Instead, we introduce an end-to-end differentiable CP framework for STL inference that enhances both reliability and interpretability of the resulting formulas. We introduce a robustness-based nonconformity score, embed a smooth CP layer directly into training, and employ a new loss function that simultaneously optimizes inference accuracy and CP prediction sets with a single term. Following training, an exact CP procedure delivers statistical guarantees for the learned STL formulas. Experiments on benchmark time-series tasks show that our approach reduces uncertainty in predictions (i.e., it achieves high coverage while reducing prediction set size), and improves accuracy (i.e., the number of misclassifications when using a fixed threshold) over state-of-the-art baselines.

  _Deokjae Lee, Hyun Oh Song_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We study weight-only post-training quantization (PTQ), which quantizes the weights of a large language model (LLM) without retraining, using little or no calibration data. Weight-only PTQ is crucial for reducing the memory footprint and latency of LLM inference, especially in memory-bound, small-batch inference scenarios, such as personalized inference on edge devices. Despite its importance, irregular weight distributions with heavy-tailed outliers in LLMs complicate quantization, recently motivating rotation-based methods that transform weights into near-Gaussian distributions, which are more regular with fewer outliers, thereby reducing quantization error. In this work, we first derive the information-theoretically optimal bit allocation for Gaussianized weights under given bit budgets, revealing that fine-grained fractional-bit quantizers approaching the Gaussian distortion-rate bound are essential to achieve near-optimal quantization performance. To bridge this theoretical insight and practical implementation, we introduce Q-Palette, a versatile collection of fractional-bit quantizers that range from trellis-coded quantizers offering near-optimal distortion to simpler vector and scalar quantizers optimized for faster inference, all efficiently implemented with optimized CUDA kernels across various bitwidths. Furthermore, leveraging Q-Palette as a foundational component, we propose a novel mixed-scheme quantization framework, jointly optimizing quantizer choices and layer fusion decisions given resource constraints.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Conformal prediction has been explored as a general and efficient way to provide uncertainty quantification for time series. However, current methods struggle to handle time series data with change points - sudden shifts in the underlying data-generating process. In this paper, we propose a novel Conformal Prediction for Time-series with Change points (CPTC) algorithm, addressing this gap by integrating a model to predict the underlying state with online conformal prediction to model uncertainties in non-stationary time series. We prove CPTC's validity and improved adaptivity in the time series setting under minimum assumptions, and demonstrate CPTC's practical effectiveness on 6 synthetic and real-world datasets, showing improved validity and adaptivity compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

  _Niklas Kemper, Tom Wollschl√§ger, Stephan G√ºnnemann_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Expressivity theory, characterizing which graphs a GNN can distinguish, has become the predominant framework for analyzing GNNs, with new models striving for higher expressivity. However, we argue that this focus is misguided: First, higher expressivity is not necessary for most real-world tasks as these tasks rarely require expressivity beyond the basic WL test. Second, expressivity theory's binary characterization and idealized assumptions fail to reflect GNNs' practical capabilities. To overcome these limitations, we propose Message Passing Complexity (MPC): a continuous measure that quantifies the difficulty for a GNN architecture to solve a given task through message passing. MPC captures practical limitations like over-squashing while preserving the theoretical impossibility results from expressivity theory, effectively narrowing the gap between theory and practice. Through extensive validation on fundamental GNN tasks, we show that MPC's theoretical predictions correlate with empirical performance, successfully explaining architectural successes and failures. Thereby, MPC advances beyond expressivity theory to provide a more powerful and nuanced framework for understanding and improving GNN architectures.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have underscored the potential of Reinforcement Learning (RL) to facilitate the emergence of reasoning capabilities. Despite the encouraging results, a fundamental dilemma persists as RL improvement relies on learning from high-quality samples, yet the exploration for such samples remains bounded by the inherent limitations of LLMs. This, in effect, creates an undesirable cycle in which what cannot be explored cannot be learned. In this work, we propose Rubric-Scaffolded Reinforcement Learning (RuscaRL), a novel instructional scaffolding framework designed to break the exploration bottleneck for general LLM reasoning. Specifically, RuscaRL introduces checklist-style rubrics as (1) explicit scaffolding for exploration during rollout generation, where different rubrics are provided as external guidance within task instructions to steer diverse high-quality responses. This guidance is gradually decayed over time, encouraging the model to internalize the underlying reasoning patterns; (2) verifiable rewards for exploitation during model training, where we can obtain robust LLM-as-a-Judge scores using rubrics as references, enabling effective RL on general reasoning tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed RuscaRL across various benchmarks, effectively expanding reasoning boundaries under the Best-of-N evaluation. Notably, RuscaRL significantly boosts Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct from 23.6 to 50.3 on HealthBench-500, surpassing GPT-4.1. Furthermore, our fine-tuned variant on Qwen3-30B-A3B-Instruct achieves 61.1 on HealthBench-500, outperforming leading LLMs including OpenAI-o3. Our code is available atthis https URL.

  _Maciej Mozolewski, Szymon Bobek, Grzegorz J. Nalepa_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Explaining machine learning (ML) models for time series (TS) classification remains challenging due to the difficulty of interpreting raw time series and the high dimensionality of the input space. We introduce PHAR-Post-hoc Attribution Rules - a unified framework that transforms numeric feature attributions from post-hoc, instance-wise explainers (e.g., LIME, SHAP) into structured, human-readable rules. These rules define human-readable intervals that indicate where and when decision-relevant segments occur and can enhance model transparency by localizing threshold-based conditions on the raw series. PHAR performs comparably to native rule-based methods, such as Anchor, while scaling more efficiently to long TS sequences and achieving broader instance coverage. A dedicated rule fusion step consolidates rule sets using strategies like weighted selection and lasso-based refinement, balancing key quality metrics: coverage, confidence, and simplicity. This fusion ensures each instance receives a concise and unambiguous rule, improving both explanation fidelity and consistency. We further introduce visualization techniques to illustrate specificity-generalization trade-offs in the derived rules. PHAR resolves conflicting and overlapping explanations - a common effect of the Rashomon phenomenon - into coherent, domain-adaptable insights. Comprehensive experiments on UCR/UEA Time Series Classification Archive demonstrate that PHAR may improve interpretability, decision transparency, and practical applicability for TS classification tasks by providing concise, human-readable rules aligned with model predictions.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Enhancing large vision-language models (LVLMs) with visual slow-thinking reasoning is crucial for solving complex multimodal tasks. However, since LVLMs are mainly trained with vision-language alignment, it is difficult to adopt on-policy reinforcement learning (RL) to develop the slow thinking ability because the rollout space is restricted by its initial abilities. Off-policy RL offers a way to go beyond the current policy, but directly distilling trajectories from external models may cause visual hallucinations due to mismatched visual perception abilities across models. To address these issues, this paper proposes SOPHIA, a simple and scalable Semi-Off-Policy RL for vision-language slow-tHInking reAsoning. SOPHIA builds a semi-off-policy behavior model by combining on-policy visual understanding from a trainable LVLM with off-policy slow-thinking reasoning from a language model, assigns outcome-based rewards to reasoning, and propagates visual rewards backward. Then LVLM learns slow-thinking reasoning ability from the obtained reasoning trajectories using propagated rewards via off-policy RL algorithms. Extensive experiments with InternVL2.5 and InternVL3.0 with 8B and 38B sizes show the effectiveness of SOPHIA. Notably, SOPHIA improves InternVL3.0-38B by 8.50% in average, reaching state-of-the-art performance among open-source LVLMs on multiple multimodal reasoning benchmarks, and even outperforms some closed-source models (e.g., GPT-4.1) on the challenging MathVision and OlympiadBench, achieving 49.08% and 49.95% pass@1 accuracy, respectively. Analysis shows SOPHIA outperforms supervised fine-tuning and direct on-policy RL methods, offering a better policy initialization for further on-policy training.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In recent years, unlearning techniques, which are methods for inducing a model to "forget" previously learned information, have attracted attention as a way to address privacy and copyright concerns in large language models (LLMs) and large multimodal models (LMMs). While several unlearning benchmarks have been established for LLMs, a practical evaluation framework for unlearning in LMMs has been less explored. Specifically, existing unlearning benchmark for LMMs considers only scenarios in which the model is required to unlearn fine-tuned knowledge through a single unlearning operation. In this study, we introduce PULSE protocol for realistic unlearning scenarios for LMMs by introducing two critical perspectives: (i) Pre-trained knowledge Unlearning for analyzing the effect across different knowledge acquisition phases and (ii) Long-term Sustainability Evaluation to address sequential requests. We then evaluate existing unlearning methods along these dimensions. Our results reveal that, although some techniques can successfully unlearn knowledge acquired through fine-tuning, they struggle to eliminate information learned during pre-training. Moreover, methods that effectively unlearn a batch of target data in a single operation exhibit substantial performance degradation when the same data are split and unlearned sequentially.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Continuous Normalizing Flows (CNFs) enable elegant generative modeling but remain bottlenecked by slow sampling: producing a single sample requires solving a nonlinear ODE with hundreds of function evaluations. Recent approaches such as Rectified Flow and OT-CFM accelerate sampling by straightening trajectories, yet the learned dynamics remain nonlinear black boxes, limiting both efficiency and interpretability. We propose a fundamentally different perspective: globally linearizing flow dynamics via Koopman theory. By lifting Conditional Flow Matching (CFM) into a higher-dimensional Koopman space, we represent its evolution with a single linear operator. This yields two key benefits. First, sampling becomes one-step and parallelizable, computed in closed form via the matrix exponential. Second, the Koopman operator provides a spectral blueprint of generation, enabling novel interpretability through its eigenvalues and modes. We derive a practical, simulation-free training objective that enforces infinitesimal consistency with the teacher's dynamics and show that this alignment preserves fidelity along the full generative path, distinguishing our method from boundary-only distillation. Empirically, our approach achieves competitive sample quality with dramatic speedups, while uniquely enabling spectral analysis of generative flows.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Finetuning large pretrained neural networks is known to be resource-intensive, both in terms of memory and computational cost. To mitigate this, a common approach is to restrict training to a subset of the model parameters. By analyzing the relationship between gradients and weights during finetuning, we observe a notable pattern: large gradients are often associated with small-magnitude weights. This correlation is more pronounced in finetuning settings than in training from scratch. Motivated by this observation, we propose NANOADAM, which dynamically updates only the small-magnitude weights during finetuning and offers several practical advantages: first, this criterion is gradient-free -- the parameter subset can be determined without gradient computation; second, it preserves large-magnitude weights, which are likely to encode critical features learned during pretraining, thereby reducing the risk of catastrophic forgetting; thirdly, it permits the use of larger learning rates and consistently leads to better generalization performance in experiments. We demonstrate this for both NLP and vision tasks.

  Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have led to the development of thinking language models that generate extensive internal reasoning chains before producing responses. While these models achieve improved performance, controlling their reasoning processes remains challenging. This work presents a steering approach for thinking LLMs by analyzing and manipulating specific reasoning behaviors in DeepSeek-R1-Distill models. Through a systematic experiment on 500 tasks across 10 diverse categories, we identify several reasoning behaviors exhibited by thinking models, including expressing uncertainty, generating examples for hypothesis validation, and backtracking in reasoning chains. We demonstrate that these behaviors are mediated by linear directions in the model's activation space and can be controlled using steering vectors. By extracting and applying these vectors, we provide a method to modulate specific aspects of the model's reasoning process, such as its tendency to backtrack or express uncertainty. Our approach offers practical tools for steering reasoning processes in thinking models in a controlled and interpretable manner. We validate our steering method using three DeepSeek-R1-Distill models, demonstrating consistent control across different model architectures.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Directed graphs naturally model systems with asymmetric, ordered relationships, essential to applications in biology, transportation, social networks, and visual understanding. Generating such graphs enables tasks such as simulation, data augmentation and novel instance discovery; however, directed graph generation remains underexplored. We identify two key factors limiting progress in this direction: first, modeling edge directionality introduces a substantially larger dependency space, making the underlying distribution harder to learn; second, the absence of standardized benchmarks hinders rigorous evaluation. Addressing the former requires more expressive models that are sensitive to directional topologies. We propose Directo, the first generative model for directed graphs built upon the discrete flow matching framework. Our approach combines: (i) principled positional encodings tailored to asymmetric pairwise relations, (ii) a dual-attention mechanism capturing both incoming and outgoing dependencies, and (iii) a robust, discrete generative framework. To support evaluation, we introduce a benchmark suite covering synthetic and real-world datasets. It shows that our method performs strongly across diverse settings and even competes with specialized models for particular classes, such as directed acyclic graphs. Our results highlight the effectiveness and generality of our approach, establishing a solid foundation for future research in directed graph generation.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Efficiently identifying the right trajectories for training remains an open problem in GFlowNets. To address this, it is essential to prioritize exploration in regions of the state space where the reward distribution has not been sufficiently learned. This calls for uncertainty-driven exploration, in other words, the agent should be aware of what it does not know. This attribute can be measured by joint predictions, which are particularly important for combinatorial and sequential decision problems. In this research, we integrate epistemic neural networks (ENN) with the conventional architecture of GFlowNets to enable more efficient joint predictions and better uncertainty quantification, thereby improving exploration and the identification of optimal trajectories. Our proposed algorithm, ENN-GFN-Enhanced, is compared to the baseline method in GFlownets and evaluated in grid environments and structured sequence generation in various settings, demonstrating both its efficacy and efficiency.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper establishes a continuous time approximation, a piece-wise continuous differential equation, for the discrete Heavy-Ball (HB) momentum method with explicit discretization error. Investigating continuous differential equations has been a promising approach for studying the discrete optimization methods. Despite the crucial role of momentum in gradient-based optimization methods, the gap between the original discrete dynamics and the continuous time approximations due to the discretization error has not been comprehensively bridged yet. In this work, we study the HB momentum method in continuous time while putting more focus on the discretization error to provide additional theoretical tools to this area. In particular, we design a first-order piece-wise continuous differential equation, where we add a number of counter terms to account for the discretization error explicitly. As a result, we provide a continuous time model for the HB momentum method that allows the control of discretization error to arbitrary order of the step size. As an application, we leverage it to find a new implicit regularization of the directional smoothness and investigate the implicit bias of HB for diagonal linear networks, indicating how our results can be used in deep learning. Our theoretical findings are further supported by numerical experiments.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Discrete diffusion models are a new class of text generators that offer advantages such as bidirectional context use, parallelizable generation, and flexible prompting compared to autoregressive models. However, a critical limitation of discrete diffusion models is their inability to perform flexible-length or flexible-position text infilling without access to ground-truth positional data. We introduce \textbf{DDOT} (\textbf{D}iscrete \textbf{D}iffusion with \textbf{O}ptimal \textbf{T}ransport Position Coupling), the first discrete diffusion model to overcome this challenge. DDOT jointly denoises token values and token positions, employing a novel sample-level Optimal Transport (OT) coupling. This coupling preserves relative token ordering while dynamically adjusting the positions and length of infilled segments, a capability previously missing in text diffusion. Our method is orthogonal to existing discrete text diffusion methods and is compatible with various pretrained text denoisers. Extensive experiments on text infilling benchmarks such as One-Billion-Word and Yelp demonstrate that DDOT outperforms naive diffusion baselines. Furthermore, DDOT achieves performance on par with state-of-the-art non-autoregressive models and enables significant improvements in training efficiency and flexibility.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Unlearning in large language models is becoming increasingly important due to regulatory compliance, copyright protection, and privacy concerns. However, a key challenge in LLM unlearning is unintended forgetting, where the removal of specific data inadvertently impairs the utility of the model and its retention of valuable, desired information. While prior work has primarily focused on architectural innovations, the influence of data-level factors on unlearning performance remains underexplored. As a result, existing methods often suffer from degraded retention when forgetting high-impact data. To address this problem, we propose GUARD, a novel framework for Guided Unlearning And Retention via Data attribution. At its core, GUARD introduces a lightweight proxy data attribution metric tailored for LLM unlearning, which quantifies the alignment between the Forget and Retain sets while remaining computationally efficient. Building on this, we design a novel unlearning objective that assigns adaptive, nonuniform unlearning weights to samples, inversely proportional to their proxy attribution scores. Through such a reallocation of unlearning power, GUARD mitigates unintended retention loss. We also provide rigorous theoretical guarantees that GUARD significantly improves retention while maintaining forgetting metrics comparable to prior methods. Extensive experiments on the TOFU and MUSE benchmarks across multiple LLM architectures demonstrate that GUARD reduces utility sacrifice on the TOFU Retain Set by up to 194.92 percent in terms of Truth Ratio when forgetting 10 percent of the training data, and improves knowledge retention on the MUSE NEWS Retain Set by 16.20 percent, with comparable or very moderate increases in privacy loss compared to state-of-the-art methods.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this work, we study the scalability of offline reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms. In principle, a truly scalable offline RL algorithm should be able to solve any given problem, regardless of its complexity, given sufficient data, compute, and model capacity. We investigate if and how current offline RL algorithms match up to this promise on diverse, challenging, previously unsolved tasks, using datasets up to 1000x larger than typical offline RL datasets. We observe that despite scaling up data, many existing offline RL algorithms exhibit poor scaling behavior, saturating well below the maximum performance. We hypothesize that the horizon is the main cause behind the poor scaling of offline RL. We empirically verify this hypothesis through several analysis experiments, showing that long horizons indeed present a fundamental barrier to scaling up offline RL. We then show that various horizon reduction techniques substantially enhance scalability on challenging tasks. Based on our insights, we also introduce a minimal yet scalable method named SHARSA that effectively reduces the horizon. SHARSA achieves the best asymptotic performance and scaling behavior among our evaluation methods, showing that explicitly reducing the horizon unlocks the scalability of offline RL.

  Clinical decision-making routinely demands reasoning over heterogeneous data, yet existing multimodal language models (MLLMs) remain largely vision-centric and fail to generalize across clinical specialties. To bridge this gap, we introduce QoQ-Med-7B/32B, the first open generalist clinical foundation model that jointly reasons across medical images, time-series signals, and text reports. QoQ-Med is trained with Domain-aware Relative Policy Optimization (DRPO), a novel reinforcement-learning objective that hierarchically scales normalized rewards according to domain rarity and modality difficulty, mitigating performance imbalance caused by skewed clinical data distributions. Trained on 2.61 million instruction tuning pairs spanning 9 clinical domains, we show that DRPO training boosts diagnostic performance by 43% in macro-F1 on average across all visual domains as compared to other critic-free training methods like GRPO. Furthermore, with QoQ-Med trained on intensive segmentation data, it is able to highlight salient regions related to the diagnosis, with an IoU 10x higher than open models while reaching the performance of OpenAI o4-mini. To foster reproducibility and downstream research, we release (i) the full model weights, (ii) the modular training pipeline, and (iii) all intermediate reasoning traces atthis https URL.

  In this paper, we unify more than 10 existing one-step diffusion distillation approaches, such as Diff-Instruct, DMD, SIM, SiD, $f$-distill, etc, inside a theory-driven framework which we name the \textbf{\emph{Uni-Instruct}}. Uni-Instruct is motivated by our proposed diffusion expansion theory of the $f$-divergence family. Then we introduce key theories that overcome the intractability issue of the original expanded $f$-divergence, resulting in an equivalent yet tractable loss that effectively trains one-step diffusion models by minimizing the expanded $f$-divergence family. The novel unification introduced by Uni-Instruct not only offers new theoretical contributions that help understand existing approaches from a high-level perspective but also leads to state-of-the-art one-step diffusion generation performances. On the CIFAR10 generation benchmark, Uni-Instruct achieves record-breaking Frechet Inception Distance (FID) values of \textbf{\emph{1.46}} for unconditional generation and \textbf{\emph{1.38}} for conditional generation. On the ImageNet-$64\times 64$ generation benchmark, Uni-Instruct achieves a new SoTA one-step generation FID of \textbf{\emph{1.02}}, which outperforms its 79-step teacher diffusion with a significant improvement margin of 1.33 (1.02 vs 2.35). We also apply Uni-Instruct on broader tasks like text-to-3D generation. For text-to-3D generation, Uni-Instruct gives decent results, which slightly outperforms previous methods, such as SDS and VSD, in terms of both generation quality and diversity. Both the solid theoretical and empirical contributions of Uni-Instruct will potentially help future studies on one-step diffusion distillation and knowledge transferring of diffusion models.

  Recent advancements in AI agents have demonstrated their growing potential to drive and support scientific discovery. In this work, we introduce MLR-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating AI agents on open-ended machine learning research. MLR-Bench includes three key components: (1) 201 research tasks sourced from NeurIPS, ICLR, and ICML workshops covering diverse ML topics; (2) MLR-Judge, an automated evaluation framework combining LLM-based reviewers with carefully designed review rubrics to assess research quality; and (3) MLR-Agent, a modular agent scaffold capable of completing research tasks through four stages: idea generation, proposal formulation, experimentation, and paper writing. Our framework supports both stepwise assessment across these distinct research stages, and end-to-end evaluation of the final research paper. We then use MLR-Bench to evaluate six frontier LLMs and an advanced coding agent, finding that while LLMs are effective at generating coherent ideas and well-structured papers, current coding agents frequently (e.g., in 80% of the cases) produce fabricated or invalidated experimental results--posing a major barrier to scientific reliability. We validate MLR-Judge through human evaluation, showing high agreement with expert reviewers, supporting its potential as a scalable tool for research evaluation. We open-source MLR-Bench to help the community benchmark, diagnose, and improve AI research agents toward trustworthy and transparent scientific discovery.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) has demonstrated strong zero-shot performance across diverse downstream text-image tasks. Existing CLIP methods typically optimize a contrastive objective using negative samples drawn from each minibatch. To achieve robust representation learning, these methods require extremely large batch sizes and escalate computational demands to hundreds or even thousands of GPUs. Prior approaches to mitigate this issue often compromise downstream performance, prolong training duration, or face scalability challenges with very large datasets. To overcome these limitations, we propose AmorLIP, an efficient CLIP pretraining framework that amortizes expensive computations involved in contrastive learning through lightweight neural networks, which substantially improves training efficiency and performance. Leveraging insights from a spectral factorization of energy-based models, we introduce novel amortization objectives along with practical techniques to improve training stability. Extensive experiments across 38 downstream tasks demonstrate the superior zero-shot classification and retrieval capabilities of AmorLIP, consistently outperforming standard CLIP baselines with substantial relative improvements of up to 12.24%.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Masked diffusion models (MDM) are powerful generative models for discrete data that generate samples by progressively unmasking tokens in a sequence. Each token can take one of two states: masked or unmasked. We observe that token sequences often remain unchanged between consecutive sampling steps; consequently, the model repeatedly processes identical inputs, leading to redundant computation. To address this inefficiency, we propose the Partial masking scheme (Prime), which augments MDM by allowing tokens to take intermediate states interpolated between the masked and unmasked states. This design enables the model to make predictions based on partially observed token information, and facilitates a fine-grained denoising process. We derive a variational training objective and introduce a simple architectural design to accommodate intermediate-state inputs. Our method demonstrates superior performance across a diverse set of generative modeling tasks. On text data, it achieves a perplexity of 15.36 on OpenWebText, outperforming previous MDM (21.52), autoregressive models (17.54), and their hybrid variants (17.58), without relying on an autoregressive formulation. On image data, it attains competitive FID scores of 3.26 on CIFAR-10 and 6.98 on ImageNet-32, comparable to leading continuous generative models.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Concept bottleneck models (CBMs) ensure interpretability by decomposing predictions into human interpretable concepts. Yet the annotations used for training CBMs that enable this transparency are often noisy, and the impact of such corruption is not well understood. In this study, we present the first systematic study of noise in CBMs and show that even moderate corruption simultaneously impairs prediction performance, interpretability, and the intervention effectiveness. Our analysis identifies a susceptible subset of concepts whose accuracy declines far more than the average gap between noisy and clean supervision and whose corruption accounts for most performance loss. To mitigate this vulnerability we propose a two-stage framework. During training, sharpness-aware minimization stabilizes the learning of noise-sensitive concepts. During inference, where clean labels are unavailable, we rank concepts by predictive entropy and correct only the most uncertain ones, using uncertainty as a proxy for susceptibility. Theoretical analysis and extensive ablations elucidate why sharpness-aware training confers robustness and why uncertainty reliably identifies susceptible concepts, providing a principled basis that preserves both interpretability and resilience in the presence of noise.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Continuous time systems are often modeled using discrete time dynamics but this requires a small simulation step to maintain accuracy. In turn, this requires a large planning horizon which leads to computationally demanding planning problems and reduced performance. Previous work in model-free reinforcement learning has partially addressed this issue using action repeats where a policy is learned to determine a discrete action duration. Instead we propose to control the continuous decision timescale directly by using temporally-extended actions and letting the planner treat the duration of the action as an additional optimization variable along with the standard action variables. This additional structure has multiple advantages. It speeds up simulation time of trajectories and, importantly, it allows for deep horizon search in terms of primitive actions while using a shallow search depth in the planner. In addition, in the model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) setting, it reduces compounding errors from model learning and improves training time for models. We show that this idea is effective and that the range for action durations can be automatically selected using a multi-armed bandit formulation and integrated into the MBRL framework. An extensive experimental evaluation both in planning and in MBRL, shows that our approach yields faster planning, better solutions, and that it enables solutions to problems that are not solved in the standard formulation.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Model fusion combines multiple Large Language Models (LLMs) with different strengths into a more powerful, integrated model through lightweight training methods. Existing works on model fusion focus primarily on supervised fine-tuning (SFT), leaving preference alignment (PA) --a critical phase for enhancing LLM performance--largely unexplored. The current few fusion methods on PA phase, like WRPO, simplify the process by utilizing only response outputs from source models while discarding their probability information. To address this limitation, we propose InfiFPO, a preference optimization method for implicit model fusion. InfiFPO replaces the reference model in Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) with a fused source model that synthesizes multi-source probabilities at the sequence level, circumventing complex vocabulary alignment challenges in previous works and meanwhile maintaining the probability information. By introducing probability clipping and max-margin fusion strategies, InfiFPO enables the pivot model to align with human preferences while effectively distilling knowledge from source models. Comprehensive experiments on 11 widely-used benchmarks demonstrate that InfiFPO consistently outperforms existing model fusion and preference optimization methods. When using Phi-4 as the pivot model, InfiFPO improve its average performance from 79.95 to 83.33 on 11 benchmarks, significantly improving its capabilities in mathematics, coding, and reasoning tasks.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Continual model merging integrates independently fine-tuned models sequentially without access to the original training data, offering a scalable and efficient solution for continual learning. However, existing methods face two critical challenges: parameter interference among tasks, which leads to catastrophic forgetting, and limited adaptability to evolving test distributions. To address these issues, we introduce the task of Test-Time Continual Model Merging (TTCMM), which leverages a small set of unlabeled test samples during inference to alleviate parameter conflicts and handle distribution shifts. We propose MINGLE, a novel framework for TTCMM. MINGLE employs a mixture-of-experts architecture with parameter-efficient, low-rank experts, which enhances adaptability to evolving test distributions while dynamically merging models to mitigate conflicts. To further reduce forgetting, we propose Null-Space Constrained Gating, which restricts gating updates to subspaces orthogonal to prior task representations, thereby suppressing activations on old tasks and preserving past knowledge. We further introduce an Adaptive Relaxation Strategy that adjusts constraint strength dynamically based on interference signals observed during test-time adaptation, striking a balance between stability and adaptability. Extensive experiments on standard continual merging benchmarks demonstrate that MINGLE achieves robust generalization, significantly reduces forgetting, and consistently surpasses previous state-of-the-art methods by 7-9% on average across diverse task orders.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Neural networks are often described as black boxes, reflecting the significant challenge of understanding their internal workings and interactions. We propose a different perspective that challenges the prevailing view: rather than being inscrutable, neural networks exhibit patterns in their raw population activity that mirror regularities in the training data. We refer to this as the Reflection Hypothesis and provide evidence for this phenomenon in both simple recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and complex large language models (LLMs). Building on this insight, we propose to leverage our cognitive tendency of chunking to segment high-dimensional neural population dynamics into interpretable units that reflect underlying concepts. We propose three methods to extract recurring chunks on a neural population level, complementing each other based on label availability and neural data dimensionality. Discrete sequence chunking (DSC) learns a dictionary of entities in a lower-dimensional neural space; population averaging (PA) extracts recurring entities that correspond to known labels; and unsupervised chunk discovery (UCD) can be used when labels are absent. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these methods in extracting concept-encoding entities agnostic to model architectures. These concepts can be both concrete (words), abstract (POS tags), or structural (narrative schema). Additionally, we show that extracted chunks play a causal role in network behavior, as grafting them leads to controlled and predictable changes in the model's behavior. Our work points to a new direction for interpretability, one that harnesses both cognitive principles and the structure of naturalistic data to reveal the hidden computations of complex learning systems, gradually transforming them from black boxes into systems we can begin to understand.

  The remarkable mechanical properties of spider silk, including its tensile strength and extensibility, are primarily governed by the repetitive regions of the proteins that constitute the fiber, the major ampullate spidroins (MaSps). However, establishing correlations between mechanical characteristics and repeat sequences is challenging due to the intricate sequence-structure-function relationships of MaSps and the limited availability of annotated datasets. In this study, we present a novel computational framework for designing MaSp repeat sequences with customizable mechanical properties. To achieve this, we developed a lightweight GPT-based generative model by distilling the pre-trained ProtGPT2 protein language model. The distilled model was subjected to multilevel fine-tuning using curated subsets of the Spider Silkome dataset. Specifically, we adapt the model for MaSp repeat generation using 6,000 MaSp repeat sequences and further refine it with 572 repeats associated with experimentally determined fiber-level mechanical properties. Our model generates biologically plausible MaSp repeat regions tailored to specific mechanical properties while also predicting those properties for given sequences. Validation includes sequence-level analysis, assessing physicochemical attributes and expected distribution of key motifs as well as secondary structure compositions. A correlation study using BLAST on the Spider Silkome dataset and a test set of MaSp repeats with known mechanical properties further confirmed the predictive accuracy of the model. This framework advances the rational design of spider silk-inspired biomaterials, offering a versatile tool for engineering protein sequences with tailored mechanical attributes.

  Topic modeling is a key component in unsupervised learning, employed to identify topics within a corpus of textual data. The rapid growth of social media generates an ever-growing volume of textual data daily, making online topic modeling methods essential for managing these data streams that continuously arrive over time. This paper introduces a novel approach to online topic modeling named StreamETM. This approach builds on the Embedded Topic Model (ETM) to handle data streams by merging models learned on consecutive partial document batches using unbalanced optimal transport. Additionally, an online change point detection algorithm is employed to identify shifts in topics over time, enabling the identification of significant changes in the dynamics of text streams. Numerical experiments on simulated and real-world data show StreamETM outperforming competitors. We provide the code publicly available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this paper, we propose a new solution to reward adaptation (RA) in reinforcement learning, where the agent adapts to a target reward function based on one or more existing source behaviors learned a priori under the same domain dynamics but different reward functions. While learning the target behavior from scratch is possible, it is often inefficient given the available source behaviors. Our work introduces a new approach to RA through the manipulation of Q-functions. Assuming the target reward function is a known function of the source reward functions, we compute bounds on the Q-function and present an iterative process (akin to value iteration) to tighten these bounds. Such bounds enable action pruning in the target domain before learning even starts. We refer to this method as "Q-Manipulation" (Q-M). The iteration process assumes access to a lite-model, which is easy to provide or learn. We formally prove that Q-M, under discrete domains, does not affect the optimality of the returned policy and show that it is provably efficient in terms of sample complexity in a probabilistic sense. Q-M is evaluated in a variety of synthetic and simulation domains to demonstrate its effectiveness, generalizability, and practicality.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KANs) are a remarkable innovation that consists of learnable activation functions, with the potential to capture more complex relationships from data. Presently, KANs are deployed by replacing multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) in deep networks, including advanced architectures such as vision Transformers (ViTs). This work asks whether KAN could learn token interactions. In this paper, we design the first learnable attention called Kolmogorov-Arnold Attention (KArAt) for ViTs that can operate on any basis, ranging from Fourier, Wavelets, Splines, to Rational Functions. However, learnable activations in the attention cause a memory explosion. To remedy this, we propose a modular version of KArAt that uses a low-rank approximation. By adopting the Fourier basis, Fourier-KArAt and its variants, in some cases, outperform their traditional softmax counterparts, or show comparable performance on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet-1K. We also deploy Fourier KArAt to ConViT and Swin-Transformer, and use it in detection and segmentation with ViT-Det. We dissect the performance of these architectures by analyzing their loss landscapes, weight distributions, optimizer paths, attention visualizations, and transferability to other datasets. KArAt's learnable activation yields a better attention score across all ViTs, indicating improved token-to-token interactions and contributing to enhanced inference. Still, its generalizability does not scale with larger ViTs. However, many factors, including the present computing interface, affect the relative performance of parameter- and memory-heavy KArAts. We note that the goal of this paper is not to produce efficient attention or challenge the traditional activations; by designing KArAt, we are the first to show that attention can be learned and encourage researchers to explore KArAt in conjunction with more advanced architectures.

  Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have enhanced their versatility as they integrate a growing number of modalities. Considering the heavy cost of training MLLMs, it is efficient to reuse the existing ones and extend them to more modalities through Modality-incremental Continual Learning (MCL). The exploration of MCL is in its early stages. In this work, we dive into the causes of performance degradation in MCL. We uncover that it suffers not only from forgetting as in traditional continual learning, but also from misalignment between the modality-agnostic and modality-specific components. To this end, we propose an elegantly simple MCL paradigm called "MErge then ReAlign" (MERA) to address both forgetting and misalignment. MERA avoids introducing heavy model budgets or modifying model architectures, hence is easy to deploy and highly reusable in the MLLM community. Extensive experiments demonstrate the impressive performance of MERA, holding an average of 99.84\% Backward Relative Gain when extending to four modalities, achieving nearly lossless MCL performance. Our findings underscore the misalignment issue in MCL. More broadly, our work showcases how to adjust different components of MLLMs during continual learning.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Text-to-image diffusion models often exhibit biases toward specific demographic groups, such as generating more males than females when prompted to generate images of engineers, raising ethical concerns and limiting their adoption. In this paper, we tackle the challenge of mitigating generation bias towards any target attribute value (e.g., "male" for "gender") in diffusion models while preserving generation quality. We propose FairGen, an adaptive latent guidance mechanism which controls the generation distribution during inference. In FairGen, a latent guidance module dynamically adjusts the diffusion process to enforce specific attributes, while a memory module tracks the generation statistics and steers latent guidance to align with the targeted fair distribution of the attribute values. Furthermore, we address the limitations of existing datasets by introducing the Holistic Bias Evaluation (HBE) benchmark, which covers diverse domains and incorporates complex prompts to assess bias more comprehensively. Extensive evaluations on HBE and Stable Bias datasets demonstrate that FairGen outperforms existing bias mitigation approaches, achieving substantial bias reduction (e.g., 68.5% gender bias reduction on Stable Diffusion 2). Ablation studies highlight FairGen's ability to flexibly control the output distribution at any user-specified granularity, ensuring adaptive and targeted bias mitigation.

  Formal languages are an integral part of modeling and simulation. They allow the distillation of knowledge into concise simulation models amenable to automatic execution, interpretation, and analysis. However, the arguably most humanly accessible means of expressing models is through natural language, which is not easily interpretable by computers. Here, we evaluate how a Large Language Model (LLM) might be used for formalizing natural language into simulation models. Existing studies only explored using very large LLMs, like the commercial GPT models, without fine-tuning model weights. To close this gap, we show how an open-weights, 7B-parameter Mistral model can be fine-tuned to translate natural language descriptions to reaction network models in a domain-specific language, offering a self-hostable, compute-efficient, and memory efficient alternative. To this end, we develop a synthetic data generator to serve as the basis for fine-tuning and evaluation. Our quantitative evaluation shows that our fine-tuned Mistral model can recover the ground truth simulation model in up to 84.5% of cases. In addition, our small-scale user study demonstrates the model's practical potential for one-time generation as well as interactive modeling in various domains. While promising, in its current form, the fine-tuned small LLM cannot catch up with large LLMs. We conclude that higher-quality training data are required, and expect future small and open-source LLMs to offer new opportunities.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Long-term causal inference is an important but challenging problem across various scientific domains. To solve the latent confounding problem in long-term observational studies, existing methods leverage short-term experimental data. Ghassami et al. propose an approach based on the Conditional Additive Equi-Confounding Bias (CAECB) assumption, which asserts that the confounding bias in the short-term outcome is equal to that in the long-term outcome, so that the long-term confounding bias and the causal effects can be identified. While effective in certain cases, this assumption is limited to scenarios where there is only one short-term outcome with the same scale as the long-term outcome. In this paper, we introduce a novel assumption that extends the CAECB assumption to accommodate temporal short-term outcomes. Our proposed assumption states a functional relationship between sequential confounding biases across temporal short-term outcomes, under which we theoretically establish the identification of long-term causal effects. Based on the identification result, we develop an estimator and conduct a theoretical analysis of its asymptotic properties. Extensive experiments validate our theoretical results and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

  Neural networks are known for their ability to approximate smooth functions, yet they fail to generalize perfectly to unseen inputs when trained on discrete operations. Such operations lie at the heart of algorithmic tasks such as arithmetic, which is often used as a test bed for algorithmic execution in neural networks. In this work, we ask: can neural networks learn to execute binary-encoded algorithmic instructions exactly? We use the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) framework to study the training dynamics of two-layer fully connected networks in the infinite-width limit and show how a sufficiently large ensemble of such models can be trained to execute exactly, with high probability, four fundamental tasks: binary permutations, binary addition, binary multiplication, and Subtract and Branch if Negative (SBN) instructions. Since SBN is Turing-complete, our framework extends to computable functions. We show how this can be efficiently achieved using only logarithmically many training data. Our approach relies on two techniques: structuring the training data to isolate bit-level rules, and controlling correlations in the NTK regime to align model predictions with the target algorithmic executions.

  Stable diffusion models represent the state-of-the-art in data synthesis across diverse domains and hold transformative potential for applications in science and engineering, e.g., by facilitating the discovery of novel solutions and simulating systems that are computationally intractable to model explicitly. While there is increasing effort to incorporate physics-based constraints into generative models, existing techniques are either limited in their applicability to latent diffusion frameworks or lack the capability to strictly enforce domain-specific constraints. To address this limitation this paper proposes a novel integration of stable diffusion models with constrained optimization frameworks, enabling the generation of outputs satisfying stringent physical and functional requirements. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated through material design experiments requiring adherence to precise morphometric properties, challenging inverse design tasks involving the generation of materials inducing specific stress-strain responses, and copyright-constrained content generation tasks.

  Diffusion models have established themselves as state-of-the-art generative models across various data modalities, including images and videos, due to their ability to accurately approximate complex data distributions. Unlike traditional generative approaches such as VAEs and GANs, diffusion models employ a progressive denoising process that transforms noise into meaningful data over multiple iterative steps. This gradual approach enhances their expressiveness and generation quality. Not only that, diffusion models have also been shown to extract meaningful representations from data while learning to generate samples. Despite their success, the application of diffusion models to graph-structured data remains relatively unexplored, primarily due to the discrete nature of graphs, which necessitates discrete diffusion processes distinct from the continuous methods used in other domains. In this work, we leverage the representational capabilities of diffusion models to learn meaningful embeddings for graph data. By training a discrete diffusion model within an autoencoder framework, we enable both effective autoencoding and representation learning tailored to the unique characteristics of graph-structured data. We extract the representation from the combination of the encoder's output and the decoder's first time step hidden embedding. Our approach demonstrates the potential of discrete diffusion models to be used for graph representation learning. The code can be found atthis https URL

  In geotechnical engineering, constitutive models are central to capturing soil behavior across diverse drainage conditions, stress paths,and loading histories. While data driven deep learning (DL) approaches have shown promise as alternatives to traditional constitutive formulations, their deployment requires models that are both accurate and capable of quantifying predictive uncertainty. This study introduces a recursive Bayesian neural network (rBNN) framework that unifies temporal sequence learning with generalized Bayesian inference to achieve both predictive accuracy and rigorous uncertainty quantification. A key innovation is the incorporation of a sliding window recursive structure that enables the model to effectively capture path dependent soil responses under monotonic and cyclic loading. By treating network parameters as random variables and inferring their posterior distributions via generalized variational inference, the rBNN produces well calibrated confidence intervals alongside pointthis http URLframework is validated against four datasets spanning both simulated and experimental triaxial tests: monotonic loading using a Hardening Soil model simulation and 28 CD tests on Baskarp sand, and cyclic loading using an exponential constitutive simulation of CD CU tests and 37 experimental cyclic CU tests on Ottawa F65 sand. This progression from monotonic to cyclic and from simulated to experimental data demonstrates the adaptability of the proposed approach across varying levels of data fidelity and complexity. Comparative analyses with LSTM, Encoder Decoder,and GRU architectures highlight that rBNN not only achieves competitive predictive accuracy but also provides reliable confidence intervals.

  Rolling element bearings are critical components of rotating machinery, with their performance directly influencing the efficiency and reliability of industrial systems. At the same time, bearing faults are a leading cause of machinery failures, often resulting in costly downtime, reduced productivity, and, in extreme cases, catastrophic damage. This study presents a methodology that utilizes Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks to address these challenges through automatic feature selection, hyperparameter tuning and interpretable fault analysis within a unified framework. By training shallow network architectures and minimizing the number of selected features, the framework produces lightweight models that deliver explainable results through feature attribution and symbolic representations of their activation functions. Validated on two widely recognized datasets for bearing fault diagnosis, the framework achieved perfect F1-Scores for fault detection and high performance in fault and severity classification tasks, including 100% F1-Scores in most cases. Notably, it demonstrated adaptability by handling diverse fault types, such as imbalance and misalignment, within the same dataset. The symbolic representations enhanced model interpretability, while feature attribution offered insights into the optimal feature types or signals for each studied task. These results highlight the framework's potential for practical applications, such as real-time machinery monitoring, and for scientific research requiring efficient and explainable models.

  Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) tend to accrue technical debt and suffer from significant retraining costs when adapting to evolving requirements. Modularizing DNNs offers the promise of improving their reusability. Previous work has proposed techniques to decompose DNN models into modules both during and after training. However, these strategies yield several shortcomings, including significant weight overlaps and accuracy losses across modules, restricted focus on convolutional layers only, and added complexity and training time by introducing auxiliary masks to control modularity. In this work, we propose MODA, an activation-driven modular training approach. MODA promotes inherent modularity within a DNN model by directly regulating the activation outputs of its layers based on three modular objectives: intra-class affinity, inter-class dispersion, and compactness. MODA is evaluated using three well-known DNN models and five datasets with varying sizes. This evaluation indicates that, compared to the existing state-of-the-art, using MODA yields several advantages: (1) MODA accomplishes modularization with 22% less training time; (2) the resultant modules generated by MODA comprise up to 24x fewer weights and 37x less weight overlap while (3) preserving the original model's accuracy without additional fine-tuning; in module replacement scenarios, (4) MODA improves the accuracy of a target class by 12% on average while ensuring minimal impact on the accuracy of other classes.

  Fine-tuning is a crucial paradigm for adapting pre-trained large language models to downstream tasks. Recently, methods like Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) have been shown to effectively fine-tune LLMs with an extreme reduction in trainable parameters. But, \emph{are their learned solutions really equivalent?} We study how LoRA and full-finetuning change pre-trained models by analyzing the model's weight matrices through the lens of their spectral properties. We find that LoRA and full fine-tuning yield weight matrices whose singular value decompositions exhibit very different structure: weight matrices trained with LoRA have new, high-ranking singular vectors, which we call \emph{intruder dimensions}, while those trained with full fine-tuning do not. Further, we extend the finding that LoRA forgets less than full fine-tuning and find its forgetting is vastly localized to the intruder dimension -- by causally intervening on the intruder dimensions by changing their associated singular values post-fine-tuning, we show that they cause forgetting. Moreover, scaling them down significantly improves modeling of the pre-training distribution with a minimal drop in downstream task performance. Given this, we should expect accumulating intruder dimensions to be harmful and lead to more forgetting. This will be amplified during continual learning because of sequentially fine-tuning, and we show that LoRA models do accumulate intruder dimensions here tend to perform worse in this setting, emphasizing the practicality of our findings.

  Weight space learning aims to extract information about a neural network, such as its training dataset or generalization error. Recent approaches learn directly from model weights, but this presents many challenges as weights are high-dimensional and include permutation symmetries between neurons. An alternative approach, Probing, represents a model by passing a set of learned inputs (probes) through the model, and training a predictor on top of the corresponding outputs. Although probing is typically not used as a stand alone approach, our preliminary experiment found that a vanilla probing baseline worked surprisingly well. However, we discover that current probe learning strategies are ineffective. We therefore propose Deep Linear Probe Generators (ProbeGen), a simple and effective modification to probing approaches. ProbeGen adds a shared generator module with a deep linear architecture, providing an inductive bias towards structured probes thus reducing overfitting. While simple, ProbeGen performs significantly better than the state-of-the-art and is very efficient, requiring between 30 to 1000 times fewer FLOPs than other top approaches.

  Gradient Smoothing is an efficient approach to reducing noise in gradient-based model explanation method. SmoothGrad adds Gaussian noise to mitigate much of these noise. However, the crucial hyper-parameter in this method, the variance $\sigma$ of Gaussian noise, is set manually or with heuristic approach. However, it results in the smoothed gradients still containing a certain amount of noise. In this paper, we aim to interpret SmoothGrad as a corollary of convolution, thereby re-understanding the gradient noise and the role of $\sigma$ from the perspective of confidence level. Furthermore, we propose an adaptive gradient smoothing method, AdaptGrad, based on these insights. Through comprehensive experiments, both qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate that AdaptGrad could effectively reduce almost all the noise in vanilla gradients compared with baselines methods. AdaptGrad is simple and universal, making it applicable for enhancing gradient-based interpretability methods for better visualization.

  This paper introduces a general method for the exploration of equivalence classes in the input space of Transformer models. The proposed approach is based on sound mathematical theory which describes the internal layers of a Transformer architecture as sequential deformations of the input manifold. Using eigendecomposition of the pullback of the distance metric defined on the output space through the Jacobian of the model, we are able to reconstruct equivalence classes in the input space and navigate across them. Our method enables two complementary exploration procedures: the first retrieves input instances that produce the same class probability distribution as the original instance-thus identifying elements within the same equivalence class-while the second discovers instances that yield a different class probability distribution, effectively navigating toward distinct equivalence classes. Finally, we demonstrate how the retrieved instances can be meaningfully interpreted by projecting their embeddings back into a human-readable format.

  Meta-learning enables learning systems to adapt quickly to new tasks, similar to humans. Different meta-learning approaches all work under/with the mini-batch episodic training framework. Such framework naturally gives the information about task identity, which can serve as additional supervision for meta-training to improve generalizability. We propose to exploit task identity as additional supervision in meta-training, inspired by the alignment and discrimination ability which is is intrinsic in human's fast learning. This is achieved by contrasting what meta-learners learn, i.e., model representations. The proposed ConML is evaluating and optimizing the contrastive meta-objective under a problem- and learner-agnostic meta-training framework. We demonstrate that ConML integrates seamlessly with existing meta-learners, as well as in-context learning models, and brings significant boost in performance with small implementation cost.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Long-term treatment effect estimation is a significant but challenging problem in many applications. Existing methods rely on ideal assumptions, such as no unobserved confounders or binary treatment, to estimate long-term average treatment effects. However, in numerous real-world applications, these assumptions could be violated, and average treatment effects are insufficient for personalized decision-making. In this paper, we address a more general problem of estimating long-term Heterogeneous Dose-Response Curve (HDRC) while accounting for unobserved confounders and continuous treatment. Specifically, to remove the unobserved confounders in the long-term observational data, we introduce an optimal transport weighting framework to align the long-term observational data to an auxiliary short-term experimental data. Furthermore, to accurately predict the heterogeneous effects of continuous treatment, we establish a generalization bound on counterfactual prediction error by leveraging the reweighted distribution induced by optimal transport. Finally, we develop a long-term HDRC estimator building upon the above theoretical foundations. Extensive experiments on synthetic and semi-synthetic datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this work, we analyze the conditions under which information about the context of an input $X$ can improve the predictions of deep learning models in new domains. Following work in marginal transfer learning in Domain Generalization (DG), we formalize the notion of context as a permutation-invariant representation of a set of data points that originate from the same domain as the input itself. We offer a theoretical analysis of the conditions under which this approach can, in principle, yield benefits, and formulate two necessary criteria that can be easily verified in practice. Additionally, we contribute insights into the kind of distribution shifts for which the marginal transfer learning approach promises robustness. Empirical analysis shows that our criteria are effective in discerning both favorable and unfavorable scenarios. Finally, we demonstrate that we can reliably detect scenarios where a model is tasked with unwarranted extrapolation in out-of-distribution (OOD) domains, identifying potential failure cases. Consequently, we showcase a method to select between the most predictive and the most robust model, circumventing the well-known trade-off between predictive performance and robustness.

  _Takahiro Suzuki, Keisuke Okumura_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We consider Connected Unlabeled Multi-Agent Pathfinding (CUMAPF), a variant of MAPF where the agents must maintain connectivity at all times. This problem is fundamental to swarm robotics applications like self-reconfiguration and marching, where standard MAPF is insufficient as it does not guarantee the required connectivity between agents. While unlabeled MAPF is tractable in optimization, CUMAPF is NP-hard even on highly restricted graph classes. To tackle this challenge, we propose PULL, a complete and polynomial-time algorithm with a simple design. It is based on a rule-based one-step function that computes a subsequent configuration that preserves connectivity and advances towards the target configuration. PULL is lightweight, and runs in $O(n^2)$ time per step in 2D grid, where $n$ is the number of agents. Our experiments further demonstrate its practical performance: PULL finds competitive solution qualities against trivial solutions for hundreds of agents, in randomly generated instances. Furthermore, we develop an eventually optimal solver that integrates PULL into an existing search-based MAPF algorithm, providing a valuable tool for small-scale instances.

  Modeling realistic human behaviour to understand people's mode choices in order to propose personalised mobility solutions remains challenging. This paper presents an architecture for modeling realistic human mobility behavior in complex multimodal transport systems, demonstrated through a case study in Toulouse, France. We apply Large Language Models (LLMs) within an agent-based simulation to capture decision-making in a real urban setting. The framework integrates the GAMA simulation platform with an LLM-based generative agent, along with General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) data for public transport, and OpenTripPlanner for multimodal routing. GAMA platform models the interactive transport environment, providing visualization and dynamic agent interactions while eliminating the need to construct the simulation environment from scratch. This design enables a stronger focus on developing generative agents and evaluating their performance in transport decision-making processes. Over a simulated month, results show that agents not only make context-aware transport decisions but also form habits over time. We conclude that combining LLMs with agent-based simulation offers a promising direction for advancing intelligent transportation systems and personalised multimodal mobility solutions. We also discuss some limitations of this approach and outline future work on scaling to larger regions, integrating real-time data, and refining memory models.

  With the advancements in hardware, software, and large language model technologies, the interaction between humans and operating systems has evolved from the command-line interface to the rapidly emerging AI agent interactions. Building an operating system (OS) agent capable of executing user instructions and faithfully following user desires is becoming a reality. In this technical report, we present ColorAgent, an OS agent designed to engage in long-horizon, robust interactions with the environment while also enabling personalized and proactive user interaction. To enable long-horizon interactions with the environment, we enhance the model's capabilities through step-wise reinforcement learning and self-evolving training, while also developing a tailored multi-agent framework that ensures generality, consistency, and robustness. In terms of user interaction, we explore personalized user intent recognition and proactive engagement, positioning the OS agent not merely as an automation tool but as a warm, collaborative partner. We evaluate ColorAgent on the AndroidWorld and AndroidLab benchmarks, achieving success rates of 77.2% and 50.7%, respectively, establishing a new state of the art. Nonetheless, we note that current benchmarks are insufficient for a comprehensive evaluation of OS agents and propose further exploring directions in future work, particularly in the areas of evaluation paradigms, agent collaboration, and security.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The rapid evolution of smart cities has increased the reliance on intelligent interconnected services to optimize infrastructure, resources, and citizen well-being. Agentic AI has emerged as a key enabler by supporting autonomous decision-making and adaptive coordination, allowing urban systems to respond in real time to dynamic conditions. Its benefits are evident in areas such as transportation, where the integration of traffic data, weather forecasts, and safety sensors enables dynamic rerouting and a faster response to hazards. However, its deployment across heterogeneous smart city ecosystems raises critical governance, risk, and compliance (GRC) challenges, including accountability, data privacy, and regulatory alignment within decentralized infrastructures. Evaluation of SORA-ATMAS with three domain agents (Weather, Traffic, and Safety) demonstrated that its governance policies, including a fallback mechanism for high-risk scenarios, effectively steer multiple LLMs (GPT, Grok, DeepSeek) towards domain-optimized, policy-aligned outputs, producing an average MAE reduction of 35% across agents. Results showed stable weather monitoring, effective handling of high-risk traffic plateaus 0.85, and adaptive trust regulation in Safety/Fire scenarios 0.65. Runtime profiling of a 3-agent deployment confirmed scalability, with throughput between 13.8-17.2 requests per second, execution times below 72~ms, and governance delays under 100 ms, analytical projections suggest maintained performance at larger scales. Cross-domain rules ensured safe interoperability, with traffic rerouting permitted only under validated weather conditions. These findings validate SORA-ATMAS as a regulation-aligned, context-aware, and verifiable governance framework that consolidates distributed agent outputs into accountable, real-time decisions, offering a resilient foundation for smart-city management.

  _Tomoki Arita, Keisuke Okumura_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Guidance is an emerging concept that improves the empirical performance of real-time, sub-optimal multi-agent pathfinding (MAPF) methods. It offers additional information to MAPF algorithms to mitigate congestion on a global scale by considering the collective behavior of all agents across the entire workspace. This global perspective helps reduce agents' waiting times, thereby improving overall coordination efficiency. In contrast, this study explores an alternative approach: providing local guidance in the vicinity of each agent. While such localized methods involve recomputation as agents move and may appear computationally demanding, we empirically demonstrate that supplying informative spatiotemporal cues to the planner can significantly improve solution quality without exceeding a moderate time budget. When applied to LaCAM, a leading configuration-based solver, this form of guidance establishes a new performance frontier for MAPF.

  _Rui Jerry Huang, Wendy Liu, Anastasia Miin, Lei Ding_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Inference-time computation is a critical yet challenging paradigm for enhancing the reasoning performance of large language models (LLMs). While existing strategies improve reasoning stability and consistency, they suffer from notable limitations: self-correction often reinforces the model's initial biases, and Multi-Agent Collaboration (MAC) often fails due to the lack of efficient coordination mechanisms, leading to collective errors. Although high-performing verifiers can detect reasoning errors, making them reliable requires substantial training. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel inference-time framework, Adaptive Coopetition (AdCo), in which LLM agents utilize an adaptive, UCB-based "coopetition" mechanism. At each round, agents leverage coarse verifier signals to determine whether to collaborate or compete, and iteratively refine their reasoning based on peer feedback. Without relying on high-performance verifiers, our adaptive strategy achieves significant performance gains on mathematical reasoning benchmarks, yielding a 20% relative improvement over baselines on the more challenging dataset. Our approach remains robust and consistent in terms of accuracy under different sample sizes and configurations. This adaptive, signal-guided "coopetition" framework enhances reasoning robustness by leveraging both model knowledge diversity and reasoning trace measures, while also promoting uncertainty-driven exploration, especially when participants have comparable capabilities. From this perspective, our work offers a fresh lens on inference-time computation and paves the way for more resilient multi-agent LLM systems. Our code is available at:this https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multi-Agent System (MAS) powered by Visual Language Models (VLMs) enables challenging tasks but suffers from a novel failure term, multi-agent visual hallucination snowballing, where hallucinations are seeded in a single agent and amplified by following ones due to the over-reliance on textual flow to relay visual information. Through turn-, layer-, and token-wise attention analyses, we provide detailed insights into the essence of hallucination snowballing regarding the reduction of visual attention allocation. It leads us to identify a subset of vision tokens with a unimodal attention peak in middle layers that best preserve visual evidence but gradually diminish in deeper agent turns, resulting in the visual hallucination snowballing in MAS. Thus, we propose ViF, a lightweight, plug-and-play mitigation paradigm that relays inter-agent messages with Visual Flow powered by the selected visual relay tokens and applies attention reallocation to amplify this pattern. The experiment results demonstrate that our method markedly reduces hallucination snowballing, consistently improving the performance across eight benchmarks based on four common MAS structures and ten base models.

  Combinatorial optimization problems involving multiple agents are notoriously challenging due to their NP-hard nature and the necessity for effective agent coordination. Despite advancements in learning-based methods, existing approaches often face critical limitations, including suboptimal agent coordination, poor generalization, and high computational latency. To address these issues, we propose PARCO (Parallel AutoRegressive Combinatorial Optimization), a general reinforcement learning framework designed to construct high-quality solutions for multi-agent combinatorial tasks efficiently. To this end, PARCO integrates three key novel components: (1) transformer-based communication layers to enable effective agent collaboration during parallel solution construction, (2) a multiple pointer mechanism for low-latency, parallel agent decision-making, and (3) priority-based conflict handlers to resolve decision conflicts via learned priorities. We evaluate PARCO in multi-agent vehicle routing and scheduling problems, where our approach outperforms state-of-the-art learning methods, demonstrating strong generalization ability and remarkable computational efficiency.

  In this paper, we propose SEA, a novel approach for active robot exploration through semantic map prediction and a reinforcement learning-based hierarchical exploration policy. Unlike existing learning-based methods that rely on one-step waypoint prediction, our approach enhances the agent's long-term environmental understanding to facilitate more efficient exploration. We propose an iterative prediction-exploration framework that explicitly predicts the missing areas of the map based on current observations. The difference between the actual accumulated map and the predicted global map is then used to guide exploration. Additionally, we design a novel reward mechanism that leverages reinforcement learning to update the long-term exploration strategies, enabling us to construct an accurate semantic map within limited steps. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art exploration strategies, achieving superior coverage ares of the global map within the same time constraints.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Solving complex real-world control tasks often takes multiple tries: if we fail at first, we reflect on what went wrong, and change our strategy accordingly to avoid making the same mistake. In robotics, Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) offer a promising path towards solving complex control tasks, but lack the ability to contextually and dynamically readjust behavior when they fail to accomplish a task. In this work, we introduce Learning from Inference-Time Execution (LITEN), which connects a VLA low-level policy to a high-level VLM that conditions on past experiences by including them in-context, allowing it to learn the affordances and capabilities of the low-level VLA. Our approach iterates between a reasoning phase that generates and executes plans for the low-level VLA, and an assessment phase that reflects on the resulting execution and draws useful conclusions to be included in future reasoning contexts. Unlike similar approaches to self-refinement in non-robotics domains, LITEN must reflect on unstructured real-world robot trajectories (e.g., raw videos), which requires structured guiderails during assessment. Our experimental results demonstrate LITEN is able to effectively learn from past experience to generate plans that use high-affordance instructions to accomplish long-horizon tasks.

  A novel approach for the fast onboard detection of isolated markers for visual relative localisation of multiple teammates in agile UAV swarms is introduced in this paper. As the detection forms a key component of real-time localisation systems, a three-fold innovation is presented, consisting of an optimised procedure for CPUs, a GPU shader program, and a functionally equivalent FPGA streaming architecture. For the proposed CPU and GPU solutions, the mean processing time per pixel of input camera frames was accelerated by two to three orders of magnitude compared to the state of the art. For the localisation task, the proposed FPGA architecture offered the most significant overall acceleration by minimising the total delay from camera exposure to detection results. Additionally, the proposed solutions were evaluated on various 32-bit and 64-bit embedded platforms to demonstrate their efficiency, as well as their feasibility for applications using low-end UAVs and MAVs. Thus, it has become a crucial enabling technology for agile UAV swarming.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Zero-shot Vision-and-Language Navigation in Continuous Environments (VLN-CE) requires an agent to navigate unseen environments based on natural language instructions without any prior training. Current methods face a critical trade-off: either rely on environment-specific waypoint predictors that limit scene generalization, or underutilize the reasoning capabilities of large models during navigation. We introduce LaViRA, a simple yet effective zero-shot framework that addresses this dilemma by decomposing action into a coarse-to-fine hierarchy: Language Action for high-level planning, Vision Action for perceptual grounding, and Robot Action for robust navigation. This modular decomposition allows us to leverage the distinct strengths of different scales of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) at each stage, creating a system that is powerful in its reasoning, grounding and practical control. LaViRA significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on the VLN-CE benchmark, demonstrating superior generalization capabilities in unseen environments, while maintaining transparency and efficiency for real-world deployment.

  The integration of advanced control strategies into prosthetic hands is essential to improve their adaptability and performance. In this study, we present an implementation of a Model Predictive Control (MPC) strategy to regulate the motions of a soft continuum wrist section attached to a tendon-driven prosthetic hand with less computational effort. MPC plays a crucial role in enhancing the functionality and responsiveness of prosthetic hands. By leveraging predictive modeling, this approach enables precise movement adjustments while accounting for dynamic user interactions. This advanced control strategy allows for the anticipation of future movements and adjustments based on the current state of the prosthetic device and the intentions of the user. Kinematic and dynamic modelings are performed using Euler-Bernoulli beam and Lagrange methods respectively. Through simulation and experimental validations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of MPC in optimizing wrist articulation and user control. Our findings suggest that this technique significantly improves the prosthetic hand dexterity, making movements more natural and intuitive. This research contributes to the field of robotics and biomedical engineering by offering a promising direction for intelligent prosthetic systems.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Imitation learning has proven effective for training robots to perform complex tasks from expert human demonstrations. However, it remains limited by its reliance on high-quality, task-specific data, restricting adaptability to the diverse range of real-world object configurations and scenarios. In contrast, non-expert data -- such as play data, suboptimal demonstrations, partial task completions, or rollouts from suboptimal policies -- can offer broader coverage and lower collection costs. However, conventional imitation learning approaches fail to utilize this data effectively. To address these challenges, we posit that with right design decisions, offline reinforcement learning can be used as a tool to harness non-expert data to enhance the performance of imitation learning policies. We show that while standard offline RL approaches can be ineffective at actually leveraging non-expert data under the sparse data coverage settings typically encountered in the real world, simple algorithmic modifications can allow for the utilization of this data, without significant additional assumptions. Our approach shows that broadening the support of the policy distribution can allow imitation algorithms augmented by offline RL to solve tasks robustly, showing considerably enhanced recovery and generalization behavior. In manipulation tasks, these innovations significantly increase the range of initial conditions where learned policies are successful when non-expert data is incorporated. Moreover, we show that these methods are able to leverage all collected data, including partial or suboptimal demonstrations, to bolster task-directed policy performance. This underscores the importance of algorithmic techniques for using non-expert data for robust policy learning in robotics.

  Training Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models for generalist robots typically requires large-scale real-world robot data, which is expensive and time-consuming to collect. The inefficiency of physical data collection severely limits the scalability, and generalization capacity of current VLA systems. To address this challenge, we introduce GigaBrain-0, a novel VLA foundation model empowered by world model-generated data (e.g., video generation, real2real transfer, human transfer, view transfer, sim2real transfer data). By leveraging world models to generate diverse data at scale, GigaBrain-0 significantly reduces reliance on real robot data while improving cross-task generalization. Our approach further improves policy robustness through RGBD input modeling and embodied Chain-of-Thought (CoT) supervision, enabling the model to reason about spatial geometry, object states, and long-horizon dependencies during task execution. This leads to substantial gains in real-world performance on dexterous, long-horizon, and mobile manipulation tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GigaBrain-0 achieves superior generalization across variations in appearances (e.g., textures, colors), object placements, and camera viewpoints. Additionally, we present GigaBrain-0-Small, an optimized lightweight variant designed to run efficiently on devices such as the NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Increasingly large datasets of robot actions and sensory observations are being collected to train ever-larger neural networks. These datasets are collected based on tasks and while these tasks may be distinct in their descriptions, many involve very similar physical action sequences (e.g., 'pick up an apple' versus 'pick up an orange'). As a result, many datasets of robotic tasks are substantially imbalanced in terms of the physical robotic actions they represent. In this work, we propose a simple sampling strategy for policy training that mitigates this imbalance. Our method requires only a few lines of code to integrate into existing codebases and improves generalization. We evaluate our method in both pre-training small models and fine-tuning large foundational models. Our results show substantial improvements on low-resource tasks compared to prior state-of-the-art methods, without degrading performance on high-resource tasks. This enables more effective use of model capacity for multi-task policies. We also further validate our approach in a real-world setup on a Franka Panda robot arm across a diverse set of tasks.

  Uncertainty-aware robot motion prediction is crucial for downstream traversability estimation and safe autonomous navigation in unstructured, off-road environments, where terrain is heterogeneous and perceptual uncertainty is high. Most existing methods assume deterministic or spatially independent terrain uncertainties, ignoring the inherent local correlations of 3D spatial data and often producing unreliable predictions. In this work, we introduce an efficient probabilistic framework that explicitly models spatially correlated aleatoric uncertainty over terrain parameters as a probabilistic world model and propagates this uncertainty through a differentiable physics engine for probabilistic trajectory forecasting. By leveraging structured convolutional operators, our approach provides high-resolution multivariate predictions at manageable computational cost. Experimental evaluation on a publicly available dataset shows significantly improved uncertainty estimation and trajectory prediction accuracy over aleatoric uncertainty estimation baselines.

  The wide application of flow-matching methods has greatly promoted the development of robot imitation learning. However, these methods all face the problem of high inference time. To address this issue, researchers have proposed distillation methods and consistency methods, but the performance of these methods still struggles to compete with that of the original diffusion models and flow-matching models. In this article, we propose a one-step shortcut method with multi-step integration for robot imitation learning. To balance the inference speed and performance, we extend the multi-step consistency loss on the basis of the shortcut model, split the one-step loss into multi-step losses, and improve the performance of one-step inference. Secondly, to solve the problem of unstable optimization of the multi-step loss and the original flow-matching loss, we propose an adaptive gradient allocation method to enhance the stability of the learning process. Finally, we evaluate the proposed method in two simulation benchmarks and five real-world environment tasks. The experimental results verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

  Chemistry laboratory automation aims to increase throughput, reproducibility, and safety, yet many existing systems still depend on frequent human intervention. Advances in robotics have reduced this dependency, but without a structured representation of the required skills, autonomy remains limited to bespoke, task-specific solutions with little capacity to transfer beyond their initial design. Current experiment abstractions typically describe protocol-level steps without specifying the robotic actions needed to execute them. This highlights the lack of a systematic account of the manipulation skills required for robots in chemistry laboratories. To address this gap, we introduce TARMAC - a Taxonomy for Robot Manipulation in Chemistry - a domain-specific framework that defines and organizes the core manipulations needed in laboratory practice. Based on annotated teaching-lab demonstrations and supported by experimental validation, TARMAC categorizes actions according to their functional role and physical execution requirements. Beyond serving as a descriptive vocabulary, TARMAC can be instantiated as robot-executable primitives and composed into higher-level macros, enabling skill reuse and supporting scalable integration into long-horizon workflows. These contributions provide a structured foundation for more flexible and autonomous laboratory automation. More information is available atthis https URL

  Long-horizon routing tasks of deformable linear objects (DLOs), such as cables and ropes, are common in industrial assembly lines and everyday life. These tasks are particularly challenging because they require robots to manipulate DLO with long-horizon planning and reliable skill execution. Successfully completing such tasks demands adapting to their nonlinear dynamics, decomposing abstract routing goals, and generating multi-step plans composed of multiple skills, all of which require accurate high-level reasoning during execution. In this paper, we propose a fully autonomous hierarchical framework for solving challenging DLO routing tasks. Given an implicit or explicit routing goal expressed in language, our framework leverages vision-language models~(VLMs) for in-context high-level reasoning to synthesize feasible plans, which are then executed by low-level skills trained via reinforcement learning. To improve robustness in long horizons, we further introduce a failure recovery mechanism that reorients the DLO into insertion-feasible states. Our approach generalizes to diverse scenes involving object attributes, spatial descriptions, as well as implicit language commands. It outperforms the next best baseline method by nearly 50% and achieves an overall success rate of 92.5% across long-horizon routing scenarios.

  Achieving dexterous robotic grasping with multi-fingered hands remains a significant challenge. While existing methods rely on complete 3D scans to predict grasp poses, these approaches face limitations due to the difficulty of acquiring high-quality 3D data in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we introduce GRASPLAT, a novel grasping framework that leverages consistent 3D information while being trained solely on RGB images. Our key insight is that by synthesizing physically plausible images of a hand grasping an object, we can regress the corresponding hand joints for a successful grasp. To achieve this, we utilize 3D Gaussian Splatting to generate high-fidelity novel views of real hand-object interactions, enabling end-to-end training with RGB data. Unlike prior methods, our approach incorporates a photometric loss that refines grasp predictions by minimizing discrepancies between rendered and real images. We conduct extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world grasping datasets, demonstrating that GRASPLAT improves grasp success rates up to 36.9% over existing image-based methods.

  Path planning for a robotic system in high-dimensional cluttered environments needs to be efficient, safe, and adaptable for different environments and hardware. Conventional methods face high computation time and require extensive parameter tuning, while prior learning-based methods still fail to generalize effectively. The primary goal of this research is to develop a path planning framework capable of generalizing to unseen environments and new robotic manipulators without the need for retraining. We present GADGET (Generalizable and Adaptive Diffusion-Guided Environment-aware Trajectory generation), a diffusion-based planning model that generates joint-space trajectories conditioned on voxelized scene representations as well as start and goal configurations. A key innovation is GADGET's hybrid dual-conditioning mechanism that combines classifier-free guidance via learned scene encoding with classifier-guided Control Barrier Function (CBF) safety shaping, integrating environment awareness with real-time collision avoidance directly in the denoising process. This design supports zero-shot transfer to new environments and robotic embodiments without retraining. Experimental results show that GADGET achieves high success rates with low collision intensity in spherical-obstacle, bin-picking, and shelf environments, with CBF guidance further improving safety. Moreover, comparative evaluations indicate strong performance relative to both sampling-based and learning-based baselines. Furthermore, GADGET provides transferability across Franka Panda, Kinova Gen3 (6/7-DoF), and UR5 robots, and physical execution on a Kinova Gen3 demonstrates its ability to generate safe, collision-free trajectories in real-world settings.

  Legged robots can sense terrain through force interactions during locomotion, offering more reliable traversability estimates than remote sensing and serving as scouts for guiding wheeled rovers in challenging environments. However, even legged scouts face challenges when traversing highly deformable or unstable terrain. We present Safe Active Exploration for Granular Terrain (SAEGT), a navigation framework that enables legged robots to safely explore unknown granular environments using proprioceptive sensing, particularly where visual input fails to capture terrain deformability. SAEGT estimates the safe region and frontier region online from leg-terrain interactions using Gaussian Process regression for traversability assessment, with a reactive controller for real-time safe exploration and navigation. SAEGT demonstrated its ability to safely explore and navigate toward a specified goal using only proprioceptively estimated traversability in simulation.

  Recent advances in robotics and autonomous systems have broadened the use of robots in laboratory settings, including automated synthesis, scalable reaction workflows, and collaborative tasks in self-driving laboratories (SDLs). This paper presents a comprehensive development of a mobile manipulator designed to assist human operators in such autonomous lab environments. Kinematic modeling of the manipulator is carried out based on the Denavit Hartenberg (DH) convention and inverse kinematics solution is determined to enable precise and adaptive manipulation capabilities. A key focus of this research is enhancing the manipulator ability to reliably grasp textured objects as a critical component of autonomous handling tasks. Advanced vision-based algorithms are implemented to perform real-time object detection and pose estimation, guiding the manipulator in dynamic grasping and following tasks. In this work, we integrate a vision method that combines feature-based detection with homography-driven pose estimation, leveraging depth information to represent an object pose as a $2$D planar projection within $3$D space. This adaptive capability enables the system to accommodate variations in object orientation and supports robust autonomous manipulation across diverse environments. By enabling autonomous experimentation and human-robot collaboration, this work contributes to the scalability and reproducibility of next-generation chemical laboratories

  This paper investigates a sample-based solution to the hybrid mode control problem across non-differentiable and algorithmic hybrid modes. Our approach reasons about a set of hybrid control modes as an integer-based optimization problem where we select what mode to apply, when to switch to another mode, and the duration for which we are in a given control mode. A sample-based variation is derived to efficiently search the integer domain for optimal solutions. We find our formulation yields strong performance guarantees that can be applied to a number of robotics-related tasks. In addition, our approach is able to synthesize complex algorithms and policies to compound behaviors and achieve challenging tasks. Last, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in real-world robotic examples that require reactive switching between long-term planning and high-frequency control.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Estimation of signed distance functions (SDFs) from point cloud data has been shown to benefit many robot autonomy capabilities, including localization, mapping, motion planning, and control. Methods that support online and large-scale SDF reconstruction tend to rely on discrete volumetric data structures, which affect the continuity and differentiability of the SDF estimates. Recently, using implicit features, neural network methods have demonstrated high-fidelity and differentiable SDF reconstruction but they tend to be less efficient, can experience catastrophic forgetting and memory limitations in large environments, and are often restricted to truncated SDFs. This work proposes $\nabla$-SDF, a hybrid method that combines an explicit prior obtained from gradient-augmented octree interpolation with an implicit neural residual. Our method achieves non-truncated (Euclidean) SDF reconstruction with computational and memory efficiency comparable to volumetric methods and differentiability and accuracy comparable to neural network methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \methodname{} outperforms the state of the art in terms of accuracy and efficiency, providing a scalable solution for downstream tasks in robotics and computer vision.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Autonomous navigation in 3D is a fundamental problem for autonomy. Despite major advancements in terrestrial and aerial settings due to improved range sensors including LiDAR, compact sensors with similar capabilities for underwater robots have only recently become available, in the form of 3D sonars. This paper introduces a novel underwater 3D navigation pipeline, called SHRUMS (Sensor Hallucination for Robust Underwater Motion planning with 3D Sonar). To the best of the authors' knowledge, SHRUMS is the first underwater autonomous navigation stack to integrate a 3D sonar. The proposed pipeline exhibits strong robustness while operating in complex 3D environments in spite of extremely poor visibility conditions. To accommodate the intricacies of the novel sensor data stream while achieving real-time locally optimal performance, SHRUMS introduces the concept of hallucinating sensor measurements from non-existent sensors with convenient arbitrary parameters, tailored to application specific requirements. The proposed concepts are validated with real 3D sonar sensor data, utilizing real inputs in challenging settings and local maps constructed in real-time. Field deployments validating the proposed approach in full are planned in the very near future.

  In the past decade, the adoption of compact 3D range sensors, such as LiDARs, has driven the developments of robust state-estimation pipelines, making them a standard sensor for aerial, ground, and space autonomy. Unfortunately, poor propagation of electromagnetic waves underwater, has limited the visibility-independent sensing options of underwater state-estimation to acoustic range sensors, which provide 2D information including, at-best, spatially ambiguous information. This paper, to the best of our knowledge, is the first study examining the performance, capacity, and opportunities arising from the recent introduction of the first compact 3D sonar. Towards that purpose, we introduce calibration procedures for extracting the extrinsics between the 3D sonar and a camera and we provide a study on acoustic response in different surfaces and materials. Moreover, we provide novel mapping and SLAM pipelines tested in deployments in underwater cave systems and other geometrically and acoustically challenging underwater environments. Our assessment showcases the unique capacity of 3D sonars to capture consistent spatial information allowing for detailed reconstructions and localization in datasets expanding to hundreds of meters. At the same time it highlights remaining challenges related to acoustic propagation, as found also in other acoustic sensors. Datasets collected for our evaluations would be released and shared with the community to enable further research advancements.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Permanently Shadowed Regions (PSRs) near the lunar poles are of interest for future exploration due to their potential to contain water ice and preserve geological records. Their complex, uneven terrain favors the use of legged robots, which can traverse challenging surfaces while collecting in-situ data, and have proven effective in Earth analogs, including dark caves, when equipped with onboard lighting. While exteroceptive sensors like cameras and lidars can capture terrain geometry and even semantic information, they cannot quantify its physical interaction with the robot, a capability provided by proprioceptive sensing. We propose a terrain mapping framework for quadruped robots, which estimates elevation, foot slippage, energy cost, and stability margins from internal sensing during locomotion. These metrics are incrementally integrated into a multi-layer 2.5D gridmap that reflects terrain interaction from the robot's perspective. The system is evaluated in a simulator that mimics a lunar environment, using the 21 kg quadruped robot Aliengo, showing consistent mapping performance under lunar gravity and terrain conditions.

  Integrating visual-language instructions into visuomotor policies is gaining momentum in robot learning for enhancing open-world generalization. Despite promising advances, existing approaches face two challenges: limited language steerability when no generated reasoning is used as a condition, or significant inference latency when reasoning isthis http URLthis work, we introduce MoTVLA, a mixture-of-transformers (MoT)-based vision-language-action (VLA) model that integrates fast-slow unified reasoning with behavior policy learning. MoTVLA preserves the general intelligence of pre-trained VLMs (serving as the generalist) for tasks such as perception, scene understanding, and semantic planning, while incorporating a domain expert, a second transformer that shares knowledge with the pretrained VLM, to generate domain-specific fast reasoning (e.g., robot motion decomposition), thereby improving policy execution efficiency. By conditioning the action expert on decomposed motion instructions, MoTVLA can learn diverse behaviors and substantially improve language steerability. Extensive evaluations across natural language processing benchmarks, robotic simulation environments, and real-world experiments confirm the superiority of MoTVLA in both fast-slow reasoning and manipulation task performance.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present OmniVIC, a universal variable impedance controller (VIC) enhanced by a vision language model (VLM), which improves safety and adaptation in any contact-rich robotic manipulation task to enhance safe physical interaction. Traditional VIC have shown advantages when the robot physically interacts with the environment, but lack generalization in unseen, complex, and unstructured safe interactions in universal task scenarios involving contact or uncertainty. To this end, the proposed OmniVIC interprets task context derived reasoning from images and natural language and generates adaptive impedance parameters for a VIC controller. Specifically, the core of OmniVIC is a self-improving Retrieval-Augmented Generation(RAG) and in-context learning (ICL), where RAG retrieves relevant prior experiences from a structured memory bank to inform the controller about similar past tasks, and ICL leverages these retrieved examples and the prompt of current task to query the VLM for generating context-aware and adaptive impedance parameters for the current manipulation scenario. Therefore, a self-improved RAG and ICL guarantee OmniVIC works in universal task scenarios. The impedance parameter regulation is further informed by real-time force/torque feedback to ensure interaction forces remain within safe thresholds. We demonstrate that our method outperforms baselines on a suite of complex contact-rich tasks, both in simulation and on real-world robotic tasks, with improved success rates and reduced force violations. OmniVIC takes a step towards bridging high-level semantic reasoning and low-level compliant control, enabling safer and more generalizable manipulation. Overall, the average success rate increases from 27% (baseline) to 61.4% (OmniVIC).

  Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models extend vision-language models to embodied control by mapping natural-language instructions and visual observations to robot actions. Despite their capabilities, VLA systems face significant challenges due to their massive computational and memory demands, which conflict with the constraints of edge platforms such as on-board mobile manipulators that require real-time performance. Addressing this tension has become a central focus of recent research. In light of the growing efforts toward more efficient and scalable VLA systems, this survey provides a systematic review of approaches for improving VLA efficiency, with an emphasis on reducing latency, memory footprint, and training and inference costs. We categorize existing solutions into four dimensions: model architecture, perception feature, action generation, and training/inference strategies, summarizing representative techniques within each category. Finally, we discuss future trends and open challenges, highlighting directions for advancing efficient embodied intelligence.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In the context of imitation learning, visuomotor-based diffusion policy learning is one of the main directions in robotic manipulation. Most of these approaches rely on point clouds as observation inputs and construct scene representations through point clouds feature learning, which enables them to achieve remarkable accuracy. However, the existing literature lacks an in-depth exploration of vision-only solutions that have significant potential. In this paper, we propose a Vision-Only and single-view Diffusion Policy learning method (VO-DP) that leverages pretrained visual foundation models to achieve effective fusion of semantic and geometric features. We utilize intermediate features from VGGT incorporating semantic features from DINOv2 and geometric features from Alternating Attention blocks. Features are fused via cross-attention and spatially compressed with a CNN to form the input to the policy head. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VO-DP not only outperforms the vision-only baseline DP significantly but also exhibits distinct performance trends against the point cloud-based method DP3: in simulation tasks, VO-DP achieves an average success rate of 64.6% on par with DP3 64.0% and far higher than DP 34.8%, while in real-world tasks, it reaches 87.9%, outperforming both DP3 67.5% and DP 11.2% by a notable margin. Further robustness evaluations confirm that VO-DP remains highly stable under varying conditions including color, size, background, and lighting. Lastly, we open-source a training library for robotic manipulation. Built on Accelerate, this library supports multi-machine and multi-GPU parallel training, as well as mixed precision training. It is compatible with visuomotor policies such as DP, DP3 and VO-DP, and also supports the RoboTwin simulator.

  While visuomotor policy has made advancements in recent years, contact-rich tasks still remain a challenge. Robotic manipulation tasks that require continuous contact demand explicit handling of compliance and force. However, most visuomotor policies ignore compliance, overlooking the importance of physical interaction with the real world, often leading to excessive contact forces or fragile behavior under uncertainty. Introducing force information into vision-based imitation learning could help improve awareness of contacts, but could also require a lot of data to perform well. One remedy for data scarcity is to generate data in simulation, yet computationally taxing processes are required to generate data good enough not to suffer from the Sim2Real gap. In this work, we introduce a framework for generating force-informed data in simulation, instantiated by a single human demonstration, and show how coupling with a compliant policy improves the performance of a visuomotor policy learned from synthetic data. We validate our approach on real-robot tasks, including non-prehensile block flipping and a bi-manual object moving, where the learned policy exhibits reliable contact maintenance and adaptation to novel conditions.

  Deploying reinforcement learning (RL) safely in the real world is challenging, as policies trained in simulators must face the inevitable sim-to-real gap. Robust safe RL techniques are provably safe, however difficult to scale, while domain randomization is more practical yet prone to unsafe behaviors. We address this gap by proposing SPiDR, short for Sim-to-real via Pessimistic Domain Randomization -- a scalable algorithm with provable guarantees for safe sim-to-real transfer. SPiDR uses domain randomization to incorporate the uncertainty about the sim-to-real gap into the safety constraints, making it versatile and highly compatible with existing training pipelines. Through extensive experiments on sim-to-sim benchmarks and two distinct real-world robotic platforms, we demonstrate that SPiDR effectively ensures safety despite the sim-to-real gap while maintaining strong performance.

We present RoboMemory, a brain-inspired framework that unifies Spatial, Temporal, Episodic, and Semantic memory under a parallelized architecture for efficient long-horizon planning and interactive environmental learning. A dynamic spatial knowledge graph (KG) ensures scalable and consistent memory updates, while a closed-loop planner with a critic module supports adaptive decision-making in dynamic settings. Experiments on EmbodiedBench show that RoboMemory, built on Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Ins, improves average success rates by 25% over its baseline and exceeds the closed-source state-of-the-art (SOTA) Gemini-1.5-Pro by 3%. Real-world trials further confirm its capacity for cumulative learning, with performance improving across repeated tasks. These results highlight RoboMemory as a scalable foundation for memory-augmented embodied intelligence, bridging the gap between cognitive neuroscience and robotic autonomy.

  The field of robotic manipulation has advanced significantly in recent years. At the sensing level, several novel tactile sensors have been developed, capable of providing accurate contact information. On a methodological level, learning from demonstrations has proven an efficient paradigm to obtain performant robotic manipulation policies. The combination of both holds the promise to extract crucial contact-related information from the demonstration data and actively exploit it during policy rollouts. However, this integration has so far been underexplored, most notably in dynamic, contact-rich manipulation tasks where precision and reactivity are essential. This work therefore proposes a multimodal, visuotactile imitation learning framework that integrates a modular transformer architecture with a flow-based generative model, enabling efficient learning of fast and dexterous manipulation policies. We evaluate our framework on the dynamic, contact-rich task of robotic match lighting - a task in which tactile feedback influences human manipulation performance. The experimental results highlight the effectiveness of our approach and show that adding tactile information improves policy performance, thereby underlining their combined potential for learning dynamic manipulation from few demonstrations.

  In-context imitation learning (ICIL) is a new paradigm that enables robots to generalize from demonstrations to unseen tasks without retraining. A well-structured action representation is the key to capturing demonstration information effectively, yet action tokenizer (the process of discretizing and encoding actions) remains largely unexplored in ICIL. In this work, we first systematically evaluate existing action tokenizer methods in ICIL and reveal a critical limitation: while they effectively encode action trajectories, they fail to preserve temporal smoothness, which is crucial for stable robotic execution. To address this, we propose LipVQ-VAE, a variational autoencoder that enforces the Lipschitz condition in the latent action space via weight normalization. By propagating smoothness constraints from raw action inputs to a quantized latent codebook, LipVQ-VAE generates more stable and smoother actions. When integrating into ICIL, LipVQ-VAE improves performance by more than 5.3% in high-fidelity simulators, with real-world experiments confirming its ability to produce smoother, more reliable trajectories.

  Drone Visual Active Tracking aims to autonomously follow a target object by controlling the motion system based on visual observations, providing a more practical solution for effective tracking in dynamic environments. However, accurate Drone Visual Active Tracking using reinforcement learning remains challenging due to the absence of a unified benchmark and the complexity of open-world environments with frequent interference. To address these issues, we pioneer a systematic solution. First, we propose DAT, the first open-world drone active air-to-ground tracking benchmark. It encompasses 24 city-scale scenes, featuring targets with human-like behaviors and high-fidelity dynamics simulation. DAT also provides a digital twin tool for unlimited scene generation. Additionally, we propose a novel reinforcement learning method called GC-VAT, which aims to improve the performance of drone tracking targets in complex scenarios. Specifically, we design a Goal-Centered Reward to provide precise feedback across viewpoints to the agent, enabling it to expand perception and movement range through unrestricted perspectives. Inspired by curriculum learning, we introduce a Curriculum-Based Training strategy that progressively enhances the tracking performance in complex environments. Besides, experiments on simulator and real-world images demonstrate the superior performance of GC-VAT, achieving a Tracking Success Rate of approximately 72% on the simulator. The benchmark and code are available atthis https URL.
