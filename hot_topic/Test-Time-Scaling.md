- **[Poutine: Vision-Language-Trajectory Pre-Training and Reinforcement Learning Post-Training Enable Robust End-to-End Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11234)**  `arXiv:2506.11234`  `cs.RO` `cs.CV`

  Maintaining good driving behavior in out-of-distribution scenarios remains a critical challenge in autonomous driving. A promising direction is to leverage the generalist knowledge and reasoning capabilities of large-language models by treating unusual driving scenarios as a logical reasoning task. In this work, we present Poutine, a method that uses an off-the-shelf 3B-parameter vision-language model (VLM) - without any additional components - to achieve robust end-to-end autonomous driving via a simple and scalable training recipe. To learn strong base driving capabilities, we first train Poutine-Base using self-supervised next-token prediction over vision, language, and trajectory (VLT) tokens, leveraging both nominal and long-tail driving data. In the second stage, we fine-tune Poutine-Base using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with a small set of human preference-labeled examples. We evaluated our approach on the Waymo end-to-end driving benchmark curated for long-tail scenarios. The final Poutine model achieves an RFS of 7.99 on the test set, placing 1st in the 2025 Waymo Vision-Based End-to-End Driving Challenge by a significant margin. Our results suggest that handcrafted tokenizers or custom architectural components added to base VLMs in prior work are not necessary to achieve strong driving performance. Instead, this work highlights the potential of scalable VLT pretraining combined with lightweight RL fine-tuning to enable robust and generalizable autonomous driving.

  When a single pilot is responsible for managing a multi-drone system, the task demands varying levels of autonomy, from direct control of individual UAVs, to group-level coordination, to fully autonomous swarm behaviors for accomplishing high-level tasks. Enabling such flexible interaction requires a framework that supports multiple modes of shared autonomy. As language models continue to improve in reasoning and planning, they provide a natural foundation for such systems, reducing pilot workload by enabling high-level task delegation through intuitive, language-based interfaces. In this paper we present TACOS (Task-Agnostic COordinator of a multi-drone System), a unified framework that enables high-level natural language control of multi-UAV systems through Large Language Models (LLMs). TACOS integrates three key capabilities into a single architecture: a one-to-many natural language interface for intuitive user interaction, an intelligent coordinator for translating user intent into structured task plans, and an autonomous agent that executes plans interacting with the real-world. TACOS allows a LLM to interact with a library of executable APIs, bridging semantic reasoning with real-time multi-robot coordination. We demonstrate the system in real-world multi-drone system and conduct an ablation study to assess the contribution of each module.

- **[Nav-EE: Navigation-Guided Early Exiting for Efficient Vision-Language Models in Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01795)**  `arXiv:2510.01795`  `cs.RO` `cs.AI`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly applied in autonomous driving for unified perception and reasoning, but high inference latency hinders real-time deployment. Early-exit reduces latency by terminating inference at intermediate layers, yet its task-dependent nature limits generalization across diverse scenarios. We observe that this limitation aligns with autonomous driving: navigation systems can anticipate upcoming contexts (e.g., intersections, traffic lights), indicating which tasks will be required. We propose Nav-EE, a navigation-guided early-exit framework that precomputes task-specific exit layers offline and dynamically applies them online based on navigation priors. Experiments on CODA, Waymo, and BOSCH show that Nav-EE achieves accuracy comparable to full inference while reducing latency by up to 63.9%. Real-vehicle integration with Autoware Universe further demonstrates reduced inference latency (600ms to 300ms), supporting faster decision-making in complex scenarios. These results suggest that coupling navigation foresight with early-exit offers a viable path toward efficient deployment of large models in autonomous systems.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown potential for robot navigation but encounter fundamental limitations: they lack persistent scene memory, offer limited spatial reasoning, and do not scale effectively with video duration for real-time application. We present VL-KnG, a Visual Scene Understanding system that tackles these challenges using spatiotemporal knowledge graph construction and computationally efficient query processing for navigation goal identification. Our approach processes video sequences in chunks utilizing modern VLMs, creates persistent knowledge graphs that maintain object identity over time, and enables explainable spatial reasoning through queryable graph structures. We also introduce WalkieKnowledge, a new benchmark with about 200 manually annotated questions across 8 diverse trajectories spanning approximately 100 minutes of video data, enabling fair comparison between structured approaches and general-purpose VLMs. Real-world deployment on a differential drive robot demonstrates practical applicability, with our method achieving 77.27% success rate and 76.92% answer accuracy, matching Gemini 2.5 Pro performance while providing explainable reasoning supported by the knowledge graph, computational efficiency for real-time deployment across different tasks, such as localization, navigation and planning. Code and dataset will be released after acceptance.

  Recent advances in robotic manipulation have integrated low-level robotic control into Vision-Language Models (VLMs), extending them into Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models. Although state-of-the-art VLAs achieve strong performance in downstream robotic applications, supported by large-scale crowd-sourced robot training data, they still inevitably encounter failures during execution. Enabling robots to reason about and recover from unpredictable and abrupt failures remains a critical challenge. Existing robotic manipulation datasets, collected in either simulation or the real world, primarily provide only ground-truth trajectories, leaving robots unable to recover once failures occur. Moreover, the few datasets that address failure detection typically offer only textual explanations, which are difficult to utilize directly in VLA models. To address this gap, we introduce FailSafe, a novel failure generation and recovery system that automatically produces diverse failure cases paired with executable recovery actions. FailSafe can be seamlessly applied to any manipulation task in any simulator, enabling scalable creation of failure-action data. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we fine-tune LLaVa-OneVision-7B (LLaVa-OV-7B) to build FailSafe-VLM. Experimental results show that FailSafe-VLM successfully helps robotic arm detect and recover from potential failures, improving the performance of three state-of-the-art VLA models pi0-FAST, OpenVLA, OpenVLA-OFT) by up to 22.6% on average across several tasks in Maniskill. Furthermore, FailSafe-VLM could generalize across different spatial configurations, camera viewpoints, and robotic embodiments. We plan to release the FailSafe code to the community.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) provides a powerful framework for learning coordination in multi-agent systems. However, applying MARL to robotics still remains challenging due to high-dimensional continuous joint action spaces, complex reward design, and non-stationary transitions inherent to decentralized settings. On the other hand, humans learn complex coordination through staged curricula, where long-horizon behaviors are progressively built upon simpler skills. Motivated by this, we propose CRAFT: Coaching Reinforcement learning Autonomously using Foundation models for multi-robot coordination Tasks, a framework that leverages the reasoning capabilities of foundation models to act as a "coach" for multi-robot coordination. CRAFT automatically decomposes long-horizon coordination tasks into sequences of subtasks using the planning capability of Large Language Models (LLMs). In what follows, CRAFT trains each subtask using reward functions generated by LLM, and refines them through a Vision Language Model (VLM)-guided reward-refinement loop. We evaluate CRAFT on multi-quadruped navigation and bimanual manipulation tasks, demonstrating its capability to learn complex coordination behaviors. In addition, we validate the multi-quadruped navigation policy in real hardware experiments.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) open new possibilities for constructing realistic and interpretable macroeconomic simulations. We present SimCity, a multi-agent framework that leverages LLMs to model an interpretable macroeconomic system with heterogeneous agents and rich interactions. Unlike classical equilibrium models that limit heterogeneity for tractability, or traditional agent-based models (ABMs) that rely on hand-crafted decision rules, SimCity enables flexible, adaptive behavior with transparent natural-language reasoning. Within SimCity, four core agent types (households, firms, a central bank, and a government) deliberate and participate in a frictional labor market, a heterogeneous goods market, and a financial market. Furthermore, a Vision-Language Model (VLM) determines the geographic placement of new firms and renders a mapped virtual city, allowing us to study both macroeconomic regularities and urban expansion dynamics within a unified environment. To evaluate the framework, we compile a checklist of canonical macroeconomic phenomena, including price elasticity of demand, Engel's Law, Okun's Law, the Phillips Curve, and the Beveridge Curve, and show that SimCity naturally reproduces these empirical patterns while remaining robust across simulation runs.

- **[StockBench: Can LLM Agents Trade Stocks Profitably In Real-world Markets?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02209)**  `arXiv:2510.02209`  `cs.LG` `cs.CL`  
  _Yanxu Chen, Zijun Yao, Yantao Liu, Jin Ye, Jianing Yu, Lei Hou, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated strong capabilities as autonomous agents, showing promise in reasoning, tool use, and sequential decision-making. While prior benchmarks have evaluated LLM agents in domains such as software engineering and scientific discovery, the finance domain remains underexplored, despite its direct relevance to economic value and high-stakes decision-making. Existing financial benchmarks primarily test static knowledge through question answering, but they fall short of capturing the dynamic and iterative nature of trading. To address this gap, we introduce StockBench, a contamination-free benchmark designed to evaluate LLM agents in realistic, multi-month stock trading environments. Agents receive daily market signals -- including prices, fundamentals, and news -- and must make sequential buy, sell, or hold decisions. Performance is assessed using financial metrics such as cumulative return, maximum drawdown, and the Sortino ratio. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art proprietary (e.g., GPT-5, Claude-4) and open-weight (e.g., Qwen3, Kimi-K2, GLM-4.5) models shows that while most LLM agents struggle to outperform the simple buy-and-hold baseline, several models demonstrate the potential to deliver higher returns and manage risk more effectively. These findings highlight both the challenges and opportunities in developing LLM-powered financial agents, showing that excelling at static financial knowledge tasks does not necessarily translate into successful trading strategies. We release StockBench as an open-source resource to support reproducibility and advance future research in this domain.

  _Weizhe Chen, Sven Koenig, Bistra Dilkina_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Since the release of Deepseek-R1, reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has become a central approach for training large language models (LLMs) on reasoning tasks. Recent work has largely focused on modifying loss functions to make RLVR more efficient and effective. In this paper, motivated by studies of overthinking in LLMs, we propose Length-aware Sampling for Policy Optimization (LSPO), a novel meta-RLVR algorithm that dynamically selects training data at each step based on the average response length. We evaluate LSPO across multiple base models and datasets, demonstrating that it consistently improves learning effectiveness. In addition, we conduct a detailed ablation study to examine alternative ways of incorporating length signals into dynamic sampling, offering further insights and highlighting promising directions for future research.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In post-training for reasoning Large Language Models (LLMs), the current state of practice trains LLMs in two independent stages: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR, shortened as ``RL'' below). In this work, we challenge whether high SFT scores translate to improved performance after RL. We provide extensive counter-examples where this is not true. We find high SFT scores can be biased toward simpler or more homogeneous data and are not reliably predictive of subsequent RL gains or scaled-up post-training effectiveness. In some cases, RL training on models with improved SFT performance could lead to substantially worse outcome compared to RL on the base model without SFT. We study alternative metrics and identify generalization loss on held-out reasoning examples and Pass@large k performance to provide strong proxies for the RL outcome. We trained hundreds of models up to 12B-parameter with SFT and RLVR via GRPO and ran extensive evaluations on 7 math benchmarks with up to 256 repetitions, spending $>$1M GPU hours. Experiments include models from Llama3, Mistral-Nemo, Qwen3 and multiple state-of-the-art SFT/RL datasets. Compared to directly predicting from pre-RL performance, prediction based on generalization loss and Pass@large k achieves substantial higher precision, improving $R^2$ coefficient and Spearman's rank correlation coefficient by up to 0.5 (2x). This provides strong utility for broad use cases. For example, in most experiments, we find SFT training on unique examples for a one epoch underperforms training on half examples for two epochs, either after SFT or SFT-then-RL; With the same SFT budget, training only on short examples may lead to better SFT performance, though, it often leads to worse outcome after RL compared to training on examples with varying lengths. Evaluation tool will be open-sourced.

- **[Control the Temperature: Selective Sampling for Diverse and High-Quality LLM Outputs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01218)**  `arXiv:2510.01218`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI` `cs.CL`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Diversity is an essential metric for evaluating the creativity of outputs generated by language models. Temperature-based sampling is a common strategy to increase diversity. However, for tasks that require high precision, e.g., mathematical reasoning, uncontrolled high temperature sampling, e.g., min-$p$ or top-$p$, degrades reasoning quality. We demonstrate that the loss of accuracy is caused by sampling incorrect continuations in sensitive decoding positions. To address this, in this paper, we propose \textbf{selective sampling}, a method that dynamically switches between greedy and high-temperature sampling based on a sampling risk metric. This risk metric estimates the likelihood of output errors when applying high-temperature sampling on the current token position. To predict sampling risk, we train a lightweight classifier on a small subset of verifiable problems. The trained classifier can be integrated with the base language model with minimal latency overhead. Experiments on mathematical reasoning tasks demonstrate that selective sampling enhances the quality-diversity trade-off, even in high-temperature settings.

  _Jiashun Liu, Johan Obando-Ceron, Han Lu, Yancheng He, Weixun Wang, Wenbo Su, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Most recent RL for LLMs (RL4LLM) methods avoid explicit critics, replacing them with average advantage baselines. This shift is largely pragmatic: conventional value functions are computationally expensive to train at LLM scale and often fail under sparse rewards and long reasoning horizons. We revisit this bottleneck from an architectural perspective and introduce Asymmetric Proximal Policy Optimization (AsyPPO), a simple and scalable framework that restores the critics role while remaining efficient in large-model settings. AsyPPO employs a set of lightweight mini-critics, each trained on disjoint prompt shards. This design encourages diversity while preserving calibration, reducing value-estimation bias. Beyond robust estimation, AsyPPO leverages inter-critic uncertainty to refine the policy update: (i) masking advantages in states where critics agree and gradients add little learning signal, and (ii) filtering high-divergence states from entropy regularization, suppressing spurious exploration. After training on open-source data with only 5,000 samples, AsyPPO consistently improves learning stability and performance across multiple benchmarks over strong baselines, such as GRPO, achieving performance gains of more than six percent on Qwen3-4b-Base and about three percent on Qwen3-8b-Base and Qwen3-14b-Base over classic PPO, without additional tricks. These results highlight the importance of architectural innovations for scalable, efficient algorithms.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) are largely driven by reinforcement learning (RL), yet the underlying parameter dynamics during RL training remain poorly understood. This work identifies two fundamental properties of RL-induced parameter updates in LLMs: (1) Rank-1 Dominance, where the top singular subspace of the parameter update matrix nearly fully determines reasoning improvements, recovering over 99\% of performance gains; and (2) Rank-1 Linear Dynamics, where this dominant subspace evolves linearly throughout training, enabling accurate prediction from early checkpoints. Extensive experiments across 8 LLMs and 7 algorithms validate the generalizability of these properties. More importantly, based on these findings, we propose AlphaRL, a plug-in acceleration framework that extrapolates the final parameter update using a short early training window, achieving up to 2.5 speedup while retaining \textgreater 96\% of reasoning performance without extra modules or hyperparameter tuning. This positions our finding as a versatile and practical tool for large-scale RL, opening a path toward principled, interpretable, and efficient training paradigm for LLMs.

- **[When Reasoning Meets Compression: Understanding the Effects of LLMs Compression on Large Reasoning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02010)**  `arXiv:2504.02010`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`

  Compression methods, including quantization, distillation, and pruning, improve the computational efficiency of large reasoning models (LRMs). However, existing studies either fail to sufficiently compare all three compression methods on LRMs or lack in-depth interpretation analysis. In this paper, we investigate how the reasoning capabilities of LRMs are compromised during compression, through performance benchmarking and mechanistic interpretation. To uncover the effects of compression on reasoning performance, we benchmark quantized, distilled, and pruned DeepSeek-R1 models on four reasoning datasets (AIME 2024, FOLIO, Temporal Sequences, and MuSiQue). To precisely locate compression effects on model weights, we adapt difference of means and attribution patching techniques, focusing on the activation of every linear component in compressed LRMs, to interpret fine-grained causal relationships between weights and various reasoning capabilities. This fine-grained interpretation addresses a fundamental question of compression: which weights are the most important for reasoning? Overall, we find dynamically quantized 2.51-bit R1 reaches close-to-R1 performance. With empirical verification, we present three main findings that generalize across both Llama and Qwen: (1) Weight count has a greater impact on LRMs' knowledge memorization than reasoning, highlighting the risks of pruning and distillation; (2) The MLP up projection in the final layer of distilled LRMs is one of the most important components, offering a new perspective on locating critical weights - a fundamental problem in model compression; and (3) Current quantization methods overly compress the final-layer modules and MLP gate projections, so protecting just 2% of all weights that are excessively compressed can raise average accuracy by 6.57%, greatly surpassing the state-of-the-art.

  _Juntao Zhao, Wenhao Lu, Sheng Wang, Lingpeng Kong, Chuan Wu_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Quantization is widely adopted to accelerate inference and reduce memory consumption in large language models (LLMs). While activation-weight joint quantization enables efficient low-precision decoding, it suffers from substantial performance degradation on multi-step reasoning tasks. We propose QSpec, a novel quantization paradigm that decouples efficiency from quality by integrating two complementary schemes via speculative decoding: low-precision joint quantization for fast drafting and high-precision weight-only quantization for accurate verification. QSpec reuses both weights and KV cache across stages, enabling near-zero-cost switching without retraining or auxiliary models. Compared to high-precision baselines, QSpec achieves up to 1.64x speedup without quality degradation, and outperforms state-of-the-art speculative decoding methods by up to 1.55x in batched settings. Furthermore, QSpec supports plug-and-play deployment and generalizes well across model scales, quantization methods, and workloads. These properties make QSpec a practical and scalable solution for high-fidelity quantized LLM serving under memory-constrained scenarios. Our code is available atthis https URL.

- **[KaVa: Latent Reasoning via Compressed KV-Cache Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02312)**  `arXiv:2510.02312`  `cs.LG`  
  _Anna Kuzina, Maciej Pioro, Paul N. Whatmough, Babak Ehteshami Bejnordi_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at multi-step reasoning problems with explicit chain-of-thought (CoT), but verbose traces incur significant computational costs and memory overhead, and often carry redundant, stylistic artifacts. Latent reasoning has emerged as an efficient alternative that internalizes the thought process, but it suffers from a critical lack of supervision, limiting its effectiveness on complex, natural-language reasoning traces. In this work, we propose KaVa, the first framework that bridges this gap by distilling knowledge directly from a compressed KV-cache of the teacher into a latent-reasoning student via self-distillation, leveraging the representational flexibility of continuous latent tokens to align stepwise KV trajectories. We show that the abstract, unstructured knowledge within compressed KV-cache, which lacks direct token correspondence, can serve as a rich supervisory signal for a latent reasoning student. Empirically, the approach consistently outperforms strong latent baselines, exhibits markedly smaller degradation from equation-only to natural-language traces, and scales to larger backbones while preserving efficiency. These results establish compressed KV-cache distillation as a scalable supervision signal for latent reasoning, combining the accuracy of CoT-trained teachers with the efficiency and deployability of latent inference.

- **[Executable Counterfactuals: Improving LLMs' Causal Reasoning Through Code](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01539)**  `arXiv:2510.01539`  `cs.LG`  
  _Aniket Vashishtha, Qirun Dai, Hongyuan Mei, Amit Sharma, Chenhao Tan, Hao Peng_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Counterfactual reasoning, a hallmark of intelligence, consists of three steps: inferring latent variables from observations (abduction), constructing alternatives (interventions), and predicting their outcomes (prediction). This skill is essential for advancing LLMs' causal understanding and expanding their applications in high-stakes domains such as scientific research. However, existing efforts in assessing LLM's counterfactual reasoning capabilities tend to skip the abduction step, effectively reducing to interventional reasoning and leading to overestimation of LLM performance. To address this, we introduce executable counterfactuals, a novel framework that operationalizes causal reasoning through code and math problems. Our framework explicitly requires all three steps of counterfactual reasoning and enables scalable synthetic data creation with varying difficulty, creating a frontier for evaluating and improving LLM's reasoning. Our results reveal substantial drop in accuracy (25-40%) from interventional to counterfactual reasoning for SOTA models like o4-mini and Claude-4-Sonnet. To address this gap, we construct a training set comprising counterfactual code problems having if-else condition and test on out-of-domain code structures (e.g. having while-loop); we also test whether a model trained on code would generalize to counterfactual math word problems. While supervised finetuning on stronger models' reasoning traces improves in-domain performance of Qwen models, it leads to a decrease in accuracy on OOD tasks such as counterfactual math problems. In contrast, reinforcement learning induces the core cognitive behaviors and generalizes to new domains, yielding gains over the base model on both code (improvement of 1.5x-2x) and math problems. Analysis of the reasoning traces reinforces these findings and highlights the promise of RL for improving LLMs' counterfactual reasoning.

  _Akshat Ramachandran, Marina Neseem, Charbel Sakr, Rangharajan Venkatesan, Brucek Khailany, Tushar Krishna_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The long-output context generation of large reasoning models enables extended chain of thought (CoT) but also drives rapid growth of the key-value (KV) cache, quickly overwhelming GPU memory. To address this challenge, we propose ThinKV, a thought-adaptive KV cache compression framework. ThinKV is based on the observation that attention sparsity reveals distinct thought types with varying importance within the CoT. It applies a hybrid quantization-eviction strategy, assigning token precision by thought importance and progressively evicting tokens from less critical thoughts as reasoning trajectories evolve. Furthermore, to implement ThinKV, we design a kernel that extends PagedAttention to enable efficient reuse of evicted tokens' memory slots, eliminating compaction overheads. Extensive experiments on DeepSeek-R1-Distill, GPT-OSS, and NVIDIA AceReason across mathematics and coding benchmarks show that ThinKV achieves near-lossless accuracy with less than 5% of the original KV cache, while improving performance with up to 5.8x higher inference throughput over state-of-the-art baselines.

- **[MissionHD: Hyperdimensional Refinement of Distribution-Deficient Reasoning Graphs for Video Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14746)**  `arXiv:2508.14746`  `cs.LG`  
  _Sanggeon Yun, Raheeb Hassan, Ryozo Masukawa, Nathaniel D. Bastian, Mohsen Imani_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  LLM-generated reasoning graphs, referred to as mission-specific graphs (MSGs), are increasingly used for video anomaly detection (VAD) and recognition (VAR). These MSGs are novel artifacts: they often exhibit skewed connectivity and lack large-scale datasets for pre-training, which makes existing graph structure refinement (GSR) methods ineffective. To address this challenge, we propose HDC-constrained Graph Structure Refinement (HDC-GSR), a paradigm that leverages hyperdimensional computing (HDC) to optimize decodable graph representations without relying on structural-distribution learning. Building on this paradigm, we introduce MissionHD, an HDC framework that encodes graphs with constrained graph-neural operations, aligns them directly with downstream task loss, and decodes refined structures. Experiments on VAD/VAR benchmarks demonstrate that MissionHD-refined graphs consistently improve performance, establishing HDC-GSR as an effective pre-processing step for structured reasoning in video anomaly tasks.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models aim to unify perception, language understanding, and action generation, offering strong cross-task and cross-scene generalization with broad impact on embodied AI. However, current VLA models often lack explicit step-by-step reasoning, instead emitting final actions without considering affordance constraints or geometric relations. Their post-training pipelines also rarely reinforce reasoning quality, relying primarily on supervised fine-tuning with weak reward design. To address these challenges, we present VLA-R1, a reasoning-enhanced VLA that integrates Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to systematically optimize both reasoning and execution. Specifically, we design an RLVR-based post-training strategy with verifiable rewards for region alignment, trajectory consistency, and output formatting, thereby strengthening reasoning robustness and execution accuracy. Moreover, we develop VLA-CoT-13K, a high-quality dataset that provides chain-of-thought supervision explicitly aligned with affordance and trajectory annotations. Furthermore, extensive evaluations on in-domain, out-of-domain, simulation, and real-robot platforms demonstrate that VLA-R1 achieves superior generalization and real-world performance compared to prior VLA methods.

  With the rapid advancement of AI-generated videos, there is an urgent need for effective detection tools to mitigate societal risks such as misinformation and reputational harm. In addition to accurate classification, it is essential that detection models provide interpretable explanations to ensure transparency for regulators and end users. To address these challenges, we introduce VidGuard-R1, the first video authenticity detector that fine-tunes a multi-modal large language model (MLLM) using group relative policy optimization (GRPO). Our model delivers both highly accurate judgments and insightful reasoning. We curate a challenging dataset of 140k real and AI-generated videos produced by state-of-the-art generation models, carefully designing the generation process to maximize discrimination difficulty. We then fine-tune Qwen-VL using GRPO with two specialized reward models that target temporal artifacts and generation complexity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VidGuard-R1 achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on existing benchmarks, with additional training pushing accuracy above 95%. Case studies further show that VidGuard-R1 produces precise and interpretable rationales behind its predictions. The code is publicly available atthis https URL.

  We develop ImageNet-Think, a multimodal reasoning dataset designed to aid the development of Vision Language Models (VLMs) with explicit reasoning capabilities. Our dataset is built on 250,000 images from ImageNet21k dataset, providing structured thinking tokens and corresponding answers. Our synthetic dataset is generated by two state-of-the-art VLMs: GLM-4.1V-9B-Thinking and Kimi-VL-A3B-Thinking-2506. Each image is accompanied by two pairs of thinking-answer sequences, creating a resource for training and evaluating multimodal reasoning models. We capture the step-by-step reasoning process of VLMs and the final descriptive answers. Our goal with this dataset is to enable the development of more robust VLMs while contributing to the broader understanding of multimodal reasoning mechanisms. The dataset and evaluation benchmarks will be publicly available to aid research in reasoning/thinking multimodal VLMs.

  Vision language models (VLMs) perform well on many tasks but often fail at spatial reasoning, which is essential for navigation and interaction with physical environments. Many spatial reasoning tasks depend on fundamental two-dimensional (2D) skills, yet our evaluation shows that state-of-the-art VLMs give implausible or incorrect answers to composite spatial problems, including simple pathfinding tasks that humans solve effortlessly. To address this, we enhance 2D spatial reasoning in VLMs by training them only on basic spatial capabilities. We first disentangle 2D spatial reasoning into three core components: direction comprehension, distance estimation, and localization. We hypothesize that mastering these skills substantially improves performance on complex spatial tasks that require advanced reasoning and combinatorial problem solving, while also generalizing to real-world scenarios. To test this, we introduce Sparkle, a framework that generates synthetic data to provide targeted supervision across these three capabilities and yields an instruction dataset for each. Experiments show that VLMs fine-tuned with \emph{Sparkle} improve not only on basic tasks but also on composite and out-of-distribution real-world spatial reasoning tasks. These results indicate that enhancing basic spatial skills through synthetic generalization effectively advances complex spatial reasoning and offers a systematic strategy for boosting the spatial understanding of VLMs. Source codes of Sparkle are available atthis https URL.

  We introduce the novel task of Language-Guided Object Placement in Real 3D Scenes. Our model is given a 3D scene's point cloud, a 3D asset, and a textual prompt broadly describing where the 3D asset should be placed. The task here is to find a valid placement for the 3D asset that respects the prompt. Compared with other language-guided localization tasks in 3D scenes such as grounding, this task has specific challenges: it is ambiguous because it has multiple valid solutions, and it requires reasoning about 3D geometric relationships and free space. We inaugurate this task by proposing a new benchmark and evaluation protocol. We also introduce a new dataset for training 3D LLMs on this task, as well as the first method to serve as a non-trivial baseline. We believe that this challenging task and our new benchmark could become part of the suite of benchmarks used to evaluate and compare generalist 3D LLM models.

  Web agents promise to automate complex browser tasks, but current methods remain brittle -- relying on step-by-step UI interactions and heavy LLM reasoning that break under dynamic layouts and long horizons. Humans, by contrast, exploit website-provided functionality through high-level operations like search, filter, and sort. We introduce WALT (Web Agents that Learn Tools), a framework that reverse-engineers latent website functionality into reusable invocable tools. Rather than hypothesizing ad-hoc skills, WALT exposes robust implementations of automations already designed into websites -- spanning discovery (search, filter, sort), communication (post, comment, upvote), and content management (create, edit, delete). Tools abstract away low-level execution: instead of reasoning about how to click and type, agents simply call search(query) or create(listing). This shifts the computational burden from fragile step-by-step reasoning to reliable tool invocation. On VisualWebArena and WebArena, WALT achieves higher success with fewer steps and less LLM-dependent reasoning, establishing a robust and generalizable paradigm for browser automation.

  The diffusion models are widely used for image and video generation, but their iterative generation process is slow and expansive. While existing distillation approaches have demonstrated the potential for one-step generation in the image domain, they still suffer from significant quality degradation. In this work, we propose Adversarial Post-Training (APT) against real data following diffusion pre-training for one-step video generation. To improve the training stability and quality, we introduce several improvements to the model architecture and training procedures, along with an approximated R1 regularization objective. Empirically, our experiments show that our adversarial post-trained model, Seaweed-APT, can generate 2-second, 1280x720, 24fps videos in real time using a single forward evaluation step. Additionally, our model is capable of generating 1024px images in a single step, achieving quality comparable to state-of-the-art methods.

  Spatial intelligence spans a rich suite of abilities, including visualising and transforming shapes, mentally rotating objects, judging relational positions and containment, and estimating numerosity. However, it still remains a critical unresolved challenge for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs).To fill this gap, we propose to treat Euclidean geometry problem-solving as a surrogate task. Specifically, we meticulously constructed a curated multimodal dataset, called Euclid30K, comprising approximately 30K plane and solid geometry problems. To enable the model to acquire and apply Euclidean principles from these geometry problems, we employed Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to finetune the Qwen2.5VL family and RoboBrain2.0 family, inspiring the models to identify shapes, count, and relate entities, and perform multi-step deductive reasoning using Euclidean principles. Our experiments demonstrate that the resulting models achieve substantial zero-shot gains across four spatial reasoning benchmarks (Super-CLEVR, Omni3DBench, VSI-Bench, and MindCube) without any task-specific adaptations. Notably, after training on the Euclid30K, the mean VSI-Bench accuracy of all evaluated models rose from 34.5% to 40.5%, improving by 5.5 percentage points. Among them, RoboBrain2.0-Euclid-7B achieves 49.6\% accuracy, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art model,this http URLour knowledge, this is the first systematic study showing that geometry-centric fine-tuning can confer vision-language models with broadly transferable spatial skills.

  Fine-grained visual reasoning remains a core challenge for multimodal large language models (MLLMs). The recently introduced ReasonMap highlights this gap by showing that even advanced MLLMs struggle with spatial reasoning in structured and information-rich settings such as transit maps, a task of clear practical and scientific importance. However, standard reinforcement learning (RL) on such tasks is impeded by sparse rewards and unstable optimization. To address this, we first construct ReasonMap-Plus, an extended dataset that introduces dense reward signals through Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks, enabling effective cold-start training of fine-grained visual understanding skills. Next, we propose RewardMap, a multi-stage RL framework designed to improve both visual understanding and reasoning capabilities of MLLMs. RewardMap incorporates two key designs. First, we introduce a difficulty-aware reward design that incorporates detail rewards, directly tackling the sparse rewards while providing richer supervision. Second, we propose a multi-stage RL scheme that bootstraps training from simple perception to complex reasoning tasks, offering a more effective cold-start strategy than conventional Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). Experiments on ReasonMap and ReasonMap-Plus demonstrate that each component of RewardMap contributes to consistent performance gains, while their combination yields the best results. Moreover, models trained with RewardMap achieve an average improvement of 3.47% across 6 benchmarks spanning spatial reasoning, fine-grained visual reasoning, and general tasks beyond transit maps, underscoring enhanced visual understanding and reasoning capabilities.

  Prompting has emerged as a practical way to adapt frozen vision-language models (VLMs) for video anomaly detection (VAD). Yet, existing prompts are often overly abstract, overlooking the fine-grained human-object interactions or action semantics that define complex anomalies in surveillance videos. We propose ASK-Hint, a structured prompting framework that leverages action-centric knowledge to elicit more accurate and interpretable reasoning from frozen VLMs. Our approach organizes prompts into semantically coherent groups (e.g. violence, property crimes, public safety) and formulates fine-grained guiding questions that align model predictions with discriminative visual cues. Extensive experiments on UCF-Crime and XD-Violence show that ASK-Hint consistently improves AUC over prior baselines, achieving state-of-the-art performance compared to both fine-tuned and training-free methods. Beyond accuracy, our framework provides interpretable reasoning traces towards anomaly and demonstrates strong generalization across datasets and VLM backbones. These results highlight the critical role of prompt granularity and establish ASK-Hint as a new training-free and generalizable solution for explainable video anomaly detection.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at many multimodal tasks, yet they frequently struggle with tasks requiring precise understanding and handling of fine-grained visual elements. This is mainly due to information loss during image encoding or insufficient attention to critical regions. Recent work has shown promise by incorporating pixel-level visual information into the reasoning process, enabling VLMs to access high-resolution visual details during their thought process. However, this pixel-level information is often overused, leading to inefficiency and distraction from irrelevant visual details. To address these challenges, we propose the first framework for adaptive pixel reasoning that dynamically determines necessary pixel-level operations based on the input query. Specifically, we first apply operation-aware supervised fine-tuning to establish baseline competence in textual reasoning and visual operations, then design a novel rollout-guided reinforcement learning framework relying on feedback of the model's own responses, which enables the VLM to determine when pixel operations should be invoked based on query difficulty. Experiments on extensive multimodal reasoning benchmarks show that our model achieves superior performance while significantly reducing unnecessary visual operations. Impressively, our model achieves 73.4\% accuracy on HR-Bench 4K while maintaining a tool usage ratio of only 20.1\%, improving accuracy and simultaneously reducing tool usage by 66.5\% compared to the previous methods.

  Reasoning has emerged as a pivotal capability in Large Language Models (LLMs). Through Reinforcement Learning (RL), typically Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), these models are able to solve complex tasks such as mathematics and code generation. Building on these advances, recent research has sought to extend reasoning to Vision-Language Models (VLMs), yielding promising results across diverse visual tasks. Despite this progress, our study uncovers the dual nature of multimodal reasoning: while it substantially enhances logical inference and facilitates performance on challenging problems, it may gradually impair perceptual grounding, leading to recognition failures on otherwise basic visual questions. Through further analysis, we attribute this phenomenon to visual forgetting, wherein prolonged reasoning causes the model to increasingly disregard visual input. To address this, we propose Vision-Anchored Policy Optimization (VAPO), a simple yet effective method that explicitly steers the reasoning process toward visually grounded trajectories. Our result model, VAPO-Thinker-7B, significantly strengthens the model's reliance on visual information and achieves new state-of-the-art results on a wide range of established benchmarks.

  Video Large Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable results on a variety of vision language tasks, yet their practical use is limited by the "needle in a haystack" problem: the massive number of visual tokens produced from raw video frames exhausts the model's context window. Existing solutions alleviate this issue by selecting a sparse set of frames, thereby reducing token count, but such frame-wise selection discards essential temporal dynamics, leading to suboptimal reasoning about motion and event continuity. In this work we systematically explore the impact of temporal information and demonstrate that extending selection from isolated key frames to key clips, which are short, temporally coherent segments, improves video understanding. To maintain a fixed computational budget while accommodating the larger token footprint of clips, we propose an adaptive resolution strategy that dynamically balances spatial resolution and clip length, ensuring a constant token count per video. Experiments on three long-form video benchmarks demonstrate that our training-free approach, F2C, outperforms uniform sampling up to 8.1%, 5.6%, and 10.3% on Video-MME, LongVideoBench and MLVU benchmarks, respectively. These results highlight the importance of preserving temporal coherence in frame selection and provide a practical pathway for scaling Video LLMs to real world video understanding applications.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS) editing still face challenges with view, temporal, and non-editing region consistency, as well as with handling complex text instructions. To address these issues, we propose 4DGS-Craft, a consistent and interactive 4DGS editing framework. We first introduce a 4D-aware InstructPix2Pix model to ensure both view and temporal consistency. This model incorporates 4D VGGT geometry features extracted from the initial scene, enabling it to capture underlying 4D geometric structures during editing. We further enhance this model with a multi-view grid module that enforces consistency by iteratively refining multi-view input images while jointly optimizing the underlying 4D scene. Furthermore, we preserve the consistency of non-edited regions through a novel Gaussian selection mechanism, which identifies and optimizes only the Gaussians within the edited regions. Beyond consistency, facilitating user interaction is also crucial for effective 4DGS editing. Therefore, we design an LLM-based module for user intent understanding. This module employs a user instruction template to define atomic editing operations and leverages an LLM for reasoning. As a result, our framework can interpret user intent and decompose complex instructions into a logical sequence of atomic operations, enabling it to handle intricate user commands and further enhance editing performance. Compared to related works, our approach enables more consistent and controllable 4D scene editing. Our code will be made available upon acceptance.

  Medical Image Quality Assessment (IQA) serves as the first-mile safety gate for clinical AI, yet existing approaches remain constrained by scalar, score-based metrics and fail to reflect the descriptive, human-like reasoning process central to expert evaluation. To address this gap, we introduce MedQ-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark that establishes a perception-reasoning paradigm for language-based evaluation of medical image quality with Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs). MedQ-Bench defines two complementary tasks: (1) MedQ-Perception, which probes low-level perceptual capability via human-curated questions on fundamental visual attributes; and (2) MedQ-Reasoning, encompassing both no-reference and comparison reasoning tasks, aligning model evaluation with human-like reasoning on image quality. The benchmark spans five imaging modalities and over forty quality attributes, totaling 2,600 perceptual queries and 708 reasoning assessments, covering diverse image sources including authentic clinical acquisitions, images with simulated degradations via physics-based reconstructions, and AI-generated images. To evaluate reasoning ability, we propose a multi-dimensional judging protocol that assesses model outputs along four complementary axes. We further conduct rigorous human-AI alignment validation by comparing LLM-based judgement with radiologists. Our evaluation of 14 state-of-the-art MLLMs demonstrates that models exhibit preliminary but unstable perceptual and reasoning skills, with insufficient accuracy for reliable clinical use. These findings highlight the need for targeted optimization of MLLMs in medical IQA. We hope that MedQ-Bench will catalyze further exploration and unlock the untapped potential of MLLMs for medical image quality evaluation.

  MLLMs (Multimodal Large Language Models) have showcased remarkable capabilities, but their performance in high-stakes, domain-specific scenarios like surgical settings, remains largely under-explored. To address this gap, we develop \textbf{EyePCR}, a large-scale benchmark for ophthalmic surgery analysis, grounded in structured clinical knowledge to evaluate cognition across \textit{Perception}, \textit{Comprehension} and \textit{Reasoning}. EyePCR offers a richly annotated corpus with more than 210k VQAs, which cover 1048 fine-grained attributes for multi-view perception, medical knowledge graph of more than 25k triplets for comprehension, and four clinically grounded reasoning tasks. The rich annotations facilitate in-depth cognitive analysis, simulating how surgeons perceive visual cues and combine them with domain knowledge to make decisions, thus greatly improving models' cognitive ability. In particular, \textbf{EyePCR-MLLM}, a domain-adapted variant of Qwen2.5-VL-7B, achieves the highest accuracy on MCQs for \textit{Perception} among compared models and outperforms open-source models in \textit{Comprehension} and \textit{Reasoning}, rivalling commercial models like GPT-4.1. EyePCR reveals the limitations of existing MLLMs in surgical cognition and lays the foundation for benchmarking and enhancing clinical reliability of surgical video understanding models.

  Vision-Language Models (VLMs) show promise in medical image analysis, yet their capacity for structured reasoning in complex domains like dermatology is often limited by data scarcity and the high computational cost of advanced training techniques. To address these challenges, we introduce DermIQ-VLM, a VLM developed through a multi-stage, resource-efficient methodology designed to emulate a dermatologist's diagnostic process. Our primary contribution is a modified version of Grouped Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), called GRPO++, which stabilizes the powerful but data-intensive GRPO framework. Our proposed training pipeline first employs GRPO++ for reasoning-oriented disease recognition, followed by supervised fine-tuning for conversational ability. To mitigate factual errors introduced during this step, we then align the model using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), leveraging a Knowledge Graph-based system as a scalable proxy for expert preference. A preliminary evaluation on a curated dermatological dataset demonstrates that our proposed methodology yields notable performance gains over standard fine-tuning approaches. These findings validate the potential of our pipeline as a feasible pathway for developing specialized, reliable VLMs in resource-constrained environments.

  Probabilistic reasoning is a key aspect of both human and artificial intelligence that allows for handling uncertainty and ambiguity in decision-making. In this paper, we introduce a new numerical reasoning task under uncertainty for large language models, focusing on estimating the privacy risk of user-generated documents containing privacy-sensitive information. We propose BRANCH, a new LLM methodology that estimates the k-privacy value of a text-the size of the population matching the given information. BRANCH factorizes a joint probability distribution of personal information as random variables. The probability of each factor in a population is estimated separately using a Bayesian network and combined to compute the final k-value. Our experiments show that this method successfully estimates the k-value 73% of the time, a 13% increase compared to o3-mini with chain-of-thought reasoning. We also find that LLM uncertainty is a good indicator for accuracy, as high-variance predictions are 37.47% less accurate on average.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning abilities on complex problems using long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. However, they often suffer from overthinking, meaning generating unnecessarily lengthy reasoning steps for simpler problems. This issue may degrade the efficiency of the models and make them difficult to adapt the reasoning depth to the complexity of problems. To address this, we introduce a novel metric Token Entropy Cumulative Average (TECA), which measures the extent of exploration throughout the reasoning process. We further propose a novel reasoning paradigm -- Explore Briefly, Then Decide -- with an associated Cumulative Entropy Regulation (CER) mechanism. This paradigm leverages TECA to help the model dynamically determine the optimal point to conclude its thought process and provide a final answer, thus achieving efficient reasoning. Experimental results across diverse mathematical benchmarks show that our approach substantially mitigates overthinking without sacrificing problem-solving ability. With our thinking paradigm, the average response length decreases by up to 71% on simpler datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method in creating a more efficient and adaptive reasoning process.

  Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is a promising paradigm for enhancing the reasoning ability in Large Language Models (LLMs). However, prevailing methods primarily rely on self-exploration or a single off-policy teacher to elicit long chain-of-thought (LongCoT) reasoning, which may introduce intrinsic model biases and restrict exploration, ultimately limiting reasoning diversity and performance. Drawing inspiration from multi-teacher strategies in knowledge distillation, we introduce Adaptive Multi-Guidance Policy Optimization (AMPO), a novel framework that adaptively leverages guidance from multiple proficient teacher models, but only when the on-policy model fails to generate correct solutions. This "guidance-on-demand" approach expands exploration while preserving the value of self-discovery. Moreover, AMPO incorporates a comprehension-based selection mechanism, prompting the student to learn from the reasoning paths that it is most likely to comprehend, thus balancing broad exploration with effective exploitation. Extensive experiments show AMPO substantially outperforms a strong baseline (GRPO), with a 4.3% improvement on mathematical reasoning tasks and 12.2% on out-of-distribution tasks, while significantly boosting Pass@k performance and enabling more diverse exploration. Notably, using four peer-sized teachers, our method achieves comparable results to approaches that leverage a single, more powerful teacher (e.g., DeepSeek-R1) with more data. These results demonstrate a more efficient and scalable path to superior reasoning and generalizability. Our code is available atthis https URL.

  Large language models (LLMs) often generate hallucinations -- unsupported content that undermines reliability. While most prior works frame hallucination detection as a binary task, many real-world applications require identifying hallucinated spans, which is a multi-step decision making process. This naturally raises the question of whether explicit reasoning can help the complex task of detecting hallucination spans. To answer this question, we first evaluate pretrained models with and without Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, and show that CoT reasoning has the potential to generate at least one correct answer when sampled multiple times. Motivated by this, we propose RL4HS, a reinforcement learning framework that incentivizes reasoning with a span-level reward function. RL4HS builds on Group Relative Policy Optimization and introduces Class-Aware Policy Optimization to mitigate reward imbalance issue. Experiments on the RAGTruth benchmark (summarization, question answering, data-to-text) show that RL4HS surpasses pretrained reasoning models and supervised fine-tuning, demonstrating the necessity of reinforcement learning with span-level rewards for detecting hallucination spans.

  Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) systems rely on high-quality benchmarks to evaluate complex multi-hop reasoning. However, despite their widespread use, popular datasets such as WebQSP and CWQ suffer from critical quality issues, including inaccurate or incomplete ground-truth annotations, poorly constructed questions that are ambiguous, trivial, or unanswerable, and outdated or inconsistent knowledge. Through a manual audit of 16 popular KGQA datasets, including WebQSP and CWQ, we find that the average factual correctness rate is only 57 %. To address these issues, we introduce KGQAGen, an LLM-in-the-loop framework that systematically resolves these pitfalls. KGQAGen combines structured knowledge grounding, LLM-guided generation, and symbolic verification to produce challenging and verifiable QA instances. Using KGQAGen, we construct KGQAGen-10k, a ten-thousand scale benchmark grounded in Wikidata, and evaluate a diverse set of KG-RAG models. Experimental results demonstrate that even state-of-the-art systems struggle on this benchmark, highlighting its ability to expose limitations of existing models. Our findings advocate for more rigorous benchmark construction and position KGQAGen as a scalable framework for advancing KGQA evaluation.

  Long-form legal reasoning remains a key challenge for large language models (LLMs) in spite of recent advances in test-time scaling. To address this, we introduce \textsc{LEXam}, a novel benchmark derived from 340 law exams spanning 116 law school courses across a range of subjects and degree levels. The dataset comprises 4,886 law exam questions in English and German, including 2,841 long-form, open-ended questions and 2,045 multiple-choice questions. Besides reference answers, the open questions are also accompanied by explicit guidance outlining the expected legal reasoning approach such as issue spotting, rule recall, or rule application. Our evaluation on both open-ended and multiple-choice questions present significant challenges for current LLMs; in particular, they notably struggle with open questions that require structured, multi-step legal reasoning. Moreover, our results underscore the effectiveness of the dataset in differentiating between models with varying capabilities. Deploying an ensemble LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm with rigorous human expert validation, we demonstrate how model-generated reasoning steps can be evaluated consistently and accurately, closely aligning with human expert assessments. Our evaluation setup provides a scalable method to assess legal reasoning quality beyond simple accuracy metrics. We have open-sourced our code on \href{this https URL}{GitHub} and released our data on \href{this https URL}{Hugging Face}. Project page:this https URL

  Interacting with knowledge graphs can be a daunting task for people without a background in computer science since the query language that is used (SPARQL) has a high barrier of entry. Large language models (LLMs) can lower that barrier by providing support in the form of Text2SPARQL translation. In this paper we introduce a generalized method based on SPINACH, an LLM backed agent that translates natural language questions to SPARQL queries not in a single shot, but as an iterative process of exploration and execution. We describe the overall architecture and reasoning behind our design decisions, and also conduct a thorough analysis of the agent behavior to gain insights into future areas for targeted improvements. This work was motivated by the Text2SPARQL challenge, a challenge that was held to facilitate improvements in the Text2SPARQL domain.

  While integrating tools like Code Interpreter and Search has significantly enhanced Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning in models like ChatGPT Agent and Gemini-Pro, practical guidance on optimal tool use is lacking. The core challenge is effectively combining textual reasoning, coding, and search for diverse questions. In this paper, we propose Tool-Use Mixture (TUMIX), an ensemble framework that runs multiple agents in parallel, each employing distinct tool-use strategies and answer paths. Agents in TUMIX iteratively share and refine responses based on the question and previous answers. In experiments, TUMIX achieves significant gains over state-of-the-art tool-augmented and test-time scaling methods, delivering an average accuracy improvement of up to 3.55% over the best baseline on Gemini-2.5-Pro and Gemini-2.5-Flash across key reasoning benchmarks, with near-equal inference costs. We find that agent diversity and quality are crucial and can be enhanced by using LLMs to auto-optimize agent designs. Furthermore, TUMIX can halt refinement upon reaching sufficient confidence, preserving performance at only 49% of the inference cost. Further scaling can achieve higher performance, albeit at a greater cost.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Amidst the rapid normalization of generative artificial intelligence (GAI), intelligent systems have come to dominate political discourse across information mediums. However, internalized political biases stemming from training data skews, human prejudice, and algorithmic flaws continue to plague the novel technology. This paper employs a zero-shot classification approach to evaluate algorithmic political partisanship through a methodical combination of ideological alignment, topicality, response sentiment, and objectivity. A total of 1800 model responses across six mainstream large language models (LLMs) were individually input into four distinct fine-tuned classification algorithms, each responsible for computing an aforementioned bias evaluation metric. Results show an amplified liberal-authoritarian alignment across all six LLMs evaluated, with notable instances of reasoning supersessions and canned refusals. The study subsequently highlights the psychological influences underpinning human-computer interactions and how intrinsic biases can permeate public discourse. The resulting distortion of the political landscape can ultimately manifest as conformity or polarization, depending on a region's pre-existing socio-political structures.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Knowledge graph question answering (KGQA) aims to answer natural language questions using knowledge graphs. Recent research leverages large language models (LLMs) to enhance KGQA reasoning, but faces limitations: retrieval-based methods are constrained by the quality of retrieved information, while agent-based methods rely heavily on proprietary LLMs. To address these limitations, we propose Retrieval-Judgment-Exploration (RJE), a framework that retrieves refined reasoning paths, evaluates their sufficiency, and conditionally explores additional evidence. Moreover, RJE introduces specialized auxiliary modules enabling small-sized LLMs to perform effectively: Reasoning Path Ranking, Question Decomposition, and Retriever-assisted Exploration. Experiments show that our approach with proprietary LLMs (such as GPT-4o-mini) outperforms existing baselines while enabling small open-source LLMs (such as 3B and 8B parameters) to achieve competitive results without fine-tuning LLMs. Additionally, RJE substantially reduces the number of LLM calls and token usage compared to agent-based methods, yielding significant efficiency improvements.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models are commonly judged by their scores on standard benchmarks, yet such scores often overstate real capability since they mask the mix of skills a task actually demands. For example, ARC is assumed to test reasoning, while HellaSwag is designed to evaluate commonsense. However, we lack a systematic way to verify if these benchmarks actually measure these labels. We introduce Benchmark Profiling, a diagnostic framework that decomposes benchmark performance into ten cognitively grounded abilities. The method combines gradient-based importance scoring with targeted parameter ablation to compute an Ability Impact Score (AIS) that quantifies how much each ability contributes to a model's success on a given benchmark. Profiling three instruction-tuned models across ten widely used benchmarks yields four key findings: (i) most benchmarks draw on several abilities rather than one, (ii) datasets with similar labels rely on distinct ability mixtures, (iii) code-generation benchmarks reward broad, multi-skill improvement and thus show only modest gains from narrow domain-specific fine-tuning, and (iv) abilities irrelevant to the task could negatively affect performance. Benchmark Profiling therefore explains why performance gains do not always translate into user-perceived competence and offers a transparent tool for benchmark audit and model interpretability.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Effective document reranking is essential for improving search relevance across diverse applications. While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at reranking due to their deep semantic understanding and reasoning, their high computational cost makes them impractical for many real-world deployments. Fine-tuning smaller, task-specific models is a more efficient alternative but typically depends on scarce, manually labeled data. To overcome this, we propose a novel pipeline that eliminates the need for human-labeled query-document pairs. Our method uses LLMs to generate synthetic queries from domain-specific corpora and employs an LLM-based classifier to label positive and hard-negative pairs. This synthetic dataset is then used to fine-tune a smaller transformer model with contrastive learning using Localized Contrastive Estimation (LCE) loss. Experiments on the MedQuAD dataset show that our approach significantly boosts in-domain performance and generalizes well to out-of-domain tasks. By using LLMs for data generation and supervision rather than inference, we reduce computational costs while maintaining strong reranking capabilities.

  Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with foundation models has achieved strong performance across diverse tasks, but their capacity for expert-level reasoning-such as solving Olympiad-level physics problems-remains largely unexplored. Inspired by the way students prepare for competitions by reviewing past problems, we investigate the potential of RAG to enhance physics reasoning in foundation models. We introduce PhoPile, a high-quality multimodal dataset specifically designed for Olympiad-level physics, enabling systematic study of retrieval-based reasoning. PhoPile includes diagrams, graphs, and equations, capturing the inherently multimodal nature of physics problem solving. Using PhoPile, we benchmark RAG-augmented foundation models, covering both large language models (LLMs) and large multimodal models (LMMs) with multiple retrievers. Our results demonstrate that integrating retrieval with physics corpora can improve model performance, while also highlighting challenges that motivate further research in retrieval-augmented physics reasoning.

  Spoken dialogue systems often rely on cascaded pipelines that transcribe, process, and resynthesize speech. While effective, this design discards paralinguistic cues and limits expressivity. Recent end-to-end methods reduce latency and better preserve these cues, yet still rely on text intermediates, creating a fundamental bottleneck. We present MOSS-Speech, a true speech-to-speech large language model that directly understands and generates speech without relying on text guidance. Our approach combines a modality-based layer-splitting architecture with a frozen pre-training strategy, preserving the reasoning and knowledge of pretrained text LLMs while adding native speech capabilities. Experiments show that our model achieves state-of-the-art results in spoken question answering and delivers comparable speech-to-speech performance relative to existing text-guided systems, while still maintaining competitive text performance. By narrowing the gap between text-guided and direct speech generation, our work establishes a new paradigm for expressive and efficient end-to-end speech interaction.

  Counterfactual reasoning typically involves considering alternatives to actual events. While often applied to understand past events, a distinct form-forward counterfactual reasoning-focuses on anticipating plausible future developments. This type of reasoning is invaluable in dynamic financial markets, where anticipating market developments can powerfully unveil potential risks and opportunities for stakeholders, guiding their decision-making. However, performing this at scale is challenging due to the cognitive demands involved, underscoring the need for automated solutions. LLMs offer promise, but remain unexplored for this application. To address this gap, we introduce a novel benchmark, FIN-FORCE-FINancial FORward Counterfactual Evaluation. By curating financial news headlines and providing structured evaluation, FIN-FORCE supports LLM based forward counterfactual generation. This paves the way for scalable and automated solutions for exploring and anticipating future market developments, thereby providing structured insights for decision-making. Through experiments on FIN-FORCE, we evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs and counterfactual generation methods, analyzing their limitations and proposing insights for future research.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) have displayed astonishing abilities in various tasks, especially in text generation, classification, question answering, etc. However, the reasoning ability of LLMs still faces many debates. The inherent ambiguity of Natural Language (NL) limits LLMs' ability to perform verifiable reasoning, making its answers lack coherence and trustworthy support. To tackle the above problems, we propose a novel framework named FANS: Formal ANswer Selection for Natural Language Math Reasoning Using Lean4. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first framework that utilizes Lean4 to enhance LLMs' NL math reasoning ability. In particular, given an NL math question and LLM-generated answers, FANS first translates it into Lean4 theorem statements. Then it tries to prove it using a Lean4 prover and verify it by Lean4. Finally, it uses the FL result to assist in answer selection. It enhances LLMs' NL math ability in providing a computer-verifiable solution for its correct answer and proposes an alternative method for answer selection beyond the reward model. Extensive experiments indicate the effectiveness of our framework. It can improve the accuracy rate of reward model enhanced LLMs in the MATH-500 dataset by at most 1.91% and AMC-23 by at most 8.33% on strong reward-model baselines. In some particular fields like number theory that Lean4 experts in, we can even select all correct solutions. The qualitative analysis also shows our framework can make NL results formally backed by Lean4 proofs. As a pioneering work in the corresponding field, we will open-source all our models and datasets to further boost the development of the field.

  _Lingzhong Dong, Ziqi Zhou, Shuaibo Yang, Haiyue Sheng, Pengzhou Cheng, Zongru Wu, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Mobile-use agents powered by vision-language models (VLMs) have shown great potential in interpreting natural language instructions and generating corresponding actions based on mobile graphical user interface. Recent studies suggest that incorporating chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning tends to improve the execution accuracy. However, existing evaluations emphasize execution accuracy while neglecting whether CoT reasoning aligns with ground-truth actions. This oversight fails to assess potential reasoning-execution gaps, which in turn foster over-trust: users relying on seemingly plausible CoTs may unknowingly authorize harmful actions, potentially resulting in financial loss or trust crisis. In this work, we introduce a new evaluation framework to diagnose reasoning-execution gaps. At its core lies Ground-Truth Alignment (GTA), which measures whether the action implied by a CoT matches the ground-truth action. By combining GTA with the standard Exact Match (EM) metric, we jointly assess both the reasoning accuracy and execution accuracy. This joint perspective reveals two types of reasoning-execution gaps: (i) Execution Gap (EG), where the reasoning correctly identifies the correct action but execution fails, and (ii) Reasoning Gap (RG), where execution succeeds but reasoning process conflicts with the actual execution. Experimental results across a wide range of mobile interaction tasks reveal that reasoning-execution gaps are prevalent, with execution gaps occurring more frequently than reasoning gaps. Moreover, while scaling up model size reduces the overall gap, sizable execution gaps persist even in the largest models. Further analysis shows that our framework reliably reflects systematic EG/RG patterns in state-of-the-art models. These findings offer concrete diagnostics and support the development of more trustworthy mobile-use agents.

  Evaluations of large language models (LLMs)' creativity have focused primarily on the quality of their outputs rather than the processes that shape them. This study takes a process-oriented approach, drawing on narratology to examine LLMs as computational authors. We introduce constraint-based decision-making as a lens for authorial creativity. Using controlled prompting to assign authorial personas, we analyze the creative preferences of the models. Our findings show that LLMs consistently emphasize Style over other elements, including Character, Event, and Setting. By also probing the reasoning the models provide for their choices, we show that distinctive profiles emerge across models and argue that our approach provides a novel systematic tool for analyzing AI's authorial creativity.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Claim verification with large language models (LLMs) has recently attracted considerable attention, owing to their superior reasoning capabilities and transparent verification pathways compared to traditional answer-only judgments. Online claim verification requires iterative evidence retrieval and reasoning, yet existing approaches mainly rely on prompt engineering or predesigned reasoning workflows without offering a unified training paradigm to improve necessary skills. Therefore, we introduce Veri-R1, an online reinforcement learning (RL) framework that enables an LLM to interact with a search engine and to receive reward signals that explicitly shape its planning, retrieval, and reasoning behaviors. The dynamic interaction between models and retrieval systems more accurately reflects real-world verification scenarios and fosters comprehensive verification skills. Empirical results show that Veri-R1 improves joint accuracy by up to 30% and doubles evidence score, often surpassing larger-scale counterparts. Ablation studies further reveal the impact of reward components and the link between output logits and label accuracy. Our results highlight the effectiveness of online RL for precise and faithful claim verification and provide a foundation for future research. We release our code to support community progress in LLM empowered claim verification.

  Reward models (RMs) play a critical role in enhancing the reasoning performance of LLMs. For example, they can provide training signals to finetune LLMs during reinforcement learning (RL) and help select the best answer from multiple candidates during inference. In this paper, we provide a systematic introduction to RMs, along with a comprehensive survey of their applications in LLM reasoning. We first review fundamental concepts of RMs, including their architectures, training methodologies, and evaluation techniques. Then, we explore their key applications: (1) guiding generation and selecting optimal outputs during LLM inference, (2) facilitating data synthesis and iterative self-improvement for LLMs, and (3) providing training signals in RL-based finetuning. Finally, we address critical open questions regarding the selection, generalization, evaluation, and enhancement of RMs, based on existing research and our own empirical findings. Our analysis aims to provide actionable insights for the effective deployment and advancement of RMs for LLM reasoning.

  _Dane Williamson, Yangfeng Ji, Matthew Dwyer_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong mathematical problem-solving abilities but frequently fail on problems that deviate syntactically from their training distribution. We identify a systematic failure mode, syntactic blind spots, in which models misapply familiar reasoning strategies to problems that are semantically straightforward but phrased in unfamiliar ways. These errors are not due to gaps in mathematical competence, but rather reflect a brittle coupling between surface form and internal representation. To test this, we rephrase incorrectly answered questions using syntactic templates drawn from correct examples. These rephrasings, which preserve semantics while reducing structural complexity, often lead to correct answers. We quantify syntactic complexity using a metric based on Dependency Locality Theory (DLT), and show that higher DLT scores are associated with increased failure rates across multiple datasets. Our findings suggest that many reasoning errors stem from structural misalignment rather than conceptual difficulty, and that syntax-aware interventions can reveal and mitigate these inductive failures.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multimodal reasoning models have recently shown promise on challenging domains such as olympiad-level geometry, yet their evaluation remains dominated by aggregate accuracy, a single score that obscures where and how models are improving. We introduce MathLens, a benchmark designed to disentangle the subskills of multimodal reasoning while preserving the complexity of textbook-style geometry problems. The benchmark separates performance into three components: Perception: extracting information from raw inputs, Reasoning: operating on available information, and Integration: selecting relevant perceptual evidence and applying it within reasoning. To support each test, we provide annotations: visual diagrams, textual descriptions to evaluate reasoning in isolation, controlled questions that require both modalities, and probes for fine-grained perceptual skills, all derived from symbolic specifications of the problems to ensure consistency and robustness. Our analysis reveals that different training approaches have uneven effects: First, reinforcement learning chiefly strengthens perception, especially when supported by textual supervision, while textual SFT indirectly improves perception through reflective reasoning. Second, reasoning improves only in tandem with perception. Third, integration remains the weakest capacity, with residual errors concentrated there once other skills advance. Finally, robustness diverges: RL improves consistency under diagram variation, whereas multimodal SFT reduces it through overfitting. We will release all data and experimental logs.

  Assessing the quality of Large Language Model (LLM) outputs presents a critical challenge. Previous methods either rely on text-level information (e.g., reward models, majority voting), which can overfit to superficial cues, or on calibrated confidence from token probabilities, which would fail on less-calibrated models. Yet both of these signals are, in fact, partial projections of a richer source of information: the model's internal hidden states. Early layers, closer to token embeddings, preserve semantic and lexical features that underpin text-based judgments, while later layers increasingly align with output logits, embedding confidence-related information. This paper explores hidden states directly as a unified foundation for verification. We show that the correctness of a solution is encoded as a geometrically separable signature within the trajectory of hidden activations. To validate this, we present Clue (Clustering and Experience-based Verification), a deliberately minimalist, non-parametric verifier. With no trainable parameters, CLUE only summarizes each reasoning trace by an hidden state delta and classifies correctness via nearest-centroid distance to ``success'' and ``failure'' clusters formed from past experience. The simplicity of this method highlights the strength of the underlying signal. Empirically, CLUE consistently outperforms LLM-as-a-judge baselines and matches or exceeds modern confidence-based methods in reranking candidates, improving both top-1 and majority-vote accuracy across AIME 24/25 and GPQA. As a highlight, on AIME 24 with a 1.5B model, CLUE boosts accuracy from 56.7% (majority@64) to 70.0% (top-maj@16).

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) excel at general language tasks but often struggle with event-based questions-especially those requiring causal or temporal reasoning. We introduce TAG-EQA (Text-And-Graph for Event Question Answering), a prompting framework that injects causal event graphs into LLM inputs by converting structured relations into natural-language statements. TAG-EQA spans nine prompting configurations, combining three strategies (zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought) with three input modalities (text-only, graph-only, text+graph), enabling a systematic analysis of when and how structured knowledge aids inference. On the TORQUESTRA benchmark, TAG-EQA improves accuracy by 5% on average over text-only baselines, with gains up to 12% in zero-shot settings and 18% when graph-augmented CoT prompting is effective. While performance varies by model and configuration, our findings show that causal graphs can enhance event reasoning in LLMs without fine-tuning, offering a flexible way to encode structure in prompt-based QA.

  While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in general domains, their reliability often falls short in scientific problem-solving. The advancement of scientific AI depends on large-scale, high-quality corpora. However, existing scientific question-answering (QA) datasets suffer from high error rates, frequently resulting from logical leaps and implicit reasoning within the answers. To address this issue, we introduce LOCA (Logical Chain Augmentation), a novel framework for automatically cleaning scientific corpora, implemented through an augment-and-review loop. At its core, LOCA enhances raw answers by completing missing logical steps and explicitly separating the underlying scientific principle from its subsequent derivation. By applying LOCA to challenging scientific corpora, we demonstrate that it can automatically filter noisy datasets, typically reducing the error rate from as high as 20\% to below 2\%. LOCA provides a scalable and effective methodology for creating high-quality scientific corpora, paving the way for more reliable training and evaluation of scientific AI.

  Large scale pretrained models have revolutionized Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computer Vision (CV), showcasing remarkable cross domain generalization abilities. However, in graph learning, models are typically trained on individual graph datasets, limiting their capacity to transfer knowledge across different graphs and tasks. This approach also heavily relies on large volumes of annotated data, which presents a significant challenge in resource-constrained settings. Unlike NLP and CV, graph structured data presents unique challenges due to its inherent heterogeneity, including domain specific feature spaces and structural diversity across various applications. To address these challenges, we propose a novel structure aware self supervised learning method for Text Attributed Graphs (SSTAG). By leveraging text as a unified representation medium for graph learning, SSTAG bridges the gap between the semantic reasoning of Large Language Models (LLMs) and the structural modeling capabilities of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Our approach introduces a dual knowledge distillation framework that co-distills both LLMs and GNNs into structure-aware multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), enhancing the scalability of large-scale TAGs. Additionally, we introduce an in-memory mechanism that stores typical graph representations, aligning them with memory anchors in an in-memory repository to integrate invariant knowledge, thereby improving the model's generalization ability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SSTAG outperforms state-of-the-art models on cross-domain transfer learning tasks, achieves exceptional scalability, and reduces inference costs while maintaining competitive performance.

  Large language models (LLMs) now perform strongly on many public math suites, yet frontier separation within mathematics increasingly suffers from ceiling effects. We present two complementary benchmarks: SKYLENAGE-ReasoningMATH, a 100-item, structure-aware diagnostic set with per-item metadata on length, numeric density, and symbolic complexity; and SKYLENAGE-MATH, a 150-item contest-style suite spanning four stages from high school to doctoral under a seven-subject taxonomy. We evaluate fifteen contemporary LLM variants under a single setup and analyze subject x model and grade x model performance. On the contest suite, the strongest model reaches 44% while the runner-up reaches 37%; accuracy declines from high school to doctoral, and top systems exhibit a doctoral-to-high-school retention near 79%. On the reasoning set, the best model attains 81% overall, and hardest-slice results reveal clear robustness gaps between leaders and the mid-tier. In summary, we release SKYLENAGE-ReasoningMATH and report aggregate results for SKYLENAGE-MATH; together, SKYLENAGE provides a hard, reasoning-centered and broadly covering math benchmark with calibrated difficulty and rich metadata, serving as a reference benchmark for future evaluations of mathematical reasoning.

  The rapid growth of large language models (LLMs) with diverse capabilities, latency and computational costs presents a critical deployment challenge: selecting the most suitable model for each prompt to optimize the trade-off between performance and efficiency. We introduce LLMRank, a prompt-aware routing framework that leverages rich, human-readable features extracted from prompts, including task type, reasoning patterns, complexity indicators, syntactic cues, and signals from a lightweight proxy solver. Unlike prior one-shot routers that rely solely on latent embeddings, LLMRank predicts per-model utility using a neural ranking model trained on RouterBench, comprising 36,497 prompts spanning 11 benchmarks and 11 state-of-the-art LLMs, from small efficient models to large frontier systems. Our approach achieves up to 89.2% of oracle utility, while providing interpretable feature attributions that explain routing decisions. Extensive studies demonstrate the importance of multifaceted feature extraction and the hybrid ranking objective, highlighting the potential of feature-driven routing for efficient and transparent LLM deployment.

  Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) with long chain-of-thought capabilities, optimized via reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), excel at objective reasoning tasks like mathematical problem solving and code generation. However, RLVR is known for degrading generation diversity, which causes LRMs to fall short on subjective reasoning that has multiple answers depending on different role perspectives. While recent studies recognize the importance of diversity-enhanced training in objective reasoning, limited attention has been given to subjective tasks. In this paper, we find that subjective reasoning can be improved by introducing perspective diversity and token-level diversity, with the former one providing a coherent scaffolding anchored to a real-world stakeholder group and the latter one broadening the answer search space. We propose MultiRole-R1, a diversity-enhanced training framework featuring an unsupervised data construction pipeline that synthesizes reasoning chains incorporating various role perspectives. It also employs reinforcement learning via Group Relative Policy Optimization with reward shaping, taking diversity as a reward signal in addition to verifiable reward. Training on subjective tasks solely, MultiRole-R1 increases the in-domain and out-of-domain accuracy by 14.1% and 7.64%, and even enhances the performance on advanced math reasoning such as AIME 2024. We further show that diversity is a more consistent indicator of accuracy than reasoning length.

  When evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) in question answering domains, it is common to ask the model to choose among a fixed set of choices (so-called multiple-choice question-answering, or MCQA). Although downstream tasks of interest typically do not provide systems with explicit options among which to choose, this approach is nevertheless widely used because it makes automatic grading straightforward and has tended to produce challenging benchmarks that correlate sufficiently well with downstream performance. This paper investigates the extent to which this trend continues to hold for state-of-the-art reasoning models, describing a systematic evaluation of 15 different question-answering benchmarks (e.g., MMLU, GSM8K) and 27 different LLMs (including small models such as Qwen-2.5 7B, mid-sized models such as Llama-3.3 70B, and large state-of-the-art models such as OpenAI's o3). For each model--benchmark pair, we considered 5 ways of presenting the model with questions, including variations on whether multiple choices were offered to the model at all; whether "none of the above" sometimes replaced the right answer; and whether the model was permitted to perform chain-of-thought reasoning before and/or after the choices were presented. MCQA remained a good proxy for the downstream performance of models as long as they were allowed to perform chain-of-thought reasoning only \emph{before} being presented with the options among which they had to select. On the other hand, large models that were able to perform reasoning \emph{after} being given a set of options tended to significantly outperform their free-text performance due to exploiting the information in the options. We identify and quantify the signals models are using when answering MCQA questions, and offer practical guidelines when analyzing results from MCQA that better reflect LLMs' genuine reasoning capabilities.

  While slow-thinking large language models (LLMs) exhibit reflection-like reasoning, commonly referred to as the "aha moment:, their ability to generate informative critiques and refine prior solutions remains limited. In this paper, we introduce Double-Checker, a principled framework designed to enhance the reasoning capabilities of slow-thinking LLMs by fostering explicit self-critique and iterative refinement of their previous solutions. By fine-tuning on our curated 1,730 self-critical instances, Double-Checker empowers long-CoT LLMs to iteratively critique and refine their outputs during inference until they evaluate their solutions as correct under self-generated critiques. We validate the efficacy of Double-Checker across a comprehensive suite of reasoning benchmarks, demonstrating that iterative self-critique significantly enhances the reasoning capabilities of long-CoT LLMs. Notably, our Double-Checker increases the pass@1 performance on challenging AIME benchmarks from 4.4% to 18.2% compared to the original long-CoT LLMs. These results highlight a promising direction for developing more trustworthy and effective LLMs capable of structured self-critique.

  Large language models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across a wide range of tasks, yet their ability to process structured symbolic knowledge remains underexplored. To address this gap, we propose a taxonomy of ontological capabilities and introduce OntoURL, the first comprehensive benchmark designed to systematically evaluate LLMs' capabilities in handling ontologies -- formal and symbolic representations of domain knowledge. Based on the proposed taxonomy, OntoURL systematically assesses three dimensions: understanding, reasoning, and learning through 15 distinct tasks comprising 57,303 questions derived from 40 ontologies across 8 domains. Experiments with 20 open-source LLMs reveal significant performance differences across models, tasks, and domains, with current LLMs showing capabilities in understanding ontological knowledge but weaknesses in reasoning and learning tasks. Further experiments with few-shot and chain-of-thought prompting illustrate how different prompting strategies affect model performance. Additionally, a human evaluation reveals that LLMs outperform humans in understanding and reasoning tasks but fall short in most learning tasks. These findings highlight both the potential and limitations of LLMs in processing symbolic knowledge and establish OntoURL as a critical benchmark for advancing the integration of LLMs with formal knowledge representations.

  Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have upgraded them from sophisticated text generators to autonomous agents capable of cooperation and tool use in multi-agent systems (MAS). However, it remains unclear how disagreements shape collective decision-making. In this paper, we revisit the role of disagreement and argue that general, partially overlapping disagreements prevent premature consensus and expand the explored solution space, while disagreements on task-critical steps can derail collaboration depending on the topology of solution paths. We investigate two collaborative settings with distinct path structures: collaborative reasoning (CounterFact, MQuAKE-cf), which typically follows a single evidential chain, whereas collaborative programming (HumanEval, GAIA) often adopts multiple valid implementations. Disagreements are instantiated as general heterogeneity among agents and as task-critical counterfactual knowledge edits injected into context or parameters. Experiments reveal that general disagreements consistently improve success by encouraging complementary exploration. By contrast, task-critical disagreements substantially reduce success on single-path reasoning, yet have a limited impact on programming, where agents can choose alternative solutions. Trace analyses show that MAS frequently bypasses the edited facts in programming but rarely does so in reasoning, revealing an emergent self-repair capability that depends on solution-path rather than scale alone. Our code is available atthis https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Self-consistency (SC) improves the performance of large language models (LLMs) across various tasks and domains that involve short content. However, does this support its effectiveness for long-context problems?We challenge the assumption that SC's benefits generalize to long-context settings, where LLMs often struggle with position bias, the systematic over-reliance on specific context regions-which hinders their ability to utilize information effectively from all parts of their context. Through comprehensive experimentation with varying state-of-the-art models, tasks, and SC formulations, we find that SC not only fails to improve but actively degrades performance on long-context tasks. This degradation is driven by persistent position bias, which worsens with longer context lengths and smaller model sizes but remains invariant to prompt format or task type. Unlike short-context tasks, where SC diversifies reasoning paths, long-context SC amplifies positional errors. These comprehensive results provide valuable insight into the limitations of current LLMs in long-context understanding and highlight the need for more sophisticated approaches.

  Recent large language models (LLMs) demonstrate multilingual abilities, yet they are English-centric due to dominance of English in training corpora. The limited resource for low-resource languages remains a crucial challenge. Code-switching (CS), a phenomenon where multilingual speakers alternate between languages in a discourse, can convey subtle cultural and linguistic nuances that can be otherwise lost in translation and elicits language-specific knowledge in human communications. In light of this, we investigate whether code-switching can activate, or identify and leverage knowledge for reasoning when LLMs solve low-resource language tasks. To facilitate the research, we first present EnKoQA, a synthetic English-Korean CS question-answering dataset. We provide comprehensive analysis on a variety of multilingual LLMs by subdividing activation process into knowledge identification and knowledge leveraging. Our results demonstrate that compared to English text, CS can faithfully activate knowledge inside LLMs especially on language-specific domains, suggesting the potential of code-switching on low-resource language tasks.

  As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to model and augment collective decision-making, it is critical to examine their alignment with human social reasoning. We present an empirical framework for assessing collective alignment, in contrast to prior work on the individual level. Using the Lost at Sea social psychology task, we conduct a large-scale online experiment (N=748), randomly assigning groups to leader elections with either visible demographic attributes (e.g. name, gender) or pseudonymous aliases. We then simulate matched LLM groups conditioned on the human data, benchmarking Gemini 2.5, GPT 4.1, Claude Haiku 3.5, and Gemma 3. LLM behaviors diverge: some mirror human biases; others mask these biases and attempt to compensate for them. We empirically demonstrate that human-AI alignment in collective reasoning depends on context, cues, and model-specific inductive biases. Understanding how LLMs align with collective human behavior is critical to advancing socially-aligned AI, and demands dynamic benchmarks that capture the complexities of collective reasoning.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In tabular anomaly detection (AD), textual semantics often carry critical signals, as the definition of an anomaly is closely tied to domain-specific context. However, existing benchmarks provide only raw data points without semantic context, overlooking rich textual metadata such as feature descriptions and domain knowledge that experts rely on in practice. This limitation restricts research flexibility and prevents models from fully leveraging domain knowledge for detection. ReTabAD addresses this gap by restoring textual semantics to enable context-aware tabular AD research. We provide (1) 20 carefully curated tabular datasets enriched with structured textual metadata, together with implementations of state-of-the-art AD algorithms including classical, deep learning, and LLM-based approaches, and (2) a zero-shot LLM framework that leverages semantic context without task-specific training, establishing a strong baseline for future research. Furthermore, this work provides insights into the role and utility of textual metadata in AD through experiments and analysis. Results show that semantic context improves detection performance and enhances interpretability by supporting domain-aware reasoning. These findings establish ReTabAD as a benchmark for systematic exploration of context-aware AD.

  We propose a novel method that leverages sparse autoencoders (SAEs) and clustering techniques to analyze the internal token representations of large language models (LLMs) and guide generations in mathematical reasoning tasks. Our approach first trains an SAE to generate sparse vector representations for training tokens, then applies k-means clustering to construct a graph where vertices represent token clusters and weighted edges capture sequential token transitions. Using this graph, we define an edge-weight based reward function to quantify adherence to established reasoning traces, thereby identifying exploitative reasoning trajectories. Additionally, we measure generation diversity from clustering to assess the extent of exploration. Our findings indicate that balancing both exploitation and exploration is crucial for achieving high accuracy in mathematical reasoning tasks. During generation, the SAE can serve as a scalable reward model to guide generations, ensuring a balanced trade-off between exploitation and exploration. This prevents extreme behaviors in either direction, ultimately fostering a higher-quality reasoning process in LLMs.

  Accurate prediction of human behavior is essential for robust and safe human-AI collaboration. However, existing approaches for modeling people are often data-hungry and brittle because they either make unrealistic assumptions about rationality or are too computationally demanding to adapt rapidly. Our key insight is that many everyday social interactions may follow predictable patterns; efficient "scripts" that minimize cognitive load for actors and observers, e.g., "wait for the green light, then go." We propose modeling these routines as behavioral programs instantiated in computer code rather than policies conditioned on beliefs and desires. We introduce ROTE, a novel algorithm that leverages both large language models (LLMs) for synthesizing a hypothesis space of behavioral programs, and probabilistic inference for reasoning about uncertainty over that space. We test ROTE in a suite of gridworld tasks and a large-scale embodied household simulator. ROTE predicts human and AI behaviors from sparse observations, outperforming competitive baselines -- including behavior cloning and LLM-based methods -- by as much as 50% in terms of in-sample accuracy and out-of-sample generalization. By treating action understanding as a program synthesis problem, ROTE opens a path for AI systems to efficiently and effectively predict human behavior in the real-world.

  Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong mathematical reasoning, but reliance on closed-source APIs for OR tasks raises privacy concerns, and training open-source models from scratch incurs high compute costs. We introduce OR-Toolformer, which fine-tunes Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct with a semi-automatic data synthesis pipeline that generates diverse OR problem-answer pairs and augments the model with external solvers to produce API calls. On three of four standard benchmarks, OR-Toolformer achieves up to 80.1% execution accuracy, exceeding size-matched baselines by over 4.3%. In zero-shot evaluation on two unseen OR problem types, it attains 54% average accuracy, a 21 percentage-point improvement over the strongest baseline. These findings validate the efficacy of tool-augmented fine-tuning LLMs for accurate and generalizable OR problem modeling and solving.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As LLMs are increasingly deployed as agents, agentic reasoning - the ability to combine tool use, especially search, and reasoning - becomes a critical skill. However, it is hard to disentangle agentic reasoning when evaluated in complex environments and tasks. Current agent benchmarks often mix agentic reasoning with challenging math reasoning, expert-level knowledge, and other advanced capabilities. To fill this gap, we build a novel benchmark, GSM-Agent, where an LLM agent is required to solve grade-school-level reasoning problems, but is only presented with the question in the prompt without the premises that contain the necessary information to solve the task, and needs to proactively collect that information using tools. Although the original tasks are grade-school math problems, we observe that even frontier models like GPT-5 only achieve 67% accuracy. To understand and analyze the agentic reasoning patterns, we propose the concept of agentic reasoning graph: cluster the environment's document embeddings into nodes, and map each tool call to its nearest node to build a reasoning path. Surprisingly, we identify that the ability to revisit a previously visited node, widely taken as a crucial pattern in static reasoning, is often missing for agentic reasoning for many models. Based on the insight, we propose a tool-augmented test-time scaling method to improve LLM's agentic reasoning performance by adding tools to encourage models to revisit. We expect our benchmark and the agentic reasoning framework to aid future studies of understanding and pushing the boundaries of agentic reasoning.

  Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have led to substantial improvements in the mathematical reasoning abilities of LLMs, as measured by standard benchmarks. Yet these gains often persist even when models are trained with flawed signals, such as random or inverted rewards. This raises a fundamental question: do such improvements reflect genuine reasoning, or are they merely artifacts of overfitting to benchmark-specific patterns? To answer this question, we adopt an evaluation-centric perspective and highlight two critical shortcomings in existing protocols. First, benchmark contamination arises because test problems are publicly available, thereby increasing the risk of data leakage. Second, evaluation fragility results from reliance on single-instance assessments, which are sensitive to stochastic outputs and fail to capture reasoning consistency. These limitations suggest the need for a new evaluation paradigm that can probe reasoning ability beyond memorization and one-off success. As response, we propose VAR-MATH, a symbolic evaluation framework that converts fixed numerical problems into parameterized templates and requires models to solve multiple instantiations of each. This design enforces consistency across structurally equivalent variants, mitigates contamination, and enhances robustness through bootstrapped metrics. We apply VAR-MATH to transform three popular benchmarks, AMC23, AIME24, and AIME25, into their symbolic counterparts, VAR-AMC23, VAR-AIME24, and VAR-AIME25. Experimental results show substantial performance drops for RL-trained models on these variabilized benchmarks, especially for smaller models, with average declines of 47.9\% on AMC23, 58.8\% on AIME24, and 72.9\% on AIME25. These findings indicate that some existing RL methods rely on superficial heuristics and fail to generalize beyond specific numerical forms.

  Preference finetuning methods like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) with AI-generated feedback have shown promise in aligning Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) with human preferences. However, existing techniques overlook the prevalence of noise in synthetic preference annotations in the form of stylistic and length biases. To this end, we introduce a hard-negative response generation framework based on LLM-guided response editing, that produces rejected responses with targeted errors, maintaining stylistic and length similarity to the accepted ones. Using this framework, we develop the VaPR dataset, comprising 30K high-quality samples, to finetune three LVLM families: LLaVA-V1.5, Qwen2VL & Qwen2.5VL (2B-13B sizes). Our VaPR models deliver significant performance improvements across ten benchmarks, achieving average gains of 6.5% (LLaVA), 4.0% (Qwen2VL), and 1.5% (Qwen2.5VL), with notable improvements on reasoning tasks. A scaling analysis shows that performance consistently improves with data size, with LLaVA models benefiting even at smaller scales. Moreover, VaPR reduces the tendency to answer "Yes" in binary questions - addressing a common failure mode in LVLMs like LLaVA. Lastly, we show that the framework generalizes to open-source LLMs as editors, with models trained on VaPR-OS achieving ~99% of the performance of models trained on \name, which is synthesized using GPT-4o.

  Reasoning requires going beyond pattern matching or memorization of solutions to identify and implement "algorithmic procedures" that can be used to deduce answers to hard problems. Doing so requires realizing the most relevant primitives, intermediate results, or shared procedures, and building upon them. While RL post-training on long chains of thought ultimately aims to uncover this kind of algorithmic behavior, most reasoning traces learned by large models fail to consistently capture or reuse procedures, instead drifting into verbose and degenerate exploration. To address more effective reasoning, we introduce reasoning abstractions: concise natural language descriptions of procedural and factual knowledge that guide the model toward learning successful reasoning. We train models to be capable of proposing multiple abstractions given a problem, followed by RL that incentivizes building a solution while using the information provided by these abstractions. This results in a two-player RL training paradigm, abbreviated as RLAD, that jointly trains an abstraction generator and a solution generator. This setup effectively enables structured exploration, decouples learning signals of abstraction proposal and solution generation, and improves generalization to harder problems. We also show that allocating more test-time compute to generating abstractions is more beneficial for performance than generating more solutions at large test budgets, illustrating the role of abstractions in guiding meaningful exploration.

  Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) improves reasoning in large language models (LLMs) but struggles with exploration, an issue that still persists for multimodal LLMs (MLLMs). Current methods treat the visual input as a fixed, deterministic condition, overlooking a critical source of ambiguity and struggling to build policies robust to plausible visual variations. We introduce $\textbf{VOGUE (Visual Uncertainty Guided Exploration)}$, a novel method that shifts exploration from the output (text) to the input (visual) space. By treating the image as a stochastic context, VOGUE quantifies the policy's sensitivity to visual perturbations using the symmetric KL divergence between a "raw" and "noisy" branch, creating a direct signal for uncertainty-aware exploration. This signal shapes the learning objective via an uncertainty-proportional bonus, which, combined with a token-entropy bonus and an annealed sampling schedule, effectively balances exploration and exploitation. Implemented within GRPO on two model scales (Qwen2.5-VL-3B/7B), VOGUE boosts pass@1 accuracy by an average of 2.6% on three visual math benchmarks and 3.7% on three general-domain reasoning benchmarks, while simultaneously increasing pass@4 performance and mitigating the exploration decay commonly observed in RL fine-tuning. Our work shows that grounding exploration in the inherent uncertainty of visual inputs is an effective strategy for improving multimodal reasoning.

  Knowledge graph completion (KGC) aims to predict missing triples in knowledge graphs (KGs) by leveraging existing triples and textual information. Recently, generative large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly employed for graph tasks. However, current approaches typically encode graph context in textual form, which fails to fully exploit the potential of LLMs for perceiving and reasoning about graph structures. To address this limitation, we propose DrKGC (Dynamic Subgraph Retrieval-Augmented LLMs for Knowledge Graph Completion). DrKGC employs a flexible lightweight model training strategy to learn structural embeddings and logical rules within the KG. It then leverages a novel bottom-up graph retrieval method to extract a subgraph for each query guided by the learned rules. Finally, a graph convolutional network (GCN) adapter uses the retrieved subgraph to enhance the structural embeddings, which are then integrated into the prompt for effective LLM fine-tuning. Experimental results on two general domain benchmark datasets and two biomedical datasets demonstrate the superior performance of DrKGC. Furthermore, a realistic case study in the biomedical domain highlights its interpretability and practical utility.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning abilities in complex tasks, often relying on Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. However, due to their autoregressive token-level generation, the reasoning process is largely constrained to local decision-making and lacks global planning. This limitation frequently results in redundant, incoherent, or inaccurate reasoning, which significantly degrades overall performance. Existing approaches, such as tree-based algorithms and reinforcement learning (RL), attempt to address this issue but suffer from high computational costs and often fail to produce optimal reasoning trajectories. To tackle this challenge, we propose Plan-Then-Action Enhanced Reasoning with Group Relative Policy Optimization PTA-GRPO, a two-stage framework designed to improve both high-level planning and fine-grained CoT reasoning. In the first stage, we leverage advanced LLMs to distill CoT into compact high-level guidance, which is then used for supervised fine-tuning (SFT). In the second stage, we introduce a guidance-aware RL method that jointly optimizes the final output and the quality of high-level guidance, thereby enhancing reasoning effectiveness. We conduct extensive experiments on multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks, including MATH, AIME2024, AIME2025, and AMC, across diverse base models such as Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, Qwen3-8B, Qwen3-14B, and LLaMA3.2-3B. Experimental results demonstrate that PTA-GRPO consistently achieves stable and significant improvements across different models and tasks, validating its effectiveness and generalization.

  We present InvThink, a simple yet powerful approach that gives large language models (LLMs) the capability of inverse thinking: reasoning through failure modes before generating responses. Unlike existing safety alignment methods that optimize directly for safe response, InvThink instructs models to 1) enumerate potential harms, 2) analyze their consequences, and 3) generate safe outputs that proactively avoid these risks. Our method reveals three key findings: (i) safety improvements show stronger scaling with model size compared to existing safety methods. (ii) InvThink mitigates safety tax; by training models to systematically consider failure modes, it preserves general reasoning capabilities on standard benchmarks. (iii) beyond general safety tasks, InvThink excels in high-stakes domains including external-facing (medicine, finance, law) and agentic (blackmail, murder) risk scenarios, achieving up to 15.7% reduction in harmful responses compared to baseline methods like SafetyPrompt. We further implement InvThink via supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning across three LLM families. These results suggest that inverse reasoning provides a scalable and generalizable path toward safer, more capable language models.

Specifically, even on simple jigsaw tasks, existing VLMs perform near randomly, revealing deficiencies in core perception and reasoning capabilities. While high-quality vision-language data can enhance these capabilities, its scarcity and limited scalability impose significant constraints. To address this, we propose AGILE, an Agentic jiGsaw Interaction Learning for Enhancing visual perception and reasoning in VLMs. AGILE formulates jigsaw solving as an interactive process, enabling the model to progressively engage with the environment. At each step, the model generates executable code to perform an action based on the current state, while the environment provides fine-grained visual feedback to guide task completion. Through this iterative cycle of observation and interaction, the model incrementally improves its perceptual and reasoning capabilities via exploration and feedback. Experimental results show that AGILE not only substantially boosts performance on jigsaw tasks of varying complexity (e.g., increasing accuracy from 9.5% to 82.8% under the 2 $\times$ 2 setting) but also demonstrates strong generalization across 9 general vision tasks, achieving an average improvement of 3.1%. These results indicate notable enhancements in both perceptual and reasoning abilities. This work opens a new avenue for advancing reasoning and generalization in multimodal models and provides an efficient, scalable solution to the scarcity of multimodal reinforcement learning data.

  Recent advancements in long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, particularly through the Group Relative Policy Optimization algorithm used by DeepSeek-R1, have led to significant interest in the potential of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) for Large Language Models (LLMs). While RLVR promises to improve reasoning by allowing models to learn from free exploration, there remains debate over whether it truly enhances reasoning abilities or simply boosts sampling efficiency. This paper systematically investigates the impact of RLVR on LLM reasoning. We revisit Pass@K experiments and demonstrate that RLVR can extend the reasoning boundary for both mathematical and coding tasks. This is supported by our introduction of a novel evaluation metric, CoT-Pass@K, which captures reasoning success by accounting for both the final answer and intermediate reasoning steps. Furthermore, we present a theoretical framework explaining RLVR's incentive mechanism, demonstrating how it can encourage correct reasoning even when rewards are based solely on answer correctness. Our analysis of RLVR's training dynamics reveals that it incentivizes correct reasoning early in the process, with substantial improvements in reasoning quality confirmed through extensive evaluations. These findings provide strong evidence of RLVR's potential to enhance LLM reasoning, offering valuable insights into its mechanisms and performance improvements.

  The rapid advancement of reasoning capabilities in large language models (LLMs) has led to notable improvements on mathematical benchmarks. However, many of the most commonly used evaluation datasets (e.g., AIME 2024) are widely available online, making it difficult to disentangle genuine reasoning from potential memorization. Furthermore, these benchmarks do not evaluate proof-writing capabilities, which are crucial for many mathematical tasks. To address this, we introduce MathArena, a new benchmark based on the following key insight: recurring math competitions provide a stream of high-quality, challenging problems that can be used for real-time evaluation of LLMs. By evaluating models as soon as new problems are released, we effectively eliminate the risk of contamination. Using this framework, we find strong signs of contamination in AIME 2024. Nonetheless, evaluations on harder competitions, such as CMIMC 2025, demonstrate impressive reasoning capabilities in top-performing models. MathArena is also the first benchmark for proof-writing capabilities. On IMO 2025, top models achieve slightly less than 40%, demonstrating both notable progress and significant room for improvement. So far, we have evaluated over $50$ models across seven competitions, totaling $162$ problems. As an evolving benchmark, MathArena will continue to track the progress of LLMs on newly released competitions, ensuring rigorous and up-to-date evaluation of mathematical reasoning.

  Recent studies suggest that the deeper layers of Large Language Models (LLMs) contribute little to representation learning and can often be removed without significant performance loss. However, such claims are typically drawn from narrow evaluations and may overlook important aspects of model behavior. In this work, we present a systematic study of depth utilization across diverse dimensions, including evaluation protocols, task categories, and model architectures. Our analysis confirms that very deep layers are generally less effective than earlier ones, but their contributions vary substantially with the evaluation setting. Under likelihood-based metrics without generation, pruning most layers preserves performance, with only the initial few being critical. By contrast, generation-based evaluation uncovers indispensable roles for middle and deeper layers in enabling reasoning and maintaining long-range coherence. We further find that knowledge and retrieval are concentrated in shallow components, whereas reasoning accuracy relies heavily on deeper layers -- yet can be reshaped through distillation. These results highlight that depth usage in LLMs is highly heterogeneous and context-dependent, underscoring the need for task-, metric-, and model-aware perspectives in both interpreting and compressing large models.

  Academic regulation advising is essential for helping students interpret and comply with institutional policies, yet building effective systems requires domain specific regulatory resources. To address this challenge, we propose REBot, an LLM enhanced advisory chatbot powered by CatRAG, a hybrid retrieval reasoning framework that integrates retrieval augmented generation with graph based reasoning. CatRAG unifies dense retrieval and graph reasoning, supported by a hierarchical, category labeled knowledge graph enriched with semantic features for domain alignment. A lightweight intent classifier routes queries to the appropriate retrieval modules, ensuring both factual accuracy and contextual depth. We construct a regulation specific dataset and evaluate REBot on classification and question answering tasks, achieving state of the art performance with an F1 score of 98.89%. Finally, we implement a web application that demonstrates the practical value of REBot in real world academic advising scenarios.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We explore the geospatial reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically, whether LLMs can read road network maps and perform navigation. We frame trajectory recovery as a proxy task, which requires models to reconstruct masked GPS traces, and introduce GLOBALTRACE, a dataset with over 4,000 real-world trajectories across diverse regions and transportation modes. Using road network as context, our prompting framework enables LLMs to generate valid paths without accessing any external navigation tools. Experiments show that LLMs outperform off-the-shelf baselines and specialized trajectory recovery models, with strong zero-shot generalization. Fine-grained analysis shows that LLMs have strong comprehension of the road network and coordinate systems, but also pose systematic biases with respect to regions and transportation modes. Finally, we demonstrate how LLMs can enhance navigation experiences by reasoning over maps in flexible ways to incorporate user preferences.

  Interactive conversational recommender systems have gained significant attention for their ability to capture user preferences through natural language interactions. However, existing approaches face substantial challenges in handling dynamic user preferences, maintaining conversation coherence, and balancing multiple ranking objectives simultaneously. This paper introduces AgentRec, a next-generation LLM-powered multi-agent collaborative recommendation framework that addresses these limitations through hierarchical agent networks with adaptive intelligence. Our approach employs specialized LLM-powered agents for conversation understanding, preference modeling, context awareness, and dynamic ranking, coordinated through an adaptive weighting mechanism that learns from interaction patterns. We propose a three-tier learning strategy combining rapid response for simple queries, intelligent reasoning for complex preferences, and deep collaboration for challenging scenarios. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that AgentRec achieves consistent improvements over state-of-the-art baselines, with 2.8\% enhancement in conversation success rate, 1.9\% improvement in recommendation accuracy (NDCG@10), and 3.2\% better conversation efficiency while maintaining comparable computational costs through intelligent agent coordination.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  LLM-based multi-agent systems excel at planning, tool use, and role coordination, but their openness and interaction complexity also expose them to jailbreak, prompt-injection, and adversarial collaboration. Existing defenses fall into two lines: (i) self-verification that asks each agent to pre-filter unsafe instructions before execution, and (ii) external guard modules that police behaviors. The former often underperforms because a standalone agent lacks sufficient capacity to detect cross-agent unsafe chains and delegation-induced risks; the latter increases system overhead and creates a single-point-of-failure-once compromised, system-wide safety collapses, and adding more guards worsens cost and complexity. To solve these challenges, we propose AdvEvo-MARL, a co-evolutionary multi-agent reinforcement learning framework that internalizes safety into task agents. Rather than relying on external guards, AdvEvo-MARL jointly optimizes attackers (which synthesize evolving jailbreak prompts) and defenders (task agents trained to both accomplish their duties and resist attacks) in adversarial learning environments. To stabilize learning and foster cooperation, we introduce a public baseline for advantage estimation: agents within the same functional group share a group-level mean-return baseline, enabling lower-variance updates and stronger intra-group coordination. Across representative attack scenarios, AdvEvo-MARL consistently keeps attack-success rate (ASR) below 20%, whereas baselines reach up to 38.33%, while preserving-and sometimes improving-task accuracy (up to +3.67% on reasoning tasks). These results show that safety and utility can be jointly improved without relying on extra guard agents or added system overhead.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Diffusion language models (dLLMs) offer a promising, non-autoregressive paradigm for text generation, yet training them for complex reasoning remains a key challenge. Current reinforcement learning approaches often rely on sparse, outcome-based rewards, which can reinforce flawed reasoning paths that lead to coincidentally correct answers. We argue that this stems from a fundamental mismatch with the natural structure of reasoning. We first propose a theoretical framework that formalizes complex problem solving as a hierarchical selection process, where an intractable global constraint is decomposed into a series of simpler, localized logical steps. This framework provides a principled foundation for algorithm design, including theoretical insights into the identifiability of this latent reasoning structure. Motivated by this theory, we identify unstructured refinement -- a failure mode where a model's iterative steps do not contribute meaningfully to the solution -- as a core deficiency in existing methods. We then introduce Step-Aware Policy Optimization (SAPO), a novel RL algorithm that aligns the dLLM's denoising process with the latent reasoning hierarchy. By using a process-based reward function that encourages incremental progress, SAPO guides the model to learn structured, coherent reasoning paths. Our empirical results show that this principled approach significantly improves performance on challenging reasoning benchmarks and enhances the interpretability of the generation process.

  High-assurance reasoning, particularly in critical domains such as law and medicine, requires conclusions that are accurate, verifiable, and explicitly grounded in evidence. This reasoning relies on premises codified from rules, statutes, and contracts, inherently involving defeasible or non-monotonic logic due to numerous exceptions, where the introduction of a single fact can invalidate general rules, posing significant challenges. While large language models (LLMs) excel at processing natural language, their capabilities in standard inference tasks do not translate to the rigorous reasoning required over high-assurance text guidelines. Core reasoning challenges within such texts often manifest specific logical structures involving negation, implication, and, most critically, defeasible rules and exceptions. In this paper, we propose a novel neurosymbolically-grounded architecture called LOGicalThought (LogT) that uses an advanced logical language and reasoner in conjunction with an LLM to construct a dual symbolic graph context and logic-based context. These two context representations transform the problem from inference over long-form guidelines into a compact grounded evaluation. Evaluated on four multi-domain benchmarks against four baselines, LogT improves overall performance by 11.84% across all LLMs. Performance improves significantly across all three modes of reasoning: by up to +10.2% on negation, +13.2% on implication, and +5.5% on defeasible reasoning compared to the strongest baseline.

  At the core of Deep Research is knowledge mining, the task of extracting structured information from massive unstructured text in response to user instructions. Large language models (LLMs) excel at interpreting such instructions but are prohibitively expensive to deploy at scale, while traditional pipelines of classifiers and extractors remain efficient yet brittle and unable to generalize to new tasks. We introduce Falconer, a collaborative framework that combines the agentic reasoning of LLMs with lightweight proxy models for scalable knowledge mining. In Falconer, LLMs act as planners, decomposing user instructions into executable pipelines, and as annotators, generating supervision to train small proxies. The framework unifies classification and extraction into two atomic operations, get label and get span, enabling a single instruction-following model to replace multiple task-specific components. To evaluate the consistency between proxy models incubated by Falconer and annotations provided by humans and large models, we construct new benchmarks covering both planning and end-to-end execution. Experiments show that Falconer closely matches state-of-the-art LLMs in instruction-following accuracy while reducing inference cost by up to 90% and accelerating large-scale knowledge mining by more than 20x, offering an efficient and scalable foundation for Deep Research.

  Modern engineering increasingly relies on vast datasets generated by experiments and simulations, driving a growing demand for efficient, reliable, and broadly applicable modeling strategies. There is also heightened interest in developing data-driven approaches, particularly neural network models, for effective prediction and analysis of scientific datasets. Traditional data-driven methods frequently involve extensive manual intervention, limiting their ability to scale effectively and generalize to diverse applications. In this study, we propose an innovative pipeline utilizing Large Language Model (LLM) agents to automate data-driven modeling and analysis, with a particular emphasis on regression tasks. We evaluate two LLM-agent frameworks: a multi-agent system featuring specialized collaborative agents, and a single-agent system based on the Reasoning and Acting (ReAct) paradigm. Both frameworks autonomously handle data preprocessing, neural network development, training, hyperparameter optimization, and uncertainty quantification (UQ). We validate our approach using a critical heat flux (CHF) prediction benchmark, involving approximately 25,000 experimental data points from the OECD/NEA benchmark dataset. Results indicate that our LLM-agent-developed model surpasses traditional CHF lookup tables and delivers predictive accuracy and UQ on par with state-of-the-art Bayesian optimized deep neural network models developed by human experts. These outcomes underscore the significant potential of LLM-based agents to automate complex engineering modeling tasks, greatly reducing human workload while meeting or exceeding existing standards of predictive performance.

  The reliability of large language models (LLMs) during test-time scaling is often assessed with \emph{external verifiers} or \emph{reward models} that distinguish correct reasoning from flawed logic. Prior work generally assumes that process reward models (PRMs), which score every intermediate reasoning step, outperform outcome reward models (ORMs) that assess only the final answer. This view is based mainly on evidence from narrow, math-adjacent domains. We present the first unified evaluation of four reward model variants, discriminative ORM and PRM (\DisORM, \DisPRM) and generative ORM and PRM (\GenORM, \GenPRM), across 14 diverse domains. Contrary to conventional wisdom, we find that (i) \DisORM performs on par with \DisPRM, (ii) \GenPRM is not competitive, and (iii) overall, \GenORM is the most robust, yielding significant and consistent gains across every tested domain. We attribute this to PRM-style stepwise scoring, which inherits label noise from LLM auto-labeling and has difficulty evaluating long reasoning trajectories, including those involving self-correcting reasoning. Our theoretical analysis shows that step-wise aggregation compounds errors as reasoning length grows, and our empirical observations confirm this effect. These findings challenge the prevailing assumption that fine-grained supervision is always better and support generative outcome verification for multi-domain deployment. We publicly release our code, datasets, and checkpoints at \href{this https URL}{\underline{\small\texttt{this https URL}}} to facilitate future research in multi-domain settings.

  Existing multi-agent learning approaches have developed interactive training environments to explicitly promote collaboration among multiple Large Language Models (LLMs), thereby constructing stronger multi-agent systems (MAS). However, during inference, they require re-executing the MAS to obtain final solutions, which diverges from human cognition that individuals can enhance their reasoning capabilities through interactions with others and resolve questions independently in the future. To investigate whether multi-agent interaction can enhance LLMs' independent problem-solving ability, we introduce ILR, a novel co-learning framework for MAS that integrates two key components: Dynamic Interaction and Perception Calibration. Specifically, Dynamic Interaction first adaptively selects either cooperative or competitive strategies depending on question difficulty and model ability. LLMs then exchange information through Idea3 (Idea Sharing, Idea Analysis, and Idea Fusion), an innovative interaction paradigm designed to mimic human discussion, before deriving their respective final answers. In Perception Calibration, ILR employs Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to train LLMs while integrating one LLM's reward distribution characteristics into another's reward function, thereby enhancing the cohesion of multi-agent interactions. We validate ILR on three LLMs across two model families of varying scales, evaluating performance on five mathematical benchmarks and one coding benchmark. Experimental results show that ILR consistently outperforms single-agent learning, yielding an improvement of up to 5% over the strongest baseline. We further discover that Idea3 can enhance the robustness of stronger LLMs during multi-agent inference, and dynamic interaction types can boost multi-agent learning compared to pure cooperative or competitive strategies.

  We investigated Agentic RL with large language models on the \textsc{TravelPlanner} benchmark. Our approach, \textsc{Planner-R1}, achieved a \textbf{56.9\%} final-pass rate with only 180 training queries, a $2.7\times$ improvement over GPT-5's $21.2\%$ baseline and the strongest agentic result on the public leaderboard. A central finding was that smaller models (8B) were highly responsive to reward shaping: with dense process-level signals, they reached competitive performance while being $3.5\times$ more compute-efficient and $1.5\times$ more memory-efficient than 32B models. Larger models were more robust under sparse rewards but exhibited smaller relative gains from shaping and higher variance across runs. While curriculum learning offered no significant benefit, shaped rewards consistently amplified learning dynamics, making 8B models the most efficient setting for agentic RL. Crucially, these gains did not come at the cost of overfitting: fine-tuned models mostly maintained or exceeded baseline performance on out-of-domain tasks, including \textsc{Multi-IF}, \textsc{NaturalPlan}, and $\tau$-\textsc{Bench}. These results establish reward shaping as a decisive lever for scaling agentic RL, highlight the competitive strength of smaller models, and demonstrate that efficiency can be achieved without sacrificing generalization.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) for Graph Reasoning have been extensively studied over the past two years, involving enabling LLMs to understand graph structures and reason on graphs to solve various graph problems, with graph algorithm problems being the most prevalent. Recent studies underscore the potential of LLMs in handling graph reasoning tasks, but their performance is underwhelming. In this work, we point out issues with existing methods and benchmarks, and rethink the direction that LLMs for graph reasoning should strive toward. We find that base models, e.g., GPT-4o-mini, are largely underestimated due to improper reasoning focus. Base models with reasoning focus redirected from replicating graph algorithms to designing them can easily solve most graph reasoning tasks in existing benchmarks. To truly evaluate the graph reasoning capabilities of LLMs, we construct a more challenging GraphAlgorithm benchmark, comprising 239 different graph problems and 3,041 test instances collected from 4 competition platforms. Finally, we introduce a simple and strong baseline Simple-Reasoning-Then-Coding (Simple-RTC)-which guides LLMs to design graph algorithms first and then code to address graph reasoning tasks. Simple-RTC achieves near-perfect accuracy on existing benchmarks and significantly outperforms GPT-4o-mini and all prior methods on the GraphAlgorithm benchmark. This strong baseline encourages further advancements in LLMs for Graph Reasoning in the future.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promising capabilities for solving Operations Research (OR) problems. While reinforcement learning serves as a powerful paradigm for LLM training on OR problems, existing works generally face two key limitations. First, outcome reward suffers from the credit assignment problem, where correct final answers can reinforce flawed reasoning. Second, conventional discriminative process supervision is myopic, failing to evaluate the interdependent steps of OR modeling holistically. To this end, we introduce StepORLM, a novel self-evolving framework with generative process supervision. At its core, StepORLM features a co-evolutionary loop where a policy model and a generative process reward model (GenPRM) iteratively improve on each other. This loop is driven by a dual-feedback mechanism: definitive, outcome-based verification from an external solver, and nuanced, holistic process evaluation from the GenPRM. The combined signal is used to align the policy via Weighted Direct Preference Optimization (W-DPO) and simultaneously refine the GenPRM. Our resulting 8B-parameter StepORLM establishes a new state-of-the-art across six benchmarks, significantly outperforming vastly larger generalist models, agentic methods, and specialized baselines. Moreover, the co-evolved GenPRM is able to act as a powerful and universally applicable process verifier, substantially boosting the inference scaling performance of both our own model and other existing LLMs.
