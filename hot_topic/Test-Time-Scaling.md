- **[Work Zones challenge VLM Trajectory Planning: Toward Mitigation and Robust Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02803)**  `arXiv:2510.02803`  `cs.RO` `cs.AI` `cs.CV`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Visual Language Models (VLMs), with powerful multimodal reasoning capabilities, are gradually integrated into autonomous driving by several automobile manufacturers to enhance planning capability in challenging environments. However, the trajectory planning capability of VLMs in work zones, which often include irregular layouts, temporary traffic control, and dynamically changing geometric structures, is still unexplored. To bridge this gap, we conduct the \textit{first} systematic study of VLMs for work zone trajectory planning, revealing that mainstream VLMs fail to generate correct trajectories in $68.0%$ of cases. To better understand these failures, we first identify candidate patterns via subgraph mining and clustering analysis, and then confirm the validity of $8$ common failure patterns through human verification. Building on these findings, we propose REACT-Drive, a trajectory planning framework that integrates VLMs with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Specifically, REACT-Drive leverages VLMs to convert prior failure cases into constraint rules and executable trajectory planning code, while RAG retrieves similar patterns in new scenarios to guide trajectory generation. Experimental results on the ROADWork dataset show that REACT-Drive yields a reduction of around $3\times$ in average displacement error relative to VLM baselines under evaluation with Qwen2.5-VL. In addition, REACT-Drive yields the lowest inference time ($0.58$s) compared with other methods such as fine-tuning ($17.90$s). We further conduct experiments using a real vehicle in 15 work zone scenarios in the physical world, demonstrating the strong practicality of REACT-Drive.

- **[How to Train Your Advisor: Steering Black-Box LLMs with Advisor Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02453)**  `arXiv:2510.02453`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI` `cs.CL`  
  _Parth Asawa, Alan Zhu, Matei Zaharia, Alexandros G. Dimakis, Joseph E. Gonzalez_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Foundation models are increasingly deployed as black-box services, where model weights cannot be modified and customization is limited to prompting. While static prompt optimization has shown promise, it produces a single fixed prompt that fails to adapt to different inputs, users, or environments. We introduce Advisor Models, lightweight parametric policies trained with reinforcement learning to reactively issue natural language steering instructions in-context to black-box models. The advisor is a second small model that sits between the input and the model, shaping behavior on a per-instance basis using reward signals from the environment. Across multiple domains involving reasoning and personalization, we show that Advisor Models outperform static prompt optimizers, discovering environment dynamics and improving downstream task performance. We also demonstrate the generalizability of advisors by transferring them across black-box models, as well as the framework's ability to achieve specialization while retaining robustness to out-of-distribution inputs. Viewed more broadly, Advisor Models provide a learnable interface to black-box systems where the advisor acts as a parametric, environment-specific memory. We argue that dynamic optimization of black-box models via Advisor Models is a promising direction for enabling personalization and environment-adaptable AI with frontier-level capabilities.

- **[Rubrics as Rewards: Reinforcement Learning Beyond Verifiable Domains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17746)**  `arXiv:2507.17746`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI` `cs.CL`  
  _Anisha Gunjal, Anthony Wang, Elaine Lau, Vaskar Nath, Yunzhong He, Bing Liu, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has proven effective for complex reasoning tasks with clear correctness signals such as math and coding. However, extending it to real-world reasoning tasks is challenging, as evaluation depends on nuanced, multi-criteria judgments rather than binary correctness. Instance-specific rubrics have recently been used in evaluation benchmarks to capture such judgments, but their potential as reward signals for on-policy post-training remains underexplored. We introduce $\textbf{Rubrics as Rewards}$ (RaR), an on-policy reinforcement learning method that extends RLVR beyond verifiable domains by using rubric-based feedback. Across both medical and science domains, we evaluate multiple strategies for aggregating rubric feedback into rewards. The best RaR variant achieves relative improvements of up to $31\%$ on HealthBench and $7\%$ on GPQA-Diamond over popular LLM-as-judge baselines that rely on direct Likert-based rewards. These results demonstrate that RaR-trained policies adapt well to diverse evaluation formats, performing strongly on both rubric-based and multiple-choice tasks. Moreover, we find that using rubrics as structured reward signals yields better alignment for smaller judges and reduces performance variance across judge scales.

- **[FeDABoost: Fairness Aware Federated Learning with Adaptive Boosting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02914)**  `arXiv:2510.02914`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Tharuka Kasthuri Arachchige, Veselka Boeva, Shahrooz Abghari_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This work focuses on improving the performance and fairness of Federated Learning (FL) in non IID settings by enhancing model aggregation and boosting the training of underperforming clients. We propose FeDABoost, a novel FL framework that integrates a dynamic boosting mechanism and an adaptive gradient aggregation strategy. Inspired by the weighting mechanism of the Multiclass AdaBoost (SAMME) algorithm, our aggregation method assigns higher weights to clients with lower local error rates, thereby promoting more reliable contributions to the global model. In parallel, FeDABoost dynamically boosts underperforming clients by adjusting the focal loss focusing parameter, emphasizing hard to classify examples during local training. We have evaluated FeDABoost on three benchmark datasets MNIST, FEMNIST, and CIFAR10, and compared its performance with those of FedAvg and Ditto. The results show that FeDABoost achieves improved fairness and competitive performance.

  _Wanjia Zhao, Qinwei Ma, Jingzhe Shi, Shirley Wu, Jiaqi Han, Yijia Xiao, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Benchmarks for competition-style reasoning have advanced evaluation in mathematics and programming, yet physics remains comparatively explored. Most existing physics benchmarks evaluate only final answers, which fail to capture reasoning processes, while recent stepwise methods rely on heuristic LLM-as-judge scoring or restrictive linear assumptions, limiting reliability and diagnostic validity. We introduce PRISM-Physics, a process-level evaluation framework and benchmark for complex physics reasoning problems. Solutions are represented as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) of formulas, explicitly encoding causal dependencies among intermediate steps to enable fine-grained, interpretable, and theoretically grounded scoring. We prove the optimality of the DAG representation and the corresponding scoring policy. Combining with a fully rule-based method for symbolic formula equivalence matching that we developed, we ensure consistent validation across diverse formulations without heuristic judgments. Results show that our evaluation framework is more aligned with human experts' scoring. Experiments on state-of-the-art LLMs reveal persistent reasoning failures in physics, while step-level scoring offers both diagnostic insight and rich signals for later training. By combining structural rigor, theoretical guarantees, and symbolic validation, PRISM-Physics provides a principled foundation for advancing process-level evaluation and guiding the development of models with deeper scientific reasoning capabilities.

- **[RoiRL: Efficient, Self-Supervised Reasoning with Offline Iterative Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02892)**  `arXiv:2510.02892`  `cs.LG`  
  _Aleksei Arzhantsev, Otmane Sakhi, Flavian Vasile_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reinforcement learning (RL) is central to improving reasoning in large language models (LLMs) but typically requires ground-truth rewards. Test-Time Reinforcement Learning (TTRL) removes this need by using majority-vote rewards, but relies on heavy online RL and incurs substantial computational cost. We propose RoiRL: Reasoning with offline iterative Reinforcement Learning, a family of lightweight offline learning alternatives that can target the same regularized optimal policies. Unlike TTRL, RoiRL eliminates the need to maintain a reference model and instead optimizes weighted log-likelihood objectives, enabling stable training with significantly lower memory and compute requirements. Experimental results show that RoiRL trains to 2.5x faster and consistently outperforms TTRL on reasoning benchmarks, establishing a scalable path to self-improving LLMs without labels.

- **[EvoSpeak: Large Language Models for Interpretable Genetic Programming-Evolved Heuristics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02686)**  `arXiv:2510.02686`  `cs.LG`  
  _Meng Xu, Jiao Liu, Yew Soon Ong_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Genetic programming (GP) has demonstrated strong effectiveness in evolving tree-structured heuristics for complex optimization problems. Yet, in dynamic and large-scale scenarios, the most effective heuristics are often highly complex, hindering interpretability, slowing convergence, and limiting transferability across tasks. To address these challenges, we present EvoSpeak, a novel framework that integrates GP with large language models (LLMs) to enhance the efficiency, transparency, and adaptability of heuristic evolution. EvoSpeak learns from high-quality GP heuristics, extracts knowledge, and leverages this knowledge to (i) generate warm-start populations that accelerate convergence, (ii) translate opaque GP trees into concise natural-language explanations that foster interpretability and trust, and (iii) enable knowledge transfer and preference-aware heuristic generation across related tasks. We verify the effectiveness of EvoSpeak through extensive experiments on dynamic flexible job shop scheduling (DFJSS), under both single- and multi-objective formulations. The results demonstrate that EvoSpeak produces more effective heuristics, improves evolutionary efficiency, and delivers human-readable reports that enhance usability. By coupling the symbolic reasoning power of GP with the interpretative and generative strengths of LLMs, EvoSpeak advances the development of intelligent, transparent, and user-aligned heuristics for real-world optimization problems.

- **[OpenTSLM: Time-Series Language Models for Reasoning over Multivariate Medical Text- and Time-Series Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02410)**  `arXiv:2510.02410`  `cs.LG`  
  _Patrick Langer, Thomas Kaar, Max Rosenblattl, Maxwell A. Xu, Winnie Chow, Martin Maritsch, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  LLMs have emerged as powerful tools for interpreting multimodal data. In medicine, they hold particular promise for synthesizing large volumes of clinical information into actionable insights and digital health applications. Yet, a major limitation remains their inability to handle time series. To overcome this gap, we present OpenTSLM, a family of Time Series Language Models (TSLMs) created by integrating time series as a native modality to pretrained LLMs, enabling reasoning over multiple time series of any length. We investigate two architectures for OpenTSLM. The first, OpenTSLM-SoftPrompt, models time series implicitly by concatenating learnable time series tokens with text tokens via soft prompting. Although parameter-efficient, we hypothesize that explicit time series modeling scales better and outperforms implicit approaches. We thus introduce OpenTSLM-Flamingo, which integrates time series with text via cross-attention. We benchmark both variants against baselines that treat time series as text tokens or plots, across a suite of text-time-series Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning tasks. We introduce three datasets: HAR-CoT, Sleep-CoT, and ECG-QA-CoT. Across all, OpenTSLM models outperform baselines, reaching 69.9 F1 in sleep staging and 65.4 in HAR, compared to 9.05 and 52.2 for finetuned text-only models. Notably, even 1B-parameter OpenTSLM models surpass GPT-4o (15.47 and 2.95). OpenTSLM-Flamingo matches OpenTSLM-SoftPrompt in performance and outperforms on longer sequences, while maintaining stable memory requirements. By contrast, SoftPrompt grows exponentially in memory with sequence length, requiring around 110 GB compared to 40 GB VRAM when training on ECG-QA with LLaMA-3B. Expert reviews by clinicians find strong reasoning capabilities exhibited by OpenTSLMs on ECG-QA. To facilitate further research, we provide all code, datasets, and models open-source.

- **[Co-rewarding: Stable Self-supervised RL for Eliciting Reasoning in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00410)**  `arXiv:2508.00410`  `cs.LG`  
  _Zizhuo Zhang, Jianing Zhu, Xinmu Ge, Zihua Zhao, Zhanke Zhou, Xuan Li, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  While reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) is effective to improve the reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs), its reliance on human-annotated labels leads to the scaling up dilemma, especially for complex tasks. Recent self-rewarding methods investigate a label-free alternative to unlock the reasoning capabilities of LLMs, yet they frequently encounter the non-negligible training collapse issue, as the single-view supervision signal easily forms the self-consistent illusion, yielding the reward hacking. Inspired by the success of self-supervised learning, we propose \textit{Co-rewarding}, a novel self-supervised RL framework that improves training stability by seeking complementary supervision from another views. Specifically, we instantiate Co-rewarding in two ways: (1) \textit{Co-rewarding-I} is a data-side instantiation that derives reward signals from contrastive agreement across semantically analogous questions; and (2) \textit{Co-rewarding-II} is a model-side instantiation that maintains a slowly-updated reference teacher with pseudo labels to realize self-distillation. Intuitively, such instantiations introduce different levels of discrepancy to increase the difficulty of training collapse on trivial reasoning solutions. Empirically, Co-rewarding exhibits stable training across various setups, and outperforms other self-rewarding baselines by $+3.31\%$ improvements on average on multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks, especially by $+7.49\%$ on Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct. Notably, Co-rewarding reaches or even surpasses RLVR with ground-truth (GT) label in several cases, such as a Pass@$1$ of $94.01\%$ on GSM8K with Qwen3-8B-Base remarkably higher than GT. Our code is publicly available atthis https URL.

- **[To Backtrack or Not to Backtrack: When Sequential Search Limits Model Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07052)**  `arXiv:2504.07052`  `cs.LG`  
  _Tian Qin, David Alvarez-Melis, Samy Jelassi, Eran Malach_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly improved their reasoning abilities, particularly through techniques involving search and backtracking. Backtracking naturally scales test-time compute by enabling sequential, linearized exploration via long chain-of-thought (CoT) generation. However, this is not the only strategy for scaling test time-compute: parallel sampling with best-of-N selection provides an alternative that generates diverse solutions simultaneously. Despite the growing adoption of sequential search, its advantages over parallel sampling-especially under a fixed compute budget-remain poorly understood. In this paper, we systematically compare these two approaches on two challenging reasoning tasks: CountDown and Sudoku. Surprisingly, we find that sequential search underperforms parallel sampling on CountDown but outperforms it on Sudoku, suggesting that backtracking is not universally beneficial. We identify two factors that can cause backtracking to degrade performance: (1) training on fixed search traces can lock models intro suboptimal strategies, and (2) explicit CoT supervision can discourage implicit (non verbalized) reasoning. Extending our analysis to reinforcement learning (RL), we show that models with backtracking capabilities benefit significantly from RL fine-tuning, while models without backtracking see limited, mixed gains. Together, these findings challenge the assumption that backtracking universally enhances LLM reasoning, instead revealing a complex interaction between task structure, training data, model scale, and learning paradigm.

- **[On the Effect of Sampling Diversity in Scaling LLM Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11027)**  `arXiv:2502.11027`  `cs.LG`  
  _Tianchun Wang, Zichuan Liu, Yuanzhou Chen, Jonathan Light, Weiyang Liu, Haifeng Chen, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language model (LLM) scaling inference is key to unlocking greater performance, and leveraging diversity has proven an effective way to enhance it. Motivated by the observed relationship between solution accuracy and meaningful response diversity, we systematically study the effect of prompt diversity in scaling inference. We theoretically explain why diversified sampling improves Best-of-$N$ scaling, showing that responses generated from meaningful diverse prompts after Best-of-$N$ selection exhibit significantly lower error rates than those produced from stationary prompts. To promote solution diversity, we analyze perturbation fidelity and show that moderately relevant perturbations improve performance, providing guidance for effective perturbation design. Further, we present a set of effective perturbations, including task-level and query-level ones, and analyze the conditions under which they succeed. We systematically evaluate diversified sampling across tasks, finding relative gains of 10.8% in EM@100 for reasoning, 9.6% for mathematics, and 9.5% in Pass@100 for code generation.

- **[SpineBench: A Clinically Salient, Level-Aware Benchmark Powered by the SpineMed-450k Corpus](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03160)**  `arXiv:2510.03160`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`  
  _Ming Zhao, Wenhui Dong, Yang Zhang, Xiang Zheng, Zhonghao Zhang, Zian Zhou, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Spine disorders affect 619 million people globally and are a leading cause of disability, yet AI-assisted diagnosis remains limited by the lack of level-aware, multimodal datasets. Clinical decision-making for spine disorders requires sophisticated reasoning across X-ray, CT, and MRI at specific vertebral levels. However, progress has been constrained by the absence of traceable, clinically-grounded instruction data and standardized, spine-specific benchmarks. To address this, we introduce SpineMed, an ecosystem co-designed with practicing spine surgeons. It features SpineMed-450k, the first large-scale dataset explicitly designed for vertebral-level reasoning across imaging modalities with over 450,000 instruction instances, and SpineBench, a clinically-grounded evaluation framework. SpineMed-450k is curated from diverse sources, including textbooks, guidelines, open datasets, and ~1,000 de-identified hospital cases, using a clinician-in-the-loop pipeline with a two-stage LLM generation method (draft and revision) to ensure high-quality, traceable data for question-answering, multi-turn consultations, and report generation. SpineBench evaluates models on clinically salient axes, including level identification, pathology assessment, and surgical planning. Our comprehensive evaluation of several recently advanced large vision-language models (LVLMs) on SpineBench reveals systematic weaknesses in fine-grained, level-specific reasoning. In contrast, our model fine-tuned on SpineMed-450k demonstrates consistent and significant improvements across all tasks. Clinician assessments confirm the diagnostic clarity and practical utility of our model's outputs.

- **[Reasoning Riddles: How Explainability Reveals Cognitive Limits in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02780)**  `arXiv:2510.02780`  `cs.CV`  
  _Prahitha Movva_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at many multimodal tasks, yet their cognitive processes remain opaque on complex lateral thinking challenges like rebus puzzles. While recent work has demonstrated these models struggle significantly with rebus puzzle solving, the underlying reasoning processes and failure patterns remain largely unexplored. We address this gap through a comprehensive explainability analysis that moves beyond performance metrics to understand how VLMs approach these complex lateral thinking challenges. Our study contributes a systematically annotated dataset of 221 rebus puzzles across six cognitive categories, paired with an evaluation framework that separates reasoning quality from answer correctness. We investigate three prompting strategies designed to elicit different types of explanatory processes and reveal critical insights into VLM cognitive processes. Our findings demonstrate that reasoning quality varies dramatically across puzzle categories, with models showing systematic strengths in visual composition while exhibiting fundamental limitations in absence interpretation and cultural symbolism. We also discover that prompting strategy substantially influences both cognitive approach and problem-solving effectiveness, establishing explainability as an integral component of model performance rather than a post-hoc consideration.

- **[Retrv-R1: A Reasoning-Driven MLLM Framework for Universal and Efficient Multimodal Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02745)**  `arXiv:2510.02745`  `cs.CV`  
  _Lanyun Zhu, Deyi Ji, Tianrun Chen, Haiyang Wu, Shiqi Wang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The success of DeepSeek-R1 demonstrates the immense potential of using reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance LLMs' reasoning capabilities. This paper introduces Retrv-R1, the first R1-style MLLM specifically designed for multimodal universal retrieval, achieving higher performance by employing step-by-step reasoning to produce more accurate retrieval results. We find that directly applying the methods of DeepSeek-R1 to retrieval tasks is not feasible, mainly due to (1) the high computational cost caused by the large token consumption required for multiple candidates with reasoning processes, and (2) the instability and suboptimal results when directly applying RL to train for retrieval tasks. To address these issues, Retrv-R1 introduces an information compression module with a details inspection mechanism, which enhances computational efficiency by reducing the number of tokens while ensuring that critical information for challenging candidates is preserved. Furthermore, a new training paradigm is proposed, including an activation stage using a retrieval-tailored synthetic CoT dataset for more effective optimization, followed by RL with a novel curriculum reward to improve both performance and efficiency. Incorporating these novel designs, Retrv-R1 achieves SOTA performance, high efficiency, and strong generalization ability, as demonstrated by experiments across multiple benchmarks and tasks.

- **[So-Fake: Benchmarking and Explaining Social Media Image Forgery Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18660)**  `arXiv:2505.18660`  `cs.CV`  
  _Zhenglin Huang, Tianxiao Li, Xiangtai Li, Haiquan Wen, Yiwei He, Jiangning Zhang, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in AI-powered generative models have enabled the creation of increasingly realistic synthetic images, posing significant risks to information integrity and public trust on social media platforms. While robust detection frameworks and diverse, large-scale datasets are essential to mitigate these risks, existing academic efforts remain limited in scope: current datasets lack the diversity, scale, and realism required for social media contexts, while detection methods struggle with generalization to unseen generative technologies. To bridge this gap, we introduce So-Fake-Set, a comprehensive social media-oriented dataset with over 2 million high-quality images, diverse generative sources, and photorealistic imagery synthesized using 35 state-of-the-art generative models. To rigorously evaluate cross-domain robustness, we establish a novel and large-scale (100K) out-of-domain benchmark (So-Fake-OOD) featuring synthetic imagery from commercial models explicitly excluded from the training distribution, creating a realistic testbed for evaluating real-world performance. Leveraging these resources, we present So-Fake-R1, an advanced vision-language framework that employs reinforcement learning for highly accurate forgery detection, precise localization, and explainable inference through interpretable visual rationales. Extensive experiments show that So-Fake-R1 outperforms the second-best method, with a 1.3% gain in detection accuracy and a 4.5% increase in localization IoU. By integrating a scalable dataset, a challenging OOD benchmark, and an advanced detection framework, this work establishes a new foundation for social media-centric forgery detection research. The code, models, and datasets will be released publicly.

- **[Uncertainty-Aware Answer Selection for Improved Reasoning in Multi-LLM Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02377)**  `arXiv:2510.02377`  `cs.CL` `cs.LG`  
  _Aakriti Agrawal, Rohith Aralikatti, Anirudh Satheesh, Souradip Chakraborty, Amrit Singh Bedi, Furong Huang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities, yet selecting the most reliable response from multiple LLMs remains a challenge, particularly in resource-constrained settings. Existing approaches often depend on costly external verifiers, human evaluators, or self-consistency techniques that require multiple samples from a single model. While multi-LLM systems produce more diverse responses than single models and thus have greater potential, they often underperform compared to single LLM self-consistency. We propose a principled, novel and computationally efficient method to select the best response from multiple different LLMs using a calibrated log-likelihood score, implicitly leveraging the inherent knowledge and confidence of these models. Our method demonstrates improvements of approx. 4%, 3%, and 5% across both debate (multi-round LLM discussions) and non-debate (Best-of-N with multiple LLMs) settings on GSM8K, MMLU (6 subsets), and ARC datasets respectively.

- **[Can Prompts Rewind Time for LLMs? Evaluating the Effectiveness of Prompted Knowledge Cutoffs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02340)**  `arXiv:2510.02340`  `cs.CL` `cs.LG`  
  _Xin Gao, Ruiyi Zhang, Daniel Du, Saurabh Mahindre, Sai Ashish Somayajula, Pengtao Xie_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used for temporal prediction, but their reliance on pretraining data raises contamination concerns, as accurate predictions on pre-cutoff test data may reflect memorization rather than reasoning, leading to an overestimation of their generalization capability. With the recent emergence of prompting-based unlearning techniques, a natural question arises: Can LLMs be prompted to simulate an earlier knowledge cutoff? In this work, we investigate the capability of prompting to simulate earlier knowledge cutoff in LLMs. We construct three evaluation datasets to assess the extent to which LLMs can forget (1) direct factual knowledge, (2) semantic shifts, and (3) causally related knowledge. Results demonstrate that while prompt-based simulated knowledge cutoffs show effectiveness when directly queried with the information after that date, they struggle to induce forgetting when the forgotten content is not directly asked but causally related to the query. These findings highlight the need for more rigorous evaluation settings when applying LLMs for temporal prediction tasks. The full dataset and evaluation code are available atthis https URL.

  _Ziqing Wang, Chengsheng Mao, Xiaole Wen, Yuan Luo, Kaize Ding_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Medical Multimodal Large Language Models (Med-MLLMs) have shown great promise in medical visual question answering (Med-VQA). However, when deployed in low-resource settings where abundant labeled data are unavailable, existing Med-MLLMs commonly fail due to their medical reasoning capability bottlenecks: (i) the intrinsic reasoning bottleneck that ignores the details from the medical image; (ii) the extrinsic reasoning bottleneck that fails to incorporate specialized medical knowledge. To address those limitations, we propose AMANDA, a training-free agentic framework that performs medical knowledge augmentation via LLM agents. Specifically, our intrinsic medical knowledge augmentation focuses on coarse-to-fine question decomposition for comprehensive diagnosis, while extrinsic medical knowledge augmentation grounds the reasoning process via biomedical knowledge graph retrieval. Extensive experiments across eight Med-VQA benchmarks demonstrate substantial improvements in both zero-shot and few-shot Med-VQA settings. The code is available atthis https URL.

  _Hongxiang Zhang, Yuan Tian, Tianyi Zhang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  To solve complex reasoning tasks for Large Language Models (LLMs), prompting-based methods offer a lightweight alternative to fine-tuning and reinforcement learning. However, as reasoning chains extend, critical intermediate steps and the original prompt will be buried in the context, receiving insufficient attention and leading to errors. In this paper, we propose Self-Anchor, a novel pipeline that leverages the inherent structure of reasoning to steer LLM attention. Self-Anchor decomposes reasoning trajectories into structured plans and automatically aligns the model's attention to the most relevant inference steps, allowing the model to maintain focus throughout generation. Our experiment shows that Self-Anchor outperforms SOTA prompting methods across six benchmarks. Notably, Self-Anchor significantly reduces the performance gap between ``non-reasoning'' models and specialized reasoning models, with the potential to enable most LLMs to tackle complex reasoning tasks without retraining.

- **[Evaluating Large Language Models for IUCN Red List Species Information](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02830)**  `arXiv:2510.02830`  `cs.CL` `cs.AI`  
  _Shinya Uryu_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly being adopted in conservation to address the biodiversity crisis, yet their reliability for species evaluation is uncertain. This study systematically validates five leading models on 21,955 species across four core IUCN Red List assessment components: taxonomy, conservation status, distribution, and threats. A critical paradox was revealed: models excelled at taxonomic classification (94.9%) but consistently failed at conservation reasoning (27.2% for status assessment). This knowledge-reasoning gap, evident across all models, suggests inherent architectural constraints, not just data limitations. Furthermore, models exhibited systematic biases favoring charismatic vertebrates, potentially amplifying existing conservation inequities. These findings delineate clear boundaries for responsible LLM deployment: they are powerful tools for information retrieval but require human oversight for judgment-based decisions. A hybrid approach is recommended, where LLMs augment expert capacity while human experts retain sole authority over risk assessment and policy.

  _Srinivas Billa, Xiaonan Jing_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Results on existing LLM benchmarks capture little information over the model capabilities in low-resource tasks, making it difficult to develop effective solutions in these domains. To address these challenges, we curated 14 travel-domain datasets spanning 7 common NLP tasks using anonymised data from real-world scenarios, and analysed the performance across LLMs. We report on the accuracy, scaling behaviour, and reasoning capabilities of LLMs in a variety of tasks. Our results confirm that general benchmarking results are insufficient for understanding model performance in low-resource tasks. Despite the amount of training FLOPs, out-of-the-box LLMs hit performance bottlenecks in complex, domain-specific scenarios. Furthermore, reasoning provides a more significant boost for smaller LLMs by making the model a better judge on certain tasks.

  Large language models (LLMs) has become a significant research focus and is utilized in various fields, such as text generation and dialog systems. One of the most essential applications of LLM is Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), which greatly enhances generated content's reliability and relevance. However, evaluating RAG systems remains a challenging task. Traditional evaluation metrics struggle to effectively capture the key features of modern LLM-generated content that often exhibits high fluency and naturalness. Inspired by the RAGAS tool, a well-known RAG evaluation framework, we extended this framework into a KG-based evaluation paradigm, enabling multi-hop reasoning and semantic community clustering to derive more comprehensive scoring metrics. By incorporating these comprehensive evaluation criteria, we gain a deeper understanding of RAG systems and a more nuanced perspective on their performance. To validate the effectiveness of our approach, we compare its performance with RAGAS scores and construct a human-annotated subset to assess the correlation between human judgments and automated metrics. In addition, we conduct targeted experiments to demonstrate that our KG-based evaluation method is more sensitive to subtle semantic differences in generated outputs. Finally, we discuss the key challenges in evaluating RAG systems and highlight potential directions for future research.

  Large language model (LLM) agents typically receive two kinds of context: (i) environment-level manuals that define interaction interfaces and global rules, and (ii) task-level guidance or demonstrations tied to specific goals. In this work, we identify a crucial but overlooked third type of context, instance-level context, which consists of verifiable and reusable facts tied to a specific environment instance, such as object locations, crafting recipes, and local rules. We argue that the absence of instance-level context is a common source of failure for LLM agents in complex tasks, as success often depends not only on reasoning over global rules or task prompts but also on making decisions based on precise and persistent facts. Acquiring such context requires more than memorization: the challenge lies in efficiently exploring, validating, and formatting these facts under tight interaction budgets. We formalize this problem as Instance-Level Context Learning (ILCL) and introduce our task-agnostic method to solve it. Our method performs a guided exploration, using a compact TODO forest to intelligently prioritize its next actions and a lightweight plan-act-extract loop to execute them. This process automatically produces a high-precision context document that is reusable across many downstream tasks and agents, thereby amortizing the initial exploration cost. Experiments across TextWorld, ALFWorld, and Crafter demonstrate consistent gains in both success and efficiency: for instance, ReAct's mean success rate in TextWorld rises from 37% to 95%, while IGE improves from 81% to 95%. By transforming one-off exploration into persistent, reusable knowledge, our method complements existing contexts to enable more reliable and efficient LLM agents.

  We explore how large language models (LLMs) assess offensiveness in political discourse when prompted to adopt specific political and cultural perspectives. Using a multilingual subset of the MD-Agreement dataset centered on tweets from the 2020 US elections, we evaluate several recent LLMs - including DeepSeek-R1, o4-mini, GPT-4.1-mini, Qwen3, Gemma, and Mistral - tasked with judging tweets as offensive or non-offensive from the viewpoints of varied political personas (far-right, conservative, centrist, progressive) across English, Polish, and Russian contexts. Our results show that larger models with explicit reasoning abilities (e.g., DeepSeek-R1, o4-mini) are more consistent and sensitive to ideological and cultural variation, while smaller models often fail to capture subtle distinctions. We find that reasoning capabilities significantly improve both the personalization and interpretability of offensiveness judgments, suggesting that such mechanisms are key to adapting LLMs for nuanced sociopolitical text classification across languages and ideologies.

  Converting natural language questions into SQL queries (Text-to-SQL) enables non-expert users to interact with relational databases and has long been a central task for natural language interfaces to data. While the WikiSQL dataset played a key role in early NL2SQL research, its usage has declined due to structural and annotation issues, including case sensitivity inconsistencies, data type mismatches, syntax errors, and unanswered questions. We present LLMSQL, a systematic revision and transformation of WikiSQL designed for the LLM era. We classify these errors and implement automated methods for cleaning and re-annotation. To assess the impact of these improvements, we evaluated multiple large language models (LLMs), including Gemma 3, LLaMA 3.2, Mistral 7B, gpt-oss 20B, Phi-3.5 Mini, Qwen 2.5, OpenAI o4-mini, DeepSeek R1 and others. Rather than serving as an update, LLMSQL is introduced as an LLM-ready benchmark: unlike the original WikiSQL, tailored for pointer-network models selecting tokens from input, LLMSQL provides clean natural language questions and full SQL queries as plain text, enabling straightforward generation and evaluation for modern natural language-to-SQL models.

  Obtaining large-scale, high-quality reasoning data is crucial for improving the geometric reasoning capabilities of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs). However, existing data generation methods, whether based on predefined tem plates or constrained symbolic provers, inevitably face diversity and numerical generalization limitations. To address these limitations, we propose NeSyGeo, a novel neuro-symbolic framework for generating geometric reasoning data. First, we propose a domain-specific language grounded in the entity-attributes-relations paradigm to comprehensively represent all components of plane geometry, along with generative actions defined within this symbolic space. We then design a symbolic-visual-text pipeline that synthesizes symbolic sequences, maps them to visual and textual representations and generates reasoning path with reverse search and forward validation. Based on this framework, we construct NeSyGeo CoT and NeSyGeo-Caption datasets, containing 100k samples, and release a new benchmark NeSyGeo-Test for evaluating geometric reasoning abilities in MLLMs. Experiments demonstrate that the proposal significantly and consistently improves the performance of multiple MLLMs under both reinforcement and supervised fine-tuning. With only 4k samples and two epochs of reinforcement fine-tuning, base models achieve improvements of up to +15.8% on MathVision, +8.4% on MathVerse, and +7.3% on GeoQA. Notably, a 4B model can be improved to outperform an 8B model from the same series on geometric reasoning tasks.s

  Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has become the standard approach for equipping Large Language Models (LLMs) with up-to-date knowledge. However, standard RAG, relying on independent passage retrieval, often fails to capture the interconnected nature of information required for complex, multi-hop reasoning. While structured RAG methods attempt to address this using knowledge graphs built from triples, we argue that the inherent context loss of triples (context collapse) limits the fidelity of the knowledge representation. We introduce PropRAG, a novel RAG framework that shifts from triples to context-rich propositions and introduces an efficient, LLM-free online beam search over proposition paths to discover multi-step reasoning chains. By coupling a higher-fidelity knowledge representation with explicit path discovery, PropRAG achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot Recall@5 and F1 scores on 2Wiki, HotpotQA, and MuSiQue, advancing non-parametric knowledge integration by improving evidence retrieval through richer representation and efficient reasoning path discovery.

  Web agents powered by large language models (LLMs) must process lengthy web page observations to complete user goals; these pages often exceed tens of thousands of tokens. This saturates context limits and increases computational cost processing; moreover, processing full pages exposes agents to security risks such as prompt injection. Existing pruning strategies either discard relevant content or retain irrelevant context, leading to suboptimal action prediction. We introduce FocusAgent, a simple yet effective approach that leverages a lightweight LLM retriever to extract the most relevant lines from accessibility tree (AxTree) observations, guided by task goals. By pruning noisy and irrelevant content, FocusAgent enables efficient reasoning while reducing vulnerability to injection attacks. Experiments on WorkArena and WebArena benchmarks show that FocusAgent matches the performance of strong baselines, while reducing observation size by over 50%. Furthermore, a variant of FocusAgent significantly reduces the success rate of prompt-injection attacks, including banner and pop-up attacks, while maintaining task success performance in attack-free settings. Our results highlight that targeted LLM-based retrieval is a practical and robust strategy for building web agents that are efficient, effective, and secure.

  Large language models (LLMs) increasingly solve complex reasoning tasks via long chain-of-thought, but their forward-only autoregressive generation process is fragile; early token errors can cascade, which creates a clear need for self-reflection mechanisms. However, existing self-reflection either performs revisions over full drafts or learns self-correction via expensive training, both fundamentally reactive and inefficient. To address this, we propose Self-Reflective Generation at Test Time (SRGen), a lightweight test-time framework that reflects before generating at uncertain points. During token generation, SRGen utilizes dynamic entropy thresholding to identify high-uncertainty tokens. For each identified token, it trains a specific corrective vector, which fully exploits the already generated context for a self-reflective generation to correct the token probability distribution. By retrospectively analyzing the partial output, this self-reflection enables more trustworthy decisions, thereby significantly reducing the probability of errors at highly uncertain points. Evaluated on challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks and a diverse set of LLMs, SRGen can consistently strengthen model reasoning: improvements in single-pass quality also translate into stronger self-consistency voting. Especially, on AIME2024 with DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B, SRGen yields absolute improvements of +12.0% on Pass@1 and +13.3% on Cons@5. Moreover, our findings position SRGen as a plug-and-play method that integrates reflection into the generation process for reliable LLM reasoning, achieving consistent gains with bounded overhead and broad composability with other training-time (e.g., RLHF) and test-time (e.g., SLOT) techniques.

  Reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated potential in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), but such training typically demands substantial efforts in creating and annotating data. In this work, we explore improving LLMs through RL with minimal data. Our approach alternates between the LLM proposing a task and then attempting to solve it. To minimize data dependency, we introduce two novel mechanisms grounded in self-awareness: (1) self-aware difficulty prediction, where the model learns to assess task difficulty relative to its own abilities and prioritize challenging yet solvable tasks, and (2) self-aware limit breaking, where the model recognizes when a task is beyond its capability boundary and proactively requests external data to break through that limit. Extensive experiments on nine benchmarks showing a 53.8% relative improvement with less than 1.2% extra data demonstrate the efficacy of self-aware RL and underscore the promise of self-evolving agent training.

  Recent developments have enabled Large Language Models (LLMs) to engage in complex reasoning tasks through deep thinking. However, the capacity of reasoning has not been successfully transferred to non-high-resource languages due to resource constraints, which struggles with multilingual reasoning tasks. To this end, we propose Structured-of-Thought (SoT), a training-free method that improves the performance on multilingual reasoning through a multi-step transformation: Language Thinking Transformation and Structured Knowledge Transformation. The SoT method converts language-specific semantic information into language-agnostic structured representations, enabling the models to understand the query in different languages more sophisticated. Besides, SoT effectively guides LLMs toward more concentrated reasoning to maintain consistent underlying reasoning pathways when handling cross-lingual variations in expression. Experimental results demonstrate that SoT outperforms several strong baselines on multiple multilingual reasoning benchmarks when adapting to various backbones of LLMs. It can also be integrated with other training-free strategies for further improvements.

  Reward models (RMs) play a critical role in enhancing the reasoning performance of LLMs. For example, they can provide training signals to finetune LLMs during reinforcement learning (RL) and help select the best answer from multiple candidates during inference. In this paper, we provide a systematic introduction to RMs, along with a comprehensive survey of their applications in LLM reasoning. We first review fundamental concepts of RMs, including their architectures, training methodologies, and evaluation techniques. Then, we explore their key applications: (1) guiding generation and selecting optimal outputs during LLM inference, (2) facilitating data synthesis and iterative self-improvement for LLMs, and (3) providing training signals in RL-based finetuning. Finally, we discuss critical open questions regarding the selection, generalization, evaluation, and enhancement of RMs, based on existing research and our own empirical findings. Our analysis aims to provide actionable insights for the effective deployment and advancement of RMs for LLM reasoning.

  Reinforcement learning improves LLM reasoning, yet sparse delayed reward over long sequences makes token-level credit assignment the key bottleneck. We study the verifiable-reward setting, where the final answer is checkable and multiple responses can be drawn per prompt. Reasoning tasks in math and medical QA align with this setup, where only a few decision tokens significantly impact the outcome. PPO offers token-level advantages with a learned value model, but it is complex to train both the actor and critic models simultaneously, and it is not easily generalizable, as the token-level values from the critic model can make training prone to overfitting. GRPO is critic-free and supports verifiable rewards, but spreads a single sequence-level return across tokens and ignores branching. We introduce \textbf{Prefix-to-Tree (P2T)}, a simple procedure that converts a group of responses into a prefix tree and computes \emph{nonparametric} prefix values \(V(s)\) by aggregating descendant outcomes. Built on P2T, we propose \textbf{TEMPO} (\emph{\textbf{T}ree-\textbf{E}stimated \textbf{M}ean Prefix Value for \textbf{P}olicy \textbf{O}ptimization}), a critic-free algorithm that augments the group-relative outcome signal of GRPO with \emph{branch-gated} temporal-difference corrections derived from the tree. At non-branch tokens, the temporal-difference (TD) term is zero, so TEMPO reduces to GRPO; at branching tokens, it supplies precise token-level credit without a learned value network or extra judges/teachers. On Qwen3-1.7B/4B, TEMPO outperforms PPO and GRPO on in-distribution (MATH, MedQA) and out-of-distribution (GSM-HARD, AMC23, MedMCQA, MMLU-Medical) benchmarks, and reaches higher validation accuracy with roughly the same wall-clock time.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) hold promise in addressing complex medical problems. However, while most prior studies focus on improving accuracy and reasoning abilities, a significant bottleneck in developing effective healthcare agents lies in the readability of LLM-generated responses, specifically, their ability to answer public health problems clearly and simply to people without medical backgrounds. In this work, we introduce RephQA, a benchmark for evaluating the readability of LLMs in public health question answering (QA). It contains 533 expert-reviewed QA pairs from 27 sources across 13 topics, and includes a proxy multiple-choice task to assess informativeness, along with two readability metrics: Flesch-Kincaid grade level and professional score. Evaluation of 25 LLMs reveals that most fail to meet readability standards, highlighting a gap between reasoning and effective communication. To address this, we explore four readability-enhancing strategies-standard prompting, chain-of-thought prompting, Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), and a token-adapted variant. Token-adapted GRPO achieves the best results, advancing the development of more practical and user-friendly public health agents. These results represent a step toward building more practical agents for public health.

  It is important for Large Language Models (LLMs) to be aware of the boundary of their knowledge, distinguishing queries they can confidently answer from those that lie beyond their capabilities. Such awareness enables models to perform adaptive inference, such as invoking retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), engaging in slow and deep thinking, or abstaining from answering when appropriate. These mechanisms are key to developing efficient and trustworthy AI. In this work, we propose a method to detect knowledge boundaries via Query-Level Uncertainty, which estimates if a model is capable of answering a given query before generating any tokens, thus avoiding the generation cost. To this end, we propose a novel, training-free method called Internal Confidence, which leverages self-evaluations across layers and tokens to provide a reliable signal of uncertainty. Empirical studies on both factual question answering and mathematical reasoning tasks demonstrate that our Internal Confidence outperforms several baselines in quality of confidence while being computationally cheaper. Furthermore, we demonstrate its benefits in adaptive inference settings, showing that for RAG and model cascading it reduces inference costs while preserving overall performance.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) can generate plausible free text self-explanations to justify their answers. However, these natural language explanations may not accurately reflect the model's actual reasoning process, indicating a lack of faithfulness. Existing faithfulness evaluation methods rely primarily on behavioral tests or computational block analysis without examining the semantic content of internal neural representations. This paper proposes NeuroFaith, a flexible framework that measures the faithfulness of LLM free text self-explanation by identifying key concepts within explanations and mechanistically testing whether these concepts actually influence the model's predictions. We show the versatility of NeuroFaith across 2-hop reasoning and classification tasks. Additionally, a linear faithfulness probe based on NeuroFaith is developed to detect unfaithful self-explanations from representation space and improve faithfulness through steering. NeuroFaith provides a principled approach to evaluating and enhancing the faithfulness of LLM free text self-explanations, addressing critical needs for trustworthy AI systems.

  We introduce EconWebArena, a benchmark for evaluating autonomous agents on complex, multimodal economic tasks in realistic web environments. The benchmark comprises 360 curated tasks from 82 authoritative websites spanning domains such as macroeconomics, labor, finance, trade, and public policy. Each task challenges agents to navigate live websites, interpret structured and visual content, interact with real interfaces, and extract precise, time-sensitive data through multi-step workflows. We construct the benchmark by prompting multiple large language models (LLMs) to generate candidate tasks, followed by rigorous human curation to ensure clarity, feasibility, and source reliability. Unlike prior work, EconWebArena emphasizes fidelity to authoritative data sources and the need for grounded web-based economic reasoning. We evaluate a diverse set of state-of-the-art multimodal LLMs as web agents, analyze failure cases, and conduct ablation studies to assess the impact of visual grounding, plan-based reasoning, and interaction design. Our results reveal substantial performance gaps and highlight persistent challenges in grounding, navigation, and multimodal understanding, positioning EconWebArena as a rigorous testbed for economic web intelligence.

  The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into multiagent systems has opened new possibilities for collaborative reasoning and cooperation with AI agents. This paper explores different prompting methods and evaluates their effectiveness in enhancing agent collaborative behaviour and decision-making. We enhance CoELA, a framework designed for building Collaborative Embodied Agents that leverage LLMs for multi-agent communication, reasoning, and task coordination in shared virtual spaces. Through systematic experimentation, we examine different LLMs and prompt engineering strategies to identify optimised combinations that maximise collaboration performance. Furthermore, we extend our research by integrating speech capabilities, enabling seamless collaborative voice-based interactions. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of prompt optimisation in enhancing collaborative agent performance; for example, our best combination improved the efficiency of the system running with Gemma3 by 22% compared to the original CoELA system. In addition, the speech integration provides a more engaging user interface for iterative system development and demonstrations.

  As vision-language models (VLMs) gain prominence, their multimodal interfaces also introduce new safety vulnerabilities, making the safety evaluation challenging and critical. Existing red-teaming efforts are either restricted to a narrow set of adversarial patterns or depend heavily on manual engineering, lacking scalable exploration of emerging real-world VLM vulnerabilities. To bridge this gap, we propose ARMs, an adaptive red-teaming agent that systematically conducts comprehensive risk assessments for VLMs. Given a target harmful behavior or risk definition, ARMs automatically optimizes diverse red-teaming strategies with reasoning-enhanced multi-step orchestration, to effectively elicit harmful outputs from target VLMs. We propose 11 novel multimodal attack strategies, covering diverse adversarial patterns of VLMs (e.g., reasoning hijacking, contextual cloaking), and integrate 17 red-teaming algorithms into ARMs via model context protocol (MCP). To balance the diversity and effectiveness of the attack, we design a layered memory with an epsilon-greedy attack exploration algorithm. Extensive experiments on instance- and policy-based benchmarks show that ARMs achieves SOTA attack success rates, exceeding baselines by an average of 52.1% and surpassing 90% on Claude-4-Sonnet. We show that the diversity of red-teaming instances generated by ARMs is significantly higher, revealing emerging vulnerabilities in VLMs. Leveraging ARMs, we construct ARMs-Bench, a large-scale multimodal safety dataset comprising over 30K red-teaming instances spanning 51 diverse risk categories, grounded in both real-world multimodal threats and regulatory risks. Safety fine-tuning with ARMs-Bench substantially improves the robustness of VLMs while preserving their general utility, providing actionable guidance to improve multimodal safety alignment against emerging threats.

  LLM web agents now browse and take actions on the open web, yet current agent evaluations are constrained to sandboxed environments or artificial tasks. We introduce BrowserArena, a live open-web agent evaluation platform that collects user-submitted tasks, runs Arena-style head-to-head comparisons, and uses step-level human feedback to surface failure modes. Collecting and analyzing step-level annotations on the agent traces, we identify three consistent failure modes: captcha resolution, pop-up banner removal, and direct navigation to URLs. By constructing targeted datasets to further study these tasks, we discover variations in how different language models navigate these failure modes. We find, for example, that o4-mini deploys a wider variety of strategies to circumvent captcha resolution than other models and DeepSeek-R1 consistently misleads users about captcha resolution. Our findings surface both the diversity and brittleness of current web agents. More broadly, our benchmarking methodology provides an approach to evaluating and understanding web agent failure modes at scale.

  Large language models (LLMs) can improve reasoning at inference time through test-time scaling (TTS), where multiple reasoning traces are generated and the best one is selected. Prior work shows that increasing the number of samples K steadily improves accuracy. In this paper, we demonstrate that this trend does not hold indefinitely: at large K, further scaling yields no gains, and certain hard questions remain unsolved regardless of the number of traces. Interestingly, we find that different sampling temperatures solve different subsets of problems, implying that single-temperature scaling explores only part of a model's potential. We therefore propose scaling along the temperature dimension, which enlarges the reasoning boundary of LLMs. Averaged over Qwen3 (0.6B, 1.7B, 4B, 8B) and five representative reasoning benchmarks (AIME 2024/2025, MATH500, LiveCodeBench, Hi-ToM), temperature scaling yields an additional 7.3 points over single-temperature TTS. Temperature scaling also enables base models to reach performance comparable to reinforcement learning (RL)-trained counterparts, without additional post-training. We further provide a comprehensive analysis of this phenomenon and design a multi-temperature voting method that reduces the overhead of temperature scaling. Overall, our findings suggest that TTS is more powerful than previously thought, and that temperature scaling offers a simple and effective way to unlock the latent potential of base models.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Although recent tool-augmented benchmarks incorporate complex user requests and diverse tools, the evaluation methods for most of them remain limited to answer matching. However, as the number of steps required to resolve a user request increases, a proper evaluation of an agent's performance must go beyond the final answer to also assess the problem-solving trajectory, including previously ignored aspects such as efficiency, hallucination, and adaptivity. The most straightforward method for evaluating these aspects is to compare an agent's trajectory with the ground-truth trajectory, but this approach is fundamentally limited since annotating all valid ground-truth trajectories is prohibitively expensive. However, a simple LLM-based evaluator struggles to assess trajectories in detail without ground truth. To effectively evaluate the agents in this manner, we introduce TRACE, a framework for the multi-dimensional evaluation of tool-augmented LLM agent performance. By incorporating an evidence bank, which accumulates knowledge gathered from preceding reasoning steps, TRACE enables a multi-faceted analysis and evaluation of an agent's reasoning trajectory effectively. To validate our framework, we develop a new meta-evaluation dataset by augmenting existing benchmarks with diverse and flawed trajectories, each labeled with multi-faceted performance scores. Our results confirm that TRACE accurately evaluates these complex behaviors in a scalable and cost-effective manner, even with small open-source LLMs. Furthermore, we apply our method to evaluate the trajectories that agents produce while solving tool-augmented tasks, presenting previously unreported observations and their corresponding insights.

  Verifying multi-step reasoning in large language models is difficult due to imprecise error localization and high token costs. Existing methods either assess entire reasoning chains, suffering attention dilution, or rely on expensive multi-sampling. We introduce Node-wise Consistency Verification (NCV), a training-free framework that recasts verification as lightweight binary consistency checks at the node level. By decomposing the chain of thought into interconnected verification nodes, NCV precisely localizes errors and avoids unnecessary long-form generation. Experiments demonstrate that our approach enhances interpretability and efficiency, presenting a scalable solution for reliable LLM reasoning verification. On public datasets, NCV achieves a 10\% to 25\% improvement in F1 scores over baselines while utilizing $6\times$~$58\times$ fewer tokens than traditional methods like CoT-based verifiers.

  Inspired by the dual-process theory of human cognition from \textit{Thinking, Fast and Slow}, we introduce \textbf{PRIME} (Planning and Retrieval-Integrated Memory for Enhanced Reasoning), a multi-agent reasoning framework that dynamically integrates \textbf{System 1} (fast, intuitive thinking) and \textbf{System 2} (slow, deliberate thinking). PRIME first employs a Quick Thinking Agent (System 1) to generate a rapid answer; if uncertainty is detected, it then triggers a structured System 2 reasoning pipeline composed of specialized agents for \textit{planning}, \textit{hypothesis generation}, \textit{retrieval}, \textit{information integration}, and \textit{decision-making}. This multi-agent design faithfully mimics human cognitive processes and enhances both efficiency and accuracy. Experimental results with LLaMA 3 models demonstrate that PRIME enables open-source LLMs to perform competitively with state-of-the-art closed-source models like GPT-4 and GPT-4o on benchmarks requiring multi-hop and knowledge-grounded reasoning. This research establishes PRIME as a scalable solution for improving LLMs in domains requiring complex, knowledge-intensive reasoning.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have made remarkable progress in mathematical reasoning, but still continue to struggle with high-precision tasks like numerical computation and formal symbolic manipulation. Integrating external tools has emerged as a promising approach to bridge this gap. Despite recent advances, existing methods struggle with three key challenges: constructing tool-integrated reasoning data, performing fine-grained optimization, and enhancing inference. To overcome these limitations, we propose THOR (Tool-Integrated Hierarchical Optimization via RL). First, we introduce TIRGen, a multi-agent actor-critic-based pipeline for constructing high-quality datasets of tool-integrated reasoning paths, aligning with the policy and generalizing well across diverse models. Second, to perform fine-grained hierarchical optimization, we introduce an RL strategy that jointly optimizes for both episode-level problem solving and step-level code generation. This is motivated by our key insight that the success of an intermediate tool call is a strong predictor of the final answer's correctness. Finally, THOR incorporates a self-correction mechanism that leverages immediate tool feedback to dynamically revise erroneous reasoning paths during inference. Our approach demonstrates strong generalization across diverse models, performing effectively in both reasoning and non-reasoning models. It further achieves state-of-the-art performance for models of a similar scale on multiple mathematical benchmarks, while also delivering consistent improvements on code benchmarks. Our code will be publicly available atthis https URL.

  While reasoning models demonstrate exceptional performance on complex tasks, they often exhibit tendencies of overthinking on simple problems. This phenomenon not only leads to excessive computational resource consumption but also significantly degrades user experience. To address this challenge, we propose SelfBudgeter - a novel user-friendly adaptive controllable reasoning framework that incorporates a budget estimation mechanism prior to reasoning. The framework adopts a dual-phase training paradigm: during the cold-start phase, the model learns to predict token budgets before executing reasoning in a standardized format; in the reinforcement learning phase, the model is trained to autonomously plan budgets based on problem difficulty and strictly adhere to them when generating responses. Since the model outputs budget estimates at the initial stage, users can immediately anticipate waiting duration, enabling flexible decisions on whether to interrupt or continue the generation process. Notably, our method supports manual control of reasoning length through pre-filled budget fields. Experimental results demonstrate that SelfBudgeter can dynamically allocate budgets according to problem complexity, yielding an average response length compression of 61% for the 1.5B model on GSM8K, MATH500, and AIME2025, and 48% for the 7B model, while maintaining nearly undiminished accuracy.

  Reinforcement learning from human or AI feedback (RLHF / RLAIF) has become the standard paradigm for aligning large language models (LLMs). However, most pipelines rely on a single reward model (RM), limiting alignment quality and risking overfitting. Recent work explores RM routing--dynamically selecting an RM from a candidate pool to exploit complementary strengths while maintaining $O(1)$ RM calls--but existing methods suffer from cold-start and insufficient exploration. We propose BayesianRouter, a hybrid routing framework that combines offline RM strengths learning with online Bayesian selection. In the offline stage, a multi-task router is trained on preference data to estimate per-RM reliability. In the online stage, a Bayesian Thompson sampling router performs per-query RM selection, initializing RM-specific weight vectors with offline embeddings as Gaussian priors and adaptively updating their posteriors with online rewards to adapt to the evolving policy distribution. Extensive experiments on instruction-following (AlpacaEval-2, Arena-Hard, MT-Bench) and reasoning (GSM8K, MMLU) benchmarks show that BayesianRouter consistently outperforms individual RMs, RM ensembling, and existing routing methods.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Natural language descriptions of optimization or satisfaction problems are challenging to translate into correct MiniZinc models, as this process demands both logical reasoning and constraint programming expertise. We introduce Gala, a framework that addresses this challenge with a global agentic approach: multiple specialized large language model (LLM) agents decompose the modeling task by global constraint type. Each agent is dedicated to detecting and generating code for a specific class of global constraint, while a final assembler agent integrates these constraint snippets into a complete MiniZinc model. By dividing the problem into smaller, well-defined sub-tasks, each LLM handles a simpler reasoning challenge, potentially reducing overall complexity. We conduct initial experiments with several LLMs and show better performance against baselines such as one-shot prompting and chain-of-thought prompting. Finally, we outline a comprehensive roadmap for future work, highlighting potential enhancements and directions for improvement.

  Large language models (LLMs) excel at natural language understanding and generation but remain vulnerable to factual errors, limiting their reliability in knowledge-intensive tasks. While decoding-time strategies provide a promising efficient solution without training, existing methods typically treat token-level and layer-level signals in isolation, overlooking the joint dynamics between them. In this work, we introduce a token-aware, layer-localized contrastive decoding method that aligns specific token types with their most influential transformer layers to improve factual generation. Through empirical attention analysis, we identify two key patterns: punctuation tokens receive dominant attention in early layers, while conceptual tokens govern semantic reasoning in intermediate layers. By selectively suppressing attention to these token types at their respective depths, we achieve the induction of controlled factual degradation and derive contrastive signals to guide the final factual decoding. Our method requires no additional training or model modification, and experiments demonstrate that our method consistently improves factuality across multiple LLMs and various benchmarks.

  Large language models frequently generate harmful recommendations in personal multi-turn dialogue by ignoring user-specific safety context, exhibiting sycophantic agreement, and compromising user safety for larger group preferences. We introduce MIRROR, a modular production-focused architecture that prevents these failures through a persistent, bounded internal state that preserves personal conversational information across conversational turns. Our dual-component design inspired by Dual Process Theory separates immediate response generation (Talker) from asynchronous deliberative processing (Thinker), which synthesizes parallel reasoning threads between turns with marginal latency. On the CuRaTe personalized safety benchmark, MIRROR-augmented models achieve a 21% relative improvement (69% to 84%) across seven diverse frontier models, with open-source Llama 4 and Mistral 3 variants surpassing both GPT-4o and Claude 3.7 Sonnet at only \$0.0028 to \$0.0172 additional cost per turn, narrowing the gap between affordable open-source models to frontier systems in the safety space. The modular architecture enables flexible deployment: full internal processing for affordable models or single-component configurations for expensive systems, democratizing access to safer, personalized AI.

  Detecting bias in multimodal news requires models that reason over text--image pairs, not just classify text. In response, we present ViLBias, a VQA-style benchmark and framework for detecting and reasoning about bias in multimodal news. The dataset comprises 40,945 text--image pairs from diverse outlets, each annotated with a bias label and concise rationale using a two-stage LLM-as-annotator pipeline with hierarchical majority voting and human-in-the-loop validation. We evaluate Small Language Models (SLMs), Large Language Models (LLMs), and Vision--Language Models (VLMs) across closed-ended classification and open-ended reasoning (oVQA), and compare parameter-efficient tuning strategies. Results show that incorporating images alongside text improves detection accuracy by 3--5\%, and that LLMs/VLMs better capture subtle framing and text--image inconsistencies than SLMs. Parameter-efficient methods (LoRA/QLoRA/Adapters) recover 97--99\% of full fine-tuning performance with $<5\%$ trainable parameters. For oVQA, reasoning accuracy spans 52--79\% and faithfulness 68--89\%, both improved by instruction tuning; closed accuracy correlates strongly with reasoning ($r = 0.91$). ViLBias offers a scalable benchmark and strong baselines for multimodal bias detection and rationale quality.
