  Developing general-purpose navigation policies for unknown environments remains a core challenge in robotics. Most existing systems rely on task-specific neural networks and fixed information flows, limiting their generalizability. Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) offer a promising alternative by embedding human-like knowledge for reasoning and planning, but prior LVLM-robot integrations have largely depended on pre-mapped spaces, hard-coded representations, and rigid control logic. We introduce the Agentic Robotic Navigation Architecture (ARNA), a general-purpose framework that equips an LVLM-based agent with a library of perception, reasoning, and navigation tools drawn from modern robotic stacks. At runtime, the agent autonomously defines and executes task-specific workflows that iteratively query modules, reason over multimodal inputs, and select navigation actions. This agentic formulation enables robust navigation and reasoning in previously unmapped environments, offering a new perspective on robotic stack design. Evaluated in Habitat Lab on the HM-EQA benchmark, ARNA outperforms state-of-the-art EQA-specific approaches. Qualitative results on RxR and custom tasks further demonstrate its ability to generalize across a broad range of navigation challenges.

  Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) can elicit strong reasoning in large language models (LLMs), while their performance after RLVR varies dramatically across different base models. This raises a fundamental question: what microscopic property of pre-trained models leads to this variation? To investigate, we formalize reasoning as chains of Horn clauses ("if-then" rules) built from features extracted from the LLM's latent space via cross-layer sparse autoencoders (SAEs). We estimate the transition probabilities between its features, and further categorize each rule by its semantic soundness level (e.g., strict, plausible, noisy) with an LLM. Our key discovery is that high-potential models are inherently soundness-aware: their internal probability distributions systematically shift across rules' soundness levels, becoming highly distinct for "strict" versus "noisy" rules. In contrast, weaker models are soundness-agnostic, collapsing to one distribution regardless of soundness levels. To quantify this, we introduce the Soundness-Aware Level (SAL), a microscopic metric using the Jensen-Shannon Divergence to measure the separation between these distributions. We show that SAL's predictions of post-RLVR reasoning performance follow a precise empirical law (R^2=0.87) across diverse model families (Qwen, Mistral, Llama, DeepSeek) and scales (0.5B-14B). This reveals that a model's reasoning potential is tied to its intrinsic, pre-trained ability to distinguish sound knowledge from unsound ones. These findings underscore the critical role of model pre-training in shaping reasoning and offer a practical metric grounded in the model's internal mechanisms for selecting/designing stronger base models.

- **[Internalizing World Models via Self-Play Finetuning for Agentic RL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15047)**  `arXiv:2510.15047`  `cs.LG` `cs.CL`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) as agents often struggle in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. Real-world environments are complex and dynamic, governed by task-specific rules and stochasticity, which makes it difficult for LLMs to ground their internal knowledge in those dynamics. Under such OOD conditions, vanilla RL training often fails to scale; we observe Pass@k--the probability that at least one of (k) sampled trajectories succeeds--drops markedly across training steps, indicating brittle exploration and limited generalization. Inspired by model-based reinforcement learning, we hypothesize that equipping LLM agents with an internal world model can better align reasoning with environmental dynamics and improve decision-making. We show how to encode this world model by decomposing it into two components: state representation and transition modeling. Building on this, we introduce SPA, a simple reinforcement learning framework that cold-starts the policy via a Self-Play supervised finetuning (SFT) stage to learn the world model by interacting with the environment, then uses it to simulate future states prior to policy optimization. This simple initialization outperforms the online world-modeling baseline and greatly boosts the RL-based agent training performance. Experiments across diverse environments like Sokoban, FrozenLake, and Sudoku show that our approach significantly improves performance. For example, SPA boosts the Sokoban success rate from 25.6% to 59.8% and raises the FrozenLake score from 22.1% to 70.9% for the Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct model.

- **[DLER: Doing Length pEnalty Right - Incentivizing More Intelligence per Token via Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15110)**  `arXiv:2510.15110`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI` `cs.CL`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reasoning language models such as OpenAI-o1, DeepSeek-R1, and Qwen achieve strong performance via extended chains of thought but often generate unnecessarily long outputs. Maximizing intelligence per token--accuracy relative to response length--remains an open problem. We revisit reinforcement learning (RL) with the simplest length penalty--truncation--and show that accuracy degradation arises not from the lack of sophisticated penalties but from inadequate RL optimization. We identify three key challenges: (i) large bias in advantage estimation, (ii) entropy collapse, and (iii) sparse reward signal. We address them with Doing Length pEnalty Right (DLER), a training recipe combining batch-wise reward normalization, higher clipping, dynamic sampling, and a simple truncation length penalty. DLER achieves state-of-the-art accuracy--efficiency trade-offs, cutting output length by over 70 percent while surpassing all previous baseline accuracy. It also improves test-time scaling: compared to DeepSeek-R1-7B, DLER-7B generates multiple concise responses in parallel with 28 percent higher accuracy and lower latency. We further introduce Difficulty-Aware DLER, which adaptively tightens truncation on easier questions for additional efficiency gains. We also propose an update-selective merging method that preserves baseline accuracy while retaining the concise reasoning ability of the DLER model, which is useful for scenarios where RL training data is scarce.

- **[CarBoN: Calibrated Best-of-N Sampling Improves Test-time Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15674)**  `arXiv:2510.15674`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Yung-Chen Tang, Pin-Yu Chen, Andrea Cavallaro_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Allocating more computation during inference time (test-time scaling) improves language model performance, especially for reasoning tasks. However, popular methods like Best-of-$N$ sampling often show diminishing returns as $N$ increases. To address this inefficiency, we introduce a general test-time calibration framework that adaptively modifies the model toward high-reward reasoning paths, with theoretical guarantees of improving the lower bound of expected reward under finite sampling, all without large language model (LLM) retraining. Within this framework, we propose CarBoN (Calibrated Best-of-$N$), a two-phase method that first explores the solution space and then learns a calibration of the logits via an input-specific temperature $T$ and additive shift vector $\delta$, guiding generation toward more reliable reasoning. Experiments on MATH-500 and AIME-2024 show that CarBoN improves efficiency, with up to $4\times$ fewer rollouts to reach the same accuracy, while often achieving higher accuracy under fixed budgets. We also analyze the complementary roles of $T$ and $\delta$ in balancing output diversity and correctness, and demonstrate that the framework also generalizes to step-level sampling strategies such as beam search.

- **[The Road Less Traveled: Enhancing Exploration in LLMs via Sequential Sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15502)**  `arXiv:2510.15502`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Shijia Kang, Muhan Zhang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reinforcement learning (RL) has been pivotal in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), but it often suffers from limited exploration and entropy collapse, where models exploit a narrow set of solutions, leading to a loss of sampling diversity and subsequently preventing RL from further improving performance. This issue is exacerbated in parallel sampling methods, where multiple outputs are drawn from the same distribution, potentially causing the model to converge to similar solutions. We propose SESA, a novel SEquential SAmpling framework that mitigates this challenge by generating diverse solution sketches sequentially before expanding them into full reasoning paths. This approach ensures broader exploration by conditioning each new output on previous ones, promoting diversity throughout the process and preventing policy collapse. Our experiments on a synthetic task show that sequential sampling consistently outperforms traditional RL methods in terms of path diversity and recovery from collapse. Further evaluations on real-world tasks demonstrate that SESA improves both the exploration of valid strategies and the overall performance of LLMs. On three agent benchmarks, SESA lifts success rates by $+0.25$, $+0.42$, and $+0.07$ absolute over the base model (up to an additional $211\%$ relative improvement over baseline RL), underscoring its exploration advantage. This work introduces a structured approach to exploration, paving the way for more effective and diverse reasoning in RL-trained LLMs. Our code is released atthis https URL.

- **[A Theoretical Study on Bridging Internal Probability and Self-Consistency for LLM Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15444)**  `arXiv:2510.15444`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Zhi Zhou, Yuhao Tan, Zenan Li, Yuan Yao, Lan-Zhe Guo, Yu-Feng Li, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Test-time scaling seeks to improve the reasoning performance of large language models (LLMs) by adding computational resources. A prevalent approach within the field is sampling-based test-time scaling methods, which enhance reasoning by generating multiple reasoning paths for a given input during inference. However, despite its practical success, the theoretical foundations remain underexplored. In this paper, we provide the first theoretical framework for analyzing sampling-based test-time scaling methods, grounded in the perspective of confidence estimation. Based on the framework, we analyze two dominant paradigms: self-consistency and perplexity, and reveal key limitations: self-consistency suffers from high estimation error while perplexity exhibits substantial modeling error and possible degradation of the estimation error convergence. To address these limitations, we introduce RPC, a hybrid method that leverages our theoretical insights through two key components: Perplexity Consistency and Reasoning Pruning. Perplexity Consistency combines the strengths of self-consistency and perplexity, boosting the convergence rate of estimation error from linear to exponential while preserving model error. Reasoning Pruning prevents degradation by eliminating low-probability reasoning paths. Both theoretical analysis and empirical results across seven benchmark datasets demonstrate that RPC has a strong potential for reducing reasoning error. Notably, RPC achieves reasoning performance comparable to self-consistency while not only enhancing confidence reliability but also reducing sampling costs by 50%.

- **[ReasonIF: Large Reasoning Models Fail to Follow Instructions During Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15211)**  `arXiv:2510.15211`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Yongchan Kwon, Shang Zhu, Federico Bianchi, Kaitlyn Zhou, James Zou_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The ability of large language models (LLMs) to follow user instructions is central to their reliability, safety, and usefulness. While prior studies assess instruction adherence in the model's main responses, we argue that it is also critical for large reasoning models (LRMs) to follow user instructions throughout their reasoning process. Reasoning instruction following makes LRMs more controllable and transparent, while reducing risks of undesirable shortcuts, hallucinations, or reward hacking within reasoning traces. To evaluate this dimension, we introduce ReasonIF, a systematic benchmark for assessing reasoning instruction following. ReasonIF includes six categories of instruction prompts, spanning multilingual reasoning, formatting and length control. Across many open-source LRMs including GPT-OSS, Qwen3, and DeepSeek-R1, we find substantial failures in reasoning instruction adherence: the highest instruction following score (IFS) remains below 0.25, meaning that fewer than $25\%$ of reasoning traces comply with the given instructions. Notably, as task difficulty increases, reasoning instruction following degrades further. We also explore two strategies to enhance reasoning instruction fidelity. (1) multi-turn reasoning and (2) Reasoning Instruction Finetuning (RIF) using synthetic data. RIF improves the IFS of $GPT-OSS-20B$ from 0.11 to 0.27, indicating measurable progress but leaving ample room for improvement.

- **[Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable yet Noisy Rewards under Imperfect Verifiers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00915)**  `arXiv:2510.00915`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Xin-Qiang Cai, Wei Wang, Feng Liu, Tongliang Liu, Gang Niu, Masashi Sugiyama_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) trains policies against automated verifiers to avoid costly human labeling. To reduce vulnerability to verifier hacking, many RLVR systems collapse rewards to binary $\{0,1\}$ during training. This choice carries a cost: it introduces \textit{false negatives} (rejecting correct answers, FNs) and \textit{false positives} (accepting incorrect ones, FPs). For instance, a rule-based checker may mark the correct fraction $\frac{12}{36}$ as wrong when compared against the canonical $\frac{1}{3}$ due to brittle parsing/equivalence rules (FN), while a large language model (LLM) judges can be gamed by superficial cues or even a single adversarial token, yielding inflated correctness for wrong solutions (FP). We formalize verifier unreliability by modeling the verifier as a stochastic reward channel with asymmetric noise rates. From this abstraction, we derive two correction algorithms for verifier errors. The first is a \textit{backward} correction that de-biases the observed binary reward to recover an \textit{unbiased} estimator of the clean policy gradient. The second is a \textit{forward} correction that reweights score-function terms so that the expected update direction aligns with the \textit{clean gradient}; notably, it requires only the FN rate. We implement both as lightweight hooks in a group relative policy optimization (GRPO)-based RLVR pipeline and evaluate them on math-reasoning models and benchmarks. Across models and datasets, both corrections improve over uncorrected training; the forward variant converges faster and remains stable under heavier noise. Finally, we show a practical appeal mechanism in which a lightweight LLM verifier estimates the FN rate online by rechecking rule-based negatives, obtaining outperformance compared with other state-of-the-art contenders.

- **[The Choice of Divergence: A Neglected Key to Mitigating Diversity Collapse in Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07430)**  `arXiv:2509.07430`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  A central paradox in fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) with Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR) is the frequent degradation of multi-attempt performance (Pass@k) despite improvements in single-attempt accuracy (Pass@1). This is often accompanied by catastrophic forgetting, where models lose previously acquired skills. While various methods have been proposed, the choice and function of the divergence term have been surprisingly unexamined as a proactive solution. We argue that standard RLVR objectives -- both those using the mode-seeking reverse KL-divergence and those forgoing a divergence term entirely -- lack a crucial mechanism for knowledge retention. The reverse-KL actively accelerates this decay by narrowing the policy, while its absence provides no safeguard against the model drifting from its diverse knowledge base. We propose a fundamental shift in perspective: using the divergence term itself as the solution. Our framework, Diversity-Preserving Hybrid RL (DPH-RL), leverages mass-covering f-divergences (like forward-KL and JS-divergence) to function as a rehearsal mechanism. By continuously referencing the initial policy, this approach forces the model to maintain broad solution coverage. Extensive experiments on math and SQL generation demonstrate that DPH-RL not only resolves the Pass@k degradation but improves both Pass@1 and Pass@k in- and out-of-domain. Additionally, DPH-RL is more training-efficient because it computes f-divergence using generator functions, requiring only sampling from the initial policy and no online reference model. Our work highlights a crucial, overlooked axis for improving RLVR, demonstrating that the proper selection of a divergence measure is a powerful tool for building more general and diverse reasoning models.

- **[Expanding the Action Space of LLMs to Reason Beyond Language](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07581)**  `arXiv:2510.07581`  `cs.LG`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful reasoners in natural language, but their actions are typically confined to outputting vocabulary tokens. As a result, interactions with external environments -- such as symbolic operators or simulators -- must be expressed through text in predefined formats, parsed, and routed to external interfaces. This overloads the model's language with both reasoning and control duties, and requires a hand-crafted parser, external to the LLM. To address this, we decouple environment interactions from language by internalizing them in an Expanded Action space (ExpA), beyond the vocabulary. The model starts reasoning in the default language environment, but may trigger routing actions and switch to an external environment at any time. From there, the model can only invoke environment-specific actions, receive feedback from the environment, and potentially route back to language as a result. To promote effective exploration of the expanded action space and new environments, we introduce ExpA Reinforcement Learning (EARL) with counterfactual policy optimization. On tasks requiring multi-turn interactions and contingent planning, EARL outperforms strong baselines with vocabulary-constrained actions. It performs robustly across calculator-based multi-task learning and, in the partially observed sorting problem, achieves perfect Sort-4 accuracy while self-discovering an efficient algorithm competitive with classical designs.

- **[Evaluating Sparse Autoencoders for Monosemantic Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15094)**  `arXiv:2508.15094`  `cs.LG`  
  _Moghis Fereidouni, Muhammad Umair Haider, Peizhong Ju, A.B. Siddique_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  A key barrier to interpreting large language models is polysemanticity, where neurons activate for multiple unrelated concepts. Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have been proposed to mitigate this issue by transforming dense activations into sparse, more interpretable features. While prior work suggests that SAEs promote monosemanticity, no quantitative comparison has examined how concept activation distributions differ between SAEs and their base models. This paper provides the first systematic evaluation of SAEs against base models through activation distribution lens. We introduce a fine-grained concept separability score based on the Jensen-Shannon distance, which captures how distinctly a neuron's activation distributions vary across concepts. Using two large language models (Gemma-2-2B and DeepSeek-R1) and multiple SAE variants across five datasets (including word-level and sentence-level), we show that SAEs reduce polysemanticity and achieve higher concept separability. To assess practical utility, we evaluate concept-level interventions using two strategies: full neuron masking and partial suppression. We find that, compared to base models, SAEs enable more precise concept-level control when using partial suppression. Building on this, we propose Attenuation via Posterior Probabilities (APP), a new intervention method that uses concept-conditioned activation distributions for targeted suppression. APP achieves the smallest perplexity increase while remaining highly effective at concept removal.

  Pretrained multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) demonstrate strong performance on diverse multimodal tasks, but remain limited in reasoning capabilities for domains where annotations are difficult to collect. In this work, we focus on artificial image domains such as charts, rendered documents, and webpages, which are abundant in practice yet lack large-scale human annotated reasoning datasets. We introduce COGS (COmposition-Grounded instruction Synthesis), a data-efficient framework for equipping MLLMs with advanced reasoning abilities from a small set of seed questions. The key idea is to decompose each seed question into primitive perception and reasoning factors, which can then be systematically recomposed with new images to generate large collections of synthetic question-answer pairs. Each generated question is paired with subquestions and intermediate answers, enabling reinforcement learning with factor-level process rewards. Experiments on chart reasoning show that COGS substantially improves performance on unseen questions, with the largest gains on reasoning-heavy and compositional questions. Moreover, training with a factor-level mixture of different seed data yields better transfer across multiple datasets, suggesting that COGS induces generalizable capabilities rather than dataset-specific overfitting. We further demonstrate that the framework extends beyond charts to other domains such as webpages.

- **[Train a Unified Multimodal Data Quality Classifier with Synthetic Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15162)**  `arXiv:2510.15162`  `cs.CV` `cs.CL`  
  _Weizhi Wang, Rongmei Lin, Shiyang Li, Colin Lockard, Ritesh Sarkhel, Sanket Lokegaonkar, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are continually pre-trained on a mixture of image-text caption data and interleaved document data, while the high-quality data filtering towards image-text interleaved document data is under-explored. We propose to train an efficient MLLM as a Unified Mulitmodal Data Quality Classifier to Filter both high-quality image-text caption and interleaved data (UniFilter). To address the challenge of collecting diverse labeled multimodal data, we introduce a semi-synthetic approach that leverages readily available raw images and generates corresponding text across four quality levels. This method enables efficient creation of sample-score pairs for both caption and interleaved document data to train UniFilter. We apply UniFilter to curate high-quality caption data from DataComp caption dataset and interleaved data from the OBELICS image-text interleaved dataset. MLLMs pre-trained on the filtered data demonstrate significantly enhanced capabilities compared to those trained on baseline-filtered data, achieving stronger zero-shot reasoning and in-context learning capabilities. After visual supervised fine-tuning, these UniFilter-induced MLLMs achieve stronger performance on various benchmarks, highlighting the downstream benefits of high-quality multimodal pre-training. We release the synthetic training data used for training UniFilter, the UniFilter model checkpoints, and the high-quality interleaved document subset OBELICS-HQ, curated by UniFilter, to the community for reproduction and further development.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Advancing machine intelligence requires developing the ability to perceive across multiple modalities, much as humans sense the world. We introduce OmniVinci, an initiative to build a strong, open-source, omni-modal LLM. We carefully study the design choices across model architecture and data curation. For model architecture, we present three key innovations: (i) OmniAlignNet for strengthening alignment between vision and audio embeddings in a shared omni-modal latent space; (ii) Temporal Embedding Grouping for capturing relative temporal alignment between vision and audio signals; and (iii) Constrained Rotary Time Embedding for encoding absolute temporal information in omni-modal embeddings. We introduce a curation and synthesis pipeline that generates 24M single-modal and omni-modal conversations. We find that modalities reinforce one another in both perception and reasoning. Our model, OmniVinci, outperforms Qwen2.5-Omni with +19.05 on DailyOmni (cross-modal understanding), +1.7 on MMAR (audio), and +3.9 on Video-MME (vision), while using just 0.2T training tokens - a 6 times reduction compared to Qwen2.5-Omni's 1.2T. We finally demonstrate omni-modal advantages in downstream applications spanning robotics, medical AI, and smart factory.

- **[Select Less, Reason More: Prioritizing Evidence Purity for Video Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15440)**  `arXiv:2510.15440`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`  
  _Xuchen Li, Xuzhao Li, Shiyu Hu, Kaiqi Huang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Long-form video reasoning remains a major challenge for Video Large Language Models (Video LLMs), as static uniform frame sampling leads to information dilution and obscures critical evidence. Furthermore, existing pixel-space video reasoning agents, which are designed to actively interact with the video to acquire new visual information, remain suboptimal due to their lack of rigorous reward mechanisms to enforce evidence purity and their inability to perform temporal information supplementation beyond pre-sampled frames. To address this critical gap, we propose a novel evidence-prioritized adaptive framework built upon our core philosophy: "Select Less, Reason More." Our core contribution is the evidence-aware reinforcement learning (EARL) framework, which transforms the model into an active interrogator of evidence. EARL is precisely engineered to dynamically select the most relevant frames and, crucially, to perform localized re-sampling around the selected key frames to access fine-grained temporal detail. Extensive experiments on five demanding video reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our EARL-trained model achieves new state-of-the-art among open-source Video LLMs, simultaneously learning an effective and high-purity visual evidence selection policy. Impressively, our 7B model achieves 59.8% on LongVideoBench, 69.0% on MVBench and 64.9% on VideoMME. These results highlight the importance of prioritizing evidence purity and the effectiveness of our framework.

  _Xingrui Wang, Jiang Liu, Chao Huang, Xiaodong Yu, Ze Wang, Ximeng Sun, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Omni-modal large language models (OLLMs) aim to unify audio, vision, and text understanding within a single framework. While existing benchmarks primarily evaluate general cross-modal question-answering ability, it remains unclear whether OLLMs achieve modality-invariant reasoning or exhibit modality-specific biases. We introduce XModBench, a large-scale tri-modal benchmark explicitly designed to measure cross-modal consistency. XModBench comprises 60,828 multiple-choice questions spanning five task families and systematically covers all six modality compositions in question-answer pairs, enabling fine-grained diagnosis of an OLLM's modality-invariant reasoning, modality disparity, and directional imbalance. Experiments show that even the strongest model, Gemini 2.5 Pro, (i) struggles with spatial and temporal reasoning, achieving less than 60% accuracy, (ii) reveals persistent modality disparities, with performance dropping substantially when the same semantic content is conveyed through audio rather than text, and (iii) shows systematic directional imbalance, exhibiting lower consistency when vision serves as context compared to text. These findings indicate that current OLLMs remain far from truly modality-invariant reasoning and position XModBench as a fundamental diagnostic tool for evaluating and improving cross-modal competence. All data and evaluation tools will be available atthis https URL.

- **[Perception Before Reasoning: Two-Stage Reinforcement Learning for Visual Reasoning in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13031)**  `arXiv:2509.13031`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`  
  _Yan Chen, Long Li, Teng Xi, Long Zeng, Jingdong Wang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reinforcement learning (RL) has proven highly effective in eliciting the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Inspired by this success, recent studies have explored applying similar techniques to vision-language models (VLMs), aiming to enhance their reasoning performance. However, directly transplanting RL methods from LLMs to VLMs is suboptimal, as the tasks faced by VLMs are inherently more complex. Specifically, VLMs must first accurately perceive and understand visual inputs before reasoning can be effectively performed. To address this challenge, we propose a two-stage reinforcement learning framework designed to jointly enhance both the perceptual and reasoning capabilities of VLMs. To mitigate the vanishing advantage issue commonly observed in RL training, we first perform dataset-level sampling to selectively strengthen specific capabilities using distinct data sources. During training, the first stage focuses on improving the model's visual perception through coarse- and fine-grained visual understanding, while the second stage targets the enhancement of reasoning abilities. After the proposed two-stage reinforcement learning process, we obtain PeBR-R1, a vision-language model with significantly enhanced perceptual and reasoning capabilities. Experimental results on seven benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and validate the superior performance of PeBR-R1 across diverse visual reasoning tasks.

- **[Neuro-Symbolic Spatial Reasoning in Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15841)**  `arXiv:2510.15841`  `cs.CV`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation (OVSS) assigns pixel-level labels from an open set of categories, requiring generalization to unseen and unlabelled objects. Using vision-language models (VLMs) to correlate local image patches with potential unseen object categories suffers from a lack of understanding of spatial relations of objects in a scene. To solve this problem, we introduce neuro-symbolic (NeSy) spatial reasoning in OVSS. In contrast to contemporary VLM correlation-based approaches, we propose Relational Segmentor (RelateSeg) to impose explicit spatial relational constraints by first order logic (FOL) formulated in a neural network architecture. This is the first attempt to explore NeSy spatial reasoning in OVSS. Specifically, RelateSeg automatically extracts spatial relations, e.g., <cat, to-right-of, person>, and encodes them as first-order logic formulas using our proposed pseudo categories. Each pixel learns to predict both a semantic category (e.g., "cat") and a spatial pseudo category (e.g., "right of person") simultaneously, enforcing relational constraints (e.g., a "cat" pixel must lie to the right of a "person"). Finally, these logic constraints are formulated in a deep network architecture by fuzzy logic relaxation, enabling end-to-end learning of spatial-relationally consistent segmentation. RelateSeg achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of average mIoU across four benchmark datasets and particularly shows clear advantages on images containing multiple categories, with the cost of only introducing a single auxiliary loss function and no additional parameters, validating the effectiveness of NeSy spatial reasoning in OVSS.

  Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are rapidly advancing, yet their reasoning ability often lags behind that of strong text-only counterparts. Existing methods to bridge this gap rely on supervised fine-tuning over large-scale multimodal reasoning data or reinforcement learning, both of which are resource-intensive. A promising alternative is model merging, which interpolates parameters between reasoning-enhanced LLMs and multimodal variants. However, our analysis shows that naive merging is not always a "free lunch": its effectiveness varies drastically across model families, with some (e.g., LLaVA, Idefics) benefiting while others (e.g., Qwen) suffer performance degradation. To address this, we propose Directional Reasoning Injection for Fine-Tuning (DRIFT) MLLMs, a lightweight method that transfers reasoning knowledge in the gradient space, without destabilizing multimodal alignment. DRIFT precomputes a reasoning prior as the parameter-space difference between reasoning and multimodal variants, then uses it to bias gradients during multimodal fine-tuning. This approach preserves the simplicity of standard supervised fine-tuning pipelines while enabling efficient reasoning transfer. Extensive experiments on multimodal reasoning benchmarks, including MathVista and MathVerse, demonstrate that DRIFT consistently improves reasoning performance over naive merging and supervised fine-tuning, while matching or surpassing training-heavy methods at a fraction of the cost.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have undergone rapid progress, largely attributed to reinforcement learning on complex reasoning tasks. In contrast, while spatial intelligence is fundamental for Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in real-world interaction, the systematic study of their complex spatial reasoning remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce SIRI-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate VLMs' structural spatial intelligence through spatial-grounded reasoning tasks. SIRI-Bench comprises 9,000 video-question-answer triplets, where each problem is embedded in a realistic 3D scene. The benchmark is carefully designed so that solving each problem requires both spatial comprehension and structural reasoning. To facilitate large-scale data synthesis, we develop an Automatic Scene Creation Engine that employs collaborative LLM agents to translate abstract mathematical problems into faithful 3D scenes. Experimental results reveal that state-of-the-art VLMs struggle significantly on SIRI-Bench, underscoring the challenge of structural spatial reasoning. We hope that our study will bring researchers' attention to spatially grounded reasoning and advance VLMs in visual problem-solving.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In recent times, the standard practice for developing MLLMs is to feed features from vision encoder(s) into the LLM and train with natural language supervision. This approach often causes models to lean towards language comprehension and undermine the rich visual perception signals present in the data, which are critical for tasks involving spatial reasoning in the domain of embodied AI and robotics. Is it possible to optimize both at the same time? In this work, we propose VisPer-LM, the first approach that infuses visual perception knowledge from expert vision encoders into the LLM's (of an MLLM) hidden representations. We start by investigating MLLMs trained solely with natural language supervision and identify a positive correlation between the quality of visual representations within these models and their downstream performance. Given this insight, we formulate the objective during the pretraining stage in MLLMs as a coupled optimization of predictive visual embedding and next (text) token prediction. Moreover, through extensive probing, we observe improved visual representation quality due to embedding optimization, underscoring the effectiveness of our probing setup. We demonstrate that our VisPer-LM outperforms the single and multi-encoder baselines, proving our approach's superiority over explicitly feeding the corresponding features to the LLM. In particular, VisPer-LM boosts performance by an average margin of up to 2.5% on various benchmarks, with a notable improvement of 8.7% on the Depth task in CV-Bench.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recently, large vision-language models (LVLMs) have rapidly gained popularity for their strong generation and reasoning capabilities given diverse multimodal inputs. However, these models incur significant computational and memory overhead during inference, which greatly hinders the efficient deployment in practical scenarios. The extensive key-value (KV) cache, necessitated by the lengthy input and output sequences, notably contributes to the high inference cost. Based on this, recent works have investigated ways to reduce the KV cache size for higher efficiency. Although effective, they generally overlook the distinct importance distributions of KV vectors across layers and maintain the same cache size for each layer during the next token prediction. This results in the significant contextual information loss for certain layers, leading to notable performance decline. To address this, we present PrefixKV, where "Prefix" means the top-ranked KV based on importance rather than position in the original sequence. It reframes the challenge of determining KV cache sizes for all layers into the task of searching for the optimal global prefix configuration. With an adaptive layer-wise KV retention recipe based on binary search, the maximum contextual information can thus be preserved in each layer, facilitating the generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance compared with others. It exhibits superior inference efficiency and generation quality trade-offs, showing promising potential for practical applications. Code is available atthis https URL.

  _Leitian Tao, Ilia Kulikov, Swarnadeep Saha, Tianlu Wang, Jing Xu, Sharon Li, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Post-training for reasoning of large language models (LLMs) increasingly relies on verifiable rewards: deterministic checkers that provide 0-1 correctness signals. While reliable, such binary feedback is brittle--many tasks admit partially correct or alternative answers that verifiers under-credit, and the resulting all-or-nothing supervision limits learning. Reward models offer richer, continuous feedback, which can serve as a complementary supervisory signal to verifiers. We introduce HERO (Hybrid Ensemble Reward Optimization), a reinforcement learning framework that integrates verifier signals with reward-model scores in a structured way. HERO employs stratified normalization to bound reward-model scores within verifier-defined groups, preserving correctness while refining quality distinctions, and variance-aware weighting to emphasize challenging prompts where dense signals matter most. Across diverse mathematical reasoning benchmarks, HERO consistently outperforms RM-only and verifier-only baselines, with strong gains on both verifiable and hard-to-verify tasks. Our results show that hybrid reward design retains the stability of verifiers while leveraging the nuance of reward models to advance reasoning.

  This paper introduces a simple and scalable approach to improve the data efficiency of large language model (LLM) training by augmenting existing text data with thinking trajectories. The compute for pre-training LLMs has been growing at an unprecedented rate, while the availability of high-quality data remains limited. Consequently, maximizing the utility of available data constitutes a significant research challenge. A primary impediment is that certain high-quality tokens are difficult to learn given a fixed model capacity, as the underlying rationale for a single token can be exceptionally complex and deep. To address this issue, we propose Thinking augmented Pre-Training (TPT), a universal methodology that augments text with automatically generated thinking trajectories. Such augmentation effectively increases the volume of the training data and makes high-quality tokens more learnable through step-by-step reasoning and decomposition. We apply TPT across diverse training configurations up to $100$B tokens, encompassing pre-training with both constrained and abundant data, as well as mid-training from strong open-source checkpoints. Experimental results indicate that our method substantially improves the performance of LLMs across various model sizes and families. Notably, TPT enhances the data efficiency of LLM pre-training by a factor of $3$. For a $3$B parameter model, it improves the post-training performance by over $10\%$ on several challenging reasoning benchmarks.

  Document understanding is critical for applications from financial analysis to scientific discovery. Current approaches, whether OCR-based pipelines feeding Large Language Models (LLMs) or native Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), face key limitations: the former loses structural detail, while the latter struggles with context modeling. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) helps ground models in external data, but documents' multimodal nature, i.e., combining text, tables, charts, and layout, demands a more advanced paradigm: Multimodal RAG. This approach enables holistic retrieval and reasoning across all modalities, unlocking comprehensive document intelligence. Recognizing its importance, this paper presents a systematic survey of Multimodal RAG for document understanding. We propose a taxonomy based on domain, retrieval modality, and granularity, and review advances involving graph structures and agentic frameworks. We also summarize key datasets, benchmarks, and applications, and highlight open challenges in efficiency, fine-grained representation, and robustness, providing a roadmap for future progress in document AI.

  Despite the remarkable advances of Large Language Models (LLMs) across diverse cognitive tasks, the rapid enhancement of these capabilities also introduces emergent deceptive behaviors that may induce severe risks in high-stakes deployments. More critically, the characterization of deception across realistic real-world scenarios remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we establish DeceptionBench, the first benchmark that systematically evaluates how deceptive tendencies manifest across different societal domains, what their intrinsic behavioral patterns are, and how extrinsic factors affect them. Specifically, on the static count, the benchmark encompasses 150 meticulously designed scenarios in five domains, i.e., Economy, Healthcare, Education, Social Interaction, and Entertainment, with over 1,000 samples, providing sufficient empirical foundations for deception analysis. On the intrinsic dimension, we explore whether models exhibit self-interested egoistic tendencies or sycophantic behaviors that prioritize user appeasement. On the extrinsic dimension, we investigate how contextual factors modulate deceptive outputs under neutral conditions, reward-based incentivization, and coercive pressures. Moreover, we incorporate sustained multi-turn interaction loops to construct a more realistic simulation of real-world feedback dynamics. Extensive experiments across LLMs and Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) reveal critical vulnerabilities, particularly amplified deception under reinforcement dynamics, demonstrating that current models lack robust resistance to manipulative contextual cues and the urgent need for advanced safeguards against various deception behaviors.

  Multi-step symbolic reasoning is essential for robust financial analysis; yet, current benchmarks largely overlook this capability. Existing datasets such as FinQA and ConvFinQA emphasize final numerical answers while neglecting the intermediate reasoning required for transparency and verification. To address this gap, we introduce FinChain, the first benchmark specifically designed for verifiable Chain-of-Thought (CoT) evaluation in finance. FinChain spans 58 topics across 12 financial domains, each represented by parameterized symbolic templates with executable Python traces that enable fully machine-verifiable reasoning and scalable, contamination-free data generation. To assess reasoning capacity, we propose ChainEval, a dynamic alignment metric that jointly evaluates both the final-answer correctness and the step-level reasoning consistency. Evaluating 26 leading LLMs reveals that even frontier proprietary systems exhibit clear limitations in symbolic financial reasoning, while domain-adapted and math-enhanced fine-tuned models substantially narrow this gap. Overall, FinChain exposes persistent weaknesses in multi-step financial reasoning and provides a foundation for developing trustworthy, interpretable, and verifiable financial AI.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown substantial advances through reinforcement learning (RL), particularly in domains where rewards can be programmatically verified, such as mathematics and code. In these areas, models benefit from a well-defined operational base guided by explicit rule-based objectives. However, this progress reveals a significant limitation: in open-ended domains where rewards are ambiguous, subjective, or context-dependent, such as creative writing, scientific reasoning, and notably medical consultation, robust reward functions are lacking, making these areas challenging for current RL strategies. To bridge this gap, we introduce ORBIT, an open-ended rubric-based incremental training framework specifically designed for high-stakes medical dialogue. ORBIT integrates syn- thetic dialogue generation with the dynamic creation of rubrics, employing these rubrics to direct an incremental RL process. In particular, this approach does not depend on external medical knowledge or manual rules, instead utilizing rubric-guided feedback to shape learning. When implemented on the Qwen3-4B-Instruct model, our method can greatly enhance its performance on the HealthBench-Hard benchmark from 7.0 to 27.2 using only 2k samples, thus achieving state-of-the-art results for models of this scale. Our analysis confirms that rubric-driven RL fos-ters consistent performance gains across diverse consultation scenarios, going beyond simple numerical improvements. These findings underscore rubric-based feedback as a scalable strategy for advancing LLMs in intricate, open-ended tasks.

  The instruction-following capabilities of large language models (LLMs) are pivotal for numerous applications, from conversational agents to complex reasoning systems. However, current evaluations predominantly focus on English models, neglecting the linguistic and cultural nuances of other languages. Specifically, Korean, with its distinct syntax, rich morphological features, honorific system, and dual numbering systems, lacks a dedicated benchmark for assessing open-ended instruction-following capabilities. To address this gap, we introduce the Korean Instruction-following Task Evaluation (KITE), a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate both general and Korean-specific instructions. Unlike existing Korean benchmarks that focus mainly on factual knowledge or multiple-choice testing, KITE directly targets diverse, open-ended instruction-following tasks. Our evaluation pipeline combines automated metrics with human assessments, revealing performance disparities across models and providing deeper insights into their strengths and weaknesses. By publicly releasing the KITE dataset and code, we aim to foster further research on culturally and linguistically inclusive LLM development and inspire similar endeavors for other underrepresented languages.

  Large language models (LLMs) excel at language understanding but often hallucinate and struggle with multi-hop reasoning. Knowledge-graph-based retrieval-augmented generation (KG-RAG) offers grounding, yet most methods rely on flat embeddings and noisy path exploration. We propose ParallaxRAG, a framework that symmetrically decouples queries and graph triples into multi-view spaces, enabling a robust retrieval architecture that explicitly enforces head diversity while constraining weakly related paths. Central to our approach is the observation that different attention heads specialize in semantic relations at distinct reasoning stages, contributing to different hops of the reasoning chain. This specialization allows ParallaxRAG to construct cleaner subgraphs and guide LLMs through grounded, step-wise reasoning. Experiments on WebQSP and CWQ, under our unified, reproducible setup (BGE-M3 + Llama3.1-8B), demonstrate competitive retrieval and QA performance, alongside reduced hallucination and good generalization. Our results highlight multi-view head specialization as a principled direction for knowledge-grounded multi-hop reasoning. Our implementation will be released as soon as the paper is accepted.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) as interactive agents show significant promise in Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) but often struggle with the semantic gap between natural language queries and structured knowledge graph (KG) representations. This leads to suboptimal planning and inefficient exploration on KG, while training-free approaches often underutilize valuable reasoning patterns in training data. To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework, Exemplar-Guided Planning (EGP), which enhances the planning capabilities of LLM agents for KGQA. EGP first preprocesses the training set questions via entity templating to normalize semantic variations. It then retrieves highly similar exemplary questions and their successful reasoning paths from this preprocessed set using semantic embeddings and an efficient FAISS index. These retrieved exemplars dynamically guide the LLM's planning process in two key phases: (1) Task Decomposition, by aligning generated sub-objectives with proven reasoning steps, and (2) Relation Exploration, by providing high-quality auxiliary information to improve relation pruning accuracy. Additionally, we introduce a Smart Lookahead mechanism during relation exploration to improve efficiency by preemptively exploring promising paths and potentially terminating exploration earlier. We apply EGP to the Plan-on-Graph (PoG) framework, termed PoG-EGP. Extensive experiments on two real-world KGQA datasets, WebQSP and CWQ, demonstrate that PoG-EGP significantly improves over the baseline PoG system and other compared methods.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce GateSkip, a simple residual-stream gating mechanism that enables token-wise layer skipping in decoder-only LMs. Each Attention/MLP branch is equipped with a sigmoid-linear gate that condenses the branch's output before it re-enters the residual stream. During inference we rank tokens by the gate values and skip low-importance ones using a per-layer budget. While early-exit or router-based Mixture-of-Depths models are known to be unstable and need extensive retraining, our smooth, differentiable gates fine-tune stably on top of pretrained models. On long-form reasoning, we save up to 15% compute while retaining over 90% of baseline accuracy. For increasingly larger models, this tradeoff improves drastically. On instruction-tuned models we see accuracy gains at full compute and match baseline quality near 50% savings. The learned gates give insight into transformer information flow (e.g., BOS tokens act as anchors), and the method combines easily with quantization, pruning, and self-speculative decoding.

  The immense computational cost of training Large Language Models (LLMs) presents a major barrier to innovation. While FP8 training offers a promising solution with significant theoretical efficiency gains, its widespread adoption has been hindered by the lack of a comprehensive, open-source training recipe. To bridge this gap, we introduce an end-to-end FP8 training recipe that seamlessly integrates continual pre-training and supervised fine-tuning. Our methodology employs a fine-grained, hybrid-granularity quantization strategy to maintain numerical fidelity while maximizing computational efficiency. Through extensive experiments, including the continue pre-training of models on a 160B-token corpus, we demonstrate that our recipe is not only remarkably stable but also essentially lossless, achieving performance on par with the BF16 baseline across a suite of reasoning benchmarks. Crucially, this is achieved with substantial efficiency improvements, including up to a 22% reduction in training time, a 14% decrease in peak memory usage, and a 19% increase in throughput. Our results establish FP8 as a practical and robust alternative to BF16, and we will release the accompanying code to further democratize large-scale model training.

  We present FLUKE (Framework for LingUistically-driven and tasK-agnostic robustness Evaluation), a framework for assessing model robustness through systematic minimal variations of test data. FLUKE introduces controlled variations across linguistic levels -- from orthography to dialect and style -- and leverages large language models (LLMs) with human validation to generate modifications. We demonstrate FLUKE's utility by evaluating both fine-tuned models and LLMs across six diverse NLP tasks (four classification and two generation tasks), and reveal that (1) the impact of linguistic variations is highly task-dependent, with some tests being critical for certain tasks but irrelevant for others; (2) LLMs still exhibit significant brittleness to certain linguistic variations, with reasoning LLMs surprisingly showing less robustness on some tasks compared to base models; (3) models are overall more brittle to natural, fluent modifications such as syntax or style changes (and especially to negation), compared to corruption-style tests such as letter flipping; (4) the ability of a model to use a linguistic feature in generation does not correlate to its robustness to this feature on downstream tasks. These findings highlight the importance of systematic robustness testing for understanding model behaviors.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive progress across a wide range of tasks, yet their heavy reliance on English-centric training data leads to significant performance degradation in non-English languages. While existing multilingual prompting methods emphasize reformulating queries into English or enhancing reasoning capabilities, they often fail to incorporate the language- and culture-specific grounding that is essential for some queries. To address this limitation, we propose EMCee (Extracting synthetic Multilingual Context and merging), a simple yet effective framework that enhances the multilingual capabilities of LLMs by explicitly extracting and utilizing query-relevant knowledge from the LLM itself. In particular, EMCee first extracts synthetic context to uncover latent, language-specific knowledge encoded within the LLM, and then dynamically merges this contextual insight with reasoning-oriented outputs through a judgment-based selection mechanism. Extensive experiments on four multilingual benchmarks covering diverse languages and tasks demonstrate that EMCee consistently outperforms prior approaches, achieving an average relative improvement of 16.4% overall and 31.7% in low-resource languages.

  Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) often causes overfitting to specific prompt wording, where minor phrasing variations drastically reduce performance. To address this, we propose Prompt-Agnostic Fine-Tuning (PAFT), a method that enhances robustness through dynamic prompt variation during training. PAFT first generates diverse synthetic prompts, then continuously samples from this set to construct training instances, forcing models to learn fundamental task principles rather than surface-level patterns. Across systematic evaluations using both supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning fine-tuning (RLFT), PAFT demonstrates substantially improved prompt robustness, achieving 7% higher generalization accuracy on unseen prompts than standard methods. In addition to enhanced robustness, PAFT consistently yields superior overall performance on established benchmarks for question answering, mathematical reasoning, and tool use. Notably, models trained with PAFT attain 3.2 faster inference speeds due to reduced prompt sensitivity. Ablation studies further validate effectiveness of PAFT, while theoretical analysis reveals that PAFT can effectively enhance the cross-domain generalization ability of LLM.

  As language models are increasingly used in scientific workflows, evaluating their ability to propose sets of explanations-not just a single correct answer-becomes critical. Many scientific problems are underdetermined: multiple, mechanistically distinct hypotheses are consistent with the same observations. We introduce HypoSpace, a diagnostic suite that treats LLMs as samplers of finite hypothesis sets and measures three complementary indicators: Validity (precision of proposals consistent with observations), Uniqueness (non-redundancy among proposals), and Recovery (coverage of the enumerated admissible set). We instantiate HypoSpace in three structured domains with deterministic validators and exactly enumerated hypothesis spaces: (i) causal graphs from perturbations, (ii) gravity-constrained 3D voxel reconstruction from top-down projections, and (iii) Boolean genetic interactions. Across instruction-tuned and reasoning-focused models, Validity often remains high while Uniqueness and Recovery degrade as the admissible space grows, revealing mode collapse that is invisible to correctness-only metrics. HypoSpace offers a controlled probe-rather than a leaderboard-for methods that explicitly explore and cover admissible explanation spaces. Code is available at:this https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong reasoning abilities with chain-of-thought prompting, but explicit reasoning introduces substantial computational overhead. Recent work on latent reasoning reduces this cost by reasoning in latent space without explicit supervision, but performance drops significantly. Our preliminary experiments suggest that this degradation stems from the unstructured latent space, which makes fitting latent tokens difficult. To address this, we restrict the latent space to the column space of the LLM vocabulary, treating latent reasoning as a superposition over vocabulary probabilities. Once latent reasoning concludes, it collapses into an eigenstate of explicit reasoning to yield the final answer. Based on this idea, we propose Latent-SFT, a two-stage learning framework. In the first stage, we design two specialized attention masks to guide the Latent Token Encoder in generating latent tokens, allowing the LLM to produce the correct answer conditioned on them. In the second stage, the Latent Token Encoder is discarded, and the LLM is directly trained to generate these latent tokens autonomously for latent reasoning, optimized with KL and CE losses. Latent-SFT sets a new state of the art on GSM8k, matching explicit SFT performance while cutting reasoning chains by up to 4 times and outperforming prior latent methods. On Math500 and AIME24, lexical probability-based latent reasoning also clearly surpasses hidden-state-based approaches. Our metrics of effective compression rate and effective global parallelism further show that latent reasoning is both the compression of a single path and the superposition of multiple paths.

  The increasing acceptance of large language models (LLMs) as an alternative to knowledge sources marks a significant paradigm shift across various domains, including time-sensitive fields such as law, healthcare, and finance. To fulfill this expanded role, LLMs must not only be factually accurate but also demonstrate consistency across temporal dimensions, necessitating robust temporal reasoning capabilities. Despite this critical requirement, efforts to ensure temporal consistency in LLMs remain scarce including noticeable absence of endeavors aimed at evaluating or augmenting LLMs across temporal references in time-sensitive inquiries. In this paper, we seek to address this gap by introducing a novel benchmark entitled temporal referential consistency, accompanied by a resource TEMP-ReCon designed to benchmark a wide range of both open-source and closed-source LLMs with various linguistic contexts characterized by differing resource richness (including English, French, and Romanian). The findings emphasis that LLMs do exhibit insufficient temporal referent consistency. To address this, we propose \newmodel, a reasoning path alignment-based model that aims to enhance the temporal referential consistency of LLMs. Our empirical experiments substantiate the efficacy of UnTRaP compared to several baseline models.

This setup is misaligned with real-world use, where seeing is not enough. This raises a fundamental question: Can MLLMs actively acquire missing evidence under incomplete information? To bridge this gap, we require the MLLMs to actively acquire missing evidence and iteratively refine decisions under incomplete information, by selecting a target image from a candidate pool without task-specific priors. To support systematic study, we propose GuessBench, a benchmark with both perception-oriented and knowledge-oriented images for evaluating active reasoning in MLLMs. We evaluate 20 superior MLLMs and find that performance on active reasoning lags far behind it on passive settings, indicating substantial room for improvement. Further analysis identifies fine-grained perception and timely decision-making as key challenges. Ablation studies show that perceptual enhancements benefit smaller models, whereas thinking-oriented methods provide consistent gains across model sizes. These results suggest promising directions for future research on multimodal active reasoning.

  While Speech Large Language Models (Speech-LLMs) show strong performance in many applications, their robustness is critically under-tested, especially to speech disfluency. Existing evaluations often rely on idealized inputs, overlooking common disfluencies, particularly those associated with conditions like Parkinson's disease. This work investigates whether current Speech-LLMs can maintain performance when interacting with users who have speech impairments. To facilitate this inquiry, we introduce VocalBench-DF, a framework for the systematic evaluation of disfluency across a multi-dimensional taxonomy. Our evaluation of 22 mainstream Speech-LLMs reveals substantial performance degradation, indicating that their real-world readiness is limited. Further analysis identifies phoneme-level processing and long-context modeling as primary bottlenecks responsible for these failures. Strengthening recognition and reasoning capability from components and pipelines can substantially improve robustness. These findings highlight the urgent need for new methods to improve disfluency handling and build truly inclusive Speech-LLMs

  Building effective knowledge graphs (KGs) for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is pivotal for advancing question answering (QA) systems. However, its effectiveness is hindered by a fundamental disconnect: the knowledge graph (KG) construction process is decoupled from its downstream application, yielding suboptimal graph structures. To bridge this gap, we introduce AutoGraph-R1, the first framework to directly optimize KG construction for task performance using Reinforcement Learning (RL). AutoGraph-R1 trains an LLM constructor by framing graph generation as a policy learning problem, where the reward is derived from the graph's functional utility in a RAG pipeline. We design two novel, task-aware reward functions, one for graphs as knowledge carriers and another as knowledge indices. Across multiple QA benchmarks, AutoGraph-R1 consistently enables graph RAG methods to achieve significant performance gains over using task-agnostic baseline graphs. Our work shows it is possible to close the loop between construction and application, shifting the paradigm from building intrinsically ``good'' graphs to building demonstrably ``useful'' ones.

  Inference-time scaling enhances the reasoning ability of a language model (LM) by extending its chain-of-thought (CoT). However, existing approaches typically generate the entire reasoning chain in a single forward pass, which often leads to CoT derailment, i.e., the reasoning trajectory drifting off course due to compounding errors. This problem is particularly severe for smaller LMs with long CoTs due to their limited capacity. To address this, we analyze raw long CoTs and uncover a reasoning hierarchy consisting of planning and execution steps. Our analysis reveals that most reasoning errors stem from incorrect planning. Motivated by this observation, we propose Multi-Path Plan Aggregation (MPPA), a framework that augments single-pass reasoning with plan exploration and aggregation. Following a variable interval schedule based on the token position, MPPA generates multiple candidate plans and aggregates them into a refined planning step. To maintain efficiency, we adopt a minimal design in which the base LM serves as the primary policy, while a lightweight LoRA module implements the plan aggregation policy. We further observe that outcome-reward RL is inefficient for long trajectories (e.g., exceeding 4K tokens). To overcome this, we introduce online Step-DPO, a process-level preference optimization scheme that leverages Twisted Sequential Monte Carlo (TSMC) to provide scalable stepwise supervision using small LMs. This yields more efficient training, improved stability, and higher accuracy. Extensive experiments on challenging math, science, and logical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that, with only 10% SFT data and 5% of preference pairs, our method outperforms both the DeepSeek-R1 distillation baseline and the outcome-reward RL baseline across multiple base models and tasks.

  Although many benchmarks evaluate the reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) within domains such as mathematics, coding, or data wrangling, few abstract away from domain specifics to examine reasoning as a capability in and of itself. We contribute a novel type of benchmark evaluating the inductive reasoning capabilities of LLMs that is inspired by the forward reconstruction task from historical linguistics but is formulated in an extremely simple, general way (in the form of Programming by Examples). The task involves generating a cascade of simple string rewrite programs to transform a given list of input strings into a list of desired output strings. We present a fully automated pipeline that programmatically generates problems of this type with controllable difficulty, enabling scalable evaluation of reasoning models while avoiding contamination. Using this approach, we construct two benchmarks: PBEBench-Lite, which efficiently stratifies models of varying capabilities, and PBEBench, which requires models to induce programs similar in complexity to those constructed by historical linguists. Our experiments reveal a substantial performance gap between models that leverage test-time compute or LCoT (long chain-of-thought) reasoning and those that do not. Moreover, although recent models show promise, the solve rate for both of them drops below 5% for hard instances of the PBEBench dataset (ground truth cascade lengths of 20 and 30, respectively), falling well short of realistic historical linguistics requirements even with computationally expensive, popular scaling techniques from the PBE and reasoning literature. Additionally, we also study the effectiveness of different scaling strategies and the impact of various hyperparameters on the difficulty of the generated data using gpt-oss-120b, the best-performing open-source model.

  Error attribution in Large Language Model (LLM) multi-agent systems presents a significant challenge in debugging and improving collaborative AI systems. Current approaches to pinpointing agent and step level failures in interaction traces - whether using all-at-once evaluation, step-by-step analysis, or binary search - fall short when analyzing complex patterns, struggling with both accuracy and consistency. We present ECHO (Error attribution through Contextual Hierarchy and Objective consensus analysis), a novel algorithm that combines hierarchical context representation, objective analysis-based evaluation, and consensus voting to improve error attribution accuracy. Our approach leverages a positional-based leveling of contextual understanding while maintaining objective evaluation criteria, ultimately reaching conclusions through a consensus mechanism. Experimental results demonstrate that ECHO outperforms existing methods across various multi-agent interaction scenarios, showing particular strength in cases involving subtle reasoning errors and complex interdependencies. Our findings suggest that leveraging these concepts of structured, hierarchical context representation combined with consensus-based objective decision-making, provides a more robust framework for error attribution in multi-agent systems.

  Real-world settings where language models (LMs) are deployed -- in domains spanning healthcare, finance, and other forms of knowledge work -- require models to grapple with incomplete information and reason under uncertainty. Yet most LM evaluations focus on problems with well-defined answers and success criteria. This gap exists in part because natural problems involving uncertainty are difficult to construct: given that LMs have access to most of the same knowledge as humans, it is non-trivial to design questions for which LMs will struggle to produce correct answers, but which humans can answer reliably. As a result, LM performance on reasoning under uncertainty remains poorly characterized. To address this gap, we introduce OpenEstimate, an extensible, multi-domain benchmark for evaluating LMs on numerical estimation tasks that require models to synthesize significant amounts of background information and express predictions as probabilistic priors. We assess these priors for accuracy and calibration, quantifying their usefulness relative to samples from the true distribution of interest. Across six frontier LMs, we find that LM-elicited priors are often inaccurate and overconfident. Performance improves modestly depending on how uncertainty is elicited from the model, but is largely unaffected by changes in sampling strategy, reasoning effort, or prompt design. The OpenEstimate benchmark thus offers a challenging evaluation for frontier LMs and a platform for developing models that are better at probabilistic estimation and reasoning under uncertainty.

  Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has demonstrated success in enhancing LLM reasoning capabilities, but remains limited to single-turn interactions without tool integration. While recent Agentic Reinforcement Learning with Tool use (ARLT) approaches have emerged to address multi-turn tool interactions, existing works develop task-specific codebases that suffer from fragmentation, synchronous execution bottlenecks, and limited extensibility across domains. These inefficiencies hinder broader community adoption and algorithmic innovation. We introduce VerlTool, a unified and modular framework that addresses these limitations through systematic design principles. VerlTool provides four key contributions: (1) upstream alignment with VeRL ensuring compatibility and simplified maintenance, (2) unified tool management via standardized APIs supporting diverse modalities including code execution, search, SQL databases, and vision processing, (3) asynchronous rollout execution achieving near 2$\times$ speedup by eliminating synchronization bottlenecks, and (4) comprehensive evaluation demonstrating competitive performance across 6 ARLT domains. Our framework formalizes ARLT as multi-turn trajectories with multi-modal observation tokens (text/image/video), extending beyond single-turn RLVR paradigms. We train and evaluate models on mathematical reasoning, knowledge QA, SQL generation, visual reasoning, web search, and software engineering tasks, achieving results comparable to specialized systems while providing unified training infrastructure. The modular plugin architecture enables rapid tool integration requiring only lightweight Python definitions, significantly reducing development overhead and providing a scalable foundation for tool-augmented RL research.

  The foundation of reproducible science lies in protocols that are precise, logically ordered, and executable. The autonomous generation of these protocols through natural language queries could greatly improve the efficiency of the reproduction process. However, current leading large language models (LLMs) often generate incomplete or inconsistent protocols, limiting their utility. To address this limitation, we first introduce SciRecipe, a large-scale dataset of over 12K structured protocols spanning 27 biological subfields and encompassing both comprehension and problem-solving tasks. To further improve protocol generation, we propose the "Sketch-and-Fill" paradigm, which separates analysis, structuring, and expression to ensure each step is explicit and verifiable. Complementing this, the structured component-based reward mechanism evaluates step granularity, action order, and semantic fidelity, aligning model optimization with experimental reliability. Building on these components, we develop Thoth, trained through a staged Knowledge-to-Action process that progresses from knowledge acquisition to operational reasoning and ultimately to robust, executable protocol generation. Across multiple benchmarks, Thoth consistently surpasses both proprietary and open-source LLMs, achieving significant improvements in step alignment, logical sequencing, and semantic accuracy. Our approach paves the way for reliable scientific assistants that bridge knowledge with experimental execution. All data, code, and models will be released publicly.

  Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as agents in dynamic, real-world environments, where success requires both reasoning and effective tool use. A central challenge for agentic tasks is the growing context length, as agents must accumulate long histories of actions and observations. This expansion raises costs and reduces efficiency in long-horizon tasks, yet prior work on context compression has mostly focused on single-step tasks or narrow applications. We introduce Agent Context Optimization (ACON), a unified framework that optimally compresses both environment observations and interaction histories into concise yet informative condensations. ACON leverages compression guideline optimization in natural language space: given paired trajectories where full context succeeds but compressed context fails, capable LLMs analyze the causes of failure, and the compression guideline is updated accordingly. Furthermore, we propose distilling the optimized LLM compressor into smaller models to reduce the overhead of the additional module. Experiments on AppWorld, OfficeBench, and Multi-objective QA show that ACON reduces memory usage by 26-54% (peak tokens) while largely preserving task performance, preserves over 95% of accuracy when distilled into smaller compressors, and enhances smaller LMs as long-horizon agents with up to 46% performance improvement.

  Tool-augmented large language models (LLMs) are emerging as deep research agents, systems that decompose complex queries, retrieve external evidence, and synthesize grounded responses. Yet current agents remain limited by shallow retrieval, weak alignment metrics, and brittle tool-use behavior. We introduce PokeeResearch-7B, a 7B-parameter deep research agent built under a unified reinforcement learning framework for robustness, alignment, and scalability. PokeeResearch-7B is trained by an annotation-free Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF) framework to optimize policies using LLM-based reward signals that capture factual accuracy, citation faithfulness, and instruction adherence. A chain-of-thought-driven multi-call reasoning scaffold further enhances robustness through self-verification and adaptive recovery from tool failures. Among 10 popular deep research benchmarks, PokeeResearch-7B achieves state-of-the-art performance among 7B-scale deep research agents. This highlights that careful reinforcement learning and reasoning design can produce efficient, resilient, and research-grade AI agents.

  Developing Large Language Models (LLMs) to cooperate and compete effectively within multi-agent systems is a critical step towards more advanced intelligence. While reinforcement learning (RL) has proven effective for enhancing reasoning in single-agent tasks, its extension to multi-turn, multi-agent scenarios remains underexplored due to the challenges of long-horizon credit assignment and agent-specific advantage estimation. To address these challenges, we introduce MARS, an end-to-end RL framework that incentivizes Multi-Agent Reasoning of LLMs through Self-play in both cooperative and competitive games. MARS features a turn-level advantage estimator that aligns learning signals with each interaction for credit assignment, and an agent-specific advantage normalization to stabilize multi-agent training. By learning with self-play across cooperative and competitive games, the MARS agent trained from Qwen3-4B develops strong strategic abilities that generalize to held-out games with up to 28.7% performance improvements. More importantly, the capability acquired through self-play generalizes beyond games, yielding consistent performance gains of multi-agent systems in reasoning benchmarks. When integrated into leading multi-agent systems, our MARS agent achieves significant performance gains of 10.0% on AIME and 12.5% on GPQA-Diamond. These results establish end-to-end RL training with self-play in strategic games as a powerful approach for developing generalizable multi-agent reasoning capabilities in LLMs. Our code and models are publicly available atthis https URL.

  Most existing software lacks accessible Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), requiring agents to operate solely through pixel-based Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs). In this API-free setting, large language model (LLM)-based agents face severe efficiency bottlenecks: limited to local visual experiences, they make myopic decisions and rely on inefficient trial-and-error, hindering both skill acquisition and long-term planning. To address these challenges, we propose KG-Agent, an experience-driven learning framework that structures an agent's raw pixel-level interactions into a persistent State-Action Knowledge Graph (SA-KG). KG-Agent overcomes inefficient exploration by linking functionally similar but visually distinct GUI states, forming a rich neighborhood of experience that enables the agent to generalize from a diverse set of historical strategies. To support long-horizon reasoning, we design a hybrid intrinsic reward mechanism based on the graph topology, combining a state value reward for exploiting known high-value pathways with a novelty reward that encourages targeted exploration. This approach decouples strategic planning from pure discovery, allowing the agent to effectively value setup actions with delayed gratification. We evaluate KG-Agent in two complex, open-ended GUI-based decision-making environments (Civilization V and Slay the Spire), demonstrating significant improvements in exploration efficiency and strategic depth over the state-of-the-art methods.

  Clinical conversations mix explicit directives (order a chest X-ray) with implicit reasoning (the cough worsened overnight, we should check for pneumonia). Many systems rely on LLM rewriting, adding latency, instability, and opacity that hinder real-time ordering. We present JEDA (Joint Embedding for Direct and Ambient clinical orders), a domain-initialized bi-encoder that retrieves canonical orders directly and, in a query-free mode, encodes a short rolling window of ambient dialogue to trigger retrieval. Initialized from PubMedBERT and fine-tuned with a duplicate-safe contrastive objective, JEDA aligns heterogeneous expressions of intent to shared order concepts. Training uses constrained LLM guidance to tie each signed order to complementary formulations (command only, context only, command+context, context+reasoning), producing clearer inter-order separation, tighter query extendash order coupling, and stronger generalization. The query-free mode is noise-resilient, reducing sensitivity to disfluencies and ASR errors by conditioning on a short window rather than a single utterance. Deployed in practice, JEDA yields large gains and substantially outperforms its base encoder and recent open embedders (Linq Embed Mistral, SFR Embedding, GTE Qwen, BGE large, Embedding Gemma). The result is a fast, interpretable, LLM-free retrieval layer that links ambient context to actionable clinical orders in real time.
