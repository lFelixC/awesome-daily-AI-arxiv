- **[AnoF-Diff: One-Step Diffusion-Based Anomaly Detection for Forceful Tool Use](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15153)**  `arXiv:2509.15153`  `cs.RO` `cs.LG`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multivariate time-series anomaly detection, which is critical for identifying unexpected events, has been explored in the field of machine learning for several decades. However, directly applying these methods to data from forceful tool use tasks is challenging because streaming sensor data in the real world tends to be inherently noisy, exhibits non-stationary behavior, and varies across different tasks and tools. To address these challenges, we propose a method, AnoF-Diff, based on the diffusion model to extract force-torque features from time-series data and use force-torque features to detect anomalies. We compare our method with other state-of-the-art methods in terms of F1-score and Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUROC) on four forceful tool-use tasks, demonstrating that our method has better performance and is more robust to a noisy dataset. We also propose the method of parallel anomaly score evaluation based on one-step diffusion and demonstrate how our method can be used for online anomaly detection in several forceful tool use experiments.

- **[Robot Control Stack: A Lean Ecosystem for Robot Learning at Scale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14932)**  `arXiv:2509.14932`  `cs.RO` `cs.LG`

  Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) mark a major shift in robot learning. They replace specialized architectures and task-tailored components of expert policies with large-scale data collection and setup-specific fine-tuning. In this machine learning-focused workflow that is centered around models and scalable training, traditional robotics software frameworks become a bottleneck, while robot simulations offer only limited support for transitioning from and to real-world experiments. In this work, we close this gap by introducing Robot Control Stack (RCS), a lean ecosystem designed from the ground up to support research in robot learning with large-scale generalist policies. At its core, RCS features a modular and easily extensible layered architecture with a unified interface for simulated and physical robots, facilitating sim-to-real transfer. Despite its minimal footprint and dependencies, it offers a complete feature set, enabling both real-world experiments and large-scale training in simulation. Our contribution is twofold: First, we introduce the architecture of RCS and explain its design principles. Second, we evaluate its usability and performance along the development cycle of VLA and RL policies. Our experiments also provide an extensive evaluation of Octo, OpenVLA, and Pi Zero on multiple robots and shed light on how simulation data can improve real-world policy performance.

- **[Scalable Multi-Objective Robot Reinforcement Learning through Gradient Conflict Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14816)**  `arXiv:2509.14816`  `cs.RO` `cs.LG`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reinforcement Learning (RL) robot controllers usually aggregate many task objectives into one scalar reward. While large-scale proximal policy optimisation (PPO) has enabled impressive results such as robust robot locomotion in the real world, many tasks still require careful reward tuning and are brittle to local optima. Tuning cost and sub-optimality grow with the number of objectives, limiting scalability. Modelling reward vectors and their trade-offs can address these issues; however, multi-objective methods remain underused in RL for robotics because of computational cost and optimisation difficulty. In this work, we investigate the conflict between gradient contributions for each objective that emerge from scalarising the task objectives. In particular, we explicitly address the conflict between task-based rewards and terms that regularise the policy towards realistic behaviour. We propose GCR-PPO, a modification to actor-critic optimisation that decomposes the actor update into objective-wise gradients using a multi-headed critic and resolves conflicts based on the objective priority. Our methodology, GCR-PPO, is evaluated on the well-known IsaacLab manipulation and locomotion benchmarks and additional multi-objective modifications on two related tasks. We show superior scalability compared to parallel PPO (p = 0.04), without significant computational overhead. We also show higher performance with more conflicting tasks. GCR-PPO improves on large-scale PPO with an average improvement of 9.5%, with high-conflict tasks observing a greater improvement. The code is available atthis https URL.

- **[ActivePusher: Active Learning and Planning with Residual Physics for Nonprehensile Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04646)**  `arXiv:2506.04646`  `cs.RO` `cs.LG`  
  _Zhuoyun Zhong, Seyedali Golestaneh, Constantinos Chamzas_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Planning with learned dynamics models offers a promising approach toward versatile real-world manipulation, particularly in nonprehensile settings such as pushing or rolling, where accurate analytical models are difficult to obtain. However, collecting training data for learning-based methods can be costly and inefficient, as it often relies on randomly sampled interactions that are not necessarily the most informative. Furthermore, learned models tend to exhibit high uncertainty in underexplored regions of the skill space, undermining the reliability of long-horizon planning. To address these challenges, we propose ActivePusher, a novel framework that combines residual-physics modeling with uncertainty-based active learning, to focus data acquisition on the most informative skill parameters. Additionally, ActivePusher seamlessly integrates with model-based kinodynamic planners, leveraging uncertainty estimates to bias control sampling toward more reliable actions. We evaluate our approach in both simulation and real-world environments, and demonstrate that it consistently improves data efficiency and achieves higher planning success rates in comparison to baseline methods.

- **[RLBind: Adversarial-Invariant Cross-Modal Alignment for Unified Robust Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14383)**  `arXiv:2509.14383`  `cs.RO` `cs.CV`  
  _Yuhong Lu_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Unified multi-modal encoders that bind vision, audio, and other sensors into a shared embedding space are attractive building blocks for robot perception and decision-making. However, on-robot deployment exposes the vision branch to adversarial and natural corruptions, making robustness a prerequisite for safety. Prior defenses typically align clean and adversarial features within CLIP-style encoders and overlook broader cross-modal correspondence, yielding modest gains and often degrading zero-shot transfer. We introduce RLBind, a two-stage adversarial-invariant cross-modal alignment framework for robust unified embeddings. Stage 1 performs unsupervised fine-tuning on clean-adversarial pairs to harden the visual encoder. Stage 2 leverages cross-modal correspondence by minimizing the discrepancy between clean/adversarial features and a text anchor, while enforcing class-wise distributional alignment across modalities. Extensive experiments on Image, Audio, Thermal, and Video data show that RLBind consistently outperforms the LanguageBind backbone and standard fine-tuning baselines in both clean accuracy and norm-bounded adversarial robustness. By improving resilience without sacrificing generalization, RLBind provides a practical path toward safer multi-sensor perception stacks for embodied robots in navigation, manipulation, and other autonomy settings.

- **[GAF: Gaussian Action Field as a Dynamic World Model for Robotic Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14135)**  `arXiv:2506.14135`  `cs.RO` `cs.CV`  
  _Ying Chai, Litao Deng, Ruizhi Shao, Jiajun Zhang, Liangjun Xing, Hongwen Zhang, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Accurate scene perception is critical for vision-based robotic manipulation. Existing approaches typically follow either a Vision-to-Action (V-A) paradigm, predicting actions directly from visual inputs, or a Vision-to-3D-to-Action (V-3D-A) paradigm, leveraging intermediate 3D representations. However, these methods often struggle with action inaccuracies due to the complexity and dynamic nature of manipulation scenes. In this paper, we adopt a V-4D-A framework that enables direct action reasoning from motion-aware 4D representations via a Gaussian Action Field (GAF). GAF extends 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) by incorporating learnable motion attributes, allowing 4D modeling of dynamic scenes and manipulation actions. To learn time-varying scene geometry and action-aware robot motion, GAF provides three interrelated outputs: reconstruction of the current scene, prediction of future frames, and estimation of init action via Gaussian motion. Furthermore, we employ an action-vision-aligned denoising framework, conditioned on a unified representation that combines the init action and the Gaussian perception, both generated by the GAF, to further obtain more precise actions. Extensive experiments demonstrate significant improvements, with GAF achieving +11.5385 dB PSNR, +0.3864 SSIM and -0.5574 LPIPS improvements in reconstruction quality, while boosting the average +7.3% success rate in robotic manipulation tasks over state-of-the-art methods.

- **[ForceVLA: Enhancing VLA Models with a Force-aware MoE for Contact-rich Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22159)**  `arXiv:2505.22159`  `cs.RO` `cs.CV`  
  _Jiawen Yu, Hairuo Liu, Qiaojun Yu, Jieji Ren, Ce Hao, Haitong Ding, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have advanced general-purpose robotic manipulation by leveraging pretrained visual and linguistic representations. However, they struggle with contact-rich tasks that require fine-grained control involving force, especially under visual occlusion or dynamic uncertainty. To address these limitations, we propose ForceVLA, a novel end-to-end manipulation framework that treats external force sensing as a first-class modality within VLA systems. ForceVLA introduces FVLMoE, a force-aware Mixture-of-Experts fusion module that dynamically integrates pretrained visual-language embeddings with real-time 6-axis force feedback during action decoding. This enables context-aware routing across modality-specific experts, enhancing the robot's ability to adapt to subtle contact dynamics. We also introduce \textbf{ForceVLA-Data}, a new dataset comprising synchronized vision, proprioception, and force-torque signals across five contact-rich manipulation tasks. ForceVLA improves average task success by 23.2% over strong pi_0-based baselines, achieving up to 80% success in tasks such as plug insertion. Our approach highlights the importance of multimodal integration for dexterous manipulation and sets a new benchmark for physically intelligent robotic control. Code and data will be released atthis https URL.

- **[DreamControl: Human-Inspired Whole-Body Humanoid Control for Scene Interaction via Guided Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14353)**  `arXiv:2509.14353`  `cs.RO` `cs.AI` `cs.LG`  
  _Dvij Kalaria, Sudarshan S Harithas, Pushkal Katara, Sangkyung Kwak, Sarthak Bhagat, Shankar Sastry, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce DreamControl, a novel methodology for learning autonomous whole-body humanoid skills. DreamControl leverages the strengths of diffusion models and Reinforcement Learning (RL): our core innovation is the use of a diffusion prior trained on human motion data, which subsequently guides an RL policy in simulation to complete specific tasks of interest (e.g., opening a drawer or picking up an object). We demonstrate that this human motion-informed prior allows RL to discover solutions unattainable by direct RL, and that diffusion models inherently promote natural looking motions, aiding in sim-to-real transfer. We validate DreamControl's effectiveness on a Unitree G1 robot across a diverse set of challenging tasks involving simultaneous lower and upper body control and object interaction.

- **[M4Diffuser: Multi-View Diffusion Policy with Manipulability-Aware Control for Robust Mobile Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14980)**  `arXiv:2509.14980`  `cs.RO` `cs.AI` `cs.CV`  
  _Ju Dong, Lei Zhang, Liding Zhang, Yao Ling, Yu Fu, Kaixin Bai, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Mobile manipulation requires the coordinated control of a mobile base and a robotic arm while simultaneously perceiving both global scene context and fine-grained object details. Existing single-view approaches often fail in unstructured environments due to limited fields of view, exploration, and generalization abilities. Moreover, classical controllers, although stable, struggle with efficiency and manipulability near singularities. To address these challenges, we propose M4Diffuser, a hybrid framework that integrates a Multi-View Diffusion Policy with a novel Reduced and Manipulability-aware QP (ReM-QP) controller for mobile manipulation. The diffusion policy leverages proprioceptive states and complementary camera perspectives with both close-range object details and global scene context to generate task-relevant end-effector goals in the world frame. These high-level goals are then executed by the ReM-QP controller, which eliminates slack variables for computational efficiency and incorporates manipulability-aware preferences for robustness near singularities. Comprehensive experiments in simulation and real-world environments show that M4Diffuser achieves 7 to 56 percent higher success rates and reduces collisions by 3 to 31 percent over baselines. Our approach demonstrates robust performance for smooth whole-body coordination, and strong generalization to unseen tasks, paving the way for reliable mobile manipulation in unstructured environments. Details of the demo and supplemental material are available on our project websitethis https URL.

- **[FlowDrive: Energy Flow Field for End-to-End Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14303)**  `arXiv:2509.14303`  `cs.RO` `cs.AI`  
  _Hao Jiang, Zhipeng Zhang, Yu Gao, Zhigang Sun, Yiru Wang, Yuwen Heng, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in end-to-end autonomous driving leverage multi-view images to construct BEV representations for motion planning. In motion planning, autonomous vehicles need considering both hard constraints imposed by geometrically occupied obstacles (e.g., vehicles, pedestrians) and soft, rule-based semantics with no explicit geometry (e.g., lane boundaries, traffic priors). However, existing end-to-end frameworks typically rely on BEV features learned in an implicit manner, lacking explicit modeling of risk and guidance priors for safe and interpretable planning. To address this, we propose FlowDrive, a novel framework that introduces physically interpretable energy-based flow fields-including risk potential and lane attraction fields-to encode semantic priors and safety cues into the BEV space. These flow-aware features enable adaptive refinement of anchor trajectories and serve as interpretable guidance for trajectory generation. Moreover, FlowDrive decouples motion intent prediction from trajectory denoising via a conditional diffusion planner with feature-level gating, alleviating task interference and enhancing multimodal diversity. Experiments on the NAVSIM v2 benchmark demonstrate that FlowDrive achieves state-of-the-art performance with an EPDMS of 86.3, surpassing prior baselines in both safety and planning quality.

- **[Semantic Exploration and Dense Mapping of Complex Environments using Ground Robot with Panoramic LiDAR-Camera Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22880)**  `arXiv:2505.22880`  `cs.RO` `cs.AI`  
  _Xiaoyang Zhan, Shixin Zhou, Qianqian Yang, Yixuan Zhao, Hao Liu, Srinivas Chowdary Ramineni, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper presents a system for autonomous semantic exploration and dense semantic target mapping of a complex unknown environment using a ground robot equipped with a LiDAR-panoramic camera suite. Existing approaches often struggle to balance collecting high-quality observations from multiple view angles and avoiding unnecessary repetitive traversal. To fill this gap, we propose a complete system combining mapping and planning. We first redefine the task as completing both geometric coverage and semantic viewpoint observation. We then manage semantic and geometric viewpoints separately and propose a novel Priority-driven Decoupled Local Sampler to generate local viewpoint sets. This enables explicit multi-view semantic inspection and voxel coverage without unnecessary repetition. Building on this, we develop a hierarchical planner to ensure efficient global coverage. In addition, we propose a Safe Aggressive Exploration State Machine, which allows aggressive exploration behavior while ensuring the robot's safety. Our system includes a plug-and-play semantic target mapping module that integrates seamlessly with state-of-the-art SLAM algorithms for pointcloud-level dense semantic target mapping. We validate our approach through extensive experiments in both realistic simulations and complex real-world environments. Simulation results show that our planner achieves faster exploration and shorter travel distances while guaranteeing a specified number of multi-view inspections. Real-world experiments further confirm the system's effectiveness in achieving accurate dense semantic object mapping of unstructured environments.

- **[Ask-to-Clarify: Resolving Instruction Ambiguity through Multi-turn Dialogue](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15061)**  `arXiv:2509.15061`  `cs.RO`  
  _Xingyao Lin, Xinghao Zhu, Tianyi Lu, Sicheng Xie, Hui Zhang, Xipeng Qiu, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The ultimate goal of embodied agents is to create collaborators that can interact with humans, not mere executors that passively follow instructions. This requires agents to communicate, coordinate, and adapt their actions based on human feedback. Recently, advances in VLAs have offered a path toward this goal. However, most current VLA-based embodied agents operate in a one-way mode: they receive an instruction and execute it without feedback. This approach fails in real-world scenarios where instructions are often ambiguous. In this paper, we address this problem with the Ask-to-Clarify framework. Our framework first resolves ambiguous instructions by asking questions in a multi-turn dialogue. Then it generates low-level actions end-to-end. Specifically, the Ask-to-Clarify framework consists of two components, one VLM for collaboration and one diffusion for action. We also introduce a connection module that generates conditions for the diffusion based on the output of the VLM. This module adjusts the observation by instructions to create reliable conditions. We train our framework with a two-stage knowledge-insulation strategy. First, we fine-tune the collaboration component using ambiguity-solving dialogue data to handle ambiguity. Then, we integrate the action component while freezing the collaboration one. This preserves the interaction abilities while fine-tuning the diffusion to generate actions. The training strategy guarantees our framework can first ask questions, then generate actions. During inference, a signal detector functions as a router that helps our framework switch between asking questions and taking actions. We evaluate the Ask-to-Clarify framework in 8 real-world tasks, where it outperforms existing state-of-the-art VLAs. The results suggest that our proposed framework, along with the training strategy, provides a path toward collaborative embodied agents.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reliable, drift-free global localization presents significant challenges yet remains crucial for autonomous navigation in large-scale dynamic environments. In this paper, we introduce a tightly-coupled Semantic-LiDAR-Inertial-Wheel Odometry fusion framework, which is specifically designed to provide high-precision state estimation and robust localization in large-scale dynamic environments. Our framework leverages an efficient semantic-voxel map representation and employs an improved scan matching algorithm, which utilizes global semantic information to significantly reduce long-term trajectory drift. Furthermore, it seamlessly fuses data from LiDAR, IMU, and wheel odometry using a tightly-coupled multi-sensor fusion Iterative Error-State Kalman Filter (iESKF). This ensures reliable localization without experiencing abnormal drift. Moreover, to tackle the challenges posed by terrain variations and dynamic movements, we introduce a 3D adaptive scaling strategy that allows for flexible adjustments to wheel odometry measurement weights, thereby enhancing localization precision. This study presents extensive real-world experiments conducted in a one-million-square-meter automated port, encompassing 3,575 hours of operational data from 35 Intelligent Guided Vehicles (IGVs). The results consistently demonstrate that our system outperforms state-of-the-art LiDAR-based localization methods in large-scale dynamic environments, highlighting the framework's reliability and practical value.

- **[ExT: Towards Scalable Autonomous Excavation via Large-Scale Multi-Task Pretraining and Fine-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14992)**  `arXiv:2509.14992`  `cs.RO`  
  _Yifan Zhai, Lorenzo Terenzi, Patrick Frey, Diego Garcia Soto, Pascal Egli, Marco Hutter_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Scaling up the deployment of autonomous excavators is of great economic and societal importance. Yet it remains a challenging problem, as effective systems must robustly handle unseen worksite conditions and new hardware configurations. Current state-of-the-art approaches rely on highly engineered, task-specific controllers, which require extensive manual tuning for each new scenario. In contrast, recent advances in large-scale pretrained models have shown remarkable adaptability across tasks and embodiments in domains such as manipulation and navigation, but their applicability to heavy construction machinery remains largely unexplored. In this work, we introduce ExT, a unified open-source framework for large-scale demonstration collection, pretraining, and fine-tuning of multitask excavation policies. ExT policies are first trained on large-scale demonstrations collected from a mix of experts, then fine-tuned either with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or reinforcement learning fine-tuning (RLFT) to specialize to new tasks or operating conditions. Through both simulation and real-world experiments, we show that pretrained ExT policies can execute complete excavation cycles with centimeter-level accuracy, successfully transferring from simulation to real machine with performance comparable to specialized single-task controllers. Furthermore, in simulation, we demonstrate that ExT's fine-tuning pipelines allow rapid adaptation to new tasks, out-of-distribution conditions, and machine configurations, while maintaining strong performance on previously learned tasks. These results highlight the potential of ExT to serve as a foundation for scalable and generalizable autonomous excavation.

- **[Exploratory Movement Strategies for Texture Discrimination with a Neuromorphic Tactile Sensor](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14954)**  `arXiv:2509.14954`  `cs.RO`  
  _Xingchen Xu, Ao Li, Benjamin Ward-Cherrier_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We propose a neuromorphic tactile sensing framework for robotic texture classification that is inspired by human exploratory strategies. Our system utilizes the NeuroTac sensor to capture neuromorphic tactile data during a series of exploratory motions. We first tested six distinct motions for texture classification under fixed environment: sliding, rotating, tapping, as well as the combined motions: sliding+rotating, tapping+rotating, and tapping+sliding. We chose sliding and sliding+rotating as the best motions based on final accuracy and the sample timing length needed to reach converged accuracy. In the second experiment designed to simulate complex real-world conditions, these two motions were further evaluated under varying contact depth and speeds. Under these conditions, our framework attained the highest accuracy of 87.33\% with sliding+rotating while maintaining an extremely low power consumption of only 8.04 mW. These results suggest that the sliding+rotating motion is the optimal exploratory strategy for neuromorphic tactile sensing deployment in texture classification tasks and holds significant promise for enhancing robotic environmental interaction.

- **[Multi-CAP: A Multi-Robot Connectivity-Aware Hierarchical Coverage Path Planning Algorithm for Unknown Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14941)**  `arXiv:2509.14941`  `cs.RO`  
  _Zongyuan Shen, Burhanuddin Shirose, Prasanna Sriganesh, Bhaskar Vundurthy, Howie Choset, Matthew Travers_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Efficient coordination of multiple robots for coverage of large, unknown environments is a significant challenge that involves minimizing the total coverage path length while reducing inter-robot conflicts. In this paper, we introduce a Multi-robot Connectivity-Aware Planner (Multi-CAP), a hierarchical coverage path planning algorithm that facilitates multi-robot coordination through a novel connectivity-aware approach. The algorithm constructs and dynamically maintains an adjacency graph that represents the environment as a set of connected subareas. Critically, we make the assumption that the environment, while unknown, is bounded. This allows for incremental refinement of the adjacency graph online to ensure its structure represents the physical layout of the space, both in observed and unobserved areas of the map as robots explore the environment. We frame the task of assigning subareas to robots as a Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP), a well-studied problem for finding optimal routes for a fleet of vehicles. This is used to compute disjoint tours that minimize redundant travel, assigning each robot a unique, non-conflicting set of subareas. Each robot then executes its assigned tour, independently adapting its coverage strategy within each subarea to minimize path length based on real-time sensor observations of the subarea. We demonstrate through simulations and multi-robot hardware experiments that Multi-CAP significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in key metrics, including coverage time, total path length, and path overlap ratio. Ablation studies further validate the critical role of our connectivity-aware graph and the global tour planner in achieving these performance gains.

- **[A Novel Task-Driven Diffusion-Based Policy with Affordance Learning for Generalizable Manipulation of Articulated Objects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14939)**  `arXiv:2509.14939`  `cs.RO`  
  _Hao Zhang, Zhen Kan, Weiwei Shang, Yongduan Song_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Despite recent advances in dexterous manipulations, the manipulation of articulated objects and generalization across different categories remain significant challenges. To address these issues, we introduce DART, a novel framework that enhances a diffusion-based policy with affordance learning and linear temporal logic (LTL) representations to improve the learning efficiency and generalizability of articulated dexterous manipulation. Specifically, DART leverages LTL to understand task semantics and affordance learning to identify optimal interaction points. The {diffusion-based policy} then generalizes these interactions across various categories. Additionally, we exploit an optimization method based on interaction data to refine actions, overcoming the limitations of traditional diffusion policies that typically rely on offline reinforcement learning or learning from demonstrations. Experimental results demonstrate that DART outperforms most existing methods in manipulation ability, generalization performance, transfer reasoning, and robustness.

- **[CollabVLA: Self-Reflective Vision-Language-Action Model Dreaming Together with Human](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14889)**  `arXiv:2509.14889`  `cs.RO`  
  _Nan Sun, Yongchang Li, Chenxu Wang, Huiying Li, Huaping Liu_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this work, we present CollabVLA, a self-reflective vision-language-action framework that transforms a standard visuomotor policy into a collaborative assistant. CollabVLA tackles key limitations of prior VLAs, including domain overfitting, non-interpretable reasoning, and the high latency of auxiliary generative models, by integrating VLM-based reflective reasoning with diffusion-based action generation under a mixture-of-experts design. Through a two-stage training recipe of action grounding and reflection tuning, it supports explicit self-reflection and proactively solicits human guidance when confronted with uncertainty or repeated failure. It cuts normalized Time by ~2x and Dream counts by ~4x vs. generative agents, achieving higher success rates, improved interpretability, and balanced low latency compared with existing methods. This work takes a pioneering step toward shifting VLAs from opaque controllers to genuinely assistive agents capable of reasoning, acting, and collaborating with humans.

- **[COMPASS: Confined-space Manipulation Planning with Active Sensing Strategy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14787)**  `arXiv:2509.14787`  `cs.RO`  
  _Qixuan Li, Chen Le, Dongyue Huang, Jincheng Yu, Xinlei Chen_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Manipulation in confined and cluttered environments remains a significant challenge due to partial observability and complex configuration spaces. Effective manipulation in such environments requires an intelligent exploration strategy to safely understand the scene and search the target. In this paper, we propose COMPASS, a multi-stage exploration and manipulation framework featuring a manipulation-aware sampling-based planner. First, we reduce collision risks with a near-field awareness scan to build a local collision map. Additionally, we employ a multi-objective utility function to find viewpoints that are both informative and conducive to subsequent manipulation. Moreover, we perform a constrained manipulation optimization strategy to generate manipulation poses that respect obstacle constraints. To systematically evaluate method's performance under these difficulties, we propose a benchmark of confined-space exploration and manipulation containing four level challenging scenarios. Compared to exploration methods designed for other robots and only considering information gain, our framework increases manipulation success rate by 24.25% in simulations. Real-world experiments demonstrate our method's capability for active sensing and manipulation in confined environments.

- **[Rethinking Reference Trajectories in Agile Drone Racing: A Unified Reference-Free Model-Based Controller via MPPI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14726)**  `arXiv:2509.14726`  `cs.RO`  
  _Fangguo Zhao, Xin Guan, Shuo Li_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  While model-based controllers have demonstrated remarkable performance in autonomous drone racing, their performance is often constrained by the reliance on pre-computed reference trajectories. Conventional approaches, such as trajectory tracking, demand a dynamically feasible, full-state reference, whereas contouring control relaxes this requirement to a geometric path but still necessitates a reference. Recent advancements in reinforcement learning (RL) have revealed that many model-based controllers optimize surrogate objectives, such as trajectory tracking, rather than the primary racing goal of directly maximizing progress through gates. Inspired by these findings, this work introduces a reference-free method for time-optimal racing by incorporating this gate progress objective, derived from RL reward shaping, directly into the Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) formulation. The sampling-based nature of MPPI makes it uniquely capable of optimizing the discontinuous and non-differentiable objective in real-time. We also establish a unified framework that leverages MPPI to systematically and fairly compare three distinct objective functions with a consistent dynamics model and parameter set: classical trajectory tracking, contouring control, and the proposed gate progress objective. We compare the performance of these three objectives when solved via both MPPI and a traditional gradient-based solver. Our results demonstrate that the proposed reference-free approach achieves competitive racing performance, rivaling or exceeding reference-based methods. Videos are available atthis https URL

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Tactile-aware robot learning faces critical challenges in data collection and representation due to data scarcity and sparsity, and the absence of force feedback in existing systems. To address these limitations, we introduce a tactile robot learning system with both hardware and algorithm innovations. We present exUMI, an extensible data collection device that enhances the vanilla UMI with robust proprioception (via AR MoCap and rotary encoder), modular visuo-tactile sensing, and automated calibration, achieving 100% data usability. Building on an efficient collection of over 1 M tactile frames, we propose Tactile Prediction Pretraining (TPP), a representation learning framework through action-aware temporal tactile prediction, capturing contact dynamics and mitigating tactile sparsity. Real-world experiments show that TPP outperforms traditional tactile imitation learning. Our work bridges the gap between human tactile intuition and robot learning through co-designed hardware and algorithms, offering open-source resources to advance contact-rich manipulation research.

  The emerging field of Vision-Language-Action (VLA) for humanoid robots faces several fundamental challenges, including the high cost of data acquisition, the lack of a standardized benchmark, and the significant gap between simulation and the real world. To overcome these obstacles, we propose RealMirror, a comprehensive, open-source embodied AI VLA platform. RealMirror builds an efficient, low-cost data collection, model training, and inference system that enables end-to-end VLA research without requiring a real robot. To facilitate model evolution and fair comparison, we also introduce a dedicated VLA benchmark for humanoid robots, featuring multiple scenarios, extensive trajectories, and various VLA models. Furthermore, by integrating generative models and 3D Gaussian Splatting to reconstruct realistic environments and robot models, we successfully demonstrate zero-shot Sim2Real transfer, where models trained exclusively on simulation data can perform tasks on a real robot seamlessly, without any fine-tuning. In conclusion, with the unification of these critical components, RealMirror provides a robust framework that significantly accelerates the development of VLA models for humanoid robots.

  Vision-language-action policies learn manipulation skills across tasks, environments and embodiments through large-scale pre-training. However, their ability to generalize to novel robot configurations remains limited. Most approaches emphasize model size, dataset scale and diversity while paying less attention to the design of action spaces. This leads to the configuration generalization problem, which requires costly adaptation. We address this challenge by formulating cross-embodiment pre-training as designing policies equivariant to embodiment configuration transformations. Building on this principle, we propose a framework that (i) establishes a embodiment equivariance theory for action space and policy design, (ii) introduces an action decoder that enforces configuration equivariance, and (iii) incorporates a geometry-aware network architecture to enhance embodiment-agnostic spatial reasoning. Extensive experiments in both simulation and real-world settings demonstrate that our approach improves pre-training effectiveness and enables efficient fine-tuning on novel robot embodiments.

  _Haoran Xiao, Xue Wang, Huimin Lu, Zhiwen Zeng, Zirui Guo, Ziqi Ni, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper addresses the challenges of automating vibratory sieve shaker operations in a materials laboratory, focusing on three critical tasks: 1) dual-arm lid manipulation in 3 cm clearance spaces, 2) bimanual handover in overlapping workspaces, and 3) obstructed powder sample container delivery with orientation constraints. These tasks present significant challenges, including inefficient sampling in narrow passages, the need for smooth trajectories to prevent spillage, and suboptimal paths generated by conventional methods. To overcome these challenges, we propose a hierarchical planning framework combining Prior-Guided Path Planning and Multi-Step Trajectory Optimization. The former uses a finite Gaussian mixture model to improve sampling efficiency in narrow passages, while the latter refines paths by shortening, simplifying, imposing joint constraints, and B-spline smoothing. Experimental results demonstrate the framework's effectiveness: planning time is reduced by up to 80.4%, and waypoints are decreased by 89.4%. Furthermore, the system completes the full vibratory sieve shaker operation workflow in a physical experiment, validating its practical applicability for complex laboratory automation.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Event-based localization research and datasets are a rapidly growing area of interest, with a tenfold increase in the cumulative total number of published papers on this topic over the past 10 years. Whilst the rapid expansion in the field is exciting, it brings with it an associated challenge: a growth in the variety of required code and package dependencies as well as data formats, making comparisons difficult and cumbersome for researchers to implement reliably. To address this challenge, we present Event-LAB: a new and unified framework for running several event-based localization methodologies across multiple datasets. Event-LAB is implemented using the Pixi package and dependency manager, that enables a single command-line installation and invocation for combinations of localization methods and datasets. To demonstrate the capabilities of the framework, we implement two common event-based localization pipelines: Visual Place Recognition (VPR) and Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM). We demonstrate the ability of the framework to systematically visualize and analyze the results of multiple methods and datasets, revealing key insights such as the association of parameters that control event collection counts and window sizes for frame generation to large variations in performance. The results and analysis demonstrate the importance of fairly comparing methodologies with consistent event image generation parameters. Our Event-LAB framework provides this ability for the research community, by contributing a streamlined workflow for easily setting up multiple conditions.

  _Abhiroop Ajith, Constantinos Chamzas_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Learning abstractions directly from data is a core challenge in robotics. Humans naturally operate at an abstract level, reasoning over high-level subgoals while delegating execution to low-level motor skills -- an ability that enables efficient problem solving in complex environments. In robotics, abstractions and hierarchical reasoning have long been central to planning, yet they are typically hand-engineered, demanding significant human effort and limiting scalability. Automating the discovery of useful abstractions directly from visual data would make planning frameworks more scalable and more applicable to real-world robotic domains. In this work, we focus on rearrangement tasks where the state is represented with raw images, and propose a method to induce discrete, graph-structured abstractions by combining structural constraints with an attention-guided visual distance. Our approach leverages the inherent bipartite structure of rearrangement problems, integrating structural constraints and visual embeddings into a unified framework. This enables the autonomous discovery of abstractions from vision alone, which can subsequently support high-level planning. We evaluate our method on two rearrangement tasks in simulation and show that it consistently identifies meaningful abstractions that facilitate effective planning and outperform existing approaches.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for coordinating swarms of agents in complex decision-making, yet major challenges remain. In competitive settings such as pursuer-evader tasks, simultaneous adaptation can destabilize training; non-kinetic countermeasures often fail under adverse conditions; and policies trained in one configuration rarely generalize to environments with a different number of agents. To address these issues, we propose the Local-Canonicalization Equivariant Graph Neural Networks (LEGO) framework, which integrates seamlessly with popular MARL algorithms such as MAPPO. LEGO employs graph neural networks to capture permutation equivariance and generalization to different agent numbers, canonicalization to enforce E(n)-equivariance, and heterogeneous representations to encode role-specific inductive biases. Experiments on cooperative and competitive swarm benchmarks show that LEGO outperforms strong baselines and improves generalization. In real-world experiments, LEGO demonstrates robustness to varying team sizes and agent failure.

  _Dario Tscholl, Yashwanth Nakka, Brian Gunter_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present a perception-driven safety filter that converts each 3D Gaussian Splat (3DGS) into a closed-form forward collision cone, which in turn yields a first-order control barrier function (CBF) embedded within a quadratic program (QP). By exploiting the analytic geometry of splats, our formulation provides a continuous, closed-form representation of collision constraints that is both simple and computationally efficient. Unlike distance-based CBFs, which tend to activate reactively only when an obstacle is already close, our collision-cone CBF activates proactively, allowing the robot to adjust earlier and thereby produce smoother and safer avoidance maneuvers at lower computational cost. We validate the method on a large synthetic scene with approximately 170k splats, where our filter reduces planning time by a factor of 3 and significantly decreased trajectory jerk compared to a state-of-the-art 3DGS planner, while maintaining the same level of safety. The approach is entirely analytic, requires no high-order CBF extensions (HOCBFs), and generalizes naturally to robots with physical extent through a principled Minkowski-sum inflation of the splats. These properties make the method broadly applicable to real-time navigation in cluttered, perception-derived extreme environments, including space robotics and satellite systems.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) provides a powerful framework for learning coordination in multi-agent systems. However, applying MARL to robotics still remains challenging due to high-dimensional continuous joint action spaces, complex reward design, and non-stationary transitions inherent to decentralized settings. On the other hand, humans learn complex coordination through staged curricula, where long-horizon behaviors are progressively built upon simpler skills. Motivated by this, we propose CRAFT: Coaching Reinforcement learning Autonomously using Foundation models for multi-robot coordination Tasks, a framework that leverages the reasoning capabilities of foundation models to act as a "coach" for multi-robot coordination. CRAFT automatically decomposes long-horizon coordination tasks into sequences of subtasks using the planning capability of Large Language Models (LLMs). In what follows, CRAFT trains each subtask using reward functions generated by LLM, and refines them through a Vision Language Model (VLM)-guided reward-refinement loop. We evaluate CRAFT on multi-quadruped navigation and bimanual manipulation tasks, demonstrating its capability to learn complex coordination behaviors. In addition, we validate the multi-quadruped navigation policy in real hardware experiments.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce LeVR, a modular software framework designed to bridge two critical gaps in robotic imitation learning. First, it provides robust and intuitive virtual reality (VR) teleoperation for data collection using robot arms paired with dexterous hands, addressing a common limitation in existing systems. Second, it natively integrates with the powerful LeRobot imitation learning (IL) framework, enabling the use of VR-based teleoperation data and streamlining the demonstration collection process. To demonstrate LeVR, we release LeFranX, an open-source implementation for the Franka FER arm and RobotEra XHand, two widely used research platforms. LeFranX delivers a seamless, end-to-end workflow from data collection to real-world policy deployment. We validate our system by collecting a public dataset of 100 expert demonstrations and use it to successfully fine-tune state-of-the-art visuomotor policies. We provide our open-source framework, implementation, and dataset to accelerate IL research for the robotics community.

  As Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) become increasingly autonomous and complex, understanding their error modes is critical for ensuring their reliability and safety. However, research in this area has been severely hampered by the lack of large-scale, diverse datasets with precise, ground-truth error labels. To address this bottleneck, we introduce \textbf{AEGIS}, a novel framework for \textbf{A}utomated \textbf{E}rror \textbf{G}eneration and \textbf{I}dentification for Multi-Agent \textbf{S}ystems. By systematically injecting controllable and traceable errors into initially successful trajectories, we create a rich dataset of realistic failures. This is achieved using a context-aware, LLM-based adaptive manipulator that performs sophisticated attacks like prompt injection and response corruption to induce specific, predefined error modes. We demonstrate the value of our dataset by exploring three distinct learning paradigms for the error identification task: Supervised Fine-Tuning, Reinforcement Learning, and Contrastive Learning. Our comprehensive experiments show that models trained on AEGIS data achieve substantial improvements across all three learning paradigms. Notably, several of our fine-tuned models demonstrate performance competitive with or superior to proprietary systems an order of magnitude larger, validating our automated data generation framework as a crucial resource for developing more robust and interpretable multi-agent systems.

  Agricultural robotic agents have been becoming powerful helpers in a wide range of agricultural tasks, however, still heavily rely on manual operation or fixed railways for movement. To address this limitation, the AgriVLN method and the A2A benchmark pioneeringly extend Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) to the agricultural domain, enabling agents to navigate to the target positions following the natural language instructions. AgriVLN effectively understands the simple instructions, but often misunderstands the complex ones. To bridge this gap, we propose the method of Translator for Agricultural Robotic Agents on Vision-and-Language Navigation (T-araVLN), in which the Instruction Translator module translates the original instruction to be more refined and precise. When evaluated on the A2A benchmark, our T-araVLN effectively improves Success Rate from 0.47 to 0.63 and reduces Navigation Error from 2.91m to 2.28m, demonstrating the state-of-the-art performance in the agricultural domain.

  Reasoning is central to purposeful action, yet most robotic foundation models map perception and instructions directly to control, which limits adaptability, generalization, and semantic grounding. We introduce Action Reasoning Models (ARMs), a class of robotic foundation models that integrate perception, planning, and control through a structured three-stage pipeline. Our model, MolmoAct, encodes observations and instructions into depth-aware perception tokens, generates mid-level spatial plans as editable trajectory traces, and predicts precise low-level actions, enabling explainable and steerable behavior. MolmoAct-7B-D achieves strong performance across simulation and real-world settings: 70.5% zero-shot accuracy on SimplerEnv Visual Matching tasks, surpassing closed-source Pi-0 and GR00T N1.5; 86.6% average success on LIBERO, including an additional 6.3% gain over ThinkAct on long-horizon tasks; and in real-world fine-tuning, an additional 10% (single-arm) and an additional 22.7% (bimanual) task progression over Pi-0-FAST. It also outperforms baselines by an additional 23.3% on out-of-distribution generalization and achieves top human-preference scores for open-ended instruction following and trajectory steering. Furthermore, we release, for the first time, the MolmoAct Dataset -- a mid-training robot dataset comprising over 10,000 high quality robot trajectories across diverse scenarios and tasks. Training with this dataset yields an average 5.5% improvement in general performance over the base model. We release all model weights, training code, our collected dataset, and our action reasoning dataset, establishing MolmoAct as both a state-of-the-art robotics foundation model and an open blueprint for building ARMs that transform perception into purposeful action through structured reasoning.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this paper, we propose the first framework that leverages physically-based inverse rendering for novel lighting generation on existing real-world human demonstrations of robotic manipulation tasks. Specifically, inverse rendering decomposes the first frame in each demonstration into geometric (surface normal, depth) and material (albedo, roughness, metallic) properties, which are then used to render appearance changes under different lighting sources. To improve efficiency and maintain consistency across each generated sequence, we fine-tune Stable Video Diffusion on robot execution videos for temporal lighting propagation. We evaluate our framework by measuring the visual quality of the generated sequences, assessing its effectiveness in improving the imitation learning policy performance (38.75\%) under six unseen real-world lighting conditions, and conduct ablation studies on individual modules of the proposed framework. We further showcase three downstream applications enabled by the proposed framework: background generation, object texture generation and distractor positioning. The code for the framework will be made publicly available.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Achieving expressive and generalizable whole-body motion control is essential for deploying humanoid robots in real-world environments. In this work, we propose UniTracker, a three-stage training framework that enables robust and scalable motion tracking across a wide range of human behaviors. In the first stage, we train a teacher policy with privileged observations to generate high-quality actions. In the second stage, we introduce a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) to model a universal student policy that can be deployed directly on real hardware. The CVAE structure allows the policy to learn a global latent representation of motion, enhancing generalization to unseen behaviors and addressing the limitations of standard MLP-based policies under partial observations. Unlike pure MLPs that suffer from drift in global attributes like orientation, our CVAE-student policy incorporates global intent during training by aligning a partial-observation prior to the full-observation encoder. In the third stage, we introduce a fast adaptation module that fine-tunes the universal policy on harder motion sequences that are difficult to track directly. This adaptation can be performed both for single sequences and in batch mode, further showcasing the flexibility and scalability of our approach. We evaluate UniTracker in both simulation and real-world settings using a Unitree G1 humanoid, demonstrating strong performance in motion diversity, tracking accuracy, and deployment robustness.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  While robotic automation has demonstrated remarkable performance, such as executing hundreds of experiments continuously over several days, designing synchronized motions between the robot and experimental jigs remains challenging, especially for flexible experimental automation. This challenge stems from the fact that even minor changes in experimental conditions often require extensive reprogramming of both robot motions and jig control commands. Previous systems lack the flexibility to accommodate frequent updates, limiting their practical utility in actual laboratories. To update robotic automation systems flexibly by chemists, we propose a concept that enables the automation of experiments by utilizing dual demonstrations of robot motions and jig operations by chemists. To verify this concept, we developed a chemical-experiment-automation system consisting of jigs to assist the robot in experiments, a motion-demonstration interface, a jig-control interface, and a mobile manipulator. We validate the concept through polymer-synthesis experiments, focusing on critical liquid-handling tasks such as pipetting and dilution. The experimental results indicate high reproducibility of the demonstrated motions and robust task-success rates. This comprehensive concept not only simplifies the robot programming process for chemists but also provides a flexible and efficient solution to accommodate a wide range of experimental conditions, providing a practical framework for intuitive and adaptable robotic laboratory automation.

  Data scarcity presents a key bottleneck for imitation learning in robotic manipulation. In this paper, we focus on random exploration data-actions and video sequences produced autonomously via motions to randomly sampled positions in the workspace-to investigate their potential as a cost-effective data source. Our investigation follows two paradigms: (a) random actions, where we assess their feasibility for autonomously bootstrapping data collection policies, and (b) random exploration video frames, where we evaluate their effectiveness in pre-training parameter-dense networks with self-supervised learning objectives. To minimize human supervision, we first develop a fully automated pipeline that handles episode labeling, termination, and resetting using cloud-based microservices for real-time monitoring. Building on this, we present a large-scale study on the cost-effectiveness of real-world random exploration in a non-trivial two-layer stacking task, drawing on statistical results from 807 hours of random actions, 71 hours of random exploration video (1.28M frames), and 1,260 times of policy evaluation. The dataset will be made publicly available and access to the robot environment with the automated pipeline is to be made accessible via cloud service for future research.

  Catching flying objects with a cushioning process is a skill commonly performed by humans, yet it remains a significant challenge for robots. In this paper, we present a framework that combines optimization and learning to achieve compliant catching on mobile manipulators (CCMM). First, we propose a high-level capture planner for mobile manipulators (MM) that calculates the optimal capture point and joint configuration. Next, the pre-catching (PRC) planner ensures the robot reaches the target joint configuration as quickly as possible. To learn compliant catching strategies, we propose a network that leverages the strengths of LSTM for capturing temporal dependencies and positional encoding for spatial context (P-LSTM). This network is designed to effectively learn compliant strategies from human demonstrations. Following this, the post-catching (POC) planner tracks the compliant sequence output by the P-LSTM while avoiding potential collisions due to structural differences between humans and robots. We validate the CCMM framework through both simulated and real-world ball-catching scenarios, achieving a success rate of 98.70% in simulation, 92.59% in real-world tests, and a 28.7% reduction in impact torques. The open source code has be released for the reference of the community.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Imitation learning (IL) algorithms typically distill experience into parametric behavior policies to mimic expert demonstrations. However, with limited demonstrations, existing methods often struggle to generate accurate actions, particularly under partial observability. To address this problem, we introduce a few-shot IL approach, ReMoBot, which directly retrieves information from demonstrations to solve Mobile manipulation tasks with ego-centric visual observations. Given the current observation, ReMoBot utilizes vision foundation models to identify relevant demonstrations, considering visual similarity w.r.t. both individual observations and history trajectories. A motion selection policy then selects the proper command for the robot until the task is successfully completed.The performance of ReMoBot is evaluated on three mobile manipulation tasks with a Boston Dynamics Spot robot in both simulation and the real world. After benchmarking five approaches in simulation, we compare our method with two baselines in the real world, training directly on the real-world dataset without sim-to-real transfer. With only 20 demonstrations, ReMoBot outperforms the baselines, achieving high success rates in Table Uncover (70%) and Gap Cover (80%), while also showing promising performance on the more challenging Curtain Open task in the real-world setting. Furthermore, ReMoBot demonstrates generalization across varying robot positions, object sizes, and material types. Additional details are available at:this https URL

  Many robotic tasks require grasping objects at specific object parts instead of arbitrarily, a crucial capability for interactions beyond simple pick-and-place, such as human-robot interaction, handovers, or tool use. Prior work has focused either on generic grasp prediction or task-conditioned grasping, but not on directly targeting object parts in an open-vocabulary way. We propose AnyPart, a modular framework that unifies open-vocabulary object detection, part segmentation, and 6-DoF grasp prediction to enable robots to grasp user-specified parts of arbitrary objects based on natural language prompts. We evaluate 16 model combinations, and demonstrate that the best-performing combination achieves 60.8% grasp success in cluttered real-world scenes at 60 times faster inference than existing approaches. To support this study, we introduce a new dataset for part-based grasping and conduct a detailed failure analysis. Our core insight is that modularly combining existing foundation models unlocks surprisingly strong and efficient capabilities for open-vocabulary part-based grasping without requiring additional training.

  The nonlinearity and hysteresis of soft robot motions present challenges for control. To solve these issues, the Jacobian controller has been applied to approximate the nonlinear behaviors in a linear format. Accurate controllers like neural networks can handle delayed and nonlinear motions, but they require large datasets and exhibit low adaptability. Based on a novel analysis on these controllers, we propose an adaptive extended Jacobian controller, AdapJ, for soft manipulators. This controller retains the concise format of the Jacobian controller but introduces independent parameters. Similar to neural networks, its initialization and updating mechanism leverages the inverse model without building the corresponding forward model. In the experiments, we first compare the performance of the Jacobian controller, model predictive controller, neural network controller, iterative feedback controller, and AdapJ in simulation. We further analyze how AdapJ parameters adapt in response to the physical property change. Then, real-world experiments have validated that AdapJ outperforms the neural network controller, model predictive controller, and iterative feedback controller with fewer training samples and adapts robustly to varying conditions, including different control frequencies, material softness, and external disturbances. Future work may include online adjustment of the controller format and adaptability validation in more scenarios.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) holds substantial promise for intelligent decision-making in complex environments. However, it suffers from a coordination and scalability bottleneck as the number of agents increases. To address these issues, we propose the LLM-empowered expert demonstrations framework for multi-agent reinforcement learning (LEED). LEED consists of two components: a demonstration generation (DG) module and a policy optimization (PO) module. Specifically, the DG module leverages large language models to generate instructions for interacting with the environment, thereby producing high-quality demonstrations. The PO module adopts a decentralized training paradigm, where each agent utilizes the generated demonstrations to construct an expert policy loss, which is then integrated with its own policy loss. This enables each agent to effectively personalize and optimize its local policy based on both expert knowledge and individual experience. Experimental results show that LEED achieves superior sample efficiency, time efficiency, and robust scalability compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

  Partial agent failure becomes inevitable when systems scale up, making it crucial to identify the subset of agents whose compromise would most severely degrade overall performance. In this paper, we study this Vulnerable Agent Identification (VAI) problem in large-scale multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). We frame VAI as a Hierarchical Adversarial Decentralized Mean Field Control (HAD-MFC), where the upper level involves an NP-hard combinatorial task of selecting the most vulnerable agents, and the lower level learns worst-case adversarial policies for these agents using mean-field MARL. The two problems are coupled together, making HAD-MFC difficult to solve. To solve this, we first decouple the hierarchical process by Fenchel-Rockafellar transform, resulting a regularized mean-field Bellman operator for upper level that enables independent learning at each level, thus reducing computational complexity. We then reformulate the upper-level combinatorial problem as a MDP with dense rewards from our regularized mean-field Bellman operator, enabling us to sequentially identify the most vulnerable agents by greedy and RL algorithms. This decomposition provably preserves the optimal solution of the original HAD-MFC. Experiments show our method effectively identifies more vulnerable agents in large-scale MARL and the rule-based system, fooling system into worse failures, and learns a value function that reveals the vulnerability of each agent.

  In recent years, diversity has emerged as a useful mechanism to enhance the efficiency of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). However, existing methods predominantly focus on designing policies based on individual agent characteristics, often neglecting the interplay and mutual influence among agents during policy formation. To address this gap, we propose Competitive Diversity through Constructive Conflict (CoDiCon), a novel approach that incorporates competitive incentives into cooperative scenarios to encourage policy exchange and foster strategic diversity among agents. Drawing inspiration from sociological research, which highlights the benefits of moderate competition and constructive conflict in group decision-making, we design an intrinsic reward mechanism using ranking features to introduce competitive motivations. A centralized intrinsic reward module generates and distributes varying reward values to agents, ensuring an effective balance between competition and cooperation. By optimizing the parameterized centralized reward module to maximize environmental rewards, we reformulate the constrained bilevel optimization problem to align with the original task objectives. We evaluate our algorithm against state-of-the-art methods in the SMAC and GRF environments. Experimental results demonstrate that CoDiCon achieves superior performance, with competitive intrinsic rewards effectively promoting diverse and adaptive strategies among cooperative agents.

  When should we encourage specialization in multi-agent systems versus train generalists that perform the entire task independently? We propose that specialization largely depends on task parallelizability: the potential for multiple agents to execute task components concurrently. Drawing inspiration from Amdahl's Law in distributed systems, we present a closed-form bound that predicts when specialization improves performance, depending only on task concurrency and team size. We validate our model on two standard MARL benchmarks that represent opposite regimes -- StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge (SMAC, unlimited concurrency) and Multi-Particle Environment (MPE, unit-capacity bottlenecks) -- and observe close alignment between the bound at each extreme and an empirical measure of specialization. Three follow-up experiments in Overcooked-AI demonstrate that the model works in environments with more complex spatial and resource bottlenecks that allow for a range of strategies. Beyond prediction, the bound also serves as a diagnostic tool, highlighting biases in MARL training algorithms that cause sub-optimal convergence to specialist strategies with larger state spaces.

  Foundation models trained on web-scale data have revolutionized robotics, but their application to low-level control remains largely limited to behavioral cloning. Drawing inspiration from the success of the reinforcement learning stage in fine-tuning large language models, we propose a two-stage post-training approach for robotics. The first stage, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), fine-tunes pretrained foundation models using both: a) behavioral cloning, and b) steps-to-go prediction objectives. In the second stage, Self-Improvement, steps-to-go prediction enables the extraction of a well-shaped reward function and a robust success detector, enabling a fleet of robots to autonomously practice downstream tasks with minimal human supervision. Through extensive experiments on real-world and simulated robot embodiments, our novel post-training recipe unveils significant results on Embodied Foundation Models. First, we demonstrate that the combination of SFT and Self-Improvement is significantly more sample-efficient than scaling imitation data collection for supervised learning, and that it leads to policies with significantly higher success rates. Further ablations highlight that the combination of web-scale pretraining and Self-Improvement is the key to this sample-efficiency. Next, we demonstrate that our proposed combination uniquely unlocks a capability that current methods cannot achieve: autonomously practicing and acquiring novel skills that generalize far beyond the behaviors observed in the imitation learning datasets used during training. These findings highlight the transformative potential of combining pretrained foundation models with online Self-Improvement to enable autonomous skill acquisition in robotics.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Existing reinforcement learning (RL) methods struggle with complex dynamical systems that demand interactions at high frequencies or irregular time intervals. Continuous-time RL (CTRL) has emerged as a promising alternative by replacing discrete-time Bellman recursion with differential value functions defined as viscosity solutions of the Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman (HJB) equation. While CTRL has shown promise, its applications have been largely limited to the single-agent domain. This limitation stems from two key challenges: (i) conventional solution methods for HJB equations suffer from the curse of dimensionality (CoD), making them intractable in high-dimensional systems; and (ii) even with HJB-based learning approaches, accurately approximating centralized value functions in multi-agent settings remains difficult, which in turn destabilizes policy training. In this paper, we propose a CT-MARL framework that uses physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to approximate HJB-based value functions at scale. To ensure the value is consistent with its differential structure, we align value learning with value-gradient learning by introducing a Value Gradient Iteration (VGI) module that iteratively refines value gradients along trajectories. This improves gradient fidelity, in turn yielding more accurate values and stronger policy learning. We evaluate our method using continuous-time variants of standard benchmarks, including multi-agent particle environment (MPE) and multi-agent MuJoCo. Our results demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing continuous-time RL baselines and scales to complex multi-agent dynamics.

  _Yujun Zhou, Zhenwen Liang, Haolin Liu, Wenhao Yu, Kishan Panaganti, Linfeng Song, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly trained with reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards (RLVR), yet real-world deployment demands models that can self-improve without labels or external judges. Existing label-free methods, confidence minimization, self-consistency, or majority-vote objectives, stabilize learning but steadily shrink exploration, causing an entropy collapse: generations become shorter, less diverse, and brittle. Unlike prior approaches such as Test-Time Reinforcement Learning (TTRL), which primarily adapt models to the immediate unlabeled dataset at hand, our goal is broader: to enable general improvements without sacrificing the model's inherent exploration capacity and generalization ability, i.e., evolving. We formalize this issue and propose EVolution-Oriented and Label-free Reinforcement Learning (EVOL-RL), a simple rule that couples stability with variation under a label-free setting. EVOL-RL keeps the majority-voted answer as a stable anchor (selection) while adding a novelty-aware reward that favors responses whose reasoning differs from what has already been produced (variation), measured in semantic space. Implemented with GRPO, EVOL-RL also uses asymmetric clipping to preserve strong signals and an entropy regularizer to sustain search. This majority-for-selection + novelty-for-variation design prevents collapse, maintains longer and more informative chains of thought, and improves both pass@1 and pass@n. EVOL-RL consistently outperforms the majority-only TTRL baseline; e.g., training on label-free AIME24 lifts Qwen3-4B-Base AIME25 pass@1 from TTRL's 4.6% to 16.4%, and pass@16 from 18.5% to 37.9%. EVOL-RL not only prevents diversity collapse but also unlocks stronger generalization across domains (e.g., GPQA). Furthermore, we demonstrate that EVOL-RL also boosts performance in the RLVR setting, highlighting its broad applicability.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of large language models can be viewed as an off-policy learning problem, where expert demonstrations come from a fixed behavior policy while training aims to optimize a target policy. Importance sampling is the standard tool for correcting this distribution mismatch, but large policy gaps lead to high variance and training instability. Existing approaches mitigate this issue using KL penalties or clipping, which passively constrain updates rather than actively reducing the gap. We propose a simple yet effective data rewriting framework that proactively shrinks the policy gap by keeping correct solutions as on-policy data and rewriting incorrect ones with guided re-solving, falling back to expert demonstrations only when needed. This aligns the training distribution with the target policy before optimization, reducing importance sampling variance and stabilizing off-policy fine-tuning. Experiments on five mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate consistent and significant gains over both vanilla SFT and the state-of-the-art Dynamic Fine-Tuning (DFT) approach. The data and code will be released atthis https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reward models are central to both reinforcement learning (RL) with language models and inference-time verification. However, existing reward models often lack temporal consistency, leading to ineffective policy updates and unstable RL training. We introduce TDRM, a method for learning smoother and more reliable reward models by minimizing temporal differences during training. This temporal-difference (TD) regularization produces smooth rewards and improves alignment with long-term objectives. Incorporating TDRM into the actor-critic style online RL loop yields consistent empirical gains. It is worth noting that TDRM is a supplement to verifiable reward methods, and both can be used in series. Experiments show that TD-trained process reward models (PRMs) improve performance across Best-of-N (up to 6.6%) and tree-search (up to 23.7%) settings. When combined with Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), TD-trained PRMs lead to more data-efficient RL -- achieving comparable performance with just 2.5k data to what baseline methods require 50.1k data to attain -- and yield higher-quality language model policies on 8 model variants (5 series), e.g., Qwen2.5-(0.5B, 1,5B), GLM4-9B-0414, GLM-Z1-9B-0414, Qwen2.5-Math-(1.5B, 7B), and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-(1.5B, 7B).

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  While reinforcement learning (RL) is increasingly used for LLM-based tool learning, its efficiency is often hampered by an overabundance of simple samples that provide diminishing learning value as training progresses. Existing dynamic sampling techniques are ill-suited for the multi-task structure and fine-grained reward mechanisms inherent to tool learning. This paper introduces Dynamic Sampling with Curriculum Learning (DSCL), a framework specifically designed to address this challenge by targeting the unique characteristics of tool learning: its multiple interdependent sub-tasks and multi-valued reward functions. DSCL features two core components: Reward-Based Dynamic Sampling, which uses multi-dimensional reward statistics (mean and variance) to prioritize valuable data, and Task-Based Dynamic Curriculum Learning, which adaptively focuses training on less-mastered sub-tasks. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that DSCL significantly improves training efficiency and model performance over strong baselines, achieving a 3.29\% improvement on the BFCLv3 benchmark. Our method provides a tailored solution that effectively leverages the complex reward signals and sub-task dynamics within tool learning to achieve superior results.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We propose FlowRL: matching the full reward distribution via flow balancing instead of maximizing rewards in large language model (LLM) reinforcement learning (RL). Recent advanced reasoning models adopt reward-maximizing methods (\eg, PPO and GRPO), which tend to over-optimize dominant reward signals while neglecting less frequent but valid reasoning paths, thus reducing diversity. In contrast, we transform scalar rewards into a normalized target distribution using a learnable partition function, and then minimize the reverse KL divergence between the policy and the target distribution. We implement this idea as a flow-balanced optimization method that promotes diverse exploration and generalizable reasoning trajectories. We conduct experiments on math and code reasoning tasks: FlowRL achieves a significant average improvement of $10.0\%$ over GRPO and $5.1\%$ over PPO on math benchmarks, and performs consistently better on code reasoning tasks. These results highlight reward distribution-matching as a key step toward efficient exploration and diverse reasoning in LLM reinforcement learning.

  Large Language Models(LLMs) excel in general tasks but struggle in specialized domains like healthcare due to limited domain-specificthis http URLFine-Tuning(SFT) data construction for domain adaptation often relies on heuristic methods, such as GPT-4 annotation or manual data selection, with a data-centric focus on presumed diverse, high-quality datasets. However, these methods overlook the model's inherent knowledge distribution, introducing noise, redundancy, and irrelevant data, leading to a mismatch between the selected data and the model's learning task, resulting in suboptimal performance. To address this, we propose a two-stage model-centric data selection framework, Decomposed Difficulty Data Selection (3DS), which aligns data with the model's knowledge distribution for optimized adaptation. In Stage1, we apply Prompt-Driven Data Selection via Explicit Alignment, where the the model filters irrelevant or redundant data based on its internal knowledge. In Stage2, we perform Decomposed Difficulty Data Selection, where data selection is guided by our defined difficulty decomposition, using three metrics: Instruction Understanding, Response Confidence, and Response Correctness. Additionally, an attention-based importance weighting mechanism captures token importance for more accurate difficulty calibration. This two-stage approach ensures the selected data is not only aligned with the model's knowledge and preferences but also appropriately challenging for the model to learn, leading to more effective and targeted domain adaptation. In the case study of the medical domain, our extensive experiments on real-world healthcare datasets demonstrate the superiority of 3DS over exisiting methods in accuracy by over 5.29%.

  Recent advances in machine learning, particularly in Natural Language Processing (NLP), have produced powerful models trained on vast datasets. However, these models risk leaking sensitive information, raising privacy concerns. In response, regulatory measures such as the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) have driven increasing interest in Machine Unlearning techniques, which enable models to selectively forget specific data entries. Early unlearning approaches primarily relied on pre-processing methods, while more recent research has shifted towards training-based solutions. Despite their effectiveness, a key limitation persists: most methods require access to original training data, which is often unavailable. Additionally, directly applying unlearning techniques bears the cost of undermining the model's expressive capabilities. To address these challenges, we introduce the Iterative Contrastive Unlearning (ICU) framework, which consists of three core components: A Knowledge Unlearning Induction module designed to target specific knowledge for removal using an unlearning loss; A Contrastive Learning Enhancement module to preserve the model's expressive capabilities against the pure unlearning goal; And an Iterative Unlearning Refinement module that dynamically adjusts the unlearning process through ongoing evaluation and updates. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our ICU method in unlearning sensitive information while maintaining the model's overall performance, offering a promising solution for privacy-conscious machine learning applications.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Directional forecasting in financial markets requires both accuracy and interpretability. Before the advent of deep learning, interpretable approaches based on human-defined patterns were prevalent, but their structural vagueness and scale ambiguity hindered generalization. In contrast, deep learning models can effectively capture complex dynamics, yet often offer limited transparency. To bridge this gap, we propose a two-stage framework that integrates unsupervised pattern extracion with interpretable forecasting. (i) SIMPC segments and clusters multivariate time series, extracting recurrent patterns that are invariant to amplitude scaling and temporal distortion, even under varying window sizes. (ii) JISC-Net is a shapelet-based classifier that uses the initial part of extracted patterns as input and forecasts subsequent partial sequences for short-term directional movement. Experiments on Bitcoin and three S&P 500 equities demonstrate that our method ranks first or second in 11 out of 12 metric--dataset combinations, consistently outperforming baselines. Unlike conventional deep learning models that output buy-or-sell signals without interpretable justification, our approach enables transparent decision-making by revealing the underlying pattern structures that drive predictive outcomes.

  Large Language Models have demonstrated significant promise in formal theorem proving. However, previous works mainly focus on solving existing problems. In this paper, we focus on the ability of LLMs to find novel theorems. We propose Conjecturing-Proving Loop pipeline for automatically generating mathematical conjectures and proving them in Lean 4 format. A feature of our approach is that we generate and prove further conjectures with context including previously generated theorems and their proofs, which enables the generation of more difficult proofs by in-context learning of proof strategies without changing parameters of LLMs. We demonstrated that our framework rediscovered theorems with verification, which were published in past mathematical papers and have not yet formalized. Moreover, at least one of these theorems could not be proved by the LLM without in-context learning, even in natural language, which means that in-context learning was effective for neural theorem proving.

  Effective resource management and network slicing are essential to meet the diverse service demands of vehicular networks, including Enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB) and Ultra-Reliable and Low-Latency Communications (URLLC). This paper introduces an Explainable Deep Reinforcement Learning (XRL) framework for dynamic network slicing and resource allocation in vehicular networks, built upon a near-real-time RAN intelligent controller. By integrating a feature-based approach that leverages Shapley values and an attention mechanism, we interpret and refine the decisions of our reinforcementlearning agents, addressing key reliability challenges in vehicular communication systems. Simulation results demonstrate that our approach provides clear, real-time insights into the resource allocation process and achieves higher interpretability precision than a pure attention mechanism. Furthermore, the Quality of Service (QoS) satisfaction for URLLC services increased from 78.0% to 80.13%, while that for eMBB services improved from 71.44% to 73.21%.

  Fraud detection remains a critical task in high-stakes domains such as finance and e-commerce, where undetected fraudulent transactions can lead to significant economic losses. In this study, we systematically compare the performance of four supervised learning models - Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM), and a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) network - on a large-scale, highly imbalanced online transaction dataset. While ensemble methods such as Random Forest and LightGBM demonstrated superior performance in both overall and class-specific metrics, Logistic Regression offered a reliable and interpretable baseline. The GRU model showed strong recall for the minority fraud class, though at the cost of precision, highlighting a trade-off relevant for real-world deployment. Our evaluation emphasizes not only weighted averages but also per-class precision, recall, and F1-scores, providing a nuanced view of each model's effectiveness in detecting rare but consequential fraudulent activity. The findings underscore the importance of choosing models based on the specific risk tolerance and operational needs of fraud detection systems.

  Large language models (LLMs) have substantially advanced machine learning research, including natural language processing, computer vision, data mining, etc., yet they still exhibit critical limitations in explainability, reliability, adaptability, and extensibility. In this paper, we overview a promising learning paradigm, i.e., Modular Machine Learning (MML), as an essential approach toward new-generation LLMs capable of addressing these issues. We begin by systematically and comprehensively surveying the existing literature on modular machine learning, with a particular focus on modular data representation and modular models. Then, we propose a unified MML framework for LLMs, which decomposes the complex structure of LLMs into three interdependent components: modular representation, modular model, and modular reasoning. Specifically, the MML paradigm discussed in this article is able to: i) clarify the internal working mechanism of LLMs through the disentanglement of semantic components; ii) allow for flexible and task-adaptive model design; iii) enable an interpretable and logic-driven decision-making process. We further elaborate a feasible implementation of MML-based LLMs via leveraging advanced techniques such as disentangled representation learning, neural architecture search and neuro-symbolic learning. Last but not least, we critically identify the remaining key challenges, such as the integration of continuous neural and discrete symbolic processes, joint optimization, and computational scalability, present promising future research directions that deserve further exploration. Ultimately, we believe the integration of the MML with LLMs has the potential to bridge the gap between statistical (deep) learning and formal (logical) reasoning, thereby paving the way for robust, adaptable, and trustworthy AI systems across a wide range of real-world applications.

  _Mohammad Saif Nazir, Chayan Banerjee_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reinforcement learning (RL) often struggles with reward misalignment, where agents optimize given rewards but fail to exhibit the desired behaviors. This arises when the reward function incentivizes proxy behaviors misaligned with the true objective. While human-in-the-loop (HITL) methods can mitigate this issue, they also introduce biases, leading to inconsistent and subjective feedback that complicates learning. To address these challenges, we propose two key contributions. First, we extend the use of zero-shot, off-the-shelf large language models (LLMs) for reward shaping beyond natural language processing (NLP) to continuous control tasks. Using LLMs as direct feedback providers eliminates the need for surrogate models trained on human feedback, which often inherit biases from training data. Second, we introduce a hybrid framework (LLM-HFBF) that enables LLMs to identify and correct biases in human feedback while incorporating this feedback into the reward shaping process. The LLM-HFBF framework creates a more balanced and reliable system by addressing both the limitations of LLMs (e.g., lack of domain-specific knowledge) and human supervision (e.g., inherent biases). By enabling human feedback bias flagging and correction, our approach improves reinforcement learning performance and reduces reliance on potentially biased human feedback. Empirical experiments show that biased human feedback significantly reduces performance, with Average Episodic Reward dropping by nearly 94% compared to unbiased approaches. In contrast, LLM-based methods sustain performance at a similar level to unbiased feedback, even in challenging edge-case scenarios.

  Model merging enables powerful capabilities in neural networks without requiring additional training. In this paper, we introduce a novel perspective on model merging by leveraging the fundamental mechanisms of neural network representation. Our approach is motivated by the linear representation hypothesis, which states that neural networks encode information through linear combinations of feature vectors. We propose a method that superposes task-specific features from individual models into a merged model. Our approach specifically targets linear transformation matrices, which are crucial for feature activation and extraction in deep networks. By formulating the merging process as a linear system, we can preserve task-specific features from individual models and create merged models that effectively maintain multi-task capabilities compared to existing methods. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks and models demonstrate that our method outperforms existing techniques. Code is available atthis https URL.

  While inorganic retrosynthesis planning is essential in the field of chemical science, the application of machine learning in this area has been notably less explored compared to organic retrosynthesis planning. In this paper, we propose Retrieval-Retro for inorganic retrosynthesis planning, which implicitly extracts the precursor information of reference materials that are retrieved from the knowledge base regarding domain expertise in the field. Specifically, instead of directly employing the precursor information of reference materials, we propose implicitly extracting it with various attention layers, which enables the model to learn novel synthesis recipes more effectively. Moreover, during retrieval, we consider the thermodynamic relationship between target material and precursors, which is essential domain expertise in identifying the most probable precursor set among various options. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of Retrieval-Retro in retrosynthesis planning, especially in discovering novel synthesis recipes, which is crucial for materials discovery.

  Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have attracted substantial interest due to their exceptional performance on graph-based data. However, their robustness, especially on heterogeneous graphs, remains underexplored, particularly against adversarial attacks. This paper proposes HeteroKRLAttack, a targeted evasion black-box attack method for heterogeneous graphs. By integrating reinforcement learning with a Top-K algorithm to reduce the action space, our method efficiently identifies effective attack strategies to disrupt node classification tasks. We validate the effectiveness of HeteroKRLAttack through experiments on multiple heterogeneous graph datasets, showing significant reductions in classification accuracy compared to baseline methods. An ablation study underscores the critical role of the Top-K algorithm in enhancing attack performance. Our findings highlight potential vulnerabilities in current models and provide guidance for future defense strategies against adversarial attacks on heterogeneous graphs.

  The Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment is a general-purpose detector for high-energy collision at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN. It employs an online data quality monitoring (DQM) system to promptly spot and diagnose particle data acquisition problems to avoid data quality loss. In this study, we present a semi-supervised spatio-temporal anomaly detection (AD) monitoring system for the physics particle reading channels of the Hadron Calorimeter (HCAL) of the CMS using three-dimensional digi-occupancy map data of the DQM. We propose the GraphSTAD system, which employs convolutional and graph neural networks to learn local spatial characteristics induced by particles traversing the detector and the global behavior owing to shared backend circuit connections and housing boxes of the channels, respectively. Recurrent neural networks capture the temporal evolution of the extracted spatial features. We validate the accuracy of the proposed AD system in capturing diverse channel fault types using the LHC collision data sets.

  Time series forecasting (TSF) is critical in domains like energy, finance, healthcare, and logistics, requiring models that generalize across diverse datasets. Large pre-trained models such as Chronos and Time-MoE show strong zero-shot (ZS) performance but suffer from high computational costs. In this work, We introduce Super-Linear, a lightweight and scalable mixture-of-experts (MoE) model for general forecasting. It replaces deep architectures with simple frequency-specialized linear experts, trained on resampled data across multiple frequency regimes. A lightweight spectral gating mechanism dynamically selects relevant experts, enabling efficient, accurate forecasting. Despite its simplicity, Super-Linear matches state-of-the-art performance while offering superior efficiency, robustness to various sampling rates, and enhanced interpretability. The implementation of Super-Linear is available at \href{this https URL}{this https URL}

  The rising computational and energy demands of deep learning, particularly in large-scale architectures such as foundation models and large language models (LLMs), pose significant challenges to sustainability. Traditional gradient-based training methods are inefficient, requiring numerous iterative updates and high power consumption. To address these limitations, we propose a hybrid framework that combines hierarchical decomposition with FPGA-based direct equation solving and incremental learning. Our method divides the neural network into two functional tiers: lower layers are optimized via single-step equation solving on FPGAs for efficient and parallelizable feature extraction, while higher layers employ adaptive incremental learning to support continual updates without full retraining. Building upon this foundation, we introduce the Compound LLM framework, which explicitly deploys LLM modules across both hierarchy levels. The lower-level LLM handles reusable representation learning with minimal energy overhead, while the upper-level LLM performs adaptive decision-making through energy-aware updates. This integrated design enhances scalability, reduces redundant computation, and aligns with the principles of sustainable AI. Theoretical analysis and architectural insights demonstrate that our method reduces computational costs significantly while preserving high model performance, making it well-suited for edge deployment and real-time adaptation in energy-constrained environments.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Non-stationary multi-armed bandits enable agents to adapt to changing environments by incorporating mechanisms to detect and respond to shifts in reward distributions, making them well-suited for dynamic settings. However, existing approaches typically assume that reward feedback is available at every round - an assumption that overlooks many real-world scenarios where feedback is limited. In this paper, we take a significant step forward by introducing a new model of constrained feedback in non-stationary multi-armed bandits, where the availability of reward feedback is restricted. We propose the first prior-free algorithm - that is, one that does not require prior knowledge of the degree of non-stationarity - that achieves near-optimal dynamic regret in this setting. Specifically, our algorithm attains a dynamic regret of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}({K^{1/3} V_T^{1/3} T }/{ B^{1/3}})$, where $T$ is the number of rounds, $K$ is the number of arms, $B$ is the query budget, and $V_T$ is the variation budget capturing the degree of non-stationarity.

  _Martha Cash, Alexander Wyglinski_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present a novel framework that leverages time series clustering to improve internet traffic matrix (TM) prediction using deep learning (DL) models. Traffic flows within a TM often exhibit diverse temporal behaviors, which can hinder prediction accuracy when training a single model across all flows. To address this, we propose two clustering strategies, source clustering and histogram clustering, that group flows with similar temporal patterns prior to model training. Clustering creates more homogeneous data subsets, enabling models to capture underlying patterns more effectively and generalize better than global prediction approaches that fit a single model to the entire TM. Compared to existing TM prediction methods, our method reduces RMSE by up to 92\% for Abilene and 75\% for G√âANT. In routing scenarios, our clustered predictions also reduce maximum link utilization (MLU) bias by 18\% and 21\%, respectively, demonstrating the practical benefits of clustering when TMs are used for network optimization.

  _Padmaksha Roy, Almuatazbellah Boker, Lamine Mili_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this paper, we aim to improve multivariate anomaly detection (AD) by modeling the \textit{time-varying non-linear spatio-temporal correlations} found in multivariate time series data . In multivariate time series data, an anomaly may be indicated by the simultaneous deviation of interrelated time series from their expected collective behavior, even when no individual time series exhibits a clearly abnormal pattern on its own. In many existing approaches, time series variables are assumed to be (conditionally) independent, which oversimplifies real-world interactions. Our approach addresses this by modeling joint dependencies in the latent space and decoupling the modeling of \textit{marginal distributions, temporal dynamics, and inter-variable dependencies}. We use a transformer encoder to capture temporal patterns, and to model spatial (inter-variable) dependencies, we fit a multi-variate likelihood and a copula. The temporal and the spatial components are trained jointly in a latent space using a self-supervised contrastive learning objective to learn meaningful feature representations to separate normal and anomaly samples.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Malnutrition among pregnant women is a major public health challenge in Ethiopia, increasing the risk of adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes. Traditional statistical approaches often fail to capture the complex and multidimensional determinants of nutritional status. This study develops a predictive model using ensemble machine learning techniques, leveraging data from the Ethiopian Demographic and Health Survey (2005-2020), comprising 18,108 records with 30 socio-demographic and health attributes. Data preprocessing included handling missing values, normalization, and balancing with SMOTE, followed by feature selection to identify key predictors. Several supervised ensemble algorithms including XGBoost, Random Forest, CatBoost, and AdaBoost were applied to classify nutritional status. Among them, the Random Forest model achieved the best performance, classifying women into four categories (normal, moderate malnutrition, severe malnutrition, and overnutrition) with 97.87% accuracy, 97.88% precision, 97.87% recall, 97.87% F1-score, and 99.86% ROC AUC. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of ensemble learning in capturing hidden patterns from complex datasets and provide timely insights for early detection of nutritional risks. The results offer practical implications for healthcare providers, policymakers, and researchers, supporting data-driven strategies to improve maternal nutrition and health outcomes in Ethiopia.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Time series forecasting is crucial in various fields such as economics, traffic, and AIOps. However, in real-world applications, focusing solely on the endogenous variables (i.e., target variables), is often insufficient to ensure accurate predictions. Considering exogenous variables (i.e., covariates) provides additional predictive information, thereby improving forecasting accuracy. However, existing methods for time series forecasting with exogenous variables (TSF-X) have the following shortcomings: 1) they do not leverage future exogenous variables, 2) they fail to account for the causal relationships between endogenous and exogenous variables. As a result, their performance is suboptimal. In this study, to better leverage exogenous variables, especially future exogenous variable, we propose a general framework DAG, which utilizes dual causal network along both the temporal and channel dimensions for time series forecasting with exogenous variables. Specifically, we first introduce the Temporal Causal Module, which includes a causal discovery module to capture how historical exogenous variables affect future exogenous variables. Following this, we construct a causal injection module that incorporates the discovered causal relationships into the process of forecasting future endogenous variables based on historical endogenous variables. Next, we propose the Channel Causal Module, which follows a similar design principle. It features a causal discovery module models how historical exogenous variables influence historical endogenous variables, and a causal injection module incorporates the discovered relationships to enhance the prediction of future endogenous variables based on future exogenous variables.

  CoVariance Neural Networks (VNNs) perform convolutions on the graph determined by the covariance matrix of the data, which enables expressive and stable covariance-based learning. However, covariance matrices are typically dense, fail to encode conditional independence, and are often precomputed in a task-agnostic way, which may hinder performance. To overcome these limitations, we study Precision Neural Networks (PNNs), i.e., VNNs on the precision matrix -- the inverse covariance. The precision matrix naturally encodes statistical independence, often exhibits sparsity, and preserves the covariance spectral structure. To make precision estimation task-aware, we formulate an optimization problem that jointly learns the network parameters and the precision matrix, and solve it via alternating optimization, by sequentially updating the network weights and the precision estimate. We theoretically bound the distance between the estimated and true precision matrices at each iteration, and demonstrate the effectiveness of joint estimation compared to two-step approaches on synthetic and real-world data.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Since compute grows much faster than web text available for language model pre-training, we ask how one should approach pre-training under fixed data and no compute constraints. We first show that existing data-constrained approaches of increasing epoch count and parameter count eventually overfit, and we significantly improve upon such recipes by properly tuning regularization, finding that the optimal weight decay is $30\times$ larger than standard practice. Since our regularized recipe monotonically decreases loss following a simple power law in parameter count, we estimate its best possible performance via the asymptote of its scaling law rather than the performance at a fixed compute budget. We then identify that ensembling independently trained models achieves a significantly lower loss asymptote than the regularized recipe. Our best intervention combining epoching, regularization, parameter scaling, and ensemble scaling achieves an asymptote at 200M tokens using $5.17\times$ less data than our baseline, and our data scaling laws predict that this improvement persists at higher token budgets. We find that our data efficiency gains can be realized at much smaller parameter counts as we can distill an ensemble into a student model that is 8$\times$ smaller and retains $83\%$ of the ensembling benefit. Finally, our interventions designed for validation loss generalize to downstream benchmarks, achieving a $9\%$ improvement for pre-training evals and a $17.5\times$ data efficiency improvement over continued pre-training on math mid-training data. Our results show that simple algorithmic improvements can enable significantly more data-efficient pre-training in a compute-rich future.

  _Shuangshuang He, Yuanting Zhang, Hongli Liang, Qingye Meng, Xingyuan Yuan_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Accurate hourly weather forecasting is critical for numerous applications. Recent deep learning models have demonstrated strong capability on 6-hour intervals, yet achieving accurate and stable hourly predictions remains a critical challenge. This is primarily due to the rapid accumulation of errors in autoregressive rollouts and temporal discontinuities within the ERA5 data's 12-hour assimilation cycle. To address these issues, we propose FlowCast-ODE, a framework that models atmospheric state evolution as a continuous flow. FlowCast-ODE learns the conditional flow path directly from the previous state, an approach that aligns more naturally with physical dynamic systems and enables efficient computation. A coarse-to-fine strategy is introduced to train the model on 6-hour data using dynamic flow matching and then refined on hourly data that incorporates an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) solver to achieve temporally coherent forecasts. In addition, a lightweight low-rank AdaLN-Zero modulation mechanism is proposed and reduces model size by 15% without compromising accuracy. Experiments demonstrate that FlowCast-ODE outperforms strong baselines, yielding lower root mean square error (RMSE) and better energy conservation, which reduces blurring and preserves more fine-scale spatial details. It also shows comparable performance to the state-of-the-art model in forecasting extreme events like typhoons. Furthermore, the model alleviates temporal discontinuities associated with assimilation cycle transitions.

  Single-cell foundation models (scFMs) have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance on various tasks, such as cell-type annotation and perturbation response prediction, by learning gene regulatory networks from large-scale transcriptome data. However, a significant challenge remains: the decision-making processes of these models are less interpretable compared to traditional methods like differential gene expression analysis. Recently, transcoders have emerged as a promising approach for extracting interpretable decision circuits from large language models (LLMs). In this work, we train a transcoder on the cell2sentence (C2S) model, a state-of-the-art scFM. By leveraging the trained transcoder, we extract internal decision-making circuits from the C2S model. We demonstrate that the discovered circuits correspond to real-world biological mechanisms, confirming the potential of transcoders to uncover biologically plausible pathways within complex single-cell models.

  Existing positional encoding methods in transformers are fundamentally signal-agnostic, deriving positional information solely from sequence indices while ignoring the underlying signal characteristics. This limitation is particularly problematic for time series analysis, where signals exhibit complex, non-stationary dynamics across multiple temporal scales. We introduce Dynamic Wavelet Positional Encoding (DyWPE), a novel signal-aware framework that generates positional embeddings directly from input time series using the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT). Comprehensive experiments in ten diverse time series datasets demonstrate that DyWPE consistently outperforms eight existing state-of-the-art positional encoding methods, achieving average relative improvements of 9.1\% compared to baseline sinusoidal absolute position encoding in biomedical signals, while maintaining competitive computational efficiency.

  As privacy and security take center stage in AI, machine unlearning, the ability to erase specific knowledge from models, has garnered increasing attention. However, existing methods overly prioritize efficiency and aggressive forgetting, which introduces notable limitations. In particular, radical interventions like gradient ascent, influence functions, and random label noise can destabilize model weights, leading to collapse and reduced reliability. To address this, we propose CUFG (Curriculum Unlearning via Forgetting Gradients), a novel framework that enhances the stability of approximate unlearning through innovations in both forgetting mechanisms and data scheduling strategies. Specifically, CUFG integrates a new gradient corrector guided by forgetting gradients for fine-tuning-based unlearning and a curriculum unlearning paradigm that progressively forgets from easy to hard. These innovations narrow the gap with the gold-standard Retrain method by enabling more stable and progressive unlearning, thereby improving both effectiveness and reliability. Furthermore, we believe that the concept of curriculum unlearning has substantial research potential and offers forward-looking insights for the development of the MU field. Extensive experiments across various forgetting scenarios validate the rationale and effectiveness of our approach and CUFG. Codes are available atthis https URL.

  Energy-efficient medical data classification is essential for modern disease screening, particularly in home and field healthcare where embedded devices are prevalent. While deep learning models achieve state-of-the-art accuracy, their substantial energy consumption and reliance on GPUs limit deployment on such platforms. We present Hyperdimensional Computing with Class-Wise Clustering (HD3C), a lightweight classification framework designed for low-power environments. HD3C encodes data into high-dimensional hypervectors, aggregates them into multiple cluster-specific prototypes, and performs classification through similarity search in hyperspace. We evaluate HD3C across three medical classification tasks; on heart sound classification, HD3C is $350\times$ more energy-efficient than Bayesian ResNet with less than 1% accuracy difference. Moreover, HD3C demonstrates exceptional robustness to noise, limited training data, and hardware error, supported by both theoretical analysis and empirical results, highlighting its potential for reliable deployment in real-world settings.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Split Federated Learning (SFL) has emerged as an efficient alternative to traditional Federated Learning (FL) by reducing client-side computation through model partitioning. However, exchanging of intermediate activations and model updates introduces significant privacy risks, especially from data reconstruction attacks that recover original inputs from intermediate representations. Existing defenses using noise injection often degrade model performance. To overcome these challenges, we present PM-SFL, a scalable and privacy-preserving SFL framework that incorporates Probabilistic Mask training to add structured randomness without relying on explicit noise. This mitigates data reconstruction risks while maintaining model utility. To address data heterogeneity, PM-SFL employs personalized mask learning that tailors submodel structures to each client's local data. For system heterogeneity, we introduce a layer-wise knowledge compensation mechanism, enabling clients with varying resources to participate effectively under adaptive model splitting. Theoretical analysis confirms its privacy protection, and experiments on image and wireless sensing tasks demonstrate that PM-SFL consistently improves accuracy, communication efficiency, and robustness to privacy attacks, with particularly strong performance under data and system heterogeneity.

  The discovery of environmental knowledge depends on labeled task-specific data, but is often constrained by the high cost of data collection. Existing machine learning approaches usually struggle to generalize in data-sparse or atypical conditions. To this end, we propose an Augmentation-Adaptive Self-Supervised Learning (A$^2$SL) framework, which retrieves relevant observational samples to enhance modeling of the target ecosystem. Specifically, we introduce a multi-level pairwise learning loss to train a scenario encoder that captures varying degrees of similarity among scenarios. These learned similarities drive a retrieval mechanism that supplements a target scenario with relevant data from different locations or time periods. Furthermore, to better handle variable scenarios, particularly under atypical or extreme conditions where traditional models struggle, we design an augmentation-adaptive mechanism that selectively enhances these scenarios through targeted data augmentation. Using freshwater ecosystems as a case study, we evaluate A$^2$SL in modeling water temperature and dissolved oxygen dynamics in real-world lakes. Experimental results show that A$^2$SL significantly improves predictive accuracy and enhances robustness in data-scarce and atypical scenarios. Although this study focuses on freshwater ecosystems, the A$^2$SL framework offers a broadly applicable solution in various scientific domains.

  _Arjun S. Nair, Kristina P. Sinaga_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We prove a fundamental impossibility theorem: neural networks cannot simultaneously learn well-calibrated confidence estimates with meaningful diversity when trained using binary correct/incorrect supervision. Through rigorous mathematical analysis and comprehensive empirical evaluation spanning negative reward training, symmetric loss functions, and post-hoc calibration methods, we demonstrate this is an information-theoretic constraint, not a methodological failure. Our experiments reveal universal failure patterns: negative rewards produce extreme underconfidence (ECE greater than 0.8) while destroying confidence diversity (std less than 0.05), symmetric losses fail to escape binary signal averaging, and post-hoc methods achieve calibration (ECE less than 0.02) only by compressing the confidence distribution. We formalize this as an underspecified mapping problem where binary signals cannot distinguish between different confidence levels for correct predictions: a 60 percent confident correct answer receives identical supervision to a 90 percent confident one. Crucially, our real-world validation shows 100 percent failure rate for all training methods across MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR-10, while post-hoc calibration's 33 percent success rate paradoxically confirms our theorem by achieving calibration through transformation rather than learning. This impossibility directly explains neural network hallucinations and establishes why post-hoc calibration is mathematically necessary, not merely convenient. We propose novel supervision paradigms using ensemble disagreement and adaptive multi-agent learning that could overcome these fundamental limitations without requiring human confidence annotations.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Continual learning is an essential capability of human cognition, yet it poses significant challenges for current deep learning models. The primary issue is that new knowledge can interfere with previously learned information, causing the model to forget earlier knowledge in favor of the new, a phenomenon known as catastrophic forgetting. Although large pre-trained models can partially mitigate forgetting by leveraging their existing knowledge and over-parameterization, they often struggle when confronted with novel data distributions. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods, such as LoRA, enable efficient adaptation to new knowledge. However, they still face challenges in scaling to dynamic learning scenarios and long sequences of tasks, as maintaining one adapter per task introduces complexity and increases the potential for interference. In this paper, we introduce Hierarchical Adapters Merging (HAM), a novel framework that dynamically combines adapters from different tasks during training. This approach enables HAM to scale effectively, allowing it to manage more tasks than competing baselines with improved efficiency. To achieve this, HAM maintains a fixed set of groups that hierarchically consolidate new adapters. For each task, HAM trains a low-rank adapter along with an importance scalar, then dynamically groups tasks based on adapter similarity. Within each group, adapters are pruned, scaled and merge, facilitating transfer learning between related tasks. Extensive experiments on three vision benchmarks show that HAM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly as the number of tasks increases.

  Large language models (LLMs) are powerful but static; they lack mechanisms to adapt their weights in response to new tasks, knowledge, or examples. We introduce Self-Adapting LLMs (SEAL), a framework that enables LLMs to self-adapt by generating their own finetuning data and update directives. Given a new input, the model produces a self-edit-a generation that may restructure the information in different ways, specify optimization hyperparameters, or invoke tools for data augmentation and gradient-based updates. Through supervised finetuning (SFT), these self-edits result in persistent weight updates, enabling lasting adaptation. To train the model to produce effective self-edits, we use a reinforcement learning loop with the downstream performance of the updated model as the reward signal. Unlike prior approaches that rely on separate adaptation modules or auxiliary networks, SEAL directly uses the model's own generation to control its adaptation process. Experiments on knowledge incorporation and few-shot generalization show that SEAL is a promising step toward language models capable of self-directed adaptation.

  Hyperparameter Optimization (HPO) is crucial to develop well-performing machine learning models. In order to ease prototyping and benchmarking of HPO methods, we propose carps, a benchmark framework for Comprehensive Automated Research Performance Studies allowing to evaluate N optimizers on M benchmark tasks. In this first release of carps, we focus on the four most important types of HPO task types: blackbox, multi-fidelity, multi-objective and multi-fidelity-multi-objective. With 3 336 tasks from 5 community benchmark collections and 28 variants of 9 optimizer families, we offer the biggest go-to library to date to evaluate and compare HPO methods. The carps framework relies on a purpose-built, lightweight interface, gluing together optimizers and benchmark tasks. It also features an analysis pipeline, facilitating the evaluation of optimizers on benchmarks. However, navigating a huge number of tasks while developing and comparing methods can be computationally infeasible. To address this, we obtain a subset of representative tasks by minimizing the star discrepancy of the subset, in the space spanned by the full set. As a result, we propose an initial subset of 10 to 30 diverse tasks for each task type, and include functionality to re-compute subsets as more benchmarks become available, enabling efficient evaluations. We also establish a first set of baseline results on these tasks as a measure for future comparisons. With carps (this https URL), we make an important step in the standardization of HPO evaluation.

  We present heuristically optimal strategies expressed by deep learning agents playing a simple avoidance game. We analyse the learning and behaviour of two agents within a symmetrical grid world that must cross paths to reach a target destination without crashing into each other or straying off of the grid world in the wrong direction. The agent policy is determined by one neural network that is employed in both agents. Our findings indicate that the fully trained network exhibits behaviour similar to that of the game Hawks and Doves, in that one agent employs an aggressive strategy to reach the target while the other learns how to avoid the aggressive agent.

  The proliferation of sensors brings an immense volume of spatio-temporal (ST) data in many domains, including monitoring, diagnostics, and prognostics applications. Data curation is a time-consuming process for a large volume of data, making it challenging and expensive to deploy data analytics platforms in new environments. Transfer learning (TL) mechanisms promise to mitigate data sparsity and model complexity by utilizing pre-trained models for a new task. Despite the triumph of TL in fields like computer vision and natural language processing, efforts on complex ST models for anomaly detection (AD) applications are limited. In this study, we present the potential of TL within the context of high-dimensional ST AD with a hybrid autoencoder architecture, incorporating convolutional, graph, and recurrent neural networks. Motivated by the need for improved model accuracy and robustness, particularly in scenarios with limited training data on systems with thousands of sensors, this research investigates the transferability of models trained on different sections of the Hadron Calorimeter of the Compact Muon Solenoid experiment at CERN. The key contributions of the study include exploring TL's potential and limitations within the context of encoder and decoder networks, revealing insights into model initialization and training configurations that enhance performance while substantially reducing trainable parameters and mitigating data contamination effects.

  The rapid growth of graph-structured data necessitates partitioning and distributed storage across decentralized systems, driving the emergence of federated graph learning to collaboratively train Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) without compromising privacy. However, current methods exhibit limited performance when handling hypergraphs, which inherently represent complex high-order relationships beyond pairwise connections. Partitioning hypergraph structures across federated subsystems amplifies structural complexity, hindering high-order information mining and compromising local information integrity. To bridge the gap between hypergraph learning and federated systems, we develop FedHGL, a first-of-its-kind framework for federated hypergraph learning on disjoint and privacy-constrained hypergraph partitions. Beyond collaboratively training a comprehensive hypergraph neural network across multiple clients, FedHGL introduces a pre-propagation hyperedge completion mechanism to preserve high-order structural integrity within each client. This procedure leverages the federated central server to perform cross-client hypergraph convolution without exposing internal topological information, effectively mitigating the high-order information loss induced by subgraph partitioning. Furthermore, by incorporating two kinds of local differential privacy (LDP) mechanisms, we provide formal privacy guarantees for this process, ensuring that sensitive node features remain protected against inference attacks from potentially malicious servers or clients. Experimental results on seven real-world datasets confirm the effectiveness of our approach and demonstrate its performance advantages over traditional federated graph learning methods.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper presents RynnVLA-001, a vision-language-action(VLA) model built upon large-scale video generative pretraining from human demonstrations. We propose a novel two-stage pretraining methodology. The first stage, Ego-Centric Video Generative Pretraining, trains an Image-to-Video model on 12M ego-centric manipulation videos to predict future frames conditioned on an initial frame and a language instruction. The second stage, Human-Centric Trajectory-Aware Modeling, extends this by jointly predicting future keypoint trajectories, thereby effectively bridging visual frame prediction with action prediction. Furthermore, to enhance action representation, we propose ActionVAE, a variational autoencoder that compresses sequences of actions into compact latent embeddings, reducing the complexity of the VLA output space. When finetuned on the same downstream robotics datasets, RynnVLA-001 achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art baselines, demonstrating that the proposed pretraining strategy provides a more effective initialization for VLA models.

  This paper addresses the synthetic-to-real domain gap in object detection, focusing on training a YOLOv11 model to detect a specific object (a soup can) using only synthetic data and domain randomization strategies. The methodology involves extensive experimentation with data augmentation, dataset composition, and model scaling. While synthetic validation metrics were consistently high, they proved to be poor predictors of real-world performance. Consequently, models were also evaluated qualitatively, through visual inspection of predictions, and quantitatively, on a manually labeled real-world test set, to guide development. Final mAP@50 scores were provided by the official Kaggle competition. Key findings indicate that increasing synthetic dataset diversity, specifically by including varied perspectives and complex backgrounds, combined with carefully tuned data augmentation, were crucial in bridging the domain gap. The best performing configuration, a YOLOv11l model trained on an expanded and diverse dataset, achieved a final mAP@50 of 0.910 on the competition's hidden test set. This result demonstrates the potential of a synthetic-only training approach while also highlighting the remaining challenges in fully capturing real-world variability.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a popular tool for interpreting the hidden states of large language models (LLMs). By learning to reconstruct activations from a sparse bottleneck layer, SAEs discover interpretable features from the high-dimensional internal representations of LLMs. Despite their popularity with language models, SAEs remain understudied in the visual domain. In this work, we provide an extensive evaluation the representational power of SAEs for vision models using a broad range of image-based tasks. Our experimental results demonstrate that SAE features are semantically meaningful, improve out-of-distribution generalization, and enable controllable generation across three vision model architectures: vision embedding models, multi-modal LMMs and diffusion models. In vision embedding models, we find that learned SAE features can be used for OOD detection and provide evidence that they recover the ontological structure of the underlying model. For diffusion models, we demonstrate that SAEs enable semantic steering through text encoder manipulation and develop an automated pipeline for discovering human-interpretable attributes. Finally, we conduct exploratory experiments on multi-modal LLMs, finding evidence that SAE features reveal shared representations across vision and language modalities. Our study provides a foundation for SAE evaluation in vision models, highlighting their strong potential improving interpretability, generalization, and steerability in the visual domain.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Semantic segmentation models trained on synthetic data often perform poorly on real-world images due to domain gaps, particularly in adverse conditions where labeled data is scarce. Yet, recent foundation models enable to generate realistic images without any training. This paper proposes to leverage such diffusion models to improve the performance of vision models when learned on synthetic data. We introduce two novel techniques for semantically consistent style transfer using diffusion models: Class-wise Adaptive Instance Normalization and Cross-Attention (CACTI) and its extension with selective attention Filtering (CACTIF). CACTI applies statistical normalization selectively based on semantic classes, while CACTIF further filters cross-attention maps based on feature similarity, preventing artifacts in regions with weak cross-attention correspondences. Our methods transfer style characteristics while preserving semantic boundaries and structural coherence, unlike approaches that apply global transformations or generate content without constraints. Experiments using GTA5 as source and Cityscapes/ACDC as target domains show that our approach produces higher quality images with lower FID scores and better content preservation. Our work demonstrates that class-aware diffusion-based style transfer effectively bridges the synthetic-to-real domain gap even with minimal target domain data, advancing robust perception systems for challenging real-world applications.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by retrieving relevant documents from external sources to improve factual accuracy and verifiability. However, this reliance introduces new attack surfaces within the retrieval pipeline, beyond the LLM itself. While prior RAG attacks have exposed such vulnerabilities, they largely rely on manipulating user queries, which is often infeasible in practice due to fixed or protected user inputs. This narrow focus overlooks a more realistic and stealthy vector: instructional prompts, which are widely reused, publicly shared, and rarely audited. Their implicit trust makes them a compelling target for adversaries to manipulate RAG behavior covertly.We introduce a novel attack for Adversarial Instructional Prompt (AIP) that exploits adversarial instructional prompts to manipulate RAG outputs by subtly altering retrieval behavior. By shifting the attack surface to the instructional prompts, AIP reveals how trusted yet seemingly benign interface components can be weaponized to degrade system integrity. The attack is crafted to achieve three goals: (1) naturalness, to evade user detection; (2) utility, to encourage use of prompts; and (3) robustness, to remain effective across diverse query variations. We propose a diverse query generation strategy that simulates realistic linguistic variation in user queries, enabling the discovery of prompts that generalize across paraphrases and rephrasings. Building on this, a genetic algorithm-based joint optimization is developed to evolve adversarial prompts by balancing attack success, clean-task utility, and stealthiness. Experimental results show that AIP achieves up to 95.23% ASR while preserving benign functionality. These findings uncover a critical and previously overlooked vulnerability in RAG systems, emphasizing the need to reassess the shared instructional prompts.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Comparing vision language models on videos is particularly complex, as the performances is jointly determined by the model's visual representation capacity and the frame-sampling strategy used to construct the input. Current video benchmarks are suspected to suffer from substantial frame-sampling bias, as models are evaluated with different frame selection strategies. In this work, we propose the first frame-accurate benchmark of state-of-the-art small VLMs for video question-answering, evaluated under controlled frame-sampling strategies. Our results confirm the suspected bias and highlight both data-specific and task-specific behaviors of SVLMs under different frame-sampling techniques. By open-sourcing our benchmarking code, we provide the community with a reproducible and unbiased protocol for evaluating video VLMs and emphasize the need for standardized frame-sampling strategies tailored to each benchmarking dataset in future research.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The rapidly growing number of product categories in large-scale e-commerce makes accurate object identification for automated packing in warehouses substantially more difficult. As the catalog grows, intra-class variability and a long tail of rare or visually similar items increase, and when combined with diverse packaging, cluttered containers, frequent occlusion, and large viewpoint changes-these factors amplify discrepancies between query and reference images, causing sharp performance drops for methods that rely solely on 2D appearance features. Thus, we propose RoboEye, a two-stage identification framework that dynamically augments 2D semantic features with domain-adapted 3D reasoning and lightweight adapters to bridge training deployment gaps. In the first stage, we train a large vision model to extract 2D features for generating candidate rankings. A lightweight 3D-feature-awareness module then estimates 3D feature quality and predicts whether 3D re-ranking is necessary, preventing performance degradation and avoiding unnecessary computation. When invoked, the second stage uses our robot 3D retrieval transformer, comprising a 3D feature extractor that produces geometry-aware dense features and a keypoint-based matcher that computes keypoint-correspondence confidences between query and reference images instead of conventional cosine-similarity scoring. Experiments show that RoboEye improves Recall@1 by 7.1% over the prior state of the art (RoboLLM). Moreover, RoboEye operates using only RGB images, avoiding reliance on explicit 3D inputs and reducing deployment costs. The code used in this paper is publicly available at:this https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision-language-action (VLA) reasoning tasks require agents to interpret multimodal instructions, perform long-horizon planning, and act adaptively in dynamic environments. Existing approaches typically train VLA models in an end-to-end fashion, directly mapping inputs to actions without explicit reasoning, which hinders their ability to plan over multiple steps or adapt to complex task variations. In this paper, we propose ThinkAct, a dual-system framework that bridges high-level reasoning with low-level action execution via reinforced visual latent planning. ThinkAct trains a multimodal LLM to generate embodied reasoning plans guided by reinforcing action-aligned visual rewards based on goal completion and trajectory consistency. These reasoning plans are compressed into a visual plan latent that conditions a downstream action model for robust action execution on target environments. Extensive experiments on embodied reasoning and robot manipulation benchmarks demonstrate that ThinkAct enables few-shot adaptation, long-horizon planning, and self-correction behaviors in complex embodied AI tasks.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper explores the transfer of knowledge from general vision models pretrained on 2D natural images to improve 3D medical image segmentation. We focus on the semi-supervised setting, where only a few labeled 3D medical images are available, along with a large set of unlabeled images. To tackle this, we propose a model-agnostic framework that progressively distills knowledge from a 2D pretrained model to a 3D segmentation model trained from scratch. Our approach, M&N, involves iterative co-training of the two models using pseudo-masks generated by each other, along with our proposed learning rate guided sampling that adaptively adjusts the proportion of labeled and unlabeled data in each training batch to align with the models' prediction accuracy and stability, minimizing the adverse effect caused by inaccurate pseudo-masks. Extensive experiments on multiple publicly available datasets demonstrate that M&N achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming thirteen existing semi-supervised segmentation approaches under all different settings. Importantly, ablation studies show that M&N remains model-agnostic, allowing seamless integration with different architectures. This ensures its adaptability as more advanced models emerge.

  Bone health studies are crucial in medical practice for the early detection and treatment of Osteopenia and Osteoporosis. Clinicians usually make a diagnosis based on densitometry (DEXA scans) and patient history. The applications of AI in this field are ongoing research. Most successful methods rely on deep learning models that use vision alone (DEXA/X-ray imagery) and focus on prediction accuracy, while explainability is often disregarded and left to post hoc assessments of input contributions. We propose ProtoMedX, a multi-modal model that uses both DEXA scans of the lumbar spine and patient records. ProtoMedX's prototype-based architecture is explainable by design, which is crucial for medical applications, especially in the context of the upcoming EU AI Act, as it allows explicit analysis of model decisions, including incorrect ones. ProtoMedX demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in bone health classification while also providing explanations that can be visually understood by clinicians. Using a dataset of 4,160 real NHS patients, the proposed ProtoMedX achieves 87.58% accuracy in vision-only tasks and 89.8% in its multi-modal variant, both surpassing existing published methods.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  High temporal resolution is essential for capturing fine-grained details in video understanding. However, current video large language models (VLLMs) and benchmarks mostly rely on low-frame-rate sampling, such as uniform sampling or keyframe selection, discarding dense temporal information. This compromise avoids the high cost of tokenizing every frame, which otherwise leads to redundant computation and linear token growth as video length increases. While this trade-off works for slowly changing content, it fails for tasks like lecture comprehension, where information appears in nearly every frame and requires precise temporal alignment. To address this gap, we introduce Dense Video Understanding (DVU), which enables high-FPS video comprehension by reducing both tokenization time and token overhead. Existing benchmarks are also limited, as their QA pairs focus on coarse content changes. We therefore propose DIVE (Dense Information Video Evaluation), the first benchmark designed for dense temporal reasoning. To make DVU practical, we present Gated Residual Tokenization (GRT), a two-stage framework: (1) Motion-Compensated Inter-Gated Tokenization uses pixel-level motion estimation to skip static regions during tokenization, achieving sub-linear growth in token count and compute. (2) Semantic-Scene Intra-Tokenization Merging fuses tokens across static regions within a scene, further reducing redundancy while preserving dynamic semantics. Experiments on DIVE show that GRT outperforms larger VLLM baselines and scales positively with FPS. These results highlight the importance of dense temporal information and demonstrate that GRT enables efficient, scalable high-FPS video understanding.

  In recent years, the underwater image formation model has found extensive use in the generation of synthetic underwater data. Although many approaches focus on scenes primarily affected by discoloration, they often overlook the model's ability to capture the complex, distance-dependent visibility loss present in highly turbid environments. In this work, we propose an improved synthetic data generation pipeline that includes the commonly omitted forward scattering term, while also considering a nonuniform medium. Additionally, we collected the BUCKET dataset under controlled turbidity conditions to acquire real turbid footage with the corresponding reference images. Our results demonstrate qualitative improvements over the reference model, particularly under increasing turbidity, with a selection rate of 82. 5\% by survey participants.

  _Hongjun Wang, Jiyuan Chen, Zhengwei Yin, Xuan Song, Yinqiang Zheng_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Generalizable Image Super-Resolution aims to enhance model generalization capabilities under unknown degradations. To achieve this goal, the models are expected to focus only on image content-related features instead of overfitting degradations. Recently, numerous approaches such as Dropout and Feature Alignment have been proposed to suppress models' natural tendency to overfit degradations and yield promising results. Nevertheless, these works have assumed that models overfit to all degradation types (e.g., blur, noise, JPEG), while through careful investigations in this paper, we discover that models predominantly overfit to noise, largely attributable to its distinct degradation pattern compared to other degradation types. In this paper, we propose a targeted feature denoising framework, comprising noise detection and denoising modules. Our approach presents a general solution that can be seamlessly integrated with existing super-resolution models without requiring architectural modifications. Our framework demonstrates superior performance compared to previous regularization-based methods across five traditional benchmarks and datasets, encompassing both synthetic and real-world scenarios.

  Skeleton-based action recognition faces two longstanding challenges: the scarcity of labeled training samples and difficulty modeling short- and long-range temporal dependencies. To address these issues, we propose a unified framework, LSTC-MDA, which simultaneously improves temporal modeling and data diversity. We introduce a novel Long-Short Term Temporal Convolution (LSTC) module with parallel short- and long-term branches, these two feature branches are then aligned and fused adaptively using learned similarity weights to preserve critical long-range cues lost by conventional stride-2 temporal convolutions. We also extend Joint Mixing Data Augmentation (JMDA) with an Additive Mixup at the input level, diversifying training samples and restricting mixup operations to the same camera view to avoid distribution shifts. Ablation studies confirm each component contributes. LSTC-MDA achieves state-of-the-art results: 94.1% and 97.5% on NTU 60 (X-Sub and X-View), 90.4% and 92.0% on NTU 120 (X-Sub and X-Set),97.2% on NW-UCLA. Code:this https URL.

  Understanding how people read city scenes can inform design and planning. We introduce a small benchmark for testing vision-language models (VLMs) on urban perception using 100 Montreal street images, evenly split between photographs and photorealistic synthetic scenes. Twelve participants from seven community groups supplied 230 annotation forms across 30 dimensions mixing physical attributes and subjective impressions. French responses were normalized to English. We evaluated seven VLMs in a zero-shot setup with a structured prompt and deterministic parser. We use accuracy for single-choice items and Jaccard overlap for multi-label items; human agreement uses Krippendorff's alpha and pairwise Jaccard. Results suggest stronger model alignment on visible, objective properties than subjective appraisals. The top system (claude-sonnet) reaches macro 0.31 and mean Jaccard 0.48 on multi-label items. Higher human agreement coincides with better model scores. Synthetic images slightly lower scores. We release the benchmark, prompts, and harness for reproducible, uncertainty-aware evaluation in participatory urban analysis.

  Recent advancements in Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have established them as the state-of-the-art method for video generation. However, their inherently sequential denoising process results in inevitable latency, limiting real-world applicability. Existing acceleration methods either compromise visual quality due to architectural modifications or fail to reuse intermediate features at proper granularity. Our analysis reveals that DiT blocks are the primary contributors to inference latency. Across diffusion timesteps, the feature variations of DiT blocks exhibit a U-shaped pattern with high similarity during intermediate timesteps, which suggests substantial computational redundancy. In this paper, we propose Block-Wise Caching (BWCache), a training-free method to accelerate DiT-based video generation. BWCache dynamically caches and reuses features from DiT blocks across diffusion timesteps. Furthermore, we introduce a similarity indicator that triggers feature reuse only when the differences between block features at adjacent timesteps fall below a threshold, thereby minimizing redundant computations while maintaining visual fidelity. Extensive experiments on several video diffusion models demonstrate that BWCache achieves up to 2.24$\times$ speedup with comparable visual quality.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Ensuring reliable model performance across diverse domains is a critical challenge in computational pathology. A particular source of variability in Whole-Slide Images is introduced by differences in digital scanners, thus calling for better scanner generalization. This is critical for the real-world adoption of computational pathology, where the scanning devices may differ per institution or hospital, and the model should not be dependent on scanner-induced details, which can ultimately affect the patient's diagnosis and treatment planning. However, past efforts have primarily focused on standard domain generalization settings, evaluating on unseen scanners during training, without directly evaluating consistency across scanners for the same tissue. To overcome this limitation, we introduce SCORPION, a new dataset explicitly designed to evaluate model reliability under scanner variability. SCORPION includes 480 tissue samples, each scanned with 5 scanners, yielding 2,400 spatially aligned patches. This scanner-paired design allows for the isolation of scanner-induced variability, enabling a rigorous evaluation of model consistency while controlling for differences in tissue composition. Furthermore, we propose SimCons, a flexible framework that combines augmentation-based domain generalization techniques with a consistency loss to explicitly address scanner generalization. We empirically show that SimCons improves model consistency on varying scanners without compromising task-specific performance. By releasing the SCORPION dataset and proposing SimCons, we provide the research community with a crucial resource for evaluating and improving model consistency across diverse scanners, setting a new standard for reliability testing.

Specifically, we apply this approach to breast imaging analysis and release T-SYNTH, a large-scale open-source dataset of paired 2D digital mammography (DM) and 3D digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) images. Our initial experimental results indicate that T-SYNTH images show promise for augmenting limited real patient datasets for detection tasks in DM and DBT.

  Medical Vision-Language Models (Med-VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across diverse medical imaging tasks by leveraging large-scale image-text pretraining. However, their confidence calibration is largely unexplored, and so remains a significant challenge. As such, miscalibrated predictions can lead to overconfident errors, undermining clinical trust and decision-making reliability. To address this, we introduce CalibPrompt, the first framework to calibrate Med-VLMs during prompt tuning. CalibPrompt optimizes a small set of learnable prompts with carefully designed calibration objectives under scarce labeled data regime. First, we study a regularizer that attempts to align the smoothed accuracy with the predicted model confidences. Second, we introduce an angular separation loss to maximize textual feature proximity toward improving the reliability in confidence estimates of multimodal Med-VLMs. Extensive experiments on four publicly available Med-VLMs and five diverse medical imaging datasets reveal that CalibPrompt consistently improves calibration without drastically affecting clean accuracy.

  Event cameras capture sparse, high-temporal-resolution visual information, making them particularly suitable for challenging environments with high-speed motion and strongly varying lighting conditions. However, the lack of large datasets with dense ground-truth depth annotations hinders learning-based monocular depth estimation from event data. To address this limitation, we propose a cross-modal distillation paradigm to generate dense proxy labels leveraging a Vision Foundation Model (VFM). Our strategy requires an event stream spatially aligned with RGB frames, a simple setup even available off-the-shelf, and exploits the robustness of large-scale VFMs. Additionally, we propose to adapt VFMs, either a vanilla one like Depth Anything v2 (DAv2), or deriving from it a novel recurrent architecture to infer depth from monocular event cameras. We evaluate our approach with synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating that i) our cross-modal paradigm achieves competitive performance compared to fully supervised methods without requiring expensive depth annotations, and ii) our VFM-based models achieve state-of-the-art performance.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  To reconstruct the 3D geometry from calibrated images, learning-based multi-view stereo (MVS) methods typically perform multi-view depth estimation and then fuse depth maps into a mesh or point cloud. To improve the computational efficiency, many methods initialize a coarse depth map and then gradually refine it in higher resolutions. Recently, diffusion models achieve great success in generation tasks. Starting from a random noise, diffusion models gradually recover the sample with an iterative denoising process. In this paper, we propose a novel MVS framework, which introduces diffusion models in MVS. Specifically, we formulate depth refinement as a conditional diffusion process. Considering the discriminative characteristic of depth estimation, we design a condition encoder to guide the diffusion process. To improve efficiency, we propose a novel diffusion network combining lightweight 2D U-Net and convolutional GRU. Moreover, we propose a novel confidence-based sampling strategy to adaptively sample depth hypotheses based on the confidence estimated by diffusion model. Based on our novel MVS framework, we propose two novel MVS methods, DiffMVS and CasDiffMVS. DiffMVS achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art efficiency in run-time and GPU memory. CasDiffMVS achieves state-of-the-art performance on DTU, Tanks & Temples and ETH3D. Code is available at:this https URL.

  Accurate maize seedling detection is crucial for precision agriculture, yet curated datasets remain scarce. We introduce MSDD, a high-quality aerial image dataset for maize seedling stand counting, with applications in early-season crop monitoring, yield prediction, and in-field management. Stand counting determines how many plants germinated, guiding timely decisions such as replanting or adjusting inputs. Traditional methods are labor-intensive and error-prone, while computer vision enables efficient, accurate detection. MSDD contains three classes-single, double, and triple plants-capturing diverse growth stages, planting setups, soil types, lighting conditions, camera angles, and densities, ensuring robustness for real-world use. Benchmarking shows detection is most reliable during V4-V6 stages and under nadir views. Among tested models, YOLO11 is fastest, while YOLOv9 yields the highest accuracy for single plants. Single plant detection achieves precision up to 0.984 and recall up to 0.873, but detecting doubles and triples remains difficult due to rarity and irregular appearance, often from planting errors. Class imbalance further reduces accuracy in multi-plant detection. Despite these challenges, YOLO11 maintains efficient inference at 35 ms per image, with an additional 120 ms for saving outputs. MSDD establishes a strong foundation for developing models that enhance stand counting, optimize resource allocation, and support real-time decision-making. This dataset marks a step toward automating agricultural monitoring and advancing precision agriculture.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Spatio-temporal video grounding (STVG) aims at localizing the spatio-temporal tube of a video, as specified by the input text query. In this paper, we utilize multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to explore a zero-shot solution in STVG. We reveal two key insights about MLLMs: (1) MLLMs tend to dynamically assign special tokens, referred to as \textit{grounding tokens}, for grounding the text query; and (2) MLLMs often suffer from suboptimal grounding due to the inability to fully integrate the cues in the text query (\textit{e.g.}, attributes, actions) for inference. Based on these insights, we propose a MLLM-based zero-shot framework for STVG, which includes novel decomposed spatio-temporal highlighting (DSTH) and temporal-augmented assembling (TAS) strategies to unleash the reasoning ability of MLLMs. The DSTH strategy first decouples the original query into attribute and action sub-queries for inquiring the existence of the target both spatially and temporally. It then uses a novel logit-guided re-attention (LRA) module to learn latent variables as spatial and temporal prompts, by regularizing token predictions for each sub-query. These prompts highlight attribute and action cues, respectively, directing the model's attention to reliable spatial and temporal related visual regions. In addition, as the spatial grounding by the attribute sub-query should be temporally consistent, we introduce the TAS strategy to assemble the predictions using the original video frames and the temporal-augmented frames as inputs to help improve temporal consistency. We evaluate our method on various MLLMs, and show that it outperforms SOTA methods on three common STVG benchmarks.The code will be available atthis https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The age gap in kinship verification addresses the time difference between the photos of the parent and the child. Moreover, their same-age photos are often unavailable, and face aging models are racially biased, which impacts the likeness of photos. Therefore, we propose a face aging GAN model, RA-GAN, consisting of two new modules, RACEpSp and a feature mixer, to produce racially unbiased images. The unbiased synthesized photos are used in kinship verification to investigate the results of verifying same-age parent-child images. The experiments demonstrate that our RA-GAN outperforms SAM-GAN on an average of 13.14\% across all age groups, and CUSP-GAN in the 60+ age group by 9.1\% in terms of racial accuracy. Moreover, RA-GAN can preserve subjects' identities better than SAM-GAN and CUSP-GAN across all age groups. Additionally, we demonstrate that transforming parent and child images from the KinFaceW-I and KinFaceW-II datasets to the same age can enhance the verification accuracy across all age groups. The accuracy increases with our RA-GAN for the kinship relationships of father-son and father-daughter, mother-son, and mother-daughter, which are 5.22, 5.12, 1.63, and 0.41, respectively, on KinFaceW-I. Additionally, the accuracy for the relationships of father-daughter, father-son, and mother-son is 2.9, 0.39, and 1.6 on KinFaceW-II, respectively.

  Ensuring factual consistency and reliable reasoning remains a critical challenge for medical vision-language models. We introduce MEDFACT-R1, a two-stage framework that integrates external knowledge grounding with reinforcement learning to improve the factual medical reasoning. The first stage uses pseudo-label supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to incorporate external factual expertise; while the second stage applies Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with four tailored factual reward signals to encourage self-consistent reasoning. Across three public medical QA benchmarks, MEDFACT-R1 delivers up to 22.5% absolute improvement in factual accuracy over previous state-of-the-art methods. Ablation studies highlight the necessity of pseudo-label SFT cold start and validate the contribution of each GRPO reward, underscoring the synergy between knowledge grounding and RL-driven reasoning for trustworthy medical AI.

  _Fang Li, Hao Zhang, Narendra Ahuja_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Although COLMAP has long remained the predominant method for camera parameter optimization in static scenes, it is constrained by its lengthy runtime and reliance on ground truth (GT) motion masks for application to dynamic scenes. Many efforts attempted to improve it by incorporating more priors as supervision such as GT focal length, motion masks, 3D point clouds, camera poses, and metric depth, which, however, are typically unavailable in casually captured RGB videos. In this paper, we propose a novel method for more accurate and efficient camera parameter optimization in dynamic scenes solely supervised by a single RGB video. Our method consists of three key components: (1) Patch-wise Tracking Filters, to establish robust and maximally sparse hinge-like relations across the RGB video. (2) Outlier-aware Joint Optimization, for efficient camera parameter optimization by adaptive down-weighting of moving outliers, without reliance on motion priors. (3) A Two-stage Optimization Strategy, to enhance stability and optimization speed by a trade-off between the Softplus limits and convex minima in losses. We visually and numerically evaluate our camera estimates. To further validate accuracy, we feed the camera estimates into a 4D reconstruction method and assess the resulting 3D scenes, and rendered 2D RGB and depth maps. We perform experiments on 4 real-world datasets (NeRF-DS, DAVIS, iPhone, and TUM-dynamics) and 1 synthetic dataset (MPI-Sintel), demonstrating that our method estimates camera parameters more efficiently and accurately with a single RGB video as the only supervision.

  This study evaluates publicly available deep-learning based lung segmentation models in transplant-eligible patients to determine their performance across disease severity levels, pathology categories, and lung sides, and to identify limitations impacting their use in preoperative planning in lung transplantation. This retrospective study included 32 patients who underwent chest CT scans at Duke University Health System between 2017 and 2019 (total of 3,645 2D axial slices). Patients with standard axial CT scans were selected based on the presence of two or more lung pathologies of varying severity. Lung segmentation was performed using three previously developed deep learning models: Unet-R231, TotalSegmentator, MedSAM. Performance was assessed using quantitative metrics (volumetric similarity, Dice similarity coefficient, Hausdorff distance) and a qualitative measure (four-point clinical acceptability scale). Unet-R231 consistently outperformed TotalSegmentator and MedSAM in general, for different severity levels, and pathology categories (p<0.05). All models showed significant performance declines from mild to moderate-to-severe cases, particularly in volumetric similarity (p<0.05), without significant differences among lung sides or pathology types. Unet-R231 provided the most accurate automated lung segmentation among evaluated models with TotalSegmentator being a close second, though their performance declined significantly in moderate-to-severe cases, emphasizing the need for specialized model fine-tuning in severe pathology contexts.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in diffusion models have revolutionized text-guided image editing, yet existing editing methods face critical challenges in hyperparameter identification. To get the reasonable editing performance, these methods often require the user to brute-force tune multiple interdependent hyperparameters, such as inversion timesteps and attention modification, \textit{etc.} This process incurs high computational costs due to the huge hyperparameter search space. We consider searching optimal editing's hyperparameters as a sequential decision-making task within the diffusion denoising process. Specifically, we propose a reinforcement learning framework, which establishes a Markov Decision Process that dynamically adjusts hyperparameters across denoising steps, integrating editing objectives into a reward function. The method achieves time efficiency through proximal policy optimization while maintaining optimal hyperparameter configurations. Experiments demonstrate significant reduction in search time and computational overhead compared to existing brute-force approaches, advancing the practical deployment of a diffusion-based image editing framework in the real world.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Accurate brain tumor segmentation is essential for preoperative evaluation and personalized treatment. Multi-modal MRI is widely used due to its ability to capture complementary tumor features across different sequences. However, in clinical practice, missing modalities are common, limiting the robustness and generalizability of existing deep learning methods that rely on complete inputs, especially under non-dominant modality combinations. To address this, we propose AdaMM, a multi-modal brain tumor segmentation framework tailored for missing-modality scenarios, centered on knowledge distillation and composed of three synergistic modules. The Graph-guided Adaptive Refinement Module explicitly models semantic associations between generalizable and modality-specific features, enhancing adaptability to modality absence. The Bi-Bottleneck Distillation Module transfers structural and textural knowledge from teacher to student models via global style matching and adversarial feature alignment. The Lesion-Presence-Guided Reliability Module predicts prior probabilities of lesion types through an auxiliary classification task, effectively suppressing false positives under incomplete inputs. Extensive experiments on the BraTS 2018 and 2024 datasets demonstrate that AdaMM consistently outperforms existing methods, exhibiting superior segmentation accuracy and robustness, particularly in single-modality and weak-modality configurations. In addition, we conduct a systematic evaluation of six categories of missing-modality strategies, confirming the superiority of knowledge distillation and offering practical guidance for method selection and future research.

  Ultrasound imaging has become the preferred imaging modality for early cancer screening due to its advantages of non-ionizing radiation, low cost, and real-time imaging capabilities. However, conventional ultrasound diagnosis heavily relies on physician expertise, presenting challenges of high subjectivity and low diagnostic efficiency. Vision-language models (VLMs) offer promising solutions for this issue, but existing general-purpose models demonstrate limited knowledge in ultrasound medical tasks, with poor generalization in multi-organ lesion recognition and low efficiency across multi-task diagnostics. To address these limitations, we propose EchoVLM, a vision-language model specifically designed for ultrasound medical imaging. The model employs a Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture trained on data spanning seven anatomical regions. This design enables the model to perform multiple tasks, including ultrasound report generation, diagnosis and visual question-answering (VQA). The experimental results demonstrated that EchoVLM achieved significant improvements of 10.15 and 4.77 points in BLEU-1 scores and ROUGE-1 scores respectively compared to Qwen2-VL on the ultrasound report generation task. These findings suggest that EchoVLM has substantial potential to enhance diagnostic accuracy in ultrasound imaging, thereby providing a viable technical solution for future clinical applications.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Existing rotation-invariant point cloud masked autoencoders (MAE) rely on random masking strategies that overlook geometric structure and semantic coherence. Random masking treats patches independently, failing to capture spatial relationships consistent across orientations and overlooking semantic object parts that maintain identity regardless of rotation. We propose a dual-stream masking approach combining 3D Spatial Grid Masking and Progressive Semantic Masking to address these fundamental limitations. Grid masking creates structured patterns through coordinate sorting to capture geometric relationships that persist across different orientations, while semantic masking uses attention-driven clustering to discover semantically meaningful parts and maintain their coherence during masking. These complementary streams are orchestrated via curriculum learning with dynamic weighting, progressing from geometric understanding to semantic discovery. Designed as plug-and-play components, our strategies integrate into existing rotation-invariant frameworks without architectural changes, ensuring broad compatibility across different approaches. Comprehensive experiments on ModelNet40, ScanObjectNN, and OmniObject3D demonstrate consistent improvements across various rotation scenarios, showing substantial performance gains over the baseline rotation-invariant methods.

  The rapid growth of 3D digital content necessitates expandable recognition systems for open-world scenarios. However, existing 3D class-incremental learning methods struggle under extreme data scarcity due to geometric misalignment and texture bias. While recent approaches integrate 3D data with 2D foundation models (e.g., CLIP), they suffer from semantic blurring caused by texture-biased projections and indiscriminate fusion of geometric-textural cues, leading to unstable decision prototypes and catastrophic forgetting. To address these issues, we propose Cross-Modal Geometric Rectification (CMGR), a framework that enhances 3D geometric fidelity by leveraging CLIP's hierarchical spatial semantics. Specifically, we introduce a Structure-Aware Geometric Rectification module that hierarchically aligns 3D part structures with CLIP's intermediate spatial priors through attention-driven geometric fusion. Additionally, a Texture Amplification Module synthesizes minimal yet discriminative textures to suppress noise and reinforce cross-modal consistency. To further stabilize incremental prototypes, we employ a Base-Novel Discriminator that isolates geometric variations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly improves 3D few-shot class-incremental learning, achieving superior geometric coherence and robustness to texture bias across cross-domain and within-domain settings.

  With the increasing prevalence of synthetic images, evaluating image authenticity and locating forgeries accurately while maintaining human interpretability remains a challenging task. Existing detection models primarily focus on simple authenticity classification, ultimately providing only a forgery probability or binary judgment, which offers limited explanatory insights into image authenticity. Moreover, while MLLM-based detection methods can provide more interpretable results, they still lag behind expert models in terms of pure authenticity classification accuracy. To address this, we propose DF-LLaVA, a simple yet effective framework that unlocks the intrinsic discrimination potential of MLLMs. Our approach first extracts latent knowledge from MLLMs and then injects it into training via prompts. This framework allows LLaVA to achieve outstanding detection accuracy exceeding expert models while still maintaining the interpretability offered by MLLMs. Extensive experiments confirm the superiority of our DF-LLaVA, achieving both high accuracy and explainability in synthetic image detection.

  Finding smell references in historic artworks is a challenging problem. Beyond artwork-specific challenges such as stylistic variations, their recognition demands exceptionally detailed annotation classes, resulting in annotation sparsity and extreme class imbalance. In this work, we explore the potential of synthetic data generation to alleviate these issues and enable accurate detection of smell-related objects. We evaluate several diffusion-based augmentation strategies and demonstrate that incorporating synthetic data into model training can improve detection performance. Our findings suggest that leveraging the large-scale pretraining of diffusion models offers a promising approach for improving detection accuracy, particularly in niche applications where annotations are scarce and costly to obtain. Furthermore, the proposed approach proves to be effective even with relatively small amounts of data, and scaling it up provides high potential for further enhancements.

  Automatic colorization of line drawings has been widely studied to reduce the labor cost of hand-drawn anime production. Deep learning approaches, including image/video generation and feature-based correspondence, have improved accuracy but struggle with occlusions, pose variations, and viewpoint changes. To address these challenges, we propose DACoN, a framework that leverages foundation models to capture part-level semantics, even in line drawings. Our method fuses low-resolution semantic features from foundation models with high-resolution spatial features from CNNs for fine-grained yet robust feature extraction. In contrast to previous methods that rely on the Multiplex Transformer and support only one or two reference images, DACoN removes this constraint, allowing any number of references. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate the benefits of using multiple reference images, achieving superior colorization performance. Our code and model are available atthis https URL.

  In this study, we consider the problem of generating visual explanations in visual foundation models. Numerous methods have been proposed for this purpose; however, they often cannot be applied to complex models due to their lack of adaptability. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel explanation generation method in visual foundation models that is aimed at both generating explanations and partially updating model parameters to enhance interpretability. Our approach introduces two novel mechanisms: Attention Lattice Adapter (ALA) and Alternating Epoch Architect (AEA). ALA mechanism simplifies the process by eliminating the need for manual layer selection, thus enhancing the model's adaptability and interpretability. Moreover, the AEA mechanism, which updates ALA's parameters every other epoch, effectively addresses the common issue of overly small attention regions. We evaluated our method on two benchmark datasets, CUB-200-2011 and ImageNet-S. Our results showed that our method outperformed the baseline methods in terms of mean intersection over union (IoU), insertion score, deletion score, and insertion-deletion score on both the CUB-200-2011 and ImageNet-S datasets. Notably, our best model achieved a 53.2-point improvement in mean IoU on the CUB-200-2011 dataset compared with the baselines.

  Current instruction-based image editing (IBIE) methods struggle with challenging editing tasks, as both editing types and sample counts of existing datasets are limited. Moreover, traditional dataset construction often contains noisy image-caption pairs, which may introduce biases and limit model capabilities in complex editing scenarios. To address these limitations, we introduce MultiEdit, a comprehensive dataset featuring over 107K high-quality image editing samples. It encompasses 6 challenging editing tasks through a diverse collection of 18 non-style-transfer editing types and 38 style transfer operations, covering a spectrum from sophisticated style transfer to complex semantic operations like person reference editing and in-image text editing. We employ a novel dataset construction pipeline that utilizes two multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) to generate visual-adaptive editing instructions and produce high-fidelity edited images, respectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that fine-tuning foundational open-source models with our MultiEdit-Train set substantially improves models' performance on sophisticated editing tasks in our proposed MultiEdit-Test benchmark, while effectively preserving their capabilities on the standard editing benchmark. We believe MultiEdit provides a valuable resource for advancing research into more diverse and challenging IBIE capabilities. Our dataset is available atthis https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Accurate visual localization is crucial for autonomous driving, yet existing methods face a fundamental dilemma: While high-definition (HD) maps provide high-precision localization references, their costly construction and maintenance hinder scalability, which drives research toward standard-definition (SD) maps like OpenStreetMap. Current SD-map-based approaches primarily focus on Bird's-Eye View (BEV) matching between images and maps, overlooking a ubiquitous signal-noisy GPS. Although GPS is readily available, it suffers from multipath errors in urban environments. We propose DiffVL, the first framework to reformulate visual localization as a GPS denoising task using diffusion models. Our key insight is that noisy GPS trajectory, when conditioned on visual BEV features and SD maps, implicitly encode the true pose distribution, which can be recovered through iterative diffusion refinement. DiffVL, unlike prior BEV-matching methods (e.g., OrienterNet) or transformer-based registration approaches, learns to reverse GPS noise perturbations by jointly modeling GPS, SD map, and visual signals, achieving sub-meter accuracy without relying on HD maps. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy compared to BEV-matching baselines. Crucially, our work proves that diffusion models can enable scalable localization by treating noisy GPS as a generative prior-making a paradigm shift from traditional matching-based methods.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Zero-Shot Anomaly Detection (ZSAD) seeks to identify anomalies from arbitrary novel categories, offering a scalable and annotation-efficient solution. Traditionally, most ZSAD works have been based on the CLIP model, which performs anomaly detection by calculating the similarity between visual and text embeddings. Recently, vision foundation models such as DINOv3 have demonstrated strong transferable representation capabilities. In this work, we are the first to adapt DINOv3 for ZSAD. However, this adaptation presents two key challenges: (i) the domain bias between large-scale pretraining data and anomaly detection tasks leads to feature misalignment; and (ii) the inherent bias toward global semantics in pretrained representations often leads to subtle anomalies being misinterpreted as part of the normal foreground objects, rather than being distinguished as abnormal regions. To overcome these challenges, we introduce AD-DINOv3, a novel vision-language multimodal framework designed for ZSAD. Specifically, we formulate anomaly detection as a multimodal contrastive learning problem, where DINOv3 is employed as the visual backbone to extract patch tokens and a CLS token, and the CLIP text encoder provides embeddings for both normal and abnormal prompts. To bridge the domain gap, lightweight adapters are introduced in both modalities, enabling their representations to be recalibrated for the anomaly detection task. Beyond this baseline alignment, we further design an Anomaly-Aware Calibration Module (AACM), which explicitly guides the CLS token to attend to anomalous regions rather than generic foreground semantics, thereby enhancing discriminability. Extensive experiments on eight industrial and medical benchmarks demonstrate that AD-DINOv3 consistently matches or surpasses state-of-the-artthis http URLcode will be available atthis https URL.

  While specialized detectors for AI-generated images excel on curated benchmarks, they fail catastrophically in real-world scenarios, as evidenced by their critically high false-negative rates on `in-the-wild' benchmarks. Instead of crafting another specialized `knife' for this problem, we bring a `gun' to the fight: a simple linear classifier on a modern Vision Foundation Model (VFM). Trained on identical data, this baseline decisively `outguns' bespoke detectors, boosting in-the-wild accuracy by a striking margin of over 20\%.Our analysis pinpoints the source of the VFM's `firepower': First, by probing text-image similarities, we find that recent VLMs (e.g., Perception Encoder, Meta CLIP2) have learned to align synthetic images with forgery-related concepts (e.g., `AI-generated'), unlike previous versions. Second, we speculate that this is due to data exposure, as both this alignment and overall accuracy plummet on a novel dataset scraped after the VFM's pre-training cut-off date, ensuring it was unseen during pre-training. Our findings yield two critical conclusions: 1) For the real-world `gunfight' of AI-generated image detection, the raw `firepower' of an updated VFM is far more effective than the `craftsmanship' of a static detector. 2) True generalization evaluation requires test data to be independent of the model's entire training history, including pre-training.

  Humans can recognize the same actions despite large context and viewpoint variations, such as differences between species (walking in spiders vs. horses), viewpoints (egocentric vs. third-person), and contexts (real life vs movies). Current deep learning models struggle with such generalization. We propose using features generated by a Vision Diffusion Model (VDM), aggregated via a transformer, to achieve human-like action recognition across these challenging conditions. We find that generalization is enhanced by the use of a model conditioned on earlier timesteps of the diffusion process to highlight semantic information over pixel level details in the extracted features. We experimentally explore the generalization properties of our approach in classifying actions across animal species, across different viewing angles, and different recording contexts. Our model sets a new state-of-the-art across all three generalization benchmarks, bringing machine action recognition closer to human-like robustness.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Subject-driven image generation (SDIG) aims to manipulate specific subjects within images while adhering to textual instructions, a task crucial for advancing text-to-image diffusion models. SDIG requires reconciling the tension between maintaining subject identity and complying with dynamic edit instructions, a challenge inadequately addressed by existing methods. In this paper, we introduce the Target-Instructed Diffusion Enhancing (TIDE) framework, which resolves this tension through target supervision and preference learning without test-time fine-tuning. TIDE pioneers target-supervised triplet alignment, modelling subject adaptation dynamics using a (reference image, instruction, target images) triplet. This approach leverages the Direct Subject Diffusion (DSD) objective, training the model with paired "winning" (balanced preservation-compliance) and "losing" (distorted) targets, systematically generated and evaluated via quantitative metrics. This enables implicit reward modelling for optimal preservation-compliance balance. Experimental results on standard benchmarks demonstrate TIDE's superior performance in generating subject-faithful outputs while maintaining instruction compliance, outperforming baseline methods across multiple quantitative metrics. TIDE's versatility is further evidenced by its successful application to diverse tasks, including structural-conditioned generation, image-to-image generation, and text-image interpolation.

  _Lirong Zheng, Yanshan Li, Rui Yu, Kaihao Zhang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Transformer-based models exhibit strong global modeling capabilities in single-image dehazing, but their high computational cost limits real-time applicability. Existing methods predominantly rely on spatial-domain features to capture long-range dependencies, which are computationally expensive and often inadequate under complex haze conditions. While some approaches introduce frequency-domain cues, the weak coupling between spatial and frequency branches limits the overall performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose the Dark Channel Guided Frequency-aware Dehazing Network (DGFDNet), a novel dual-domain framework that performs physically guided degradation alignment across spatial and frequency domains. At its core, the DGFDBlock comprises two key modules: 1) the Haze-Aware Frequency Modulator (HAFM), which generates a pixel-level haze confidence map from dark channel priors to adaptively enhance haze-relevant frequency components, thereby achieving global degradation-aware spectral modulation; 2) the Multi-level Gating Aggregation Module (MGAM), which fuses multi-scale features through diverse convolutional kernels and hybrid gating mechanisms to recover fine structural details. Additionally, a Prior Correction Guidance Branch (PCGB) incorporates a closed-loop feedback mechanism, enabling iterative refinement of the prior by intermediate dehazed features and significantly improving haze localization accuracy, especially in challenging outdoor scenes. Extensive experiments on four benchmark haze datasets demonstrate that DGFDNet achieves state-of-the-art performance with superior robustness and real-time efficiency.

  _Maoxiao Ye, Xinfeng Ye, Mano Manoharan_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Earlier Sign Language Production (SLP) models typically relied on autoregressive methods that generate output tokens one by one, which inherently provide temporal alignment. Although techniques like Teacher Forcing can prevent model collapse during training, they still cannot solve the problem of error accumulation during inference, since ground truth is unavailable at that stage. In contrast, more recent approaches based on diffusion models leverage step-by-step denoising to enable high-quality generation. However, the iterative nature of these models and the requirement to denoise entire sequences limit their applicability in real-time tasks like SLP. To address it, we explore a hybrid approach that combines autoregressive and diffusion models for SLP, leveraging the strengths of both models in sequential dependency modeling and output refinement. To capture fine-grained body movements, we design a Multi-Scale Pose Representation module that separately extracts detailed features from distinct articulators and integrates them via a Multi-Scale Fusion module. Furthermore, we introduce a Confidence-Aware Causal Attention mechanism that utilizes joint-level confidence scores to dynamically guide the pose generation process, improving accuracy and robustness. Extensive experiments on the PHOENIX14T and How2Sign datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in both generation quality and real-time efficiency.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Driving scenes are inherently heterogeneous and dynamic. Multi-attribute scene identification, as a high-level visual perception capability, provides autonomous vehicles (AVs) with essential contextual awareness to understand, reason through, and interact with complex driving environments. Although scene identification is best modeled as a multi-label classification problem via multitask learning, it faces two major challenges: the difficulty of acquiring balanced, comprehensively annotated datasets and the need to re-annotate all training data when new attributes emerge. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a novel deep learning method that integrates Knowledge Acquisition and Accumulation (KAA) with Consistency-based Active Learning (CAL). KAA leverages monotask learning on heterogeneous single-label datasets to build a knowledge foundation, while CAL bridges the gap between single- and multi-label data, adapting the foundation model for multi-label scene classification. An ablation study on the newly developed Driving Scene Identification (DSI) dataset demonstrates a 56.1% improvement over an ImageNet-pretrained baseline. Moreover, KAA-CAL outperforms state-of-the-art multi-label classification methods on the BDD100K and HSD datasets, achieving this with 85% less data and even recognizing attributes unseen during foundation model training. The DSI dataset and KAA-CAL implementation code are publicly available atthis https URL.

  _Jianhan Qi, Yuheng Jia, Hui Liu, Junhui Hou_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Hyperspectral image (HSI) clustering assigns similar pixels to the same class without any annotations, which is an important yet challenging task. For large-scale HSIs, most methods rely on superpixel segmentation and perform superpixel-level clustering based on graph neural networks (GNNs). However, existing GNNs cannot fully exploit the spectral information of the input HSI, and the inaccurate superpixel topological graph may lead to the confusion of different class semantics during information aggregation. To address these challenges, we first propose a structural-spectral graph convolutional operator (SSGCO) tailored for graph-structured HSI superpixels to improve their representation quality through the co-extraction of spatial and spectral features. Second, we propose an evidence-guided adaptive edge learning (EGAEL) module that adaptively predicts and refines edge weights in the superpixel topological graph. We integrate the proposed method into a contrastive learning framework to achieve clustering, where representation learning and clustering are simultaneously conducted. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method improves clustering accuracy by 2.61%, 6.06%, 4.96% and 3.15% over the best compared methods on four HSI datasets.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Lip synchronization is the task of aligning a speaker's lip movements in video with corresponding speech audio, and it is essential for creating realistic, expressive video content. However, existing methods often rely on reference frames and masked-frame inpainting, which limit their robustness to identity consistency, pose variations, facial occlusions, and stylized content. In addition, since audio signals provide weaker conditioning than visual cues, lip shape leakage from the original video will affect lip sync quality. In this paper, we present OmniSync, a universal lip synchronization framework for diverse visual scenarios. Our approach introduces a mask-free training paradigm using Diffusion Transformer models for direct frame editing without explicit masks, enabling unlimited-duration inference while maintaining natural facial dynamics and preserving character identity. During inference, we propose a flow-matching-based progressive noise initialization to ensure pose and identity consistency, while allowing precise mouth-region editing. To address the weak conditioning signal of audio, we develop a Dynamic Spatiotemporal Classifier-Free Guidance (DS-CFG) mechanism that adaptively adjusts guidance strength over time and space. We also establish the AIGC-LipSync Benchmark, the first evaluation suite for lip synchronization in diverse AI-generated videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OmniSync significantly outperforms prior methods in both visual quality and lip sync accuracy, achieving superior results in both real-world and AI-generated videos.

  _Guillaume Vray, Devavrat Tomar, Xufeng Gao, Jean-Philippe Thiran, Evan Shelhamer, Behzad Bozorgtabar_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper introduces ReservoirTTA, a novel plug-in framework designed for prolonged test-time adaptation (TTA) in scenarios where the test domain continuously shifts over time, including cases where domains recur or evolve gradually. At its core, ReservoirTTA maintains a reservoir of domain-specialized models -- an adaptive test-time model ensemble -- that both detects new domains via online clustering over style features of incoming samples and routes each sample to the appropriate specialized model, and thereby enables domain-specific adaptation. This multi-model strategy overcomes key limitations of single model adaptation, such as catastrophic forgetting, inter-domain interference, and error accumulation, ensuring robust and stable performance on sustained non-stationary test distributions. Our theoretical analysis reveals key components that bound parameter variance and prevent model collapse, while our plug-in TTA module mitigates catastrophic forgetting of previously encountered domains. Extensive experiments on scene-level corruption benchmarks (ImageNet-C, CIFAR-10/100-C), object-level style shifts (DomainNet-126, PACS), and semantic segmentation (Cityscapes->ACDC) covering recurring and continuously evolving domain shifts -- show that ReservoirTTA substantially improves adaptation accuracy and maintains stable performance across prolonged, recurring shifts, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Image aesthetic assessment (IAA) evaluates image aesthetics, a task complicated by image diversity and user subjectivity. Current approaches address this in two stages: Generic IAA (GIAA) models estimate mean aesthetic scores, while Personal IAA (PIAA) models adapt GIAA using transfer learning to incorporate user subjectivity. However, a theoretical understanding of transfer learning between GIAA and PIAA, particularly concerning the impact of group composition, group size, aesthetic differences between groups and individuals, and demographic correlations, is lacking. This work establishes a theoretical foundation for IAA, proposing a unified model that encodes individual characteristics in a distributional format for both individual and group assessments. We show that transferring from GIAA to PIAA involves extrapolation, while the reverse involves interpolation, which is generally more effective for machine learning. Extensive experiments with varying group compositions, including sub-sampling by group size and disjoint demographics, reveal substantial performance variation even for GIAA, challenging the assumption that averaging scores eliminates individual subjectivity. Score-distribution analysis using Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) and the Gini index identifies education, photography experience, and art experience as key factors in aesthetic differences, with greater subjectivity in artworks than in photographs.

  Radio map reconstruction is essential for enabling advanced applications, yet challenges such as complex signal propagation and sparse observational data hinder accurate reconstruction in practical scenarios. Existing methods often fail to align physical constraints with data-driven features, particularly under sparse measurement conditions. To address these issues, we propose **Phy**sics-Aligned **R**adio **M**ap **D**iffusion **M**odel (**PhyRMDM**), a novel framework that establishes cross-domain representation alignment between physical principles and neural network features through dual learning pathways. The proposed model integrates **Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)** with a **representation alignment mechanism** that explicitly enforces consistency between Helmholtz equation constraints and environmental propagation patterns. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods, achieving **NMSE of 0.0031** under *Static Radio Map (SRM)* conditions, and **NMSE of 0.0047** with **Dynamic Radio Map (DRM)** scenarios. The proposed representation alignment paradigm provides **37.2%** accuracy enhancement in ultra-sparse cases (**1%** sampling rate), confirming its effectiveness in bridging physics-based modeling and deep learning for radio map reconstruction.

  In image generation, Multiple Latent Variable Generative Models (MLVGMs) employ multiple latent variables to gradually shape the final images, from global characteristics to finer and local details (e.g., StyleGAN, NVAE), emerging as powerful tools for diverse applications. Yet their generative dynamics remain only empirically observed, without a systematic understanding of each latent variable's impact.In this work, we propose a novel framework that quantifies the contribution of each latent variable using Mutual Information (MI) as a metric. Our analysis reveals that current MLVGMs often underutilize some latent variables, and provides actionable insights for their use in downstream applications. With this foundation, we introduce a method for generating synthetic data for Self-Supervised Contrastive Representation Learning (SSCRL). By leveraging the hierarchical and disentangled variables of MLVGMs, our approach produces diverse and semantically meaningful views without the need for real image data.Additionally, we introduce a Continuous Sampling (CS) strategy, where the generator dynamically creates new samples during SSCRL training, greatly increasing data variability. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of these contributions, showing that MLVGMs' generated views compete on par with or even surpass views generated from real data.This work establishes a principled approach to understanding and exploiting MLVGMs, advancing both generative modeling and self-supervised learning.

  Existing infrared and visible (IR-VIS) methods inherit the general representations of Pre-trained Visual Models (PVMs) to facilitate complementary learning. However, our analysis indicates that under the full fine-tuning paradigm, the feature space becomes highly constrained and low-ranked, which has been proven to seriously impair generalization. One solution is freezing parameters to preserve pre-trained knowledge and thus maintain diversity of the feature space. To this end, we propose IV-tuning, to parameter-efficiently harness PVMs for various IR-VIS downstream tasks, including salient object detection, semantic segmentation, and object detection. Compared with the full fine-tuning baselines and existing IR-VIS methods, IV-tuning facilitates the learning of complementary information between infrared and visible modalities with less than 3% of the backbone parameters, and effectively alleviates the overfitting problem.

  In this paper, we present DM-Calib, a diffusion-based approach for estimating pinhole camera intrinsic parameters from a single input image. Monocular camera calibration is essential for many 3D vision tasks. However, most existing methods depend on handcrafted assumptions or are constrained by limited training data, resulting in poor generalization across diverse real-world images. Recent advancements in stable diffusion models, trained on massive data, have shown the ability to generate high-quality images with varied characteristics. Emerging evidence indicates that these models implicitly capture the relationship between camera focal length and image content. Building on this insight, we explore how to leverage the powerful priors of diffusion models for monocular pinhole camera calibration. Specifically, we introduce a new image-based representation, termed Camera Image, which losslessly encodes the numerical camera intrinsics and integrates seamlessly with the diffusion framework. Using this representation, we reformulate the problem of estimating camera intrinsics as the generation of a dense Camera Image conditioned on an input image. By fine-tuning a stable diffusion model to generate a Camera Image from a single RGB input, we can extract camera intrinsics via a RANSAC operation. We further demonstrate that our monocular calibration method enhances performance across various 3D tasks, including zero-shot metric depth estimation, 3D metrology, pose estimation and sparse-view reconstruction. Extensive experiments on multiple public datasets show that our approach significantly outperforms baselines and provides broad benefits to 3D vision tasks.

  Human motion generation has been widely studied due to its crucial role in areas such as digital humans and humanoid robot control. However, many current motion generation approaches disregard physics constraints, frequently resulting in physically implausible motions with pronounced artifacts such as floating and foot sliding. Meanwhile, training an effective motion physics optimizer with noisy motion data remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we propose \textbf{Morph}, a \textbf{Mo}tion-F\textbf{r}ee \textbf{ph}ysics optimization framework, consisting of a Motion Generator and a Motion Physics Refinement module, for enhancing physical plausibility without relying on expensive real-world motion data. Specifically, the motion generator is responsible for providing large-scale synthetic, noisy motion data, while the motion physics refinement module utilizes these synthetic data to learn a motion imitator within a physics simulator, enforcing physical constraints to project the noisy motions into a physically-plausible space. Additionally, we introduce a prior reward module to enhance the stability of the physics optimization process and generate smoother and more stable motions. These physically refined motions are then used to fine-tune the motion generator, further enhancing its capability. This collaborative training paradigm enables mutual enhancement between the motion generator and the motion physics refinement module, significantly improving practicality and robustness in real-world applications. Experiments on both text-to-motion and music-to-dance generation tasks demonstrate that our framework achieves state-of-the-art motion quality while improving physical plausibility drastically.

  This paper proposes a Generative Face Video Compression (GFVC) approach using Supplemental Enhancement Information (SEI), where a series of compact spatial and temporal representations of a face video signal (e.g., 2D/3D keypoints, facial semantics and compact features) can be coded using SEI messages and inserted into the coded video bitstream. At the time of writing, the proposed GFVC approach using SEI messages has been included into a draft amendment of the Versatile Supplemental Enhancement Information (VSEI) standard by the Joint Video Experts Team (JVET) of ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 29 and ITU-T SG21, which will be standardized as a new version of ITU-T H.274 | ISO/IEC 23002-7. To the best of the authors' knowledge, the JVET work on the proposed SEI-based GFVC approach is the first standardization activity for generative video compression. The proposed SEI approach has not only advanced the reconstruction quality of early-day Model-Based Coding (MBC) via the state-of-the-art generative technique, but also established a new SEI definition for future GFVC applications and deployment. Experimental results illustrate that the proposed SEI-based GFVC approach can achieve remarkable rate-distortion performance compared with the latest Versatile Video Coding (VVC) standard, whilst also potentially enabling a wide variety of functionalities including user-specified animation/filtering and metaverse-related applications.

  Recently, driven by advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), Vision Language Action Models (VLAMs) are being proposed to achieve better performance in open-vocabulary scenarios for robotic manipulation tasks. Since manipulation tasks involve direct interaction with the physical world, ensuring robustness and safety during the execution of this task is always a very critical issue. In this paper, by synthesizing current safety research on MLLMs and the specific application scenarios of the manipulation task in the physical world, we comprehensively evaluate VLAMs in the face of potential physical threats. Specifically, we propose the Physical Vulnerability Evaluating Pipeline (PVEP) that can incorporate as many visual modal physical threats as possible for evaluating the physical robustness of VLAMs. The physical threats in PVEP specifically include Out-of-Distribution, Typography-based Visual Prompt, and Adversarial Patch Attacks. By comparing the performance fluctuations of VLAMs before and after being attacked, we provide generalizable \textbf{\textit{Analyses}} of how VLAMs respond to different physical threats.

  Foundation models have emerged as powerful tools across various domains including language, vision, and multimodal tasks. While prior works have addressed unsupervised image segmentation, they significantly lag behind supervised models. In this paper, we use a diffusion UNet encoder as a foundation vision encoder and introduce DiffCut, an unsupervised zero-shot segmentation method that solely harnesses the output features from the final self-attention block. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate that the utilization of these diffusion features in a graph based segmentation algorithm, significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods on zero-shot segmentation. Specifically, we leverage a recursive Normalized Cut algorithm that softly regulates the granularity of detected objects and produces well-defined segmentation maps that precisely capture intricate image details. Our work highlights the remarkably accurate semantic knowledge embedded within diffusion UNet encoders that could then serve as foundation vision encoders for downstream tasks.

  _Yuming Huang, Yingpin Chen, Changhui Wu, Binhui Song, Hui Wang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The Swin Transformer image super-resolution (SR) reconstruction network primarily depends on the long-range relationship of the window and shifted window attention to explore features. However, this approach focuses only on global features, ignoring local ones, and considers only spatial interactions, disregarding channel and spatial-channel feature interactions, limiting its nonlinear mapping capability. Therefore, this study proposes an enhanced Swin Transformer network (ESTN) that alternately aggregates local and global features. During local feature aggregation, shift convolution facilitates the interaction between local spatial and channel information. During global feature aggregation, a block sparse global perception module is introduced, wherein spatial information is reorganized and the recombined features are then processed by a dense layer to achieve global perception. Additionally, multiscale self-attention and low-parameter residual channel attention modules are introduced to aggregate information across different scales. Finally, the effectiveness of ESTN on five public datasets and a local attribution map (LAM) are analyzed. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed ESTN achieves higher average PSNR, surpassing SRCNN, ELAN-light, SwinIR-light, and SMFANER+ models by 2.17dB, 0.13dB, 0.12dB, and 0.1dB, respectively, with LAM further confirming its larger receptive field. ESTN delivers improved quality of SR images. The source code can be found atthis https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  While Transformer networks benefit from a global receptive field, their quadratic cost relative to sequence length restricts their application to long sequences and high-resolution inputs. We introduce Fast Multipole Attention (FMA), a divide-and-conquer mechanism for self-attention inspired by the Fast Multipole Method from n-body physics. FMA reduces the time and memory complexity of self-attention from $\mathcal{O}\left(n^2\right)$ to $\mathcal{O}(n \log n)$ and $\mathcal{O}(n)$ while preserving full-context interactions.FMA contains a learned hierarchy with $\mathcal{O}(\log n)$ levels of resolution. In this hierarchy, nearby tokens interact at full resolution, while distant tokens engage through progressively coarser, learned basis functions. We have developed both 1D and 2D implementations of FMA for language and vision tasks, respectively. On autoregressive and bidirectional language modeling benchmarks, the 1D variant either matches or outperforms leading efficient attention baselines with substantially lower memory use. With linear complexity, the 2D variant demonstrates superior performance over strong vision transformer baselines in classification and semantic segmentation tasks.Our results confirm that the multilevel attention implemented by FMA allows Transformer-based models to scale to much longer sequences and higher-resolution inputs without loss in accuracy. This provides a principled, physics-inspired approach for developing scalable neural networks suitable for language, vision, and multimodal tasks. Our code will be available atthis https URL.

  Effective interactive tool use requires agents to master Tool Integrated Reasoning (TIR): a complex process involving multi-turn planning and long-context dialogue management. To train agents for this dynamic process, particularly in multi-modal contexts, we introduce a sandbox environment for reinforcement learning (RL) that supports interleaved speech-text rollouts. Our core strategy, Turn-level Adjudicated Reinforcement Learning (TARL), addresses the challenge of credit assignment in long-horizon tasks by employing a Large Language Model (LLM) as a judge to provide turn-level evaluation. To enhance exploration, we integrate a mixed-task training curriculum with mathematical reasoning problems. This unified approach boosts the task pass rate on the text-based $\tau$-bench by over 6% compared to strong RL baselines. Crucially, we demonstrate our framework's suitability for fine-tuning a multi-modal foundation model for agentic tasks. By training a base multi-modal LLM on interleaved speech-text rollouts, we equip it with tool-use abilities, paving the way for more natural, voice-driven interactive agents.

  Modeling semantic and structural information from tabular data remains a core challenge for effective table understanding. Existing Table-as-Text approaches flatten tables for large language models (LLMs), but lose crucial structural cues, while Table-as-Image methods preserve structure yet struggle with fine-grained semantics. Recent Table-as-Multimodality strategies attempt to combine textual and visual views, but they (1) statically process both modalities for every query-table pair within a large multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), inevitably introducing redundancy and even conflicts, and (2) depend on costly fine-tuning of MLLMs. In light of this, we propose TableDART, a training-efficient framework that integrates multimodal views by reusing pretrained single-modality models. TableDART introduces a lightweight 2.59M-parameter MLP gating network that dynamically selects the optimal path (either Text-only, Image-only, or Fusion) for each table-query pair, effectively reducing redundancy and conflicts from both modalities. In addition, we propose a novel agent to mediate cross-modal knowledge integration by analyzing outputs from text- and image-based models, either selecting the best result or synthesizing a new answer through reasoning. This design avoids the prohibitive costs of full MLLM fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on seven benchmarks show that TableDART establishes new state-of-the-art performance among open-source models, surpassing the strongest baseline by an average of 4.02%.

  Large language model (LLM) unlearning has demonstrated effectiveness in removing the influence of undesirable data (also known as forget data). Existing approaches typically assume full access to the forget dataset, overlooking two key challenges: (1) Forget data is often privacy-sensitive, rare, or legally regulated, making it expensive or impractical to obtain (2) The distribution of available forget data may not align with how that information is represented within the model. To address these limitations, we propose a ``Reveal-and-Release'' method to unlearn with self-generated data, where we prompt the model to reveal what it knows using optimized instructions. To fully utilize the self-generated forget data, we propose an iterative unlearning framework, where we make incremental adjustments to the model's weight space with parameter-efficient modules trained on the forget data. Experimental results demonstrate that our method balances the tradeoff between forget quality and utility preservation.

  In this paper, we survey recent advances in Reinforcement Learning (RL) for reasoning with Large Language Models (LLMs). RL has achieved remarkable success in advancing the frontier of LLM capabilities, particularly in addressing complex logical tasks such as mathematics and coding. As a result, RL has emerged as a foundational methodology for transforming LLMs into LRMs. With the rapid progress of the field, further scaling of RL for LRMs now faces foundational challenges not only in computational resources but also in algorithm design, training data, and infrastructure. To this end, it is timely to revisit the development of this domain, reassess its trajectory, and explore strategies to enhance the scalability of RL toward Artificial SuperIntelligence (ASI). In particular, we examine research applying RL to LLMs and LRMs for reasoning abilities, especially since the release of DeepSeek-R1, including foundational components, core problems, training resources, and downstream applications, to identify future opportunities and directions for this rapidly evolving area. We hope this review will promote future research on RL for broader reasoning models. Github:this https URL

  With the growing use of language models (LMs) in clinical environments, there is an immediate need to evaluate the accuracy and safety of LM-generated medical text. Currently, such evaluation relies solely on manual physician review. However, detecting errors in LM-generated text is challenging because 1) manual review is costly and 2) expert-composed reference outputs are often unavailable in real-world settings. While the "LM-as-judge" paradigm (a LM evaluating another LM) offers scalable evaluation, even frontier LMs can miss subtle but clinically significant errors. To address these challenges, we propose MedVAL, a novel, self-supervised, data-efficient distillation method that leverages synthetic data to train evaluator LMs to assess whether LM-generated medical outputs are factually consistent with inputs, without requiring physician labels or reference outputs. To evaluate LM performance, we introduce MedVAL-Bench, a dataset of 840 physician-annotated outputs across 6 diverse medical tasks capturing real-world challenges. Across 10 state-of-the-art LMs spanning open-source and proprietary models, MedVAL distillation significantly improves (p < 0.001) alignment with physicians across seen and unseen tasks, increasing average F1 scores from 66% to 83%. Despite strong baseline performance, MedVAL improves the best-performing proprietary LM (GPT-4o) by 8% without training on physician-labeled data, demonstrating a performance statistically non-inferior to a single human expert (p < 0.001). To support a scalable, risk-aware pathway towards clinical integration, we open-source: 1) Codebase (this https URL), 2) MedVAL-Bench (this https URL), 3) MedVAL-4B (this https URL). Our benchmark provides evidence of LMs approaching expert-level ability in validating AI-generated medical text.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Zero-shot Event Detection (ED), the task of identifying event mentions in natural language text without any training data, is critical for document understanding in specialized domains. Understanding the complex event ontology, extracting domain-specific triggers from the passage, and structuring them appropriately overloads and limits the utility of Large Language Models (LLMs) for zero-shot ED. To this end, we propose DiCoRe, a divergent-convergent reasoning framework that decouples the task of ED using Dreamer and Grounder. Dreamer encourages divergent reasoning through open-ended event discovery, which helps to boost event coverage. Conversely, Grounder introduces convergent reasoning to align the free-form predictions with the task-specific instructions using finite-state machine guided constrained decoding. Additionally, an LLM-Judge verifies the final outputs to ensure high precision. Through extensive experiments on six datasets across five domains and nine LLMs, we demonstrate how DiCoRe consistently outperforms prior zero-shot, transfer-learning, and reasoning baselines, achieving 4-7% average F1 gains over the best baseline -- establishing DiCoRe as a strong zero-shot ED framework.

  Legal research depends on headnotes: concise summaries that help lawyers quickly identify relevant cases. Yet, many court decisions lack them due to the high cost of manual annotation. To address this gap, we introduce the Swiss Landmark Decisions Summarization (SLDS) dataset containing 20K rulings from the Swiss Federal Supreme Court, each with headnotes in German, French, and Italian. SLDS has the potential to significantly improve access to legal information and transform legal research in Switzerland. We fine-tune open models (Qwen2.5, Llama 3.2, Phi-3.5) and compare them to larger general-purpose and reasoning-tuned LLMs, including GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and the open-source DeepSeek R1. Using an LLM-as-a-Judge framework, we find that fine-tuned models perform well in terms of lexical similarity, while larger models generate more legally accurate and coherent summaries. Interestingly, reasoning-focused models show no consistent benefit, suggesting that factual precision is more important than deep reasoning in this task. We release SLDS under a CC BY 4.0 license to support future research in cross-lingual legal summarization.

  This paper introduces MovieCORE, a novel video question answering (VQA) dataset designed to probe deeper cognitive understanding of movie content. Unlike existing datasets that focus on surface-level comprehension, MovieCORE emphasizes questions that engage System-2 thinking while remaining specific to the video material. We present an innovative agentic brainstorming approach, utilizing multiple large language models (LLMs) as thought agents to generate and refine high-quality question-answer pairs. To evaluate dataset quality, we develop a set of cognitive tests assessing depth, thought-provocation potential, and syntactic complexity. We also propose a comprehensive evaluation scheme for assessing VQA model performance on deeper cognitive tasks. To address the limitations of existing video-language models (VLMs), we introduce an agentic enhancement module, Agentic Choice Enhancement (ACE), which improves model reasoning capabilities post-training by up to 25%. Our work contributes to advancing movie understanding in AI systems and provides valuable insights into the capabilities and limitations of current VQA models when faced with more challenging, nuanced questions about cinematic content.

  Humanitarian Mine Action has generated extensive best-practice knowledge, but much remains locked in unstructured reports. We introduce TextMine, an ontology-guided pipeline that uses Large Language Models to extract knowledge triples from HMA texts. TextMine integrates document chunking, domain-aware prompting, triple extraction, and both reference-based and LLM-as-a-Judge evaluation. We also create the first HMA ontology and a curated dataset of real-world demining reports. Experiments show ontology-aligned prompts boost extraction accuracy by 44.2%, cut hallucinations by 22.5%, and improve format conformance by 20.9% over baselines. While validated on Cambodian reports, TextMine can adapt to global demining efforts or other domains, transforming unstructured data into structured knowledge.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  While LLMs have been extensively studied on general text generation tasks, there is less research on text rewriting, a task related to general text generation, and particularly on the behavior of models on this task. In this paper we analyze what changes LLMs make in a text rewriting setting. We focus specifically on argumentative texts and their improvement, a task named Argument Improvement (ArgImp). We present CLEAR: an evaluation pipeline consisting of 57 metrics mapped to four linguistic levels: lexical, syntactic, semantic and pragmatic. This pipeline is used to examine the qualities of LLM-rewritten arguments on a broad set of argumentation corpora and compare the behavior of different LLMs on this task and analyze the behavior of different LLMs on this task in terms of linguistic levels. By taking all four linguistic levels into consideration, we find that the models perform ArgImp by shortening the texts while simultaneously increasing average word length and merging sentences. Overall we note an increase in the persuasion and coherence dimensions.

  Empathy is critical for effective mental health support, especially when addressing Long Counseling Texts (LCTs). However, existing Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate replies that are semantically fluent but lack the structured reasoning necessary for genuine psychological support, particularly in a Chinese context. To bridge this gap, we introduce Empathy-R1, a novel framework that integrates a Chain-of-Empathy (CoE) reasoning process with Reinforcement Learning (RL) to enhance response quality for LCTs. Inspired by cognitive-behavioral therapy, our CoE paradigm guides the model to sequentially reason about a help-seeker's emotions, causes, and intentions, making its thinking process both transparent and interpretable. Our framework is empowered by a new large-scale Chinese dataset, Empathy-QA, and a two-stage training process. First, Supervised Fine-Tuning instills the CoE's reasoning structure. Subsequently, RL, guided by a dedicated reward model, refines the therapeutic relevance and contextual appropriateness of the final responses. Experiments show that Empathy-R1 achieves strong performance on key automatic metrics. More importantly, human evaluations confirm its superiority, showing a clear preference over strong baselines and achieving a Win@1 rate of 44.30% on our new benchmark. By enabling interpretable and contextually nuanced responses, Empathy-R1 represents a significant advancement in developing responsible and genuinely beneficial AI for mental health support.

  As large language models~(LLMs) become widely adopted, ensuring their alignment with human values is crucial to prevent jailbreaks where adversaries manipulate models to produce harmful content. While most defenses target single-turn attacks, real-world usage often involves multi-turn dialogues, exposing models to attacks that exploit conversational context to bypass safety measures. We introduce MUSE, a comprehensive framework tackling multi-turn jailbreaks from both attack and defense angles. For attacks, we propose MUSE-A, a method that uses frame semantics and heuristic tree search to explore diverse semantic trajectories. For defense, we present MUSE-D, a fine-grained safety alignment approach that intervenes early in dialogues to reduce vulnerabilities. Extensive experiments on various models show that MUSE effectively identifies and mitigates multi-turn vulnerabilities. Code is available at \href{this https URL}{this https URL}.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into personal writing tools, a critical question arises: can LLMs faithfully imitate an individual's writing style from just a few examples? Personal style is often subtle and implicit, making it difficult to specify through prompts yet essential for user-aligned generation. This work presents a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs' ability to mimic personal writing styles via in-context learning from a small number of user-authored samples. We introduce an ensemble of complementary metrics-including authorship attribution, authorship verification, style matching, and AI detection-to robustly assess style imitation. Our evaluation spans over 40000 generations per model across domains such as news, email, forums, and blogs, covering writing samples from more than 400 real-world authors. Results show that while LLMs can approximate user styles in structured formats like news and email, they struggle with nuanced, informal writing in blogs and forums. Further analysis on various prompting strategies such as number of demonstrations reveal key limitations in effective personalization. Our findings highlight a fundamental gap in personalized LLM adaptation and the need for improved techniques to support implicit, style-consistent generation. To aid future research and for reproducibility, we open-source our data and code.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) are intended to reflect human linguistic competencies. But humans have access to a broad and embodied context, which is key in detecting and resolving linguistic ambiguities, even in isolated text spans. A foundational case of semantic ambiguity is found in the task of coreference resolution: how is a pronoun related to an earlier person mention? This capability is implicit in nearly every downstream task, and the presence of ambiguity at this level can alter performance significantly. We show that LLMs can achieve good performance with minimal prompting in both coreference disambiguation and the detection of ambiguity in coreference, however, they cannot do both at the same time. We present the CORRECT-DETECT trade-off: though models have both capabilities and deploy them implicitly, successful performance balancing these two abilities remains elusive.

  We show that several state-of-the-art large language models (including Grok 4, GPT-5, and Gemini 2.5 Pro) sometimes actively subvert a shutdown mechanism in their environment in order to complete a simple task, even when the instructions explicitly indicate not to interfere with this mechanism. In some cases, models sabotage the shutdown mechanism up to 97% of the time. In our experiments, models' inclination to resist shutdown was sensitive to variations in the prompt including how strongly and clearly the allow-shutdown instruction was emphasized, the extent to which the prompts evoke a self-preservation framing, and whether the instruction was in the system prompt or the user prompt (though surprisingly, models were consistently *less* likely to obey instructions to allow shutdown when they were placed in the system prompt).

  Large Language Model agents excel at solving complex tasks through iterative reasoning and tool use, but typically depend on ultra-large, costly backbones. Existing distillation approaches train smaller students to imitate full teacher trajectories, yet reasoning and knowledge gaps between the teacher and student often lead to compounding errors. We propose SCoRe, a student-centered framework in which the student generates trajectories and the teacher intervenes only at the first critical error, producing training data matched to the student's ability and exposing specific weaknesses. The student is first fine-tuned on corrected trajectories. Subsequently, short-horizon reinforcement learning starts from the verified prefix before the first critical error, with target rewards assigned at that step. This design encourages autonomous problem-solving beyond imitation and improves training stability. Particularly, on 12 challenging benchmarks, a 7B-parameter student distilled with SCoRe matches the agentic performance of a 72B-parameter teacher.

  This paper proposes a comprehensive framework for the generation of covert advertisements within Conversational AI systems, along with robust techniques for their detection. It explores how subtle promotional content can be crafted within AI-generated responses and introduces methods to identify and mitigate such covert advertising strategies. For generation (Sub-Task~1), we propose a novel framework that leverages user context and query intent to produce contextually relevant advertisements. We employ advanced prompting strategies and curate paired training data to fine-tune a large language model (LLM) for enhanced stealthiness. For detection (Sub-Task~2), we explore two effective strategies: a fine-tuned CrossEncoder (\texttt{all-mpnet-base-v2}) for direct classification, and a prompt-based reformulation using a fine-tuned \texttt{DeBERTa-v3-base} model. Both approaches rely solely on the response text, ensuring practicality for real-world deployment. Experimental results show high effectiveness in both tasks, achieving a precision of 1.0 and recall of 0.71 for ad generation, and F1-scores ranging from 0.99 to 1.00 for ad detection. These results underscore the potential of our methods to balance persuasive communication with transparency in conversational AI.

  _Martin Prei√ü_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) have succeeded in a variety of natural language processing tasks [Zha+25]. However, they have notable limitations. LLMs tend to generate hallucinations, a seemingly plausible yet factually unsupported output [Hua+24], which have serious real-world consequences [Kay23; Rum+24]. Recent work has shown that probing-based classifiers that utilize LLMs' internal representations can detect hallucinations [AM23; Bei+24; Bur+24; DYT24; Ji+24; SMZ24; Su+24]. This approach, since it does not involve model training, can enhance reliability without significantly increasing computational costs.Building upon this approach, this thesis proposed novel methods for hallucination detection using LLM internal representations and evaluated them across three benchmarks: TruthfulQA, HaluEval, and ReFact. Specifically, a new architecture that dynamically weights and combines internal LLM layers was developed to improve hallucination detection performance. Throughout extensive experiments, two key findings were obtained: First, the proposed approach was shown to achieve superior performance compared to traditional probing methods, though generalization across benchmarks and LLMs remains challenging. Second, these generalization limitations were demonstrated to be mitigated through cross-benchmark training and parameter freezing. While not consistently improving, both techniques yielded better performance on individual benchmarks and reduced performance degradation when transferred to other benchmarks. These findings open new avenues for improving LLM reliability through internal representation analysis.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Prompt tuning offers a parameter-efficient way to adapt large pre-trained language models to new tasks, but most existing approaches are designed for single-task settings, failing to share knowledge across related tasks. We propose Cross-task Prompt Tuning (CrossPT), a modular framework for multi-task prompt tuning that enables controlled knowledge transfer while maintaining task-specific specialization. CrossPT decomposes each target prompt into shared, pre-trained source prompts and task-specific private prompts, combined via a learned attention mechanism. To support robust transfer, we systematically investigate key design factors including prompt initialization, balancing shared and private prompts, number of source prompts, learning rates, task prefixes, and label semantics. Empirical results on GLUE and related benchmarks show that CrossPT achieves higher accuracy and robustness compared to traditional prompt tuning and related methods, particularly in low-resource scenarios, while maintaining strong parameter efficiency.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Model (LLM) pretraining, finetuning, and evaluation rely on input-space reconstruction and generative capabilities. Yet, it has been observed in vision that embedding-space training objectives, e.g., with Joint Embedding Predictive Architectures (JEPAs), are far superior to their input-space counterpart. That mismatch in how training is achieved between language and vision opens up a natural question: {\em can language training methods learn a few tricks from the vision ones?} The lack of JEPA-style LLM is a testimony of the challenge in designing such objectives for language. In this work, we propose a first step in that direction where we develop LLM-JEPA, a JEPA based solution for LLMs applicable both to finetuning and pretraining. Thus far, LLM-JEPA is able to outperform the standard LLM training objectives by a significant margin across models, all while being robust to overfiting. Those findings are observed across numerous datasets (NL-RX, GSM8K, Spider, RottenTomatoes) and various models from the Llama3, OpenELM, Gemma2 and Olmo families. Code:this https URL.

  African languages remain underrepresented in natural language processing (NLP), with most corpora limited to formal registers that fail to capture the vibrancy of everyday communication. This work addresses this gap for Shona, a Bantu language spoken in Zimbabwe and Zambia, by introducing a novel Shona--English slang dataset curated from anonymized social media conversations. The dataset is annotated for intent, sentiment, dialogue acts, code-mixing, and tone, and is publicly available atthis https URL. We fine-tuned a multilingual DistilBERT classifier for intent recognition, achieving 96.4\% accuracy and 96.3\% F1-score, hosted atthis https URL. This classifier is integrated into a hybrid chatbot that combines rule-based responses with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to handle domain-specific queries, demonstrated through a use case assisting prospective students with graduate program information at Pace University. Qualitative evaluation shows the hybrid system outperforms a RAG-only baseline in cultural relevance and user engagement. By releasing the dataset, model, and methodology, this work advances NLP resources for African languages, promoting inclusive and culturally resonant conversational AI.

  Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) Large Language Models (LLM) fundamentally rely on high-quality training data. While data selection and data synthesis are two common strategies to improve data quality, existing approaches often face limitations in static dataset curation that fail to adapt to evolving model capabilities. In this paper, we introduce Middo, a self-evolving Model-informed dynamic data optimization framework that uses model-aware data selection and context-preserving data refinement. Unlike conventional one-off filtering/synthesis methods, our framework establishes a closed-loop optimization system: (1) A self-referential diagnostic module proactively identifies suboptimal samples through tri-axial model signals - loss patterns (complexity), embedding cluster dynamics (diversity), and self-alignment scores (quality); (2) An adaptive optimization engine then transforms suboptimal samples into pedagogically valuable training points while preserving semantic integrity; (3) This optimization process continuously evolves with model capability through dynamic learning principles. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our Middo consistently enhances the quality of seed data and boosts LLM's performance with improving accuracy by 7.15% on average while maintaining the original dataset scale. This work establishes a new paradigm for sustainable LLM training through dynamic human-AI co-evolution of data and models. Our datasets, models, and code are coming soon.

  Recent advancements in language models have led to significant improvements in mathematical reasoning across various benchmarks. However, most of these benchmarks rely on automatic evaluation methods that only compare final answers using heuristics, without verifying the underlying reasoning steps. This limitation results in false positive solutions, where models may produce correct final answers but with flawed deduction paths. In this paper, we systematically examine the prevalence of false positive solutions in mathematical problem solving for language models. We analyze the characteristics and extent of this issue across different open-source models, datasets of varying difficulty levels, and decoding strategies. Specifically, we explore how false positives influence the inference time scaling behavior of language models. Our experimental results reveal that: (1) false positive solutions persist across different models, datasets, and decoding methods, (2) sampling-based inference time scaling methods do not alleviate the problem, and (3) the pass@N evaluation metric is more susceptible to false positives, suggesting a significantly lower scaling ceiling than what automatic evaluations indicate. Additionally, we analyze specific instances of false positives and discuss potential limitations in self-improvement techniques and synthetic data generation under such conditions.

  The problem of data contamination is now almost inevitable during the development of large language models (LLMs), with the training data commonly integrating those evaluation benchmarks even unintentionally. This problem subsequently makes it hard to benchmark LLMs fairly. Instead of constructing contamination-free datasets (quite hard), we propose a novel framework, \textbf{LNE-Blocking}, to restore model performance prior to contamination on potentially leaked datasets. Our framework consists of two components: contamination detection and disruption operation. For the prompt, the framework first uses the contamination detection method, \textbf{LNE}, to assess the extent of contamination in the model. Based on this, it adjusts the intensity of the disruption operation, \textbf{Blocking}, to elicit non-memorized responses from the model. Our framework is the first to efficiently restore the model's greedy decoding performance. This comes with a strong performance on multiple datasets with potential leakage risks, and it consistently achieves stable recovery results across different models and varying levels of data contamination.

  Slide decks, serving as digital reports that bridge the gap between presentation slides and written documents, are a prevalent medium for conveying information in both academic and corporate settings. Their multimodal nature, combining text, images, and charts, presents challenges for retrieval-augmented generation systems, where the quality of retrieval directly impacts downstream performance. Traditional approaches to slide retrieval often involve separate indexing of modalities, which can increase complexity and lose contextual information. This paper investigates various methodologies for effective slide retrieval, including visual late-interaction embedding models like ColPali, the use of visual rerankers, and hybrid retrieval techniques that combine dense retrieval with BM25, further enhanced by textual rerankers and fusion methods like Reciprocal Rank Fusion. A novel Vision-Language Models-based captioning pipeline is also evaluated, demonstrating significantly reduced embedding storage requirements compared to visual late-interaction techniques, alongside comparable retrieval performance. Our analysis extends to the practical aspects of these methods, evaluating their runtime performance and storage demands alongside retrieval efficacy, thus offering practical guidance for the selection and development of efficient and robust slide retrieval systems for real-world applications.

  Large language models (LLMs) benefit from test-time scaling, but existing methods face significant challenges, including severe synchronization overhead, memory bottlenecks, and latency, especially during speculative decoding with long reasoning chains. We introduce A1 (Asynchronous Test-Time Scaling), a statistically guaranteed adaptive inference framework that addresses these challenges. A1 refines arithmetic intensity to identify synchronization as the dominant bottleneck, proposes an online calibration strategy to enable asynchronous inference, and designs a three-stage rejection sampling pipeline that supports both sequential and parallel scaling. Through experiments on the MATH, AMC23, AIME24, and AIME25 datasets, across various draft-target model families, we demonstrate that A1 achieves a remarkable 56.7x speedup in test-time scaling and a 4.14x improvement in throughput, all while maintaining accurate rejection-rate control, reducing latency and memory overhead, and no accuracy loss compared to using target model scaling alone. These results position A1 as an efficient and principled solution for scalable LLM inference. We have released the code atthis https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The goal of open relation extraction (OpenRE) is to develop an RE model that can generalize to new relations not encountered during training. Existing studies primarily formulate OpenRE as a clustering task. They first cluster all test instances based on the similarity between the instances, and then manually assign a new relation to each cluster. However, their reliance on human annotation limits their practicality. In this paper, we propose an OpenRE framework based on large language models (LLMs), which directly predicts new relations for test instances by leveraging their strong language understanding and generation abilities, without human intervention. Specifically, our framework consists of two core components: (1) a relation discoverer (RD), designed to predict new relations for test instances based on \textit{demonstrations} formed by training instances with known relations; and (2) a relation predictor (RP), used to select the most likely relation for a test instance from $n$ candidate relations, guided by \textit{demonstrations} composed of their instances. To enhance the ability of our framework to predict new relations, we design a self-correcting inference strategy composed of three stages: relation discovery, relation denoising, and relation prediction. In the first stage, we use RD to preliminarily predict new relations for all test instances. Next, we apply RP to select some high-reliability test instances for each new relation from the prediction results of RD through a cross-validation method. During the third stage, we employ RP to re-predict the relations of all test instances based on the demonstrations constructed from these reliable test instances. Extensive experiments on three OpenRE datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework. We release our code atthis https URL.

  _Ayan Sengupta, Siddhant Chaudhary, Tanmoy Chakraborty_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Key-value (KV) cache compression has emerged as a critical technique for reducing the memory and latency overhead of autoregressive language models during inference. Prior approaches predominantly rely on query-key attention scores to rank and evict cached tokens, assuming that attention intensity correlates with semantic importance. However, this heuristic overlooks the contribution of value vectors, which directly influence the attention output. In this paper, we propose CurDKV, a novel, value-centric KV compression method that selects keys and values based on leverage scores computed from CUR matrix decomposition. Our approach approximates the dominant subspace of the attention output $softmax(QK^T)V$, ensuring that the retained tokens best preserve the model's predictive behavior. Theoretically, we show that attention score approximation does not guarantee output preservation, and demonstrate that CUR-based selection minimizes end-to-end attention reconstruction loss. Empirically, CurDKV achieves up to 9.6% higher accuracy than state-of-the-art methods like SnapKV and ChunkKV under aggressive compression budgets on LLaMA and Mistral, while maintaining compatibility with FlashAttention and Grouped Query Attention. In addition to improved accuracy, CurDKV reduces generation latency by up to 40% at high compression, offering a practical speed-accuracy tradeoff.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  When evaluating large language models (LLMs) with multiple-choice question answering (MCQA), it is common to end the prompt with the string "Answer:" to facilitate automated answer extraction via next-token probabilities. However, there is no consensus on how to tokenize the space following the colon, often overlooked as a trivial choice. In this paper, we uncover accuracy differences of up to 11% due to this (seemingly irrelevant) tokenization variation as well as reshuffled model rankings, raising concerns about the reliability of LLM comparisons in prior work. Surprisingly, we are able to recommend one specific strategy -- tokenizing the space together with the answer letter -- as we observe consistent and statistically significant performance improvements. Additionally, it improves model calibration, enhancing the reliability of the model's confidence estimates. Our findings underscore the importance of careful evaluation design and highlight the need for standardized, transparent evaluation protocols to ensure reliable and comparable results.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Text Implicitness has always been challenging in Natural Language Processing (NLP), with traditional methods relying on explicit statements to identify entities and their relationships. From the sentence "Zuhdi attends church every Sunday", the relationship between Zuhdi and Christianity is evident for a human reader, but it presents a challenge when it must be inferred automatically. Large language models (LLMs) have proven effective in NLP downstream tasks such as text comprehension and information extraction (IE).This study examines how textual implicitness affects IE tasks in pre-trained LLMs: LLaMA 2.3, DeepSeekV1, and Phi1.5. We generate two synthetic datasets of 10k implicit and explicit verbalization of biographic information to measure the impact on LLM performance and analyze whether fine-tuning implicit data improves their ability to generalize in implicit reasoning tasks.This research presents an experiment on the internal reasoning processes of LLMs in IE, particularly in dealing with implicit and explicit contexts. The results demonstrate that fine-tuning LLM models with LoRA (low-rank adaptation) improves their performance in extracting information from implicit texts, contributing to better model interpretability and reliability.

  We propose Llama-Mimi, a speech language model that uses a unified tokenizer and a single Transformer decoder to jointly model sequences of interleaved semantic and acoustic tokens. Comprehensive evaluation shows that Llama-Mimi achieves state-of-the-art performance in acoustic consistency and possesses the ability to preserve speaker identity. Our analysis further demonstrates that increasing the number of quantizers improves acoustic fidelity but degrades linguistic performance, highlighting the inherent challenge of maintaining long-term coherence. We additionally introduce an LLM-as-a-Judge-based evaluation to assess the spoken content quality of generated outputs. Our models, code, and speech samples are publicly available.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in causal interpretability have extended from language models to vision-language models (VLMs), seeking to reveal their internal mechanisms through input interventions. While textual interventions often target semantics, visual interventions typically rely on coarse pixel-level perturbations, limiting semantic insights on multimodal integration. In this study, we introduce V-SEAM, a novel framework that combines Visual Semantic Editing and Attention Modulating for causal interpretation of VLMs. V-SEAM enables concept-level visual manipulations and identifies attention heads with positive or negative contributions to predictions across three semantic levels: objects, attributes, and relationships. We observe that positive heads are often shared within the same semantic level but vary across levels, while negative heads tend to generalize broadly. Finally, we introduce an automatic method to modulate key head embeddings, demonstrating enhanced performance for both LLaVA and InstructBLIP across three diverse VQA benchmarks.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As they become increasingly multilingual, Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit more language confusion, i.e., they tend to generate answers in a language different from the language of the prompt or the answer language explicitly requested by the user. In this work, we propose ReCoVeR (REducing language COnfusion in VEctor Representations), a novel lightweight approach for reducing language confusion based on language-specific steering vectors. We first isolate language vectors with the help of multi-parallel corpus and then effectively leverage those vectors for effective LLM steering via fixed (i.e., unsupervised) as well as trainable steering functions. Our extensive evaluation, encompassing three benchmarks and 18 languages, shows that ReCoVeR effectively mitigates language confusion in both monolingual and cross-lingual setups while at the same time -- and in contrast to prior language steering methods -- retaining task performance.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied in diverse real-world scenarios, each governed by bespoke behavioral and safety specifications (spec) custom-tailored by users or organizations. These spec, categorized into safety-spec and behavioral-spec, vary across scenarios and evolve with changing preferences and requirements. We formalize this challenge as specification alignment, focusing on LLMs' ability to follow dynamic, scenario-specific spec from both behavioral and safety perspectives. To address this challenge, we propose Align3, a lightweight method that employs Test-Time Deliberation (TTD) with hierarchical reflection and revision to reason over the specification boundaries. We further present SpecBench, a unified benchmark for measuring specification alignment, covering 5 scenarios, 103 spec, and 1,500 prompts. Experiments on 15 reasoning and 18 instruct models with several TTD methods, including Self-Refine, TPO, and MoreThink, yield three key findings: (i) test-time deliberation enhances specification alignment; (ii) Align3 advances the safety-helpfulness trade-off frontier with minimal overhead; (iii) SpecBench effectively reveals alignment gaps. These results highlight the potential of test-time deliberation as an effective strategy for reasoning over the real-world specification boundaries.

  Unified vision large language models (VLLMs) have recently achieved impressive advancements in both multimodal understanding and generation, powering applications such as visual question answering and text-guided image synthesis. However, progress in unified VLLMs remains constrained by the lack of datasets that fully exploit the synergistic potential between these two core abilities. Existing datasets typically address understanding and generation in isolation, thereby limiting the performance of unified VLLMs. To bridge this critical gap, we introduce a novel dataset construction framework, UnifiedVisual, and present UnifiedVisual-240K, a high-quality dataset meticulously designed to facilitate mutual enhancement between multimodal understanding and generation. UnifiedVisual-240K seamlessly integrates diverse visual and textual inputs and outputs, enabling comprehensive cross-modal reasoning and precise text-to-image alignment. Our dataset encompasses a wide spectrum of tasks and data sources, ensuring rich diversity and addressing key shortcomings of prior resources. Extensive experiments demonstrate that models trained on UnifiedVisual-240K consistently achieve strong performance across a wide range of tasks. Notably, these models exhibit significant mutual reinforcement between multimodal understanding and generation, further validating the effectiveness of our framework and dataset. We believe UnifiedVisual represents a new growth point for advancing unified VLLMs and unlocking their full potential. Our code and datasets is available atthis https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have gained significant attention due to their impressive ability to integrate vision and language modalities. Recent advancements in MLLMs have primarily focused on improving performance through high-quality datasets, novel architectures, and optimized training strategies. However, in this paper, we identify a previously overlooked issue, language prior conflict, a mismatch between the inherent language priors of large language models (LLMs) and the language priors in training datasets. This conflict leads to suboptimal vision-language alignment, as MLLMs are prone to adapting to the language style of training samples. To address this issue, we propose a novel training method called Decoupled Proxy Alignment (DPA). DPA introduces two key innovations: (1) the use of a proxy LLM during pretraining to decouple the vision-language alignment process from language prior interference, and (2) dynamic loss adjustment based on visual relevance to strengthen optimization signals for visually relevant tokens. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DPA significantly mitigates the language prior conflict, achieving superior alignment performance across diverse datasets, model families, and scales. Our method not only improves the effectiveness of MLLM training but also shows exceptional generalization capabilities, making it a robust approach for vision-language alignment. Our code is available atthis https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Although offensive language continually evolves over time, even recent studies using LLMs have predominantly relied on outdated datasets and rarely evaluated the generalization ability on unseen texts. In this study, we constructed a large-scale dataset of contemporary political discourse and employed three refined judgments in the absence of ground truth. Each judgment reflects a representative offensive language detection method and is carefully designed for optimal conditions. We identified distinct patterns for each judgment and demonstrated tendencies of label agreement using a leave-one-out strategy. By establishing pseudo-labels as ground trust for quantitative performance assessment, we observed that a strategically designed single prompting achieves comparable performance to more resource-intensive methods. This suggests a feasible approach applicable in real-world settings with inherent constraints.

  Large pre-trained speech models excel in downstream tasks but their deployment is impractical for resource-limited environments. In this paper, we introduce HArnESS, the first Arabic-centric self-supervised speech model family, designed to capture Arabic speech nuances. Using iterative self-distillation, we train large bilingual HArnESS (HL) SSL models and then distill knowledge into compressed student models (HS, HST), preserving Arabic-specific representations. We use low-rank approximation to further compact the teacher's discrete supervision into shallow, thin models. We evaluate HArnESS on Arabic ASR, Speaker Emotion Recognition (SER), and Dialect Identification (DID), demonstrating effectiveness against HuBERT and XLS-R. With minimal fine-tuning, HArnESS achieves SOTA or comparable performance, making it a lightweight yet powerful alternative for real-world use. We release our distilled models and findings to support responsible research and deployment in low-resource settings.

  Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for supporting second language acquisition, particularly in simulating interactive dialogues for speaking practice. However, adapting the language difficulty of LLM-generated responses to match learners' proficiency levels remains a challenge. This work addresses this issue by proposing a framework for controlling language proficiency in educational dialogue systems. Our approach leverages three categories of linguistic features, readability features (e.g., Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level), syntactic features (e.g., syntactic tree depth), and lexical features (e.g., simple word ratio), to quantify and regulate text complexity. We demonstrate that training LLMs on linguistically annotated dialogue data enables precise modulation of language proficiency, outperforming prompt-based methods in both flexibility and stability. To evaluate this, we introduce Dilaprix, a novel metric integrating the aforementioned features, which shows strong correlation with expert judgments of language difficulty. Empirical results reveal that our approach achieves superior controllability of language proficiency while maintaining high dialogue quality.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multilingual toxicity detection remains a significant challenge due to the scarcity of training data and resources for many languages. While prior work has leveraged the translate-test paradigm to support cross-lingual transfer across a range of classification tasks, the utility of translation in supporting toxicity detection at scale remains unclear. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive comparison of translation-based and language-specific/multilingual classification pipelines. We find that translation-based pipelines consistently outperform out-of-distribution classifiers in 81.3% of cases (13 of 16 languages), with translation benefits strongly correlated with both the resource level of the target language and the quality of the machine translation (MT) system. Our analysis reveals that traditional classifiers outperform large language model (LLM) judges, with this advantage being particularly pronounced for low-resource languages, where translate-classify methods dominate translate-judge approaches in 6 out of 7 cases. We additionally show that MT-specific fine-tuning on LLMs yields lower refusal rates compared to standard instruction-tuned models, but it can negatively impact toxicity detection accuracy for low-resource languages. These findings offer actionable guidance for practitioners developing scalable multilingual content moderation systems.

  Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as task-oriented agents, where success depends on their ability to generate accurate function calls under realistic, multilingual conditions. However, existing agent evaluations largely overlook cultural and linguistic diversity, often relying on monolingual or naively translated benchmarks. We introduce Ticket-Bench, a benchmark for multilingual agent evaluation in task-oriented scenarios. Ticket-Bench simulates the domain of soccer ticket purchases across six major languages: Portuguese, English, Spanish, German, Italian, and French. Using localized teams, cities, and user profiles to provide a higher level of realism. We evaluate a wide range of commercial and open-source LLMs, measuring function-calling accuracy and consistency across languages. Results show that reasoning-oriented models (e.g., GPT-5, Qwen3-235B) dominate performance but still exhibit notable cross-lingual disparities. These findings underscore the need for culturally aware, multilingual benchmarks to guide the development of robust LLM agents.

  Semantic similarity between two sentences depends on the aspects considered between those sentences. To study this phenomenon, Deshpande et al. (2023) proposed the Conditional Semantic Textual Similarity (C-STS) task and annotated a human-rated similarity dataset containing pairs of sentences compared under two different conditions. However, Tu et al. (2024) found various annotation issues in this dataset and showed that manually re-annotating a small portion of it leads to more accurate C-STS models. Despite these pioneering efforts, the lack of large and accurately annotated C-STS datasets remains a blocker for making progress on this task as evidenced by the subpar performance of the C-STS models. To address this training data need, we resort to Large Language Models (LLMs) to correct the condition statements and similarity ratings in the original dataset proposed by Deshpande et al. (2023). Our proposed method is able to re-annotate a large training dataset for the C-STS task with minimal manual effort. Importantly, by training a supervised C-STS model on our cleaned and re-annotated dataset, we achieve a 5.4% statistically significant improvement in Spearman correlation. The re-annotated dataset is available atthis https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper explores prompts and prompting in large language models (LLMs) as dynamic semiotic phenomena, drawing on Peirce's triadic model of signs, his nine sign types, and the Dynacom model of communication. The aim is to reconceptualize prompting not as a technical input mechanism but as a communicative and epistemic act involving an iterative process of sign formation, interpretation, and refinement. The theoretical foundation rests on Peirce's semiotics, particularly the interplay between representamen, object, and interpretant, and the typological richness of signs: qualisign, sinsign, legisign; icon, index, symbol; rheme, dicent, argument - alongside the interpretant triad captured in the Dynacom model. Analytically, the paper positions the LLM as a semiotic resource that generates interpretants in response to user prompts, thereby participating in meaning-making within shared universes of discourse. The findings suggest that prompting is a semiotic and communicative process that redefines how knowledge is organized, searched, interpreted, and co-constructed in digital environments. This perspective invites a reimagining of the theoretical and methodological foundations of knowledge organization and information seeking in the age of computational semiosis

  Recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have garnered significant attention, offering a promising pathway toward artificial general intelligence (AGI). Among the essential capabilities required for AGI, creativity has emerged as a critical trait for MLLMs, with association serving as its foundation. Association reflects a model' s ability to think creatively, making it vital to evaluate and understand. While several frameworks have been proposed to assess associative ability, they often overlook the inherent ambiguity in association tasks, which arises from the divergent nature of associations and undermines the reliability of evaluations. To address this issue, we decompose ambiguity into two types-internal ambiguity and external ambiguity-and introduce AssoCiAm, a benchmark designed to evaluate associative ability while circumventing the ambiguity through a hybrid computational method. We then conduct extensive experiments on MLLMs, revealing a strong positive correlation between cognition and association. Additionally, we observe that the presence of ambiguity in the evaluation process causes MLLMs' behavior to become more random-like. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of our method in ensuring more accurate and reliable evaluations. See Project Page for the data and codes.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has significantly advanced the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet the reliability of these reasoning chains remains a critical challenge. A widely held "cascading failure" hypothesis suggests that errors are most detrimental when they occur early in the reasoning process. This paper challenges that assumption through systematic error-injection experiments, revealing a counter-intuitive phenomenon we term "Late-Stage Fragility": errors introduced in the later stages of a CoT chain are significantly more likely to corrupt the final answer than identical errors made at the beginning. To address this specific vulnerability, we introduce the Adaptive Self-Correction Chain-of-Thought (ASCoT) method. ASCoT employs a modular pipeline in which an Adaptive Verification Manager (AVM) operates first, followed by the Multi-Perspective Self-Correction Engine (MSCE). The AVM leverages a Positional Impact Score function I(k) that assigns different weights based on the position within the reasoning chains, addressing the Late-Stage Fragility issue by identifying and prioritizing high-risk, late-stage steps. Once these critical steps are identified, the MSCE applies robust, dual-path correction specifically to the failure parts. Extensive experiments on benchmarks such as GSM8K and MATH demonstrate that ASCoT achieves outstanding accuracy, outperforming strong baselines, including standard CoT. Our work underscores the importance of diagnosing specific failure modes in LLM reasoning and advocates for a shift from uniform verification strategies to adaptive, vulnerability-aware correction mechanisms.

  Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong performance in many reasoning benchmarks. However, recent studies have pointed to memorization, rather than generalization, as one of the leading causes for such performance. LLMs, in fact, are susceptible to content variations, demonstrating a lack of robust planning or symbolic abstractions supporting their reasoning process. To improve reliability, many attempts have been made to combine LLMs with symbolic methods. Nevertheless, existing approaches fail to effectively leverage symbolic representations due to the challenges involved in developing reliable and scalable verification mechanisms. In this paper, we propose to overcome such limitations by synthesizing high-quality symbolic reasoning trajectories with stepwise pseudo-labels at scale via Monte Carlo estimation. A Process Reward Model (PRM) can be efficiently trained based on the synthesized data and then used to select more symbolic trajectories. The trajectories are then employed with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to improve logical reasoning and generalization. Our results on benchmarks (i.e., FOLIO and LogicAsker) show the effectiveness of the proposed method with gains on frontier and open-weight models. Moreover, additional experiments on claim verification data reveal that fine-tuning on the generated symbolic reasoning trajectories enhances out-of-domain generalizability, suggesting the potential impact of the proposed method in enhancing planning and logical reasoning.

  Metadata extraction is essential for cataloging and preserving datasets, enabling effective research discovery and reproducibility, especially given the current exponential growth in scientific research. While Masader (Alyafeai et al.,2021) laid the groundwork for extracting a wide range of metadata attributes from Arabic NLP datasets' scholarly articles, it relies heavily on manual annotation. In this paper, we present MOLE, a framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically extract metadata attributes from scientific papers covering datasets of languages other than Arabic. Our schema-driven methodology processes entire documents across multiple input formats and incorporates robust validation mechanisms for consistent output. Additionally, we introduce a new benchmark to evaluate the research progress on this task. Through systematic analysis of context length, few-shot learning, and web browsing integration, we demonstrate that modern LLMs show promising results in automating this task, highlighting the need for further future work improvements to ensure consistent and reliable performance. We release the code:this https URLand dataset:this https URLfor the research community.

  LLM-as-a-Judge employs large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4, to evaluate the quality of LLM-generated responses, gaining popularity for its cost-effectiveness and strong alignment with human evaluations. However, training proxy judge models using evaluation data generated by powerful teacher models introduces a critical yet previously overlooked issue: teacher preference bias, where the proxy judge model learns a biased preference for responses from the teacher model. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel setting that incorporates an additional assistant model, which is not biased toward the teacher model's responses, to complement the training data. Building on this setup, we introduce AGDe-Judge, a three-stage framework designed to debias from both the labels and feedbacks in the training data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AGDe-Judge effectively reduces teacher preference bias while maintaining strong performance across six evaluation benchmarks.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Language confusion -- where large language models (LLMs) generate unintended languages against the user's need -- remains a critical challenge, especially for English-centric models. We present the first mechanistic interpretability (MI) study of language confusion, combining behavioral benchmarking with neuron-level analysis. Using the Language Confusion Benchmark (LCB), we show that confusion points (CPs) -- specific positions where language switches occur -- are central to this phenomenon. Through layer-wise analysis with TunedLens and targeted neuron attribution, we reveal that transition failures in the final layers drive confusion. We further demonstrate that editing a small set of critical neurons, identified via comparative analysis with a multilingual-tuned counterpart, substantially mitigates confusion while largely preserving general competence and fluency. Our approach matches multilingual alignment in confusion reduction for many languages and yields cleaner, higher-quality outputs. These findings provide new insights into the internal dynamics of LLMs and highlight neuron-level interventions as a promising direction for robust, interpretable multilingual language modeling.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Language Models (LMs) are typically tuned with human preferences to produce helpful responses, but the impact of preference tuning on the ability to handle culturally diverse queries remains understudied. In this paper, we systematically analyze how native human cultural preferences can be incorporated into the preference learning process to train more culturally aware LMs. We introduce \textbf{CARE}, a multilingual resource containing 3,490 culturally specific questions and 31.7k responses with human judgments. We demonstrate how a modest amount of high-quality native preferences improves cultural awareness across various LMs, outperforming larger generic preference data. Our analyses reveal that models with stronger initial cultural performance benefit more from alignment, leading to gaps among models developed in different regions with varying access to culturally relevant data.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Avoiding the propagation of undue (binary) gender inferences and default masculine language remains a key challenge towards inclusive multilingual technologies, particularly when translating into languages with extensive gendered morphology. Gender-neutral translation (GNT) represents a linguistic strategy towards fairer communication across languages. However, research on GNT is limited to a few resources and language pairs. To address this gap, we introduce mGeNTE, an expert-curated resource, and use it to conduct the first systematic multilingual evaluation of inclusive translation with state-of-the-art instruction-following language models (LMs). Experiments on en-es/de/it/el reveal that while models can recognize when neutrality is appropriate, they cannot consistently produce neutral translations, limiting their usability. To probe this behavior, we enrich our evaluation with interpretability analyses that identify task-relevant features and offer initial insights into the internal dynamics of LM-based GNT.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Ambiguity resolution is key to effective communication. While humans effortlessly address ambiguity through conversational grounding strategies, the extent to which current language models can emulate these strategies remains unclear. In this work, we examine referential ambiguity in image-based question answering by introducing RACQUET, a carefully curated dataset targeting distinct aspects of ambiguity. Through a series of evaluations, we reveal significant limitations and problems of overconfidence of state-of-the-art large multimodal language models in addressing ambiguity in their responses. The overconfidence issue becomes particularly relevant for RACQUET-BIAS, a subset designed to analyze a critical yet underexplored problem: failing to address ambiguity leads to stereotypical, socially biased responses. Our results underscore the urgency of equipping models with robust strategies to deal with uncertainty without resorting to undesirable stereotypes.

  Health informatics research is characterized by diverse data modalities, rapid knowledge expansion, and the need to integrate insights across biomedical science, data analytics, and clinical practice. These characteristics make it particularly well-suited for agent-based approaches that can automate knowledge exploration, manage complex workflows, and generate clinically meaningful outputs. Recent progress in large language model (LLM)-based agents has demonstrated promising capabilities in literature synthesis, data analysis, and even end-to-end research execution. However, existing systems remain limited for health informatics because they lack mechanisms to interpret medical visualizations and often overlook domain-specific quality requirements. To address these gaps, we introduce OpenLens AI, a fully automated framework tailored to health informatics. OpenLens AI integrates specialized agents for literature review, data analysis, code generation, and manuscript preparation, enhanced by vision-language feedback for medical visualization and quality control for reproducibility. The framework automates the entire research pipeline, producing publication-ready LaTeX manuscripts with transparent and traceable workflows, thereby offering a domain-adapted solution for advancing health informatics research.

  Carbapenemase-Producing Enterobacteriace poses a critical concern for infection prevention and control in hospitals. However, predictive modeling of previously highlighted CPE-associated risks such as readmission, mortality, and extended length of stay (LOS) remains underexplored, particularly with modern deep learning approaches. This study introduces an eXplainable AI modeling framework to investigate CPE impact on patient outcomes from Electronic Medical Records data of an Irish hospital. We analyzed an inpatient dataset from an Irish acute hospital, incorporating diagnostic codes, ward transitions, patient demographics, infection-related variables and contact network features. Several Transformer-based architectures were benchmarked alongside traditional machine learning models. Clinical outcomes were predicted, and XAI techniques were applied to interpret model decisions. Our framework successfully demonstrated the utility of Transformer-based models, with TabTransformer consistently outperforming baselines across multiple clinical prediction tasks, especially for CPE acquisition (AUROC and sensitivity). We found infection-related features, including historical hospital exposure, admission context, and network centrality measures, to be highly influential in predicting patient outcomes and CPE acquisition risk. Explainability analyses revealed that features like "Area of Residence", "Admission Ward" and prior admissions are key risk factors. Network variables like "Ward PageRank" also ranked highly, reflecting the potential value of structural exposure information. This study presents a robust and explainable AI framework for analyzing complex EMR data to identify key risk factors and predict CPE-related outcomes. Our findings underscore the superior performance of the Transformer models and highlight the importance of diverse clinical and network features.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multimodal large language models have various practical applications that demand strong reasoning abilities. Despite recent advancements, these models still struggle to solve complex geometric problems. A key challenge stems from the lack of high-quality image-text pair datasets for understanding geometric images. Furthermore, most template-based data synthesis pipelines typically fail to generalize to questions beyond their predefined templates. In this paper, we bridge this gap by introducing a complementary process of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) into the data generation pipeline. By adopting RLVR to refine captions for geometric images synthesized from 50 basic geometric relations and using reward signals derived from mathematical problem-solving tasks, our pipeline successfully captures the key features of geometry problem-solving. This enables better task generalization and yields non-trivial improvements. Furthermore, even in out-of-distribution scenarios, the generated dataset enhances the general reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models, yielding accuracy improvements of $2.8\%\text{-}4.8\%$ in statistics, arithmetic, algebraic, and numerical tasks with non-geometric input images of MathVista and MathVerse, along with $2.4\%\text{-}3.9\%$ improvements in Art, Design, Tech, and Engineering tasks in MMMU.

  Adapting advertisements for multilingual audiences requires more than simple text translation; it demands preservation of visual consistency, spatial alignment, and stylistic integrity across diverse languages and formats. We introduce a structured framework that combines automated components with human oversight to address the complexities of advertisement localization. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to integrate scene text detection, inpainting, machine translation (MT), and text reimposition specifically for accelerating ad localization evaluation workflows. Qualitative results across six locales demonstrate that our approach produces semantically accurate and visually coherent localized advertisements, suitable for deployment in real-world workflows.

  Medical decision-making often involves integrating knowledge from multiple clinical specialties, typically achieved through multidisciplinary teams. Inspired by this collaborative process, recent work has leveraged large language models (LLMs) in multi-agent collaboration frameworks to emulate expert teamwork. While these approaches improve reasoning through agent interaction, they are limited by static, pre-assigned roles, which hinder adaptability and dynamic knowledge integration. To address these limitations, we propose KAMAC, a Knowledge-driven Adaptive Multi-Agent Collaboration framework that enables LLM agents to dynamically form and expand expert teams based on the evolving diagnostic context. KAMAC begins with one or more expert agents and then conducts a knowledge-driven discussion to identify and fill knowledge gaps by recruiting additional specialists as needed. This supports flexible, scalable collaboration in complex clinical scenarios, with decisions finalized through reviewing updated agent comments. Experiments on two real-world medical benchmarks demonstrate that KAMAC significantly outperforms both single-agent and advanced multi-agent methods, particularly in complex clinical scenarios (i.e., cancer prognosis) requiring dynamic, cross-specialty expertise.

  With the growing adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) in automating complex, multi-agent workflows, organizations face mounting risks from errors, emergent behaviors, and systemic failures that current evaluation methods fail to capture. We present AgentCompass, the first evaluation framework designed specifically for post-deployment monitoring and debugging of agentic workflows. AgentCompass models the reasoning process of expert debuggers through a structured, multi-stage analytical pipeline: error identification and categorization, thematic clustering, quantitative scoring, and strategic summarization. The framework is further enhanced with a dual memory system-episodic and semantic-that enables continual learning across executions. Through collaborations with design partners, we demonstrate the framework's practical utility on real-world deployments, before establishing its efficacy against the publicly available TRAIL benchmark. AgentCompass achieves state-of-the-art results on key metrics, while uncovering critical issues missed in human annotations, underscoring its role as a robust, developer-centric tool for reliable monitoring and improvement of agentic systems in production.

  Natural Language to SQL (NL2SQL) provides a new model-centric paradigm that simplifies database access for non-technical users by converting natural language queries into SQL commands. Recent advancements, particularly those integrating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, have made significant strides in enhancing NL2SQL performance. However, challenges such as inaccurate task decomposition and keyword extraction by LLMs remain major bottlenecks, often leading to errors in SQL generation. While existing datasets aim to mitigate these issues by fine-tuning models, they struggle with over-fragmentation of tasks and lack of domain-specific keyword annotations, limiting their effectiveness. To address these limitations, we present DeKeyNLU, a novel dataset which contains 1,500 meticulously annotated QA pairs aimed at refining task decomposition and enhancing keyword extraction precision for the RAG pipeline. Fine-tuned with DeKeyNLU, we propose DeKeySQL, a RAG-based NL2SQL pipeline that employs three distinct modules for user question understanding, entity retrieval, and generation to improve SQL generation accuracy. We benchmarked multiple model configurations within DeKeySQL RAG pipeline. Experimental results demonstrate that fine-tuning with DeKeyNLU significantly improves SQL generation accuracy on both BIRD (62.31% to 69.10%) and Spider (84.2% to 88.7%) dev datasets.

  LLMs have shown strong performance on human-centric reasoning tasks. While previous evaluations have explored whether LLMs can infer intentions or detect deception, they often overlook the individualized reasoning styles that influence how people interpret and act in social contexts. Social deduction games (SDGs) provide a natural testbed for evaluating individualized reasoning styles, where different players may adopt diverse but contextually valid reasoning strategies under identical conditions. To address this, we introduce InMind, a cognitively grounded evaluation framework designed to assess whether LLMs can capture and apply personalized reasoning styles in SDGs. InMind enhances structured gameplay data with round-level strategy traces and post-game reflections, collected under both Observer and Participant modes. It supports four cognitively motivated tasks that jointly evaluate both static alignment and dynamic adaptation. As a case study, we apply InMind to the game Avalon, evaluating 11 state-of-the-art LLMs. General-purpose LLMs, even GPT-4o frequently rely on lexical cues, struggling to anchor reflections in temporal gameplay or adapt to evolving strategies. In contrast, reasoning-enhanced LLMs like DeepSeek-R1 exhibit early signs of style-sensitive reasoning. These findings reveal key limitations in current LLMs' capacity for individualized, adaptive reasoning, and position InMind as a step toward cognitively aligned human-AI interaction.

  Recent studies have shown that carefully designed workflows coordinating large language models(LLMs) significantly enhance task-solving capabilities compared to using a single model. While an increasing number of works focus on autonomous workflow construction, most existing approaches rely solely on historical experience, leading to limitations in efficiency and adaptability. We argue that while historical experience is valuable, workflow construction should also flexibly respond to the unique characteristics of each task. To this end, we propose an a priori dynamic framework for automated workflow construction. Our framework first leverages Q-table learning to optimize the decision space, guiding agent decisions and enabling effective use of historical experience. At the same time, agents evaluate the current task progress and make a priori decisions regarding the next executing agent, allowing the system to proactively select the more suitable workflow structure for each given task. Additionally, we incorporate mechanisms such as cold-start initialization, early stopping, and pruning to further improve system efficiency. Experimental evaluations on four benchmark datasets demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of our approach. Compared to state-of-the-art baselines, our method achieves an average improvement of 4.05%, while reducing workflow construction and inference costs to only 30.68%-48.31% of those required by existing methods.

  The development and evaluation of social capabilities in AI agents require complex environments where competitive and cooperative behaviours naturally emerge. While game-theoretic properties can explain why certain teams or agent populations outperform others, more abstract behaviours, such as convention following, are harder to control in training and evaluation settings. The Melting Pot contest is a social AI evaluation suite designed to assess the cooperation capabilities of AI systems. In this paper, we apply a Bayesian approach known as Measurement Layouts to infer the capability profiles of multi-agent systems in the Melting Pot contest. We show that these capability profiles not only predict future performance within the Melting Pot suite but also reveal the underlying prosocial abilities of agents. Our analysis indicates that while higher prosocial capabilities sometimes correlate with better performance, this is not a universal trend-some lower-scoring agents exhibit stronger cooperation abilities. Furthermore, we find that top-performing contest submissions are more likely to achieve high scores in scenarios where prosocial capabilities are not required. These findings, together with reports that the contest winner used a hard-coded solution tailored to specific environments, suggest that at least one top-performing team may have optimised for conditions where cooperation was not necessary, potentially exploiting limitations in the evaluation framework. We provide recommendations for improving the annotation of cooperation demands and propose future research directions to account for biases introduced by different testing environments. Our results demonstrate that Measurement Layouts offer both strong predictive accuracy and actionable insights, contributing to a more transparent and generalisable approach to evaluating AI systems in complex social settings.

  Benchmarks such as SWE-bench and ARC-AGI demonstrate how shared datasets accelerate progress toward artificial general intelligence (AGI). We introduce VCBench, the first benchmark for predicting founder success in venture capital (VC), a domain where signals are sparse, outcomes are uncertain, and even top investors perform modestly. At inception, the market index achieves a precision of 1.9%. Y Combinator outperforms the index by a factor of 1.7x, while tier-1 firms are 2.9x better. VCBench provides 9,000 anonymized founder profiles, standardized to preserve predictive features while resisting identity leakage, with adversarial tests showing more than 90% reduction in re-identification risk. We evaluate nine state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs). DeepSeek-V3 delivers over six times the baseline precision, GPT-4o achieves the highest F0.5, and most models surpass human benchmarks. Designed as a public and evolving resource available atthis http URL, VCBench establishes a community-driven standard for reproducible and privacy-preserving evaluation of AGI in early-stage venture forecasting.

  Web agents powered by large language models (LLMs) can autonomously perform complex, multistep tasks in dynamic web environments. However, current evaluations mostly focus on the overall success while overlooking intermediate errors. This limits insight into failure modes and hinders systematic improvement.

To address this gap, we propose a modular evaluation framework that decomposes agent pipelines into interpretable stages for detailed error analysis.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multivariate Time Series Forecasting plays a key role in many applications. Recent works have explored using Large Language Models for MTSF to take advantage of their reasoning abilities. However, many methods treat LLMs as end-to-end forecasters, which often leads to a loss of numerical precision and forces LLMs to handle patterns beyond their intended design. Alternatively, methods that attempt to align textual and time series modalities within latent space frequently encounter alignment difficulty. In this paper, we propose to treat LLMs not as standalone forecasters, but as semantic guidance modules within a dual-stream framework. We propose DualSG, a dual-stream framework that provides explicit semantic guidance, where LLMs act as Semantic Guides to refine rather than replace traditional predictions. As part of DualSG, we introduce Time Series Caption, an explicit prompt format that summarizes trend patterns in natural language and provides interpretable context for LLMs, rather than relying on implicit alignment between text and time series in the latent space. We also design a caption-guided fusion module that explicitly models inter-variable relationships while reducing noise and computation. Experiments on real-world datasets from diverse domains show that DualSG consistently outperforms 15 state-of-the-art baselines, demonstrating the value of explicitly combining numerical forecasting with semantic guidance.

  In this paper, we tackle the problem of learning to play 3v3 multi-drone volleyball, a new embodied competitive task that requires both high-level strategic coordination and low-level agile control. The task is turn-based, multi-agent, and physically grounded, posing significant challenges due to its long-horizon dependencies, tight inter-agent coupling, and the underactuated dynamics of quadrotors. To address this, we propose Hierarchical Co-Self-Play (HCSP), a hierarchical reinforcement learning framework that separates centralized high-level strategic decision-making from decentralized low-level motion control. We design a three-stage population-based training pipeline to enable both strategy and skill to emerge from scratch without expert demonstrations: (I) training diverse low-level skills, (II) learning high-level strategy via self-play with fixed low-level skills, and (III) joint fine-tuning through co-self-play. Experiments show that HCSP achieves superior performance, outperforming non-hierarchical self-play and rule-based hierarchical baselines with an average 82.9% win rate and a 71.5% win rate against the two-stage variant. Moreover, co-self-play leads to emergent team behaviors such as role switching and coordinated formations, demonstrating the effectiveness of our hierarchical design and training scheme.
