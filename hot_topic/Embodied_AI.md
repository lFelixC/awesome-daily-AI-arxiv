  Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models are emerging as a next-generation paradigm for robotics. We introduce dVLA, a diffusion-based VLA that leverages a multimodal chain-of-thought to unify visual perception, language reasoning, and robotic control in a single system. dVLA jointly optimizes perception, language understanding, and action under a single diffusion objective, enabling stronger cross-modal reasoning and better generalization to novel instructions and objects. For practical deployment, we mitigate inference latency by incorporating two acceleration strategies, a prefix attention mask and KV caching, yielding up to around times speedup at test-time inference. We evaluate dVLA in both simulation and the real world: on the LIBERO benchmark, it achieves state-of-the-art performance with a 96.4% average success rate, consistently surpassing both discrete and continuous action policies; on a real Franka robot, it succeeds across a diverse task suite, including a challenging bin-picking task that requires multi-step planning, demonstrating robust real-world performance. Together, these results underscore the promise of unified diffusion frameworks for practical, high-performance VLA robotics.

- **[WorldGym: World Model as An Environment for Policy Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00613)**  `arXiv:2506.00613`  `cs.RO` `cs.AI`

  Evaluating robot control policies is difficult: real-world testing is costly, and handcrafted simulators require manual effort to improve in realism and generality. We propose a world-model-based policy evaluation environment (WorldGym), an autoregressive, action-conditioned video generation model which serves as a proxy to real world environments. Policies are evaluated via Monte Carlo rollouts in the world model, with a vision-language model providing rewards. We evaluate a set of VLA-based real-robot policies in the world model using only initial frames from real robots, and show that policy success rates within the world model highly correlate with real-world success rates. Moreoever, we show that WorldGym is able to preserve relative policy rankings across different policy versions, sizes, and training checkpoints. Due to requiring only a single start frame as input, the world model further enables efficient evaluation of robot policies' generalization ability on novel tasks and environments. We find that modern VLA-based robot policies still struggle to distinguish object shapes and can become distracted by adversarial facades of objects. While generating highly realistic object interaction remains challenging, WorldGym faithfully emulates robot motions and offers a practical starting point for safe and reproducible policy evaluation before deployment.

- **[MLA: A Multisensory Language-Action Model for Multimodal Understanding and Forecasting in Robotic Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26642)**  `arXiv:2509.26642`  `cs.RO`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision-language-action models (VLAs) have shown generalization capabilities in robotic manipulation tasks by inheriting from vision-language models (VLMs) and learning action generation. Most VLA models focus on interpreting vision and language to generate actions, whereas robots must perceive and interact within the spatial-physical world. This gap highlights the need for a comprehensive understanding of robotic-specific multisensory information, which is crucial for achieving complex and contact-rich control. To this end, we introduce a multisensory language-action (MLA) model that collaboratively perceives heterogeneous sensory modalities and predicts future multisensory objectives to facilitate physical world modeling. Specifically, to enhance perceptual representations, we propose an encoder-free multimodal alignment scheme that innovatively repurposes the large language model itself as a perception module, directly interpreting multimodal cues by aligning 2D images, 3D point clouds, and tactile tokens through positional correspondence. To further enhance MLA's understanding of physical dynamics, we design a future multisensory generation post-training strategy that enables MLA to reason about semantic, geometric, and interaction information, providing more robust conditions for action generation. For evaluation, the MLA model outperforms the previous state-of-the-art 2D and 3D VLA methods by 12% and 24% in complex, contact-rich real-world tasks, respectively, while also demonstrating improved generalization to unseen configurations.

- **[MUVLA: Learning to Explore Object Navigation via Map Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25966)**  `arXiv:2509.25966`  `cs.RO`

  In this paper, we present MUVLA, a Map Understanding Vision-Language-Action model tailored for object navigation. It leverages semantic map abstractions to unify and structure historical information, encoding spatial context in a compact and consistent form. MUVLA takes the current and history observations, as well as the semantic map, as inputs and predicts the action sequence based on the description of goal object. Furthermore, it amplifies supervision through reward-guided return modeling based on dense short-horizon progress signals, enabling the model to develop a detailed understanding of action value for reward maximization. MUVLA employs a three-stage training pipeline: learning map-level spatial understanding, imitating behaviors from mixed-quality demonstrations, and reward amplification. This strategy allows MUVLA to unify diverse demonstrations into a robust spatial representation and generate more rational exploration strategies. Experiments on HM3D and Gibson benchmarks demonstrate that MUVLA achieves great generalization and learns effective exploration behaviors even from low-quality or partially successful trajectories.

- **[TacRefineNet: Tactile-Only Grasp Refinement Between Arbitrary In-Hand Object Poses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25746)**  `arXiv:2509.25746`  `cs.RO`

  Despite progress in both traditional dexterous grasping pipelines and recent Vision-Language-Action (VLA) approaches, the grasp execution stage remains prone to pose inaccuracies, especially in long-horizon tasks, which undermines overall performance. To address this "last-mile" challenge, we propose TacRefineNet, a tactile-only framework that achieves fine in-hand pose refinement of known objects in arbitrary target poses using multi-finger fingertip sensing. Our method iteratively adjusts the end-effector pose based on tactile feedback, aligning the object to the desired configuration. We design a multi-branch policy network that fuses tactile inputs from multiple fingers along with proprioception to predict precise control updates. To train this policy, we combine large-scale simulated data from a physics-based tactile model in MuJoCo with real-world data collected from a physical system. Comparative experiments show that pretraining on simulated data and fine-tuning with a small amount of real data significantly improves performance over simulation-only training. Extensive real-world experiments validate the effectiveness of the method, achieving millimeter-level grasp accuracy using only tactile input. To our knowledge, this is the first method to enable arbitrary in-hand pose refinement via multi-finger tactile sensing alone. Project website is available atthis https URL

- **[VLA Model Post-Training via Action-Chunked PPO and Self Behavior Cloning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25718)**  `arXiv:2509.25718`  `cs.RO`

  Reinforcement learning (RL) is a promising avenue for post-training vision-language-action (VLA) models, but practical deployment is hindered by sparse rewards and unstable training. This work mitigates these challenges by introducing an action chunk based on proximal policy optimization (PPO) with behavior cloning using self-collected demonstrations. Aggregating consecutive actions into chunks improves the temporal consistency of the policy and the density of informative feedback. In addition, an auxiliary behavior cloning loss is applied with a dynamically updated demonstration buffer that continually collects high-quality task trials during training. The relative weight between the action-chunked PPO objective and the self behavior clone auxiliary loss is adapted online to stabilize the post-training process. Experiments on the MetaWorld benchmark indicate improved performance over supervised fine-tuning, achieving a high success rate (0.93) and few steps to success (42.17). These results demonstrate the viability of RL for VLA post-training and help lay the groundwork for downstream VLA applications.

  Large Vision-Language Action (VLA) models have shown significant potential for embodied AI. However, their predominant training via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) limits generalization due to susceptibility to compounding errors under distribution shifts. Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a path to overcome these limitations by optimizing for task objectives via trial-and-error, yet a systematic understanding of its specific generalization benefits for VLAs compared to SFT is lacking. To address this, our study introduces a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating VLA generalization and systematically investigates the impact of RL fine-tuning across diverse visual, semantic, and execution dimensions. Our extensive experiments reveal that RL fine-tuning, particularly with PPO, significantly enhances generalization in semantic understanding and execution robustness over SFT, while maintaining comparable visual robustness. We identify PPO as a more effective RL algorithm for VLAs than LLM-derived methods like DPO and GRPO. We also develop a simple recipe for efficient PPO training on VLAs, and demonstrate its practical utility for improving VLA generalization. The project page is atthis https URL

- **[Seeing Space and Motion: Enhancing Latent Actions with Spatial and Dynamic Awareness for VLA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26251)**  `arXiv:2509.26251`  `cs.CV`

  Latent Action Models (LAMs) enable Vision- Language-Action (VLA) systems to learn semantic action rep- resentations from large-scale unannotated data. Yet, we identify two bottlenecks of LAMs: 1) the commonly adopted end-to-end trained image encoder suffers from poor spatial understanding; 2) LAMs can be fragile when input frames are distant, leading to limited temporal perception. Such factors inevitably hinder stable and clear action modeling. To this end, we propose Farsighted-LAM, a latent action framework with geometry- aware spatial encoding and multi-scale temporal modeling, capturing structural priors and dynamic motion patterns from consecutive frames. We further propose SSM-VLA, an end- to-end VLA framework built upon Farsighted-LAM, which integrates structured perception with a visual Chain-of-Thought module to explicitly reason about environmental dynamics, enhancing decision consistency and interpretability. We validate SSM-VLA on multiple VLA tasks in both simulation and real- world settings, and achieve state-of-the-art performance. Our results demonstrate that our strategy of combining geometry- aware modeling, temporal coherence, and explicit reasoning is effective in enhancing the robustness and generalizability of embodied intelligence.
