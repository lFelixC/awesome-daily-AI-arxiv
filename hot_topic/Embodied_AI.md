  Current Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models are often constrained by a rigid, static interaction paradigm, which lacks the ability to see, hear, speak, and act concurrently as well as handle real-time user interruptions dynamically. This hinders seamless embodied collaboration, resulting in an inflexible and unresponsive user experience. To address these limitations, we introduce VITA-E, a novel embodied interaction framework designed for both behavioral concurrency and nearly real-time interruption. The core of our approach is a dual-model architecture where two parallel VLA instances operate as an ``Active Model'' and a ``Standby Model'', allowing the embodied agent to observe its environment, listen to user speech, provide verbal responses, and execute actions, all concurrently and interruptibly, mimicking human-like multitasking capabilities. We further propose a ``model-as-controller'' paradigm, where we fine-tune the VLM to generate special tokens that serve as direct system-level commands, coupling the model's reasoning with the system's behavior. Experiments conducted on a physical humanoid platform demonstrate that VITA-E can reliably handle complex interactive scenarios. Our framework is compatible with various dual-system VLA models, achieving an extremely high success rate on emergency stops and speech interruptions while also successfully performing concurrent speech and action. This represents a significant step towards more natural and capable embodied assistants.

  The pursuit of robot generalists - instructable agents capable of performing diverse tasks across diverse environments - demands rigorous and scalable evaluation. Yet real-world testing of robot policies remains fundamentally constrained: it is labor-intensive, slow, unsafe at scale, and difficult to reproduce. Existing simulation benchmarks are similarly limited, as they train and test policies within the same synthetic domains and cannot assess models trained from real-world demonstrations or alternative simulation environments. As policies expand in scope and complexity, these barriers only intensify, since defining "success" in robotics often hinges on nuanced human judgments of execution quality. In this paper, we introduce a new benchmarking framework that overcomes these challenges by shifting VLA evaluation into large-scale simulated environments augmented with online human feedback. Leveraging advances in vision-language models, 2D-to-3D generative modeling, and differentiable rendering, our approach automatically converts video demonstrations from widely used robot datasets into simulated counterparts. Within these digital twins, we assess VLA policies using both automated VLM-guided scoring and scalable human preference judgments collected from crowdworkers, transforming human involvement from tedious scene setup, resetting, and safety supervision into lightweight preference comparisons. To measure robustness, we systematically perturb simulated environments along multiple axes, such as textures and object placements, stress-testing policy generalization under controlled variation. The result is a continuously evolving, reproducible, and scalable benchmark for real-world trained robot manipulation policies, addressing a critical missing capability in today's robotics landscape.

- **[UrbanVLA: A Vision-Language-Action Model for Urban Micromobility](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23576)**  `arXiv:2510.23576`  `cs.RO` `cs.AI` `cs.CV`

  Urban micromobility applications, such as delivery robots, demand reliable navigation across large-scale urban environments while following long-horizon route instructions. This task is particularly challenging due to the dynamic and unstructured nature of real-world city areas, yet most existing navigation methods remain tailored to short-scale and controllable scenarios. Effective urban micromobility requires two complementary levels of navigation skills: low-level capabilities such as point-goal reaching and obstacle avoidance, and high-level capabilities, such as route-visual alignment. To this end, we propose UrbanVLA, a route-conditioned Vision-Language-Action (VLA) framework designed for scalable urban navigation. Our method explicitly aligns noisy route waypoints with visual observations during execution, and subsequently plans trajectories to drive the robot. To enable UrbanVLA to master both levels of navigation, we employ a two-stage training pipeline. The process begins with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) using simulated environments and trajectories parsed from web videos. This is followed by Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) on a mixture of simulation and real-world data, which enhances the model's safety and adaptability in real-world settings. Experiments demonstrate that UrbanVLA surpasses strong baselines by more than 55% in the SocialNav task on MetaUrban. Furthermore, UrbanVLA achieves reliable real-world navigation, showcasing both scalability to large-scale urban environments and robustness against real-world uncertainties.

- **[Butter-Bench: Evaluating LLM Controlled Robots for Practical Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21860)**  `arXiv:2510.21860`  `cs.RO` `cs.AI`  
  _Callum Sharrock, Lukas Petersson, Hanna Petersson, Axel Backlund, Axel Wennstr√∂m, Kristoffer Nordstr√∂m, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present Butter-Bench, a benchmark evaluating large language model (LLM) controlled robots for practical intelligence, defined as the ability to navigate the messiness of the physical world. Current state-of-the-art robotic systems use a hierarchical architecture with LLMs in charge of high-level reasoning, and a Vision Language Action (VLA) model for low-level control. Butter-Bench evaluates the LLM part in isolation from the VLA. Although LLMs have repeatedly surpassed humans in evaluations requiring analytical intelligence, we find humans still outperform LLMs on Butter-Bench. The best LLMs score 40% on Butter-Bench, while the mean human score is 95%. LLMs struggled the most with multi-step spatial planning and social understanding. We also evaluate LLMs that are fine-tuned for embodied reasoning and conclude that this training does not improve their score on Butter-Bench.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this paper, we present Dexbotic, an open-source Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model toolbox based on PyTorch. It aims to provide a one-stop VLA research service for professionals in the field of embodied intelligence. It offers a codebase that supports multiple mainstream VLA policies simultaneously, allowing users to reproduce various VLA methods with just a single environment setup. The toolbox is experiment-centric, where the users can quickly develop new VLA experiments by simply modifying the Exp script. Moreover, we provide much stronger pretrained models to achieve great performance improvements for state-of-the-art VLA policies.

  Diffusion and flow matching models have emerged as powerful robot policies, enabling Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models to generalize across diverse scenes and instructions. Yet, when trained via imitation learning, their high generative capacity makes them sensitive to noise in human demonstrations: jerks, pauses, and jitter which reduce action coherence. Reduced action coherence causes instability and trajectory drift during deployment, failures that are catastrophic in fine-grained manipulation where precision is crucial. In this paper, we present Action Coherence Guidance (ACG) for VLA models, a training-free test-time guidance algorithm that improves action coherence and thereby yields performance gains. Evaluated on RoboCasa, DexMimicGen, and real-world SO-101 tasks, ACG consistently improves action coherence and boosts success rates across diverse manipulation tasks.

- **[Avi: Action from Volumetric Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21746)**  `arXiv:2510.21746`  `cs.RO`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We propose Avi, a novel 3D Vision-Language-Action (VLA) architecture that reframes robotic action generation as a problem of 3D perception and spatial reasoning, rather than low-level policy learning. While existing VLA models primarily operate on 2D visual inputs and are trained end-to-end on task-specific action policies, Avi leverages 3D point clouds and language-grounded scene understanding to compute actions through classical geometric transformations. Most notably, Avi does not train on previous action tokens, rather, we build upon a 3D Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) to generate the next point cloud and explicitly calculate the actions through classical transformations. This approach enables generalizable behaviors that are robust to occlusions, camera pose variations, and changes in viewpoint. By treating the robotic decision-making process as a structured reasoning task over 3D representations, Avi bridges the gap between high-level language instructions and low-level actuation without requiring opaque policy learning. Our preliminary results highlight the potential of 3D vision-language reasoning as a foundation for scalable, robust robotic systems. Check it out atthis https URL.

- **[FORGE-Tree: Diffusion-Forcing Tree Search for Long-Horizon Robot Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21744)**  `arXiv:2510.21744`  `cs.RO`  
  _Yanjia Huang, Shuo Liu, Sheng Liu, Qingxiao Xu, Mingyang Wu, Xiangbo Gao, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Long-horizon robot manipulation tasks remain challenging for Vision-Language-Action (VLA) policies due to drift and exposure bias, often denoise the entire trajectory with fixed hyperparameters, causing small geometric errors to compound across stages and offering no mechanism to allocate extra test-time compute where clearances are tight. To address these challenges, we introduce FORGE-Tree, a plug-in control layer that couples a stage-aligned Diffusion Forcing (DF) head with test-time Monte Carlo Tree Diffusion (MCTD). With a frozen VLA encoder, DF aligns timesteps to subtask stages; during inference we partially denoise only a target segment while keeping other tokens frozen, turning trajectory refinement into a sequence of local edits. We then apply Monte Carlo Tree Diffusion to select the next segment to refine. A scene graph supplies priors for expansion and geometry relation-aware scoring for rollouts, yielding tree-structured denoising whose performance scales with search budget while preserving the executed prefix. Evaluation on LIBERO, FORGE-Tree improves success rate by 13.4 to 17.2 pp over the native VLA baselines with both OpenVLA and Octo-Base. Gains remain consistent under comparable compute budgets, especially on long-horizon variants. Videos available at:this https URL

- **[FailSafe: Reasoning and Recovery from Failures in Vision-Language-Action Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01642)**  `arXiv:2510.01642`  `cs.RO`

  Recent advances in robotic manipulation have integrated low-level robotic control into Vision-Language Models (VLMs), extending them into Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models. Although state-of-the-art VLAs achieve strong performance in downstream robotic applications, supported by large-scale crowd-sourced robot training data, they still inevitably encounter failures during execution. Enabling robots to reason and recover from unpredictable and abrupt failures remains a critical challenge. Existing robotic manipulation datasets, collected in either simulation or the real world, primarily provide only ground-truth trajectories, leaving robots unable to recover once failures occur. Moreover, the few datasets that address failure detection typically offer only textual explanations, which are difficult to utilize directly in VLA models. To address this gap, we introduce FailSafe, a novel failure generation and recovery system that automatically produces diverse failure cases paired with executable recovery actions. FailSafe can be seamlessly applied to any manipulation task in any simulator, enabling scalable creation of failure action data. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we fine-tune LLaVa-OneVision-7B (LLaVa-OV-7B) to build FailSafe-VLM. Experimental results show that FailSafe-VLM successfully helps robotic arms detect and recover from potential failures, improving the performance of three state-of-the-art VLA models (pi0-FAST, OpenVLA, OpenVLA-OFT) by up to 22.6% on average across several tasks in Maniskill. Furthermore, FailSafe-VLM could generalize across different spatial configurations, camera viewpoints, object and robotic embodiments. We plan to release the FailSafe code to the community.

- **[World-Env: Leveraging World Model as a Virtual Environment for VLA Post-Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24948)**  `arXiv:2509.24948`  `cs.RO`  
  _Junjin Xiao, Yandan Yang, Xinyuan Chang, Ronghan Chen, Feng Xiong, Mu Xu, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models trained via imitation learning suffer from significant performance degradation in data-scarce scenarios due to their reliance on large-scale demonstration datasets. Although reinforcement learning (RL)-based post-training has proven effective in addressing data scarcity, its application to VLA models is hindered by the non-resettable nature of real-world environments. This limitation is particularly critical in high-risk domains such as industrial automation, where interactions often induce state changes that are costly or infeasible to revert. Furthermore, existing VLA approaches lack a reliable mechanism for detecting task completion, leading to redundant actions that reduce overall task success rates. To address these challenges, we propose World-Env, an RL-based post-training framework that replaces physical interaction with a low-cost, world model-based virtual simulator. World-Env consists of two key components: (1) a video-based world simulator that generates temporally consistent future visual observations, and (2) a vision-language model (VLM)-guided instant reflector that provides continuous reward signals and predicts action termination. This simulated environment enables VLA models to safely explore and generalize beyond their initial imitation learning distribution. Our method achieves notable performance gains with as few as five expert demonstrations per task. Experiments on complex robotic manipulation tasks demonstrate that World-Env effectively overcomes the data inefficiency, safety constraints, and inefficient execution of conventional VLA models that rely on real-world interaction, offering a practical and scalable solution for post-training in resource-constrained settings.

- **[AutoVLA: A Vision-Language-Action Model for End-to-End Autonomous Driving with Adaptive Reasoning and Reinforcement Fine-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13757)**  `arXiv:2506.13757`  `cs.CV`

  Recent advancements in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have shown promise for end-to-end autonomous driving by leveraging world knowledge and reasoning capabilities. However, current VLA models often struggle with physically infeasible action outputs, complex model structures, or unnecessarily long reasoning. In this paper, we propose AutoVLA, a novel VLA model that unifies reasoning and action generation within a single autoregressive generation model for end-to-end autonomous driving. AutoVLA performs semantic reasoning and trajectory planning directly from raw visual inputs and language instructions. We tokenize continuous trajectories into discrete, feasible actions, enabling direct integration into the language model. For training, we employ supervised fine-tuning to equip the model with dual thinking modes: fast thinking (trajectory-only) and slow thinking (enhanced with chain-of-thought reasoning). To further enhance planning performance and efficiency, we introduce a reinforcement fine-tuning method based on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), reducing unnecessary reasoning in straightforward scenarios. Extensive experiments across real-world and simulated datasets and benchmarks, including nuPlan, nuScenes, Waymo, and CARLA, demonstrate the competitive performance of AutoVLA in both open-loop and closed-loop settings. Qualitative results showcase the adaptive reasoning and accurate planning capabilities of AutoVLA in diverse scenarios.
