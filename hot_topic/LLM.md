  Large language models (LLMs) provide robots with powerful contextual reasoning abilities and a natural human interface. Yet, current LLM-enabled robots typically depend on cloud-hosted models, limiting their usability in environments with unreliable communication infrastructure, such as outdoor or industrial settings. We present PRISM, a framework for distilling small language model (SLM)-enabled robot planners that run on-device with minimal human supervision. Starting from an existing LLM-enabled planner, PRISM automatically synthesizes diverse tasks and environments, elicits plans from the LLM, and uses this synthetic dataset to distill a compact SLM as a drop-in replacement of the source model. We apply PRISM to three LLM-enabled planners for mapping and exploration, manipulation, and household assistance, and we demonstrate that PRISM improves the performance of Llama-3.2-3B from 10-20% of GPT-4o's performance to over 93% - using only synthetic data. We further demonstrate that the distilled planners generalize across heterogeneous robotic platforms (ground and aerial) and diverse environments (indoor and outdoor). We release all software, trained models, and datasets atthis https URL.

- **[ARRC: Advanced Reasoning Robot Control - Knowledge-Driven Autonomous Manipulation Using Retrieval-Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05547)**  `arXiv:2510.05547`  `cs.RO`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present ARRC (Advanced Reasoning Robot Control), a practical system that connects natural-language instructions to safe local robotic control by combining Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with RGB-D perception and guarded execution on an affordable robot arm. The system indexes curated robot knowledge (movement patterns, task templates, and safety heuristics) in a vector database, retrieves task-relevant context for each instruction, and conditions a large language model (LLM) to produce JSON-structured action plans. Plans are executed on a UFactory xArm 850 fitted with a Dynamixel-driven parallel gripper and an Intel RealSense D435 camera. Perception uses AprilTag detections fused with depth to produce object-centric metric poses. Execution is enforced via software safety gates: workspace bounds, speed and force caps, timeouts, and bounded retries. We describe the architecture, knowledge design, integration choices, and a reproducible evaluation protocol for tabletop scan, approach, and pick-place tasks. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach. Our design shows that RAG-based planning can substantially improve plan validity and adaptability while keeping perception and low-level control local to the robot.

- **[Active Semantic Perception](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05430)**  `arXiv:2510.05430`  `cs.RO`  
  _Huayi Tang, Pratik Chaudhari_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We develop an approach for active semantic perception which refers to using the semantics of the scene for tasks such as exploration. We build a compact, hierarchical multi-layer scene graph that can represent large, complex indoor environments at various levels of abstraction, e.g., nodes corresponding to rooms, objects, walls, windows etc. as well as fine-grained details of their geometry. We develop a procedure based on large language models (LLMs) to sample plausible scene graphs of unobserved regions that are consistent with partial observations of the scene. These samples are used to compute an information gain of a potential waypoint for sophisticated spatial reasoning, e.g., the two doors in the living room can lead to either a kitchen or a bedroom. We evaluate this approach in complex, realistic 3D indoor environments in simulation. We show using qualitative and quantitative experiments that our approach can pin down the semantics of the environment quicker and more accurately than baseline approaches.

- **[Emergent Coordination in Multi-Agent Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05174)**  `arXiv:2510.05174`  `cs.MA` `cs.AI`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  When are multi-agent LLM systems merely a collection of individual agents versus an integrated collective with higher-order structure? We introduce an information-theoretic framework to test -- in a purely data-driven way -- whether multi-agent systems show signs of higher-order structure. This information decomposition lets us measure whether dynamical emergence is present in multi-agent LLM systems, localize it, and distinguish spurious temporal coupling from performance-relevant cross-agent synergy. We implement both a practical criterion and an emergence capacity criterion operationalized as partial information decomposition of time-delayed mutual information (TDMI). We apply our framework to experiments using a simple guessing game without direct agent communication and only minimal group-level feedback with three randomized interventions. Groups in the control condition exhibit strong temporal synergy but only little coordinated alignment across agents. Assigning a persona to each agent introduces stable identity-linked differentiation. Combining personas with an instruction to ``think about what other agents might do'' shows identity-linked differentiation and goal-directed complementarity across agents. Taken together, our framework establishes that multi-agent LLM systems can be steered with prompt design from mere aggregates to higher-order collectives. Our results are robust across emergence measures and entropy estimators, and not explained by coordination-free baselines or temporal dynamics alone. Without attributing human-like cognition to the agents, the patterns of interaction we observe mirror well-established principles of collective intelligence in human groups: effective performance requires both alignment on shared objectives and complementary contributions across members.

- **[QLLM: Do We Really Need a Mixing Network for Credit Assignment in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12961)**  `arXiv:2504.12961`  `cs.MA` `cs.AI`  
  _Zhouyang Jiang, Bin Zhang, Airong Wei, Zhiwei Xu_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Credit assignment has remained a fundamental challenge in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). Previous studies have primarily addressed this issue through value decomposition methods under the centralized training with decentralized execution paradigm, where neural networks are utilized to approximate the nonlinear relationship between individual Q-values and the global Q-value. Although these approaches have achieved considerable success in various benchmark tasks, they still suffer from several limitations, including imprecise attribution of contributions, limited interpretability, and poor scalability in high-dimensional state spaces. To address these challenges, we propose a novel algorithm, \textbf{QLLM}, which facilitates the automatic construction of credit assignment functions using large language models (LLMs). Specifically, the concept of \textbf{TFCAF} is introduced, wherein the credit allocation process is represented as a direct and expressive nonlinear functional formulation. A custom-designed \textit{coder-evaluator} framework is further employed to guide the generation, verification, and refinement of executable code by LLMs, significantly mitigating issues such as hallucination and shallow reasoning during inference. Extensive experiments conducted on several standard MARL benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art baselines. Moreover, QLLM exhibits strong generalization capability and maintains compatibility with a wide range of MARL algorithms that utilize mixing networks, positioning it as a promising and versatile solution for complex multi-agent scenarios.

- **[Agent+P: Guiding UI Agents via Symbolic Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06042)**  `arXiv:2510.06042`  `cs.MA`  
  _Shang Ma, Xusheng Xiao, Yanfang Ye_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Model (LLM)-based UI agents show great promise for UI automation but often hallucinate in long-horizon tasks due to their lack of understanding of the global UI transition structure. To address this, we introduce AGENT+P, a novel framework that leverages symbolic planning to guide LLM-based UI agents. Specifically, we model an app's UI transition structure as a UI Transition Graph (UTG), which allows us to reformulate the UI automation task as a pathfinding problem on the UTG. This further enables an off-the-shelf symbolic planner to generate a provably correct and optimal high-level plan, preventing the agent from redundant exploration and guiding the agent to achieve the automation goals. AGENT+P is designed as a plug-and-play framework to enhance existing UI agents. Evaluation on the AndroidWorld benchmark demonstrates that AGENT+P improves the success rates of state-of-the-art UI agents by up to 14% and reduces the action steps by 37.7%.

- **[Teaching Metric Distance to Discrete Autoregressive Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02379)**  `arXiv:2503.02379`  `cs.LG` `cs.CV`  
  _Jiwan Chung, Saejin Kim, Yongrae Jo, Jaewoo Park, Dongjun Min, Youngjae Yu_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As large language models expand beyond natural language to domains such as mathematics, multimodal understanding, and embodied agents, tokens increasingly reflect metric relationships rather than purely linguistic meaning. We introduce DIST2Loss, a distance-aware framework designed to train autoregressive discrete models by leveraging predefined distance relationships among output tokens. At its core, DIST2Loss transforms continuous exponential family distributions derived from inherent distance metrics into discrete, categorical optimization targets compatible with the models' architectures. This approach enables the models to learn and preserve meaningful distance relationships during token generation while maintaining compatibility with existing architectures. Empirical evaluations show consistent performance gains in diverse multimodal applications, including visual grounding, robotic manipulation, generative reward modeling, and image generation using vector-quantized features. These improvements are most notable in low-data regimes, demonstrating DIST2Loss's strength under resource constraints.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) on chain-of-thought (CoT) data shows that a small amount of high-quality data can outperform massive datasets. Yet, what constitutes "quality" remains ill-defined. Existing reasoning methods rely on indirect heuristics such as problem difficulty or trace length, while instruction-tuning has explored a broader range of automated selection strategies, but rarely in the context of reasoning. We propose to define reasoning data quality using influence functions, which measure the causal effect of individual CoT examples on downstream accuracy, and introduce influence-based pruning, which consistently outperforms perplexity and embedding-based baselines on math reasoning within a model family.

- **[The Alignment Auditor: A Bayesian Framework for Verifying and Refining LLM Objectives](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06096)**  `arXiv:2510.06096`  `cs.LG` `cs.CL`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The objectives that Large Language Models (LLMs) implicitly optimize remain dangerously opaque, making trustworthy alignment and auditing a grand challenge. While Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) can infer reward functions from behaviour, existing approaches either produce a single, overconfident reward estimate or fail to address the fundamental ambiguity of the task (non-identifiability). This paper introduces a principled auditing framework that re-frames reward inference from a simple estimation task to a comprehensive process for verification. Our framework leverages Bayesian IRL to not only recover a distribution over objectives but to enable three critical audit capabilities: (i) Quantifying and systematically reducing non-identifiability by demonstrating posterior contraction over sequential rounds of evidence; (ii) Providing actionable, uncertainty-aware diagnostics that expose spurious shortcuts and identify out-of-distribution prompts where the inferred objective cannot be trusted; and (iii) Validating policy-level utility by showing that the refined, low-uncertainty reward can be used directly in RLHF to achieve training dynamics and toxicity reductions comparable to the ground-truth alignment process. Empirically, our framework successfully audits a detoxified LLM, yielding a well-calibrated and interpretable objective that strengthens alignment guarantees. Overall, this work provides a practical toolkit for auditors, safety teams, and regulators to verify what LLMs are truly trying to achieve, moving us toward more trustworthy and accountable AI.

- **[Learning from Failures: Understanding LLM Alignment through Failure-Aware Inverse RL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06092)**  `arXiv:2510.06092`  `cs.LG` `cs.CL`  
  _Nyal Patel, Matthieu Bou, Arjun Jagota, Satyapriya Krishna, Sonali Parbhoo_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) aligns Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences, yet the underlying reward signals they internalize remain hidden, posing a critical challenge for interpretability and safety. Existing approaches attempt to extract these latent incentives using Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL), but treat all preference pairs equally, often overlooking the most informative signals: those examples the extracted reward model misclassifies or assigns nearly equal scores, which we term \emph{failures}. We introduce a novel \emph{failure-aware} IRL algorithm that focuses on misclassified or difficult examples to recover the latent rewards defining model behaviors. By learning from these failures, our failure-aware IRL extracts reward functions that better reflect the true objectives behind RLHF. We demonstrate that failure-aware IRL outperforms existing IRL baselines across multiple metrics when applied to LLM detoxification, without requiring external classifiers or supervision. Crucially, failure-aware IRL yields rewards that better capture the true incentives learned during RLHF, enabling more effective re-RLHF training than standard IRL. This establishes failure-aware IRL as a robust, scalable method for auditing model alignment and reducing ambiguity in the IRL process.

- **[Sample Smart, Not Hard: Correctness-First Decoding for Better Reasoning in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05987)**  `arXiv:2510.05987`  `cs.LG` `cs.CL`  
  _Xueyan Li, Guinan Su, Mrinmaya Sachan, Jonas Geiping_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to complex tasks that require extended reasoning. In such settings, models often benefit from diverse chains-of-thought to arrive at multiple candidate solutions. This requires two competing objectives: to inject enough stochasticity to explore multiple reasoning chains, and to ensure sufficient accuracy and quality in each path. Existing works pursue the first objective by increasing exploration at highly uncertain steps with higher temperature or larger candidate token sets, while others improve reliability by rejecting samples with low confidence post-generation, implying that low confidence correlates with low answer quality. These two lines of thought are in conflict, as they conflate different sources of uncertainty. To resolve this, we argue that the decoding rule should be calibrated by correctness, not confidence alone. We should sample from tokens with higher estimated correctness, and reduce sampling where expected correctness is low. We propose simple strategies that achieve this goal: Greedy-Threshold makes sampling greedy at very low confidence steps. Calibrated-TopK and Calibrated-epsilon set truncation threshold based on estimated rank-wise correctness. Together, our findings challenge prevailing heuristics about decoding under uncertainty and show gains across math and general reasoning benchmarks.

- **[NorMuon: Making Muon more efficient and scalable](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05491)**  `arXiv:2510.05491`  `cs.LG` `cs.CL`  
  _Zichong Li, Liming Liu, Chen Liang, Weizhu Chen, Tuo Zhao_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The choice of optimizer significantly impacts the training efficiency and computational costs of large language models (LLMs). Recently, the Muon optimizer has demonstrated promising results by orthogonalizing parameter updates, improving optimization geometry through better conditioning. Despite Muon's emergence as a candidate successor to Adam, the potential for jointly leveraging their strengths has not been systematically explored. In this work, we bridge this gap by proposing NorMuon (Neuron-wise Normalized Muon), an optimizer that synergistically combines orthogonalization with neuron-level adaptive learning rates. Our analysis reveals that while Muon effectively reduces condition numbers, the resulting updates exhibit highly non-uniform neuron norms, causing certain neurons to dominate the optimization process. NorMuon addresses this imbalance by maintaining second-order momentum statistics for each neuron and applying row-wise normalization after orthogonalization, ensuring balanced parameter utilization while preserving Muon's conditioning benefits. To enable practical deployment at scale, we develop an efficient distributed implementation under the FSDP2 framework that strategically distributes orthogonalization computations across devices. Experiments across multiple model scales demonstrate that NorMuon consistently outperforms both Adam and Muon, achieving 21.74% better training efficiency than Adam and 11.31% improvement over Muon on 1.1 B pretraining setting, while maintaining a comparable memory footprint to Muon. Our findings suggest that orthogonalization and adaptive learning rates are complementary rather than competing approaches, opening new avenues for optimizer design in large-scale deep learning.

- **[Decoding Partial Differential Equations: Cross-Modal Adaptation of Decoder-only Models to PDEs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05278)**  `arXiv:2510.05278`  `cs.LG` `cs.CL`  
  _Paloma Garc√≠a-de-Herreros, Philipp Slusallek, Dietrich Klakow, Vagrant Gautam_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models have shown great success on natural language tasks in recent years, but they have also shown great promise when adapted to new modalities, e.g., for scientific machine learning tasks. Even though decoder-only models are more popular within NLP and scale exceedingly well at generating natural language, most proposed approaches for cross-modal adaptation focus on encoder-only models, raising the question of how model architecture affects these approaches. In this paper, we therefore perform a series of ablation studies to answer this question, systematically comparing encoder-only and decoder-only models on cross-modal adaptation for time-dependent simulation tasks based on partial differential equations (PDEs). We find that decoder-only models are far worse than encoder-only models, when existing approaches are applied unmodified. In contrast to several other domains, scaling decoder-only models also does not help. To harness the potential of decoder-only models in this context, we introduce two novel approaches, Parallel Flipping and Sequence Doubling, attempting to mimic bidirectionality in autoregressive models. Both our methods improve overall performance using decoder-only models for all tasks and all cross-model adaptation methods, closing the gap to encoder-only model performance. We hope that our findings broaden the spectrum of models used on cross-modal adaptation tasks to further scientific ML.

- **[Stratified GRPO: Handling Structural Heterogeneity in Reinforcement Learning of LLM Search Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06214)**  `arXiv:2510.06214`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI` `cs.CL`  
  _Mingkang Zhu, Xi Chen, Bei Yu, Hengshuang Zhao, Jiaya Jia_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language model (LLM) agents increasingly rely on external tools such as search engines to solve complex, multi-step problems, and reinforcement learning (RL) has become a key paradigm for training them. However, the trajectories of search agents are structurally heterogeneous, where variations in the number, placement, and outcomes of search calls lead to fundamentally different answer directions and reward distributions. Standard policy gradient methods, which use a single global baseline, suffer from what we identify and formalize as cross-stratum bias-an "apples-to-oranges" comparison of heterogeneous trajectories. This cross-stratum bias distorts credit assignment and hinders exploration of complex, multi-step search strategies. To address this, we propose Stratified GRPO, whose central component, Stratified Advantage Normalization (SAN), partitions trajectories into homogeneous strata based on their structural properties and computes advantages locally within each stratum. This ensures that trajectories are evaluated only against their true peers. Our analysis proves that SAN eliminates cross-stratum bias, yields conditionally unbiased unit-variance estimates inside each stratum, and retains the global unbiasedness and unit-variance properties enjoyed by standard normalization, resulting in a more pure and scale-stable learning signal. To improve practical stability under finite-sample regimes, we further linearly blend SAN with the global estimator. Extensive experiments on diverse single-hop and multi-hop question-answering benchmarks demonstrate that Stratified GRPO consistently and substantially outperforms GRPO by up to 11.3 points, achieving higher training rewards, greater training stability, and more effective search policies. These results establish stratification as a principled remedy for structural heterogeneity in RL for LLM search agents.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) are scaling rapidly, creating significant challenges for collaborative server client distributed training, particularly in terms of communication efficiency and computational overheads. To address these challenges, we implement Parameter-efficient Split Learning, which effectively balances efficiency and performance for collaborative training on low-resource devices.To reduce communication overhead in collaborative training, we introduce Adaptive Mixed bit Activation Quantization (AMAQ), a strategy that progressively compresses activations and gradients from high precision (6 to 8 bits) to low precision (3 to 4 bits). AMAQ achieves this by effectively allocating bit budgets across channels based on feature wise and layer wise importance using bit regularization.Under the same bit budgets, AMAQ outperforms fixed-precision approaches, delivering about 2.5% higher generation accuracy and about 1.3% better classification accuracy for models like LLaMA3 8B and Qwen2.5 7B. In addition, it significantly enhances training stability and reducing ultra-low bit representation collapse during the training.Experiments demonstrate that AMAQ integrates effectively into practical multi-machine collaborative training setups, offering superior inference accuracy with only a modest communication overhead for bits adaptation during training. This trade off makes AMAQ a practical and effective solution for collaborative training with minimal communication cost.

  Large Language Model (LLM) agents can leverage tools such as Google Search to complete complex tasks. However, this tool usage introduces the risk of indirect prompt injections, where malicious instructions hidden in tool outputs can manipulate the agent, posing security risks like data leakage. Current defense strategies typically rely on fine-tuning LLM agents on datasets of known attacks. However, the generation of these datasets relies on manually crafted attack patterns, which limits their diversity and leaves agents vulnerable to novel prompt injections. To address this limitation, we propose Adversarial Reinforcement Learning for Agent Safety (ARLAS), a novel framework that leverages adversarial reinforcement learning (RL) by formulating the problem as a two-player zero-sum game. ARLAS co-trains two LLMs: an attacker that learns to autonomously generate diverse prompt injections and an agent that learns to defend against them while completing its assigned tasks. To ensure robustness against a wide range of attacks and to prevent cyclic learning, we employ a population-based learning framework that trains the agent to defend against all previous attacker checkpoints. Evaluated on BrowserGym and AgentDojo, agents fine-tuned with ARLAS achieve a significantly lower attack success rate than the original model while also improving their task success rate. Our analysis further confirms that the adversarial process generates a diverse and challenging set of attacks, leading to a more robust agent compared to the base model.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate their reasoning ability through chain-of-thought (CoT) generation. However, LLM's autoregressive decoding may limit the ability to revisit and refine earlier tokens in a holistic manner, which can also lead to inefficient exploration for diverse solutions. In this paper, we propose LaDiR (Latent Diffusion Reasoner), a novel reasoning framework that unifies the expressiveness of continuous latent representation with the iterative refinement capabilities of latent diffusion models for an existing LLM. We first construct a structured latent reasoning space using a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) that encodes text reasoning steps into blocks of thought tokens, preserving semantic information and interpretability while offering compact but expressive representations. Subsequently, we utilize a latent diffusion model that learns to denoise a block of latent thought tokens with a blockwise bidirectional attention mask, enabling longer horizon and iterative refinement with adaptive test-time compute. This design allows efficient parallel generation of diverse reasoning trajectories, allowing the model to plan and revise the reasoning process holistically. We conduct evaluations on a suite of mathematical reasoning and planning benchmarks. Empirical results show that LaDiR consistently improves accuracy, diversity, and interpretability over existing autoregressive, diffusion-based, and latent reasoning methods, revealing a new paradigm for text reasoning with latent diffusion.

  Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has improved the reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by using rule-based binary feedback. However, current RLVR methods typically assign the same reward to every token. This coarse-grained feedback hampers precise credit assignment, making it hard for models to identify which reasoning steps lead to success or failure, and often results in suboptimal policies. Methods like PPO provide credit assignment by value estimation, but yield inaccurate and unverifiable signals due to limited sampling. On the other hand, methods using Process Reward Models can provide step-wise rewards but suffer from several key limitations: they require high-quality process supervision labels, the feedback is unreliable due to probabilistic reward modeling, and their application in online reinforcement learning (RL) is time-consuming. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a simple but efficient method-Credit Assignment Policy Optimization (CAPO). Instead of training auxiliary models, CAPO directly leverages an off-the-shelf, general-purpose LLM as a Generative Process Reward Model (LLM-as-GenPRM) to generate all step-wise critique by one pass only based on the correctness of the step itself, providing deterministic token-level credits to refine the tokens that were originally assigned identical rule-based rewards. To further enhance the accuracy and robustness, we employ voting mechanisms that scale with the number of generated critiques. Extensive experiments on various backbones like Llama and Qwen models show that CAPO consistently outperforms supervised learning-based and RL-based fine-tuning methods across four challenging mathematical benchmarks and three out-of-domain benchmarks. Further analysis shows that CAPO can help the model to foster the learning of correct reasoning pathways leading to correct answers.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Evaluation insights are limited by the availability of high-quality benchmarks. As models evolve, there is a need to create benchmarks that can measure progress on new and complex generative capabilities. However, manually creating new benchmarks is slow and expensive, restricting comprehensive evaluations for any capability. We introduce BenchAgents, a multi-agent framework that methodically leverages large language models (LLMs) to automate evaluation benchmark creation while inherently ensuring data and (evaluation) metric quality. BenchAgents decomposes the benchmark creation process into planning, generation, verification, and evaluation, each of which is ] orchestrated via LLM agents. These agents interact with each other and utilize feedback from benchmark developers to improve and flexibly control data diversity and quality. We use BenchAgents to create benchmarks to evaluate capabilities related to planning, constraint satisfaction, and causal reasoning spanning both language and vision modalities. We then use these benchmarks to study state-of-the-art models and extract new insights into common failure modes and model differences.

- **[How Reliable are Causal Probing Interventions?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15510)**  `arXiv:2408.15510`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI` `cs.CL`  
  _Marc Canby, Adam Davies, Chirag Rastogi, Julia Hockenmaier_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Causal probing aims to analyze foundation models by examining how intervening on their representation of various latent properties impacts their outputs. Recent works have cast doubt on the theoretical basis of several leading causal probing methods, but it has been unclear how to systematically evaluate the effectiveness of these methods in practice. To address this, we define two key causal probing desiderata: completeness (how thoroughly the representation of the target property has been transformed) and selectivity (how little non-targeted properties have been impacted). We find that there is an inherent tradeoff between the two, which we define as reliability, their harmonic mean. We introduce an empirical analysis framework to measure and evaluate these quantities, allowing us to make the first direct comparisons between different families of leading causal probing methods (e.g., linear vs. nonlinear, or concept removal vs. counterfactual interventions). We find that: (1) all methods show a clear tradeoff between completeness and selectivity; (2) more complete and reliable methods have a greater impact on LLM behavior; and (3) nonlinear interventions are almost always more reliable than linear interventions.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  High-dimensional data remains a pervasive challenge in machine learning, often undermining model interpretability and computational efficiency. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise for dimensionality reduction through feature selection, existing LLM-based approaches frequently lack structured reasoning and transparent justification for their decisions. This paper introduces LLM-FS-Agent, a novel multi-agent architecture designed for interpretable and robust feature selection. The system orchestrates a deliberative "debate" among multiple LLM agents, each assigned a specific role, enabling collective evaluation of feature relevance and generation of detailed justifications. We evaluate LLM-FS-Agent in the cybersecurity domain using the CIC-DIAD 2024 IoT intrusion detection dataset and compare its performance against strong baselines, including LLM-Select and traditional methods such as PCA. Experimental results demonstrate that LLM-FS-Agent consistently achieves superior or comparable classification performance while reducing downstream training time by an average of 46% (statistically significant improvement, p = 0.028 for XGBoost). These findings highlight that the proposed deliberative architecture enhances both decision transparency and computational efficiency, establishing LLM-FS-Agent as a practical and reliable solution for real-world applications.

  The proliferation of mobile devices generates a massive volume of time series across various domains, where effective time series forecasting enables a variety of real-world applications. This study focuses on a new problem of source-free domain adaptation for time series forecasting. It aims to adapt a pretrained model from sufficient source time series to the sparse target time series domain without access to the source data, embracing data protection regulations. To achieve this, we propose TimePD, the first source-free time series forecasting framework with proxy denoising, where large language models (LLMs) are employed to benefit from their generalization capabilities. Specifically, TimePD consists of three key components: (1) dual-branch invariant disentangled feature learning that enforces representation- and gradient-wise invariance by means of season-trend decomposition; (2) lightweight, parameter-free proxy denoising that dynamically calibrates systematic biases of LLMs; and (3) knowledge distillation that bidirectionally aligns the denoised prediction and the original target prediction. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets offer insight into the effectiveness of the proposed TimePD, outperforming SOTA baselines by 9.3% on average.

  Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) and direct preference optimization (DPO) are important techniques to align large language models (LLM) with human preference. However, the quality of RLHF and DPO training is seriously compromised by \textit{\textbf{C}orrupted} preference, reward \textit{\textbf{O}veroptimization}, and bias towards \textit{\textbf{V}erbosity}. To our knowledge, most existing works tackle only one of these important issues, and the few other works require much computation to estimate multiple reward models and lack theoretical guarantee of generalization ability. In this work, we propose RLHF-\textbf{COV} and DPO-\textbf{COV} algorithms that can simultaneously mitigate these three issues, in both offline and online settings. This ability is theoretically demonstrated by obtaining length-regularized generalization error rates for our DPO-COV algorithms trained on corrupted data, which match the best-known rates for simpler cases with clean data and without length regularization. Moreover, our DPO-COV algorithm is simple to implement without reward estimation, and is proved to be equivalent to our RLHF-COV algorithm, which directly implies the equivalence between the vanilla RLHF and DPO algorithms. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our DPO-COV algorithms under both offline and online settings.

  Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as a simple and effective method for aligning large language models. However, its reliance on a fixed temperature parameter leads to suboptimal training on diverse preference data, causing overfitting on easy examples and under-learning from informative ones. Recent methods have emerged to counter this. While IPO addresses general overfitting, its uniform regularization can be overly conservative. The more targeted approach of $\beta$-DPO suffers from its own limitations: its batch-level adaptation applies a single, compromised temperature to mixed-margin pairs, its linear update rule can produce unstable negative $\beta$ values, and its filtering mechanism discards potentially useful training signals. In this work, we introduce Margin-Adaptive Direct Preference Optimization (MADPO), a method that provides a stable, data-preserving, and instance-level solution. MADPO employs a practical two-step approach: it first trains a reward model to estimate preference margins and then uses these margins to apply a continuous, adaptive weight to the DPO loss for each individual training sample. This re-weighting scheme creates an effective target margin that is amplified for hard pairs and dampened for easy pairs, allowing for granular control over the learning signal. We provide a comprehensive theoretical analysis, proving that MADPO has a well-behaved optimization landscape and is robust to reward model estimation errors. We validate our theory with experiments on a sentiment generation task, where MADPO consistently and significantly outperforms strong baselines across datasets of varying quality. It achieves performance gains of up to +33.3\% on High Quality data and +10.5\% on Low Quality data over the next-best method. Our results establish MADPO as a more robust and principled approach to preference alignment.

  Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable progress in coding and math problem-solving, but evaluation on advanced research-level problems in hard sciences remains scarce. To fill this gap, we present CMT-Benchmark, a dataset of 50 problems covering condensed matter theory (CMT) at the level of an expert researcher. Topics span analytical and computational approaches in quantum many-body, and classical statistical mechanics. The dataset was designed and verified by a panel of expert researchers from around the world. We built the dataset through a collaborative environment that challenges the panel to write and refine problems they would want a research assistant to solve, including Hartree-Fock, exact diagonalization, quantum/variational Monte Carlo, density matrix renormalization group (DMRG), quantum/classical statistical mechanics, and model building. We evaluate LLMs by programmatically checking solutions against expert-supplied ground truth. We developed machine-grading, including symbolic handling of non-commuting operators via normal ordering. They generalize across tasks too. Our evaluations show that frontier models struggle with all of the problems in the dataset, highlighting a gap in the physical reasoning skills of current LLMs. Notably, experts identified strategies for creating increasingly difficult problems by interacting with the LLMs and exploiting common failure modes. The best model, GPT5, solves 30\% of the problems; average across 17 models (GPT, Gemini, Claude, DeepSeek, Llama) is 11.4$\pm$2.1\%. Moreover, 18 problems are solved by none of the 17 models, and 26 by at most one. These unsolved problems span Quantum Monte Carlo, Variational Monte Carlo, and DMRG. Answers sometimes violate fundamental symmetries or have unphysical scaling dimensions. We believe this benchmark will guide development toward capable AI research assistants and tutors.

  KV cache in autoregressive LLMs eliminates redundant recomputation but has emerged as the dominant memory and bandwidth bottleneck during inference, notably with long contexts and test-time scaling. KV quantization is a key lever for reducing cache cost, but accuracy drops sharply as the native KV distribution lacks flatness and thus maintains a wide quantization range. Prior work focuses on isolating outliers, which caps their error but fails to flatten the overall distribution, leaving performance fragile under low-bit settings. In this work, we show that the K cache maintains a stable structure that evolves gradually with context, while the V cache carries latent semantic regularities. Building on these insights, we propose PatternKV, a pattern-aligned residual quantization scheme. It mines representative pattern vectors online, aligns each KV vector to its nearest pattern, and quantizes only the residual. This reshaping of the KV distribution flattens the quantization target and narrows its range, thereby improving the fidelity of low-bit KV quantization. Across long-context and test-time scaling settings on multiple backbones, PatternKV delivers consistent 2-bit gains, with a 0.08% average 4-bit drop relative to FP16, improves test-time scaling accuracy by 10% on average, and raises throughput by 1.4x while supporting 1.25x larger batches.

  Effective model and hyperparameter selection remains a major challenge in deep learning, often requiring extensive expertise and computation. While AutoML and large language models (LLMs) promise automation, current LLM-based approaches rely on trial and error and expensive APIs, which provide limited interpretability and generalizability. We propose MetaLLMiX, a zero-shot hyperparameter optimization framework combining meta-learning, explainable AI, and efficient LLM reasoning. By leveraging historical experiment outcomes with SHAP explanations, MetaLLMiX recommends optimal hyperparameters and pretrained models without additional trials. We further employ an LLM-as-judge evaluation to control output format, accuracy, and completeness. Experiments on eight medical imaging datasets using nine open-source lightweight LLMs show that MetaLLMiX achieves competitive or superior performance to traditional HPO methods while drastically reducing computational cost. Our local deployment outperforms prior API-based approaches, achieving optimal results on 5 of 8 tasks, response time reductions of 99.6-99.9%, and the fastest training times on 6 datasets (2.4-15.7x faster), maintaining accuracy within 1-5% of best-performing baselines.

  Understanding how language models generalize behaviors from their training to a broader deployment distribution is an important problem in AI safety. Betley et al. discovered that fine-tuning GPT-4o on intentionally insecure code causes "emergent misalignment," where models give stereotypically malicious responses to unrelated prompts. We extend this work, demonstrating emergent misalignment across diverse conditions, including reinforcement learning on reasoning models, fine-tuning on various synthetic datasets, and in models without safety training. To investigate the mechanisms behind this generalized misalignment, we apply a "model diffing" approach using sparse autoencoders to compare internal model representations before and after fine-tuning. This approach reveals several "misaligned persona" features in activation space, including a toxic persona feature which most strongly controls emergent misalignment and can be used to predict whether a model will exhibit such behavior. Additionally, we investigate mitigation strategies, discovering that fine-tuning an emergently misaligned model on just a few hundred benign samples efficiently restores alignment.

  Inference scaling helps LLMs solve complex reasoning problems through extended runtime computation. On top of long chain-of-thought (long-CoT) models, purely inference-time techniques such as best-of-N (BoN) sampling, majority voting, or more generally, minimum Bayes risk decoding (MBRD), can further improve LLM accuracy by generating multiple candidate solutions and aggregating over them. These methods typically leverage additional signals in the form of reward models and risk/similarity functions that compare generated samples, e.g., exact match in some normalized space or standard similarity metrics such as Rouge. Here we present a novel method for incorporating reward and risk/similarity signals into MBRD. Based on the concept of optimal policy in KL-controlled reinforcement learning, our framework provides a simple and well-defined mechanism for leveraging such signals, offering several advantages over traditional inference-time methods: higher robustness, improved accuracy, and well-understood asymptotic behavior. In addition, it allows for the development of a sample-efficient variant of MBRD that can adjust the number of samples to generate according to the difficulty of the problem, without relying on majority vote counts. We empirically demonstrate the advantages of our approach on math (MATH-$500$) and coding (HumanEval) tasks using recent open-source models. We also present a comprehensive analysis of its accuracy-compute trade-offs.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  While post-training quantization is widely adopted for efficient deployment of large language models, the mechanisms underlying quantization robustness remain unclear. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of quantization degradation across open-source language model training trajectories up to 32B parameters and 15T training tokens to accurately assess the relationship between training dynamics and quantization performance. Our key finding is that quantization errors in large-scale training runs are driven by a complex interplay between learning rate and other training hyperparameters. Specifically, once learning rates decay, validation loss and quantization error diverge, largely independent of training data scale. To investigate interventions on the training dynamics and identify specific configurations that can modulate quantization robustness favorably, we train our own models in controlled experiments up to 100B tokens. Our results challenge the assumption that increasing dataset scale inherently compromises quantization effectiveness, demonstrating instead that strategic training hyperparameter interventions can improve quantization quality at scale.

  This paper formally studies generation processes, including auto-regressive next-token prediction and masked diffusion, that abstract beyond architectural specifics. At this level of abstraction, we quantify their benefits and limitations through measurable criteria such as computational hardness and learnability. In particular, we demonstrate that allowing generation to proceed beyond autoregression and current masked diffusion, with capabilities to rewrite and length-variable edit, can bring significant theoretical and empirical advantages, with important implications for frontier LLMs that aspire to tackle increasingly hard problems and work universally across domains beyond natural language, such as coding and science.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Effective data selection is essential for pretraining large language models (LLMs), enhancing efficiency and improving generalization to downstream tasks. However, existing approaches often require leveraging external pretrained models, making it difficult to disentangle the effects of data selection from those of the external pretrained models. In addition, they often overlook the long-term impact of selected data if the model is trained to convergence, primarily due to the prohibitive cost of full-scale LLM pretraining. In this paper, we introduce BLISS (\textbf{B}ileve\textbf{L} \textbf{I}nfluence \textbf{S}coring method for data \textbf{S}election): a lightweight data selection method that operates entirely \emph{from scratch}, without relying on any external pretrained oracle models, while explicitly accounting for the long-term impact of selected data. BLISS leverages a small proxy model as a surrogate for the LLM and employs a score model to estimate the long-term influence of training samples if the proxy model is trained to convergence. We formulate data selection as a bilevel optimization problem, where the upper-level objective optimizes the score model to assign importance weights to training samples, ensuring that minimizing the lower-level objective (i.e., training the proxy model over the weighted training loss until convergence) leads to best validation performance. Once optimized, the trained score model predicts influence scores for the dataset, enabling efficient selection of high-quality samples for LLM pretraining. We validate BLISS by pretraining 410M/1B/2.8B Pythia and LLaMA-0.5B models on selected subsets of the C4 dataset. Notably, under the 1B model setting, BLISS achieves $1.7\times$ speedup in reaching the same performance as the state-of-the-art method, demonstrating superior performance across multiple downstream tasks.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Eliciting cooperation in multi-agent LLM systems is critical for AI alignment. We investigate two approaches: direct communication and curriculum learning. In a 4-player Stag Hunt, a one-word "cheap talk" channel increases cooperation from 0% to 48.3%, demonstrating communication as a robust coordination mechanism. In contrast, we find that curriculum learning is highly sensitive to design choices: our pedagogical curriculum through progressively complex games reduced agent payoffs by 27.4% in an Iterated Public Goods Game with Punishment. Qualitative analysis reveals that curricula emphasizing defection-equilibrium games can induce "learned pessimism" in agents. These findings suggest that for coordination problems, simple communication protocols may be more reliable than experience-based training, and that curriculum design for social dilemmas requires careful attention to the strategic lessons embedded in game sequences.

  The widespread application of Large Language Models (LLMs) imposes increasing demands on safety, such as reducing harmful content and fake information, and avoiding certain forbidden tokens due to rules and laws. While there have been several recent works studying safe alignment of LLMs, these works either require the training of reward and cost models and incur high memory and computational costs, or need prior knowledge about the optimal solution. Motivated by this fact, we study the problem of constrained alignment in LLMs, i.e., maximizing the output reward while restricting the cost due to potentially unsafe content to stay below a threshold. For this problem, we propose a novel primal-dual DPO approach, which first trains a model using standard DPO on reward preference data to provide reward information, and then adopts a rearranged Lagrangian DPO objective utilizing the provided reward information to fine-tune LLMs on cost preference data. Our approach significantly reduces memory and computational costs, and does not require extra prior knowledge. Moreover, we establish rigorous theoretical guarantees on the suboptimality and constraint violation of the output policy. We also extend our approach to an online data setting by incorporating exploration bonuses, which enables our approach to explore uncovered prompt-response space, and then provide theoretical results that get rid of the dependence on preference data coverage. Experimental results on the widely-used preference dataset PKU-SafeRLHF demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

  _Jiashu Tao, Reza Shokri_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Machine learning models are known to leak sensitive information, as they inevitably memorize (parts of) their training data. More alarmingly, large language models (LLMs) are now trained on nearly all available data, which amplifies the magnitude of information leakage and raises serious privacy risks. Hence, it is more crucial than ever to quantify privacy risk before the release of LLMs. The standard method to quantify privacy is via membership inference attacks, where the state-of-the-art approach is the Robust Membership Inference Attack (RMIA). In this paper, we present InfoRMIA, a principled information-theoretic formulation of membership inference. Our method consistently outperforms RMIA across benchmarks while also offering improved computational efficiency.In the second part of the paper, we identify the limitations of treating sequence-level membership inference as the gold standard for measuring leakage. We propose a new perspective for studying membership and memorization in LLMs: token-level signals and analyses. We show that a simple token-based InfoRMIA can pinpoint which tokens are memorized within generated outputs, thereby localizing leakage from the sequence level down to individual tokens, while achieving stronger sequence-level inference power on LLMs. This new scope rethinks privacy in LLMs and can lead to more targeted mitigation, such as exact unlearning.

  _Lawrence Liu, Alexander Liu, Mengdi Wang, Tuo Zhao, Lin F. Yang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) present significant deployment challenges due to their immense computational and memory requirements. While semi-structured pruning, particularly 2:4 sparsity, offers a path to practical hardware acceleration, existing methods often incur substantial performance degradation. To bridge this gap, we introduce ARMOR: (Adaptive Representation with Matrix-factORization), a novel one-shot post-training pruning algorithm. Instead of directly pruning weights, ARMOR factorizes each weight matrix into a 2:4 sparse core wrapped by two low-overhead, block diagonal matrices. These wrappers act as efficient pre and post-transformation error correctors, offering greater flexibility to preserve model quality compared to conventional 2:4 pruning techniques. The sparse core and block diagonal wrappers are chosen through a block coordinate descent algorithm that minimizes a layer-wise proxy loss. We theoretically prove this optimization is guaranteed to converge to a solution with a proxy loss less than or equal to state-of-the-art pruning algorithms. Experiments on Llama (Touvron et al., 2023; Dubey et al., 2024) and Qwen (Yang et al., 2025) model families demonstrate that ARMOR consistently and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art 2:4 pruning methods across a wide range of downstream tasks and perplexity evaluations. ARMOR achieves this superior performance while retaining the inference speedups and substantial memory usage reductions of 2:4 pruning, establishing a more effective trade-off between model compression and task accuracy

  _Shrenik Bhansali, Larry Heck_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Autoregressive (AR) decoding is a major latency bottleneck for large language models. Speculative decoding (SD) accelerates AR by letting a drafter propose multi-token blocks that a verifier accepts or rejects. However, many SD systems require heavy offline training or extra components. These choices raise data/compute cost and can yield brittle drafters under distribution drift. We introduce \emph{Draft, Verify, \& Improve (DVI)}, a training-aware self-speculative framework that combines inference with continual online learning. We partition an LLM into a drafter and a verifier, and during generation, verifier accept/reject decisions are converted into supervision signals and used to update the drafter head. A simple \emph{KL$\rightarrow$RL} schedule bootstraps calibration via online distillation and then adds reward-masked cross-entropy with a on-policy policy-gradient term, preserving lossless, single model deployment. On Spec-Bench, DVI achieves a $2.16\times$ wall-time speedup, on par with SoTA approaches like EAGLE-2, while orders of magnitude less data for training, and ablations show that DVI outperforms KL-only online distillation. DVI demonstrates that \emph{training-aware} self-speculation can deliver state-of-the-art, lossless speedups with minimal training overhead.

  _Utkarsh Saxena, Kaushik Roy_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Quantizing the key-value (KV) cache is a promising strategy for improving the inference efficiency of large language models (LLMs). However, aggressive quantization to very low precision (e.g., 2 bits) introduces significant errors in the stored key and value tensors, which propagate through the dot-product attention mechanism and ultimately degrade generation quality. To address this, we propose KVLinC, a framework to mitigate attention errors introduced by KV cache quantization in the extreme low-precision regime. KVLinC combines a Hadamard rotation, which reduces quantization error in values, with lightweight linear correction adapters that explicitly compensate for errors introduced by quantized keys. Across extensive evaluations on the LLaMA, Qwen2.5, and Qwen3 model families, KVLinC consistently matches or surpasses strong baselines while achieving higher KV-cache compression. Furthermore, we implement a custom attention kernel that results in upto 2.55x faster inference compared to Flash Attention baseline, enabling efficient long-context LLM inference.

  Time series forecasting is central to decision-making in domains as diverse as energy, finance, climate, and public health. In practice, forecasters face thousands of short, noisy series that vary in frequency, quality, and horizon, where the dominant cost lies not in model fitting, but in the labor-intensive preprocessing, validation, and ensembling required to obtain reliable predictions. Prevailing statistical and deep learning models are tailored to specific datasets or domains and generalize poorly. A general, domain-agnostic framework that minimizes human intervention is urgently in demand. In this paper, we introduce TimeSeriesScientist (TSci), the first LLM-driven agentic framework for general time series forecasting. The framework comprises four specialized agents: Curator performs LLM-guided diagnostics augmented by external tools that reason over data statistics to choose targeted preprocessing; Planner narrows the hypothesis space of model choice by leveraging multi-modal diagnostics and self-planning over the input; Forecaster performs model fitting and validation and, based on the results, adaptively selects the best model configuration as well as ensemble strategy to make final predictions; and Reporter synthesizes the whole process into a comprehensive, transparent report. With transparent natural-language rationales and comprehensive reports, TSci transforms the forecasting workflow into a white-box system that is both interpretable and extensible across tasks. Empirical results on eight established benchmarks demonstrate that TSci consistently outperforms both statistical and LLM-based baselines, reducing forecast error by an average of 10.4% and 38.2%, respectively. Moreover, TSci produces a clear and rigorous report that makes the forecasting workflow more transparent and interpretable.

  In this paper, we study the surprising impact that truncating text embeddings has on downstream performance. We consistently observe across 6 state-of-the-art text encoders and 26 downstream tasks, that randomly removing up to 50% of embedding dimensions results in only a minor drop in performance, less than 10%, in retrieval and classification tasks. Given the benefits of using smaller-sized embeddings, as well as the potential insights about text encoding, we study this phenomenon and find that, contrary to what is suggested in prior work, this is not the result of an ineffective use of representation space. Instead, we find that a large number of uniformly distributed dimensions actually cause an increase in performance when removed. This would explain why, on average, removing a large number of embedding dimensions results in a marginal drop in performance. We make similar observations when truncating the embeddings used by large language models to make next-token predictions on generative tasks, suggesting that this phenomenon is not isolated to classification or retrieval tasks.

  Ensuring the safe use of agentic systems requires a thorough understanding of the range of malicious behaviors these systems may exhibit when under attack. In this paper, we evaluate the robustness of LLM-based agentic systems against attacks that aim to elicit harmful actions from agents. To this end, we propose a novel taxonomy of harms for agentic systems and a novel benchmark, BAD-ACTS, for studying the security of agentic systems with respect to a wide range of harmful actions. BAD-ACTS consists of 4 implementations of agentic systems in distinct application environments, as well as a dataset of 188 high-quality examples of harmful actions. This enables a comprehensive study of the robustness of agentic systems across a wide range of categories of harmful behaviors, available tools, and inter-agent communication structures. Using this benchmark, we analyze the robustness of agentic systems against an attacker that controls one of the agents in the system and aims to manipulate other agents to execute a harmful target action. Our results show that the attack has a high success rate, demonstrating that even a single adversarial agent within the system can have a significant impact on the security. This attack remains effective even when agents use a simple prompting-based defense strategy. However, we additionally propose a more effective defense based on message monitoring. We believe that this benchmark provides a diverse testbed for the security research of agentic systems. The benchmark can be found atthis http URL

  We present significant extensions to diffusion-based sequence generation models, blurring the line with autoregressive language models. We introduce hyperschedules, which assign distinct noise schedules to individual token positions, generalizing both autoregressive models (e.g., GPT) and conventional diffusion models (e.g., SEDD, MDLM) as special cases. Second, we propose two hybrid token-wise noising processes that interpolate between absorbing and uniform processes, enabling the model to fix past mistakes, and we introduce a novel inference algorithm that leverages this new feature in a simplified context inspired from MDLM. To support efficient training and inference, we design attention masks compatible with KV-caching. Our methods achieve state-of-the-art perplexity and generate diverse, high-quality sequences across standard benchmarks, suggesting a promising path for autoregressive diffusion-based sequence generation.

  Text-to-image retrieval (T2I retrieval) remains challenging because cross-modal embeddings often behave as bags of concepts and underrepresent structured visual relationships such as pose and viewpoint. We propose Visualize-then-Retrieve (VisRet), a new paradigm for T2I retrieval that mitigates this limitation of cross-modal similarity alignment. VisRet first projects textual queries into the image modality via T2I generation. Then, it performs retrieval within the image modality to bypass the weaknesses of cross-modal retrievers in recognizing subtle visual-spatial features. Across four benchmarks (Visual-RAG, INQUIRE-Rerank, Microsoft COCO, and our new Visual-RAG-ME featuring multi-entity comparisons), VisRet substantially outperforms cross-modal similarity matching and baselines that recast T2I retrieval as text-to-text similarity matching, improving nDCG@30 by 0.125 on average with CLIP as the retriever and by 0.121 with E5-V. For downstream question answering, VisRet increases accuracy on Visual-RAG and Visual-RAG-ME by 3.8% and 15.7% in top-1 retrieval, and by 3.9% and 11.1% in top-10 retrieval. Ablation studies show compatibility with different T2I instruction LLMs, T2I generation models, and downstream LLMs. VisRet provides a practical and principled path that energizes further advances in vision-language retrieval. Our code and the Visual-RAG-ME benchmark will be publicly released.

  In the current paradigm of image captioning, deep learning models are trained to generate text from image embeddings of latent features. We challenge the assumption that fine-tuning of large, bespoke models is required to improve model generation accuracy. Here we propose Label Boosted Retrieval Augmented Generation (LaB-RAG), a small-model-based approach to image captioning that leverages image descriptors in the form of categorical labels to boost standard retrieval augmented generation (RAG) with pretrained large language models (LLMs). We study our method in the context of radiology report generation (RRG) over MIMIC-CXR and CheXpert Plus. We argue that simple classification models combined with zero-shot embeddings can effectively transform X-rays into text-space as radiology-specific labels. In combination with standard RAG, we show that these derived text labels can be used with general-domain LLMs to generate radiology reports. Without ever training our generative language model or image embedding models specifically for the task, and without ever directly "showing" the LLM an X-ray, we demonstrate that LaB-RAG achieves better results across natural language and radiology language metrics compared with other retrieval-based RRG methods, while attaining competitive results compared to other fine-tuned vision-language RRG models. We further conduct extensive ablation experiments to better understand the components of LaB-RAG. Our results suggest broader compatibility and synergy with fine-tuned methods to further enhance RRG performance.

  Autoregressive multimodal large language models have recently gained popularity for image generation, driven by advances in foundation models. To enhance alignment and detail, newer approaches employ chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, expanding user inputs into elaborated prompts prior to image synthesis. However, this strategy can introduce unnecessary redundancy -- a phenomenon we call visual overthinking -- which increases computational costs and can introduce details that contradict the original prompt. In this work, we explore how to generate more concise CoT sequences for more efficient image generation. We introduce ShortCoTI, a lightweight optimization framework that encourages more concise CoT while preserving output image quality. ShortCoTI rewards more concise prompts with an adaptive function that scales according to an estimated difficulty for each task. Incorporating this reward into a reinforcement learning paradigm reduces prompt reasoning length by 54% while maintaining or slightly improving quality metrics across multiple benchmarks (T2I-CompBench, GenEval). Qualitative analysis shows that our method eliminates verbose explanations and repetitive refinements, producing reasoning prompts that are both concise and semantically rich. As a result, ShortCoTI improves computational efficiency without compromising the fidelity or visual appeal of generated images.

  Video Large Multimodal Models (VLMMs) have made impressive strides in understanding video content, but they often struggle with abstract and adaptive reasoning-the ability to revise their interpretations when new information emerges. In reality, conclusions are rarely set in stone; additional context can strengthen or weaken an initial inference. To address this, we introduce Defeasible Video Entailment (DVidE), a new task that challenges models to think like doubters, constantly updating their reasoning based on evolving evidence. In DVidE, given a video premise and a textual hypothesis, models must determine whether a new update strengthens or weakens the hypothesis (classification version) or generate a coherent update that modifies the entailment relationship (generation version). For solving the classification task, we propose the Chain of Counterfactual Thought framework, utilizing counterfactual reasoning, ASR-enhanced video content, and rationale refinement to reduce inference bias. For the generation task, we develop a framework that combines ASR output with a Large Language Model (LLM) to produce coherent, contextually relevant updates aligned with the intended strengthener or weakener goals. Additionally, we introduce a novel benchmark dataset, with strengthener/weakener annotations and an LLM-based evaluation metric specifically designed for assessing generative performance. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements, highlighting our proposed method in enhancing dynamic reasoning capabilities of VLMMs.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Most existing benchmarks for egocentric vision understanding focus primarily on daytime scenarios, overlooking the low-light conditions that are inevitable in real-world applications. To investigate this gap, we present EgoNight, the first comprehensive benchmark for nighttime egocentric vision, with visual question answering (VQA) as the core task. A key feature of EgoNight is the introduction of day-night aligned videos, which enhance night annotation quality using the daytime data and reveal clear performance gaps between lighting conditions. To achieve this, we collect both synthetic videos rendered by Blender and real-world recordings, ensuring that scenes and actions are visually and temporally aligned. Leveraging these paired videos, we construct EgoNight-VQA, supported by a novel day-augmented night auto-labeling engine and refinement through extensive human verification. Each QA pair is double-checked by annotators for reliability. In total, EgoNight-VQA contains 3658 QA pairs across 90 videos, spanning 12 diverse QA types, with more than 300 hours of human work. Evaluations of state-of-the-art multimodal large language models (MLLMs) reveal substantial performance drops when transferring from day to night, underscoring the challenges of reasoning under low-light conditions. Beyond VQA, EgoNight also introduces two auxiliary tasks, day-night correspondence retrieval and egocentric depth estimation at night, that further explore the boundaries of existing models. We believe EgoNight-VQA provides a strong foundation for advancing application-driven egocentric vision research and for developing models that generalize across illumination domains. All the data and code will be made available upon acceptance.

  Recent advances in generative medical models are constrained by modality-specific scenarios that hinder the integration of complementary evidence from imaging, pathology, and clinical notes. This fragmentation limits their evolution into foundation models that can learn and reason across the full spectrum of biomedical data. We propose MeDiM, the first medical discrete diffusion model that learns shared distributions across modalities without modality-specific components. MeDiM unifies multiple generative tasks: translating between images and text, and jointly producing image-report pairs across domains in response to prompts. Built on a discrete diffusion framework, MeDiM bridges vision and language representations through a shared probabilistic space. To enable unified and flexible medical generation, we employ a multimodal large language model (MLLM) as the diffusion backbone, leveraging its prior knowledge and cross-modal reasoning. Two key designs are introduced: (1) removing the causal attention mask for bidirectional context, and (2) injecting continuous timestep embeddings for diffusion awareness. Experiments demonstrate high-fidelity medical generation (FID 16.60 on MIMIC-CXR and FID 24.19 on PathGen) and accurate report generation (METEOR 0.2650 and 0.2580). Jointly generated image-report pairs further enhance downstream performance (plus6.43 percent BLEU-1, plus18.57 percent BLEU-2, plus31.58 percent BLEU-3, plus4.80 percent METEOR), showing that MeDiM supports coherent and clinically grounded multimodal outputs.

  CAPTCHA, originally designed to distinguish humans from robots, has evolved into a real-world benchmark for assessing the spatial reasoning capabilities of vision-language models. In this work, we first show that step-by-step reasoning is crucial for vision-language models (VLMs) to solve CAPTCHAs, which represent high-difficulty spatial reasoning tasks, and that current commercial vision-language models still struggle with such reasoning. In particular, we observe that most commercial VLMs (e.g., Gemini, Claude, GPT, etc.) fail to effectively solve CAPTCHAs and thus achieve low accuracy (around 21.9 percent). However, our findings indicate that requiring the model to perform step-by-step reasoning before generating the final coordinates can significantly enhance its solving accuracy, underscoring the severity of the gap. To systematically study this issue, we introduce CAPTCHA-X, the first real-world CAPTCHA benchmark with reasoning, covering seven categories of CAPTCHAs (such as Gobang, hCaptcha, etc.) with step-by-step action solutions and grounding annotations. We further define five reasoning-oriented metrics that enable a comprehensive evaluation of models reasoning capabilities. To validate the effectiveness of reasoning, we also propose a general agentic VLM-based framework that incorporates the models inherent reasoning abilities. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across five high-difficulty CAPTCHA types, with an average solving accuracy of 83.9 percent, substantially surpassing existing baselines. These results reveal the limitations of current models and highlight the importance of reasoning in advancing visual-spatial challenges in the future.

  Understanding hour-long videos with multi-modal large language models (MM-LLMs) enriches the landscape of human-centered AI applications. However, for end-to-end video understanding with LLMs, uniformly sampling video frames results in LLMs being overwhelmed by a vast amount of irrelevant information as video length increases. Existing hierarchical key frame extraction methods improve the accuracy of video understanding but still face two critical challenges. 1) How can the interference of extensive redundant information in long videos be mitigated? 2) How can a model dynamically adapt to complex hierarchical structures while accurately identifying key frames? To address these issues, we propose VideoMiner, which iteratively segments, captions, and clusters long videos, forming a hierarchical tree structure. The proposed VideoMiner progresses from long videos to events to frames while preserving temporal coherence, effectively addressing the first challenge. To precisely locate key frames, we introduce T-GRPO, a tree-based group relative policy optimization in reinforcement learning method that guides the exploration of the VideoMiner. The proposed T-GRPO is specifically designed for tree structures, integrating spatiotemporal information at the event level while being guided by the question, thus solving the second challenge. We achieve superior performance in all long-video understanding tasks and uncover several interesting insights. Our proposed T-GRPO surprisingly incentivizes the model to spontaneously generate a reasoning chain. Additionally, the designed tree growth auxin dynamically adjusts the expansion depth, obtaining accuracy and efficiency gains. The code is publicly available atthis https URL.

  This study examines the use of social media and news images to detect and measure hailstones, utilizing pre-trained multimodal large language models. The dataset for this study comprises 474 crowdsourced images of hailstones from documented hail events in Austria, which occurred between January 2022 and September 2024. These hailstones have maximum diameters ranging from 2 to 11cm. We estimate the hail diameters and compare four different models utilizing one-stage and two-stage prompting strategies. The latter utilizes additional size cues from reference objects, such as human hands, within the image. Our results show that pretrained models already have the potential to measure hailstone diameters from images with an average mean absolute error of 1.12cm for the best model. In comparison to a single-stage prompt, two-stage prompting improves the reliability of most models. Our study suggests that these off-the-shelf models, even without fine-tuning, can complement traditional hail sensors by extracting meaningful and spatially dense information from social media imagery, enabling faster and more detailed assessments of severe weather events. The automated real-time image harvesting from social media and other sources remains an open task, but it will make our approach directly applicable to future hail events.

  Recent Human-object interaction detection (HOID) methods highly require prior knowledge from VLMs to enhance the interaction recognition capabilities. The training strategies and model architectures for connecting the knowledge from VLMs to the HOI instance representations from the object detector are challenging, and the whole framework is complex for further development or application. On the other hand, the inherent reasoning abilities of MLLMs on human-object interaction detection are under-explored. Inspired by the recent success of training MLLMs with reinforcement learning (RL) methods, we propose HOI-R1 and first explore the potential of the language model on the HOID task without any additional detection modules. We introduce an HOI reasoning process and HOID reward functions to solve the HOID task by pure text. The results on the HICO-DET dataset show that HOI-R1 achieves 2x the accuracy of the baseline with great generalization ability. The source code is available atthis https URL.

  Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) raise the question of their potential for grading, analyzing, and offering feedback on handwritten student classwork. This capability would be particularly beneficial in elementary and middle-school mathematics education, where most work remains handwritten, because seeing students' full working of a problem provides valuable insights into their learning processes, but is extremely time-consuming to grade. We present two experiments investigating MLLM performance on handwritten student mathematics classwork. Experiment A examines 288 handwritten responses from Ghanaian middle school students solving arithmetic problems with objective answers. In this context, models achieved near-human accuracy (95%, k = 0.90) but exhibited occasional errors that human educators would be unlikely to make. Experiment B evaluates 150 mathematical illustrations from American elementary students, where the drawings are the answer to the question. These tasks lack single objective answers and require sophisticated visual interpretation as well as pedagogical judgment in order to analyze and evaluate them. We attempted to separate MLLMs' visual capabilities from their pedagogical abilities by first asking them to grade the student illustrations directly, and then by augmenting the image with a detailed human description of the illustration. We found that when the models had to analyze the student illustrations directly, they struggled, achieving only k = 0.20 with ground truth scores, but when given human descriptions, their agreement levels improved dramatically to k = 0.47, which was in line with human-to-human agreement levels. This gap suggests MLLMs can "see" and interpret arithmetic work relatively well, but still struggle to "see" student mathematical illustrations.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Generating accurate and coherent image captions in a continual learning setting remains a major challenge due to catastrophic forgetting and the difficulty of aligning evolving visual concepts with language over time. In this work, we propose a novel multi-loss framework for continual image captioning that integrates semantic guidance through prompt-based continual learning and contrastive alignment. Built upon a pretrained ViT-GPT-2 backbone, our approach combines standard cross-entropy loss with three additional components: (1) a prompt-based cosine similarity loss that aligns image embeddings with synthetically constructed prompts encoding objects, attributes, and actions; (2) a CLIP-style loss that promotes alignment between image embeddings and target caption embedding; and (3) a language-guided contrastive loss that employs a triplet loss to enhance class-level discriminability between tasks. Notably, our approach introduces no additional overhead at inference time and requires no prompts during caption generation. We find that this approach mitigates catastrophic forgetting, while achieving better semantic caption alignment compared to state-of-the-art methods.

  Long-form video understanding has always been a challenging problem due to the significant redundancy in both temporal and spatial contents. This challenge is further exacerbated by the limited context length of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). To address this issue, many previous works have attempted to extract key video information, where the "key" is typically semantic-aware and heavily dependent on the CLIP model as prior. In this paper, we propose Flow4Agent, a novel framework that pioneeringly incorporates motion priors from optical flow to facilitate LLM-based long video understanding. Flow4Agent mitigates the redundancy in long videos at both temporal and spatial levels through two core modules: Temporal Granularity Optimization (TGO) adaptively refines framelevel hierarchies, which first leverages coarse flow priors to group similar visual contents and then applies semantic priors to filter out highly irrelevant scene information. Motion Token Pruning (MTP) further refines the intra-frame visual representations, pruning high-redundancy video tokens using fine-grained optical flow information. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our Flow4Agent outperforms existing methods across a wide range of video MLLM benchmarks, especially for hour-level video understanding tasks, achieving 64.7% on Video-MME, 71.4% on MLVU and 60.4% on LongVideoBench.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in language modeling have witnessed the rise of highly desirable emergent capabilities, such as reasoning and in-context learning. However, vision models have yet to exhibit comparable progress in these areas. In this paper, we argue that this gap could stem from the lack of semantic and contextual guidance in current vision transformer (ViT) training schemes, and such a gap can be narrowed through the design of a semantic-grounded objective. Specifically, we notice that individual words in natural language are inherently semantic, and modeling directly on word tokens naturally learns a realistic distribution. In contrast, ViTs rely on spatial patchification, which inevitably lacks semantic information. To bridge this gap, we propose to directly model "object" as the visual equivalence of "word," pushing the model to learn the global context and semantics among visual elements. We investigate our hypotheses via masked image modeling (MIM), a framework where our approach can be readily tested by applying masks to visual objects rather than random patches. Considerable evidence from qualitative and quantitative evaluations reveals a key finding: object-level representation alone helps to learn a real-world distribution, whereas pixel-averaging shortcuts are often learned without it. Moreover, further evaluations with multimodal LLMs (MLLM) on visual question answering (VQA, GQA, ScienceQA) tasks demonstrate the strong reasoning and contextual understanding gained with this simple objective. We hope our study highlights the effectiveness of object-level encoding and provides a plausible direction for developing stronger vision encoders and tokenizers. Code and model will be publicly released. Keywords: Semantic Visual Tokenizer, Vision Reasoning, In-context Learning, Multimodal Reasoning

  Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel in vision-language reasoning but often struggle with structured perception tasks requiring precise localization and robustness. We propose a reinforcement learning framework that augments Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with curriculum-based data scheduling and difficulty-aware filtering. This approach stabilizes optimization under sparse, noisy rewards and enables progressive adaptation to complex samples. Evaluations on autonomous driving benchmarks demonstrate substantial improvements in detection accuracy and robustness. Ablation studies confirm the importance of reward design, KL regularization, and curriculum pacing for convergence stability and generalization. Our findings highlight reinforcement-driven optimization with structured data curricula as a scalable path toward robust and interpretable multimodal detection.

  We introduce OneCAT, a unified multimodal model that seamlessly integrates understanding, generation, and editing within a novel, pure decoder-only transformer architecture. Our framework uniquely eliminates the need for external components such as Vision Transformers (ViT) or vision tokenizer during inference, leading to significant efficiency gains, especially for high-resolution inputs. This is achieved through a modality-specific Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) structure trained with a single autoregressive (AR) objective, which also natively supports dynamic resolutions. Furthermore, we pioneer a multi-scale visual autoregressive mechanism within the Large Language Model (LLM) that drastically reduces decoding steps compared to diffusion-based methods while maintaining state-of-the-art performance. Our findings demonstrate the powerful potential of pure autoregressive modeling as a sufficient and elegant foundation for unified multimodal intelligence. As a result, OneCAT sets a new performance standard, outperforming existing open-source unified multimodal models across benchmarks for multimodal generation, editing, and understanding.

  Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in vision-language tasks. However, these models often infer and reveal sensitive biometric attributes such as race, gender, age, body weight, and eye color; even when such information is not explicitly requested. This raises critical concerns, particularly in real-world applications and socially-sensitive domains. Despite increasing awareness, no publicly available dataset or benchmark exists to comprehensively evaluate or mitigate biometric leakage in MLLMs. To address this gap, we introduce PRISM (Privacy-aware Evaluation of Responses in Sensitive Modalities), a new benchmark designed to assess MLLMs on two fronts: (1) refuse biometric-related queries and (2) implicit biometric leakage in general responses while maintaining semantic faithfulness. Further, we conduct a detailed audit of the widely used LLaVA datasets and uncover extensive biometric leakage across pretraining and instruction data. To address this, we present Safe-LLaVA dataset, the first privacy-preserving MLLM training dataset constructed by systematically removing explicit and implicit biometric information from LLaVA dataset. Our evaluations on PRISM reveal biometric leakages across MLLMs for different attributes, highlighting the detailed privacy-violations. We also fine-tune a model on Safe-LLaVA dataset and show that it substantially reduces the biometric leakages. Together, Safe-LLaVA and PRISM set a new standard for privacy-aligned development and evaluation of MLLMs.

  The existing image manipulation localization (IML) models mainly relies on visual cues, but ignores the semantic logical relationships between content features. In fact, the content semantics conveyed by real images often conform to human cognitive laws. However, image manipulation technology usually destroys the internal relationship between content features, thus leaving semantic clues for IML. In this paper, we propose a cognition inspired multimodal boundary preserving network (CMB-Net). Specifically, CMB-Net utilizes large language models (LLMs) to analyze manipulated regions within images and generate prompt-based textual information to compensate for the lack of semantic relationships in the visual information. Considering that the erroneous texts induced by hallucination from LLMs will damage the accuracy of IML, we propose an image-text central ambiguity module (ITCAM). It assigns weights to the text features by quantifying the ambiguity between text and image features, thereby ensuring the beneficial impact of textual information. We also propose an image-text interaction module (ITIM) that aligns visual and text features using a correlation matrix for fine-grained interaction. Finally, inspired by invertible neural networks, we propose a restoration edge decoder (RED) that mutually generates input and output features to preserve boundary information in manipulated regions without loss. Extensive experiments show that CMB-Net outperforms most existing IML models. Our code is available onthis https URL.

  Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in various multimodal tasks. To pursue higher intelligence in space, MLLMs require integrating multiple spatial capabilities, even for handling simple and normal tasks. However, existing benchmarks struggle to comprehensively evaluate the spatial intelligence of common MLLMs from the atomic level to the compositional level. To fill this gap, we present SpaCE-10, a comprehensive benchmark for compositional spatial evaluations. In SpaCE-10, we define 10 atomic spatial capabilities, which are combined to form 8 compositional capabilities. Based on these definitions, we propose a novel hierarchical annotation pipeline to generate high-quality and diverse question-answer (QA) pairs. With over 150+ hours of human expert effort, we obtain over 5k QA pairs for 811 real indoor scenes in SpaCE-10, which covers various evaluation settings like point cloud input and multi-choice QA. We conduct an extensive evaluation of common MLLMs on SpaCE-10 and find that even the most advanced MLLM still lags behind humans by large margins. Through our careful study, we also draw several significant findings that benefit the MLLM community. For example, we reveal that the shortcoming of counting capability greatly limits the compositional spatial capabilities of existing MLLMs.

  Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have achieved impressive progress in visual perception and reasoning. However, when confronted with visually ambiguous or non-semantic scene text, they often struggle to accurately spot and understand the content, frequently generating semantically plausible yet visually incorrect answers, which we refer to as semantic hallucination. In this work, we investigate the underlying causes of semantic hallucination and identify a key finding: Transformer layers in LLM with stronger attention focus on scene text regions are less prone to producing semantic hallucinations. Thus, we propose a training-free semantic hallucination mitigation framework comprising two key components: (1) ZoomText, a coarse-to-fine strategy that identifies potential text regions without external detectors; and (2) Grounded Layer Correction, which adaptively leverages the internal representations from layers less prone to hallucination to guide decoding, correcting hallucinated outputs for non-semantic samples while preserving the semantics of meaningful ones. To enable rigorous evaluation, we introduce TextHalu-Bench, a benchmark of 1,740 samples spanning both semantic and non-semantic cases, with manually curated question answer pairs designed to probe model hallucinations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method not only effectively mitigates semantic hallucination but also achieves strong performance on public benchmarks for scene text spotting and understanding.

  Recent video diffusion models have demonstrated their great capability in generating visually-pleasing results, while synthesizing the correct physical effects in generated videos remains challenging. The complexity of real-world motions, interactions, and dynamics introduce great difficulties when learning physics from data. In this work, we propose DiffPhy, a generic framework that enables physically-correct and photo-realistic video generation by fine-tuning a pre-trained video diffusion model. Our method leverages large language models (LLMs) to infer rich physical context from the text prompt. To incorporate this context into the video diffusion model, we use a multimodal large language model (MLLM) to verify intermediate latent variables against the inferred physical rules, guiding the gradient updates of model accordingly. Textual output of LLM is transformed into continuous signals. We then formulate a set of training objectives that jointly ensure physical accuracy and semantic alignment with the input text. Additionally, failure facts of physical phenomena are corrected via attention injection. We also establish a high-quality physical video dataset containing diverse phyiscal actions and events to facilitate effective finetuning. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks demonstrate that DiffPhy is able to produce state-of-the-art results across diverse physics-related scenarios.

  Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in a wide range of natural language processing tasks and can be adapted through prompting. However, they remain suboptimal in multi-turn interactions, often relying on incorrect early assumptions and failing to track user goals over time, which makes such tasks particularly challenging. Prior works in dialogue systems have shown that long-term planning is essential for handling interactive tasks. In this work, we propose a prompt optimisation framework inspired by reinforcement learning, which enables such planning to take place by only modifying the task instruction prompt of the LLM-based agent. By generating turn-by-turn feedback and leveraging experience replay for prompt rewriting, our proposed method shows significant improvement in multi-turn tasks such as text-to-SQL and task-oriented dialogue. Moreover, it generalises across different LLM-based agents and can leverage diverse LLMs as meta-prompting agents. This warrants future research in reinforcement learning-inspired parameter-free optimisation methods.

  Large language models (LLM) and vision-language models (VLM) have achieved state-of-the-art performance, but they impose significant memory and computing challenges in deployment. We present a novel low-rank compression framework to address this challenge. First, we upper bound the change of network loss via layer-wise activation-based compression errors, filling a theoretical gap in the literature. We then formulate low-rank model compression as a bi-objective optimization and prove that a single uniform tolerance yields surrogate Pareto-optimal heterogeneous ranks. Based on our theoretical insights, we propose Pareto-Guided Singular Value Decomposition (PGSVD), a zero-shot pipeline that improves activation-aware compression via Pareto-guided rank selection and alternating least-squares implementation. We apply PGSVD to both LLM and VLM, showing better accuracy at the same compression levels and inference speedup.

  Autoregressive decoding in large language models (LLMs) requires caching a growing list of past key-value (KV) pairs, making long-context inference a memory-bound problem. While recent methods have explored quantizing the cache, evicting tokens, or using binary sketches for keys (e.g., Loki), these approaches often provide an incomplete solution by leaving one component (like values) uncompressed or by discarding context information. This paper introduces the Hybrid One-Bit KV Cache (H1B-KV), a comprehensive compression scheme that radically reduces memory usage without sacrificing context. H1B-KV represents each key vector using a 1-bit binary sketch, enabling hardware-friendly bitwise attention, and further compresses value vectors using 4-bit quantization. This holistic, hybrid approach allows a 7-billion parameter LLM to handle an 8k-token context with under 60 MB of cache memory - a 70x reduction. We demonstrate that after a lightweight finetuning, H1B-KV matches full-precision performance not only on perplexity benchmarks but also on complex downstream tasks like mathematical reasoning (GSM8K), multi-task understanding (MMLU), and code generation (HumanEval). Our results show H1B-KV significantly outperforms leading quantization (KIVI), token eviction (SparseLLM), and key-only sketching (Loki) methods in quality-per-byte, establishing it as a robust solution for deploying LLMs in memory-constrained environments.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Nursing documentation in intensive care units (ICUs) provides essential clinical intelligence but often suffers from inconsistent terminology, informal styles, and lack of standardization, challenges that are particularly critical in heart failure care. This study applies Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to adapt Mistral-7B, a locally deployable language model, using 8,838 heart failure nursing notes from the MIMIC-III database and 21,210 preference pairs derived from expert-verified GPT outputs, model generations, and original notes. Evaluation across BLEU, ROUGE, BERTScore, Perplexity, and expert qualitative assessments demonstrates that DPO markedly enhances documentation quality. Specifically, BLEU increased by 84% (0.173 to 0.318), BERTScore improved by 7.6% (0.828 to 0.891), and expert ratings rose across accuracy (+14.4 points), completeness (+14.5 points), logical consistency (+14.1 points), readability (+11.1 points), and structural clarity (+6.0 points). These results indicate that DPO can align lightweight clinical language models with expert standards, supporting privacy-preserving, AI-assisted documentation within electronic health record systems to reduce administrative burden and improve ICU patient safety.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) is a powerful paradigm for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), yet its success hinges on effective exploration. An ideal exploration strategy must navigate two fundamental challenges: it must preserve sample quality while also ensuring training stability. While standard fixed-temperature sampling is simple, it struggles to balance these competing demands, as high temperatures degrade sample quality and low temperatures limit discovery. In this work, we propose a simpler and more effective strategy, Exploratory Annealed Decoding (EAD), grounded in the insight that exploration is most impactful on early tokens which define a sequence's semantic direction. EAD implements an intuitive **explore-at-the-beginning, exploit-at-the-end** strategy by annealing the sampling temperature from high to low during generation. This dynamic schedule encourages meaningful, high-level diversity at the start, then gradually lowers the temperature to preserve sample quality and keep the sampling distribution close to the target policy, which is essential for stable training. We demonstrate that EAD is a lightweight, plug-and-play method that significantly improves sample efficiency, consistently outperforming fixed-temperature sampling across various RLVR algorithms and model sizes. Our work suggests that aligning exploration with the natural dynamics of sequential generation offers a robust path to improving LLM reasoning.

  This research explores the strengths and weaknesses of domain-adapted Large Language Models (LLMs) in the context of financial natural language processing (NLP). The analysis centers on FinMA, a model created within the PIXIU framework, which is evaluated for its performance in specialized financial tasks. Recognizing the critical demands of accuracy, reliability, and domain adaptation in financial applications, this study examines FinMA's model architecture, its instruction tuning process utilizing the Financial Instruction Tuning (FIT) dataset, and its evaluation under the FLARE benchmark. Findings indicate that FinMA performs well in sentiment analysis and classification, but faces notable challenges in tasks involving numerical reasoning, entity recognition, and summarization. This work aims to advance the understanding of how financial LLMs can be effectively designed and evaluated to assist in finance-related decision-making processes.

  Modern large language models (LLMs) excel at objective tasks such as evaluating mathematical reasoning and factual accuracy, yet they falter when faced with the nuanced, subjective nature of assessing creativity. In this work, we propose a novel curiosity-driven LLM-as-a-judge for evaluating creative writing which is personlized to each individual's creative judgments. We use the Torrance Test of Creative Thinking(TTCW) benchmark introduced in Chakrabarty et al. (2024), which has stories annotated by expert humans across various subjective dimensions like Originality, to test our hypothesis. We show that our method enables models across various sizes, to learn the nuanced creative judgments of different individuals, by showing improvements over baseline supervised finetuning(SFT) method across various evaluation metrics like Pearson correlation, Cohen's and F1 values. Our method is especially useful in subjective evaluations where not all the annotators agree with each other.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  While collaborative filtering delivers predictive accuracy and efficiency, and Large Language Models (LLMs) enable expressive and generalizable reasoning, modern recommendation systems must bring these strengths together. Growing user expectations, such as natural-language queries and transparent explanations, further highlight the need for a unified approach. However, doing so is nontrivial. Collaborative signals are often token-efficient but semantically opaque, while LLMs are semantically rich but struggle to model implicit user preferences when trained only on textual inputs. This paper introduces Item-ID + Oral-language Mixture-of-Experts Language Model (IDIOMoE), which treats item interaction histories as a native dialect within the language space, enabling collaborative signals to be understood in the same way as natural language. By splitting the Feed Forward Network of each block of a pretrained LLM into a separate text expert and an item expert with token-type gating, our method avoids destructive interference between text and catalog modalities. IDIOMoE demonstrates strong recommendation performance across both public and proprietary datasets, while preserving the text understanding of the pretrained model.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) with Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures are distinguished by their strong performance scaling with increasing parameters across a wide range of tasks, yet they also suffer from substantial computational and storage overheads. Notably, the performance gains of MoE models do not scale proportionally with the growth in expert parameters. While prior works attempt to reduce parameters via expert-level pruning, merging, or decomposition, they still suffer from challenges in both performance and computational efficiency. In this paper, we address these challenges by introducing micro-expert as a finer-grained compression unit that spans across matrices. We first establish a more fundamental perspective, viewing MoE layers as mixtures of micro-experts, and present CAMERA, a lightweight and training-free framework for identifying micro-expert redundancy. Our analysis uncovers significant variance in micro-expert contributions during decoding. Based on this insight, we further propose CAMERA-P, a structured micro-expert pruning framework, and CAMERA-Q, a mixed-precision quantization idea designed for micro-experts. Extensive experiments on nine downstream tasks show that CAMERA-P consistently outperforms strong baselines under pruning ratios ranging from 20% to 60%. Furthermore, CAMERA-Q achieves superior results under aggressive 2-bit quantization, surpassing existing matrix- and channel-level ideas. Notably, our method enables complete micro-expert analysis of Qwen2-57B-A14B in less than 5 minutes on a single NVIDIA A100-40GB GPU.

  The increasing volume of academic literature makes it essential for researchers to organize, compare, and contrast collections of documents. Large language models (LLMs) can support this process by generating schemas defining shared aspects along which to compare papers. However, progress on schema generation has been slow due to: (i) ambiguity in reference-based evaluations, and (ii) lack of editing/refinement methods. Our work is the first to address both issues. First, we present an approach for augmenting unannotated table corpora with \emph{synthesized intents}, and apply it to create a dataset for studying schema generation conditioned on a given information need, thus reducing ambiguity. With this dataset, we show how incorporating table intents significantly improves baseline performance in reconstructing reference schemas. We start by comprehensively benchmarking several single-shot schema generation methods, including prompted LLM workflows and fine-tuned models, showing that smaller, open-weight models can be fine-tuned to be competitive with state-of-the-art prompted LLMs. Next, we propose several LLM-based schema refinement techniques and show that these can further improve schemas generated by these methods.

By leveraging their semantic and reasoning capabilities, LLMs are reshaping how autonomous systems perceive, model, and predict trajectories. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of this emerging field, categorizing recent work into five directions: (1) Trajectory prediction via language modeling paradigms, (2) Direct trajectory prediction with pretrained language models, (3) Language-guided scene understanding for trajectory prediction, (4) Language-driven data generation for trajectory prediction, (5) Language-based reasoning and interpretability for trajectory prediction. For each, we analyze representative methods, highlight core design choices, and identify open challenges. This survey bridges natural language processing and trajectory prediction, offering a unified perspective on how language can enrich trajectory prediction.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  When thinking with images, humans rarely rely on a single glance: they revisit visual information repeatedly during reasoning. However, existing models typically process images only once and thereafter generate reasoning entirely in text, lacking mechanisms to re-access or ground inference in visual representations. We empirically confirm this: as reasoning chains lengthen, models progressively lose focus on relevant regions. In response, we introduce v1, a lightweight extension that enables active visual referencing through a simple point-and-copy approach. This allows the model to identify relevant image patches and copy their embeddings back into the reasoning stream, ensuring that evolving hypotheses remain grounded in perceptual evidence. Crucially, our pointing strategy lets the MLLM directly select image patches using their semantic representations as keys, keeping perceptual evidence embedded in the same space as the model's reasoning. To train this capability, we construct v1g, a dataset of 300K multimodal reasoning traces with interleaved visual grounding annotations. Across various multimodal mathematical reasoning benchmarks, v1 consistently outperforms comparable baselines, establishing point-and-copy as a practical mechanism for grounded reasoning. The model checkpoint and dataset are available atthis http URL.

  Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance in text summarization, yet their performance often falls short when applied to specialized domains %or conversational data that differ from their original pre-training distribution. While fine-tuning can improve summarization quality, it typically relies on costly and scarce high-quality labeled data. In this work, we explore continual pre-training as a scalable, self-supervised approach to adapt LLMs for downstream summarization tasks, particularly in the context of noisy real-world conversation transcripts. We conduct extensive experiments using large-scale, unlabeled business conversation data to investigate whether continual pre-training enhances model capabilities in conversational summarization. Our results demonstrate that continual pre-training yields substantial gains in both in-domain and out-of-domain summarization benchmarks, while maintaining strong generalization and robustness. We also analyze the effects of data selection strategies, providing practical guidelines for applying continual pre-training in summarization-focused industrial applications.

  Although LLMs have demonstrated improved performance by scaling parallel test-time compute, doing so relies on generating reasoning paths that are both diverse and accurate. For challenging problems, the forking tokens that trigger diverse yet correct reasoning modes are typically deep in the sampling tree. Consequently, common strategies to encourage diversity, such as temperature scaling, encounter a worsened trade-off between diversity and accuracy. Motivated by this challenge, we treat parallel reasoning as a set-of-next-token-prediction problem, and incorporate a set-based global loss into Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) using self-supervised bipartite matching between our global forking tokens and unique reasoning traces. We observe that, while naive fine-tuning with multiple reasoning traces collapses these unique reasoning modes, our proposed method, Set Supervised Fine-Tuning (SSFT), preserves these modes and produces emergent global forking tokens. Experiments on multiple reasoning benchmarks show that our SSFT consistently outperforms SFT under both Pass@1 and Cons@k metrics.

  Modern large language models often encode sensitive, harmful, or copyrighted knowledge, raising the need for post-hoc unlearning-the ability to remove specific domains of knowledge from a model without full retraining. A major bottleneck in current unlearning pipelines is constructing effective forget sets-datasets that approximate the target domain and guide the model to forget it. In this work, we introduce a scalable, automated approach to generate high-quality forget sets using language models themselves. Our method synthesizes textbook-style data through a structured prompting pipeline, requiring only a domain name as input. Through experiments on unlearning biosecurity, cybersecurity, and Harry Potter novels, we show that our synthetic datasets consistently outperform the baseline synthetic alternatives and are comparable to the expert-curated ones. Additionally, ablation studies reveal that the multi-step generation pipeline significantly boosts data diversity, which in turn improves unlearning utility. Overall, our findings suggest that synthetic datasets offer a promising path toward practical, scalable unlearning for a wide range of emerging domains without the need for manual intervention. We release our code and dataset atthis https URL.

  Reasoning language models improve performance on complex tasks by generating long chains of thought (CoTs), but this process can also increase harmful outputs in adversarial settings. In this work, we ask whether the long CoTs can be leveraged for predictive safety monitoring: do the reasoning traces provide early signals of final response alignment that could enable timely intervention? We evaluate a range of monitoring methods using either CoT text or activations, including highly capable large language models, fine-tuned classifiers, and humans. First, we find that a simple linear probe trained on CoT activations significantly outperforms all text-based baselines in predicting whether a final response is safe or unsafe, with an average absolute increase of 13 in F1 scores over the best-performing alternatives. CoT texts are often unfaithful and misleading, while model latents provide a more reliable predictive signal. Second, the probe can be applied to early CoT segments before the response is generated, showing that alignment signals appear before reasoning completes. Error analysis reveals that the performance gap between text classifiers and the linear probe largely stems from a subset of responses we call performative CoTs, where the reasoning consistently contradicts the final response as the CoT progresses. Our findings generalize across model sizes, families, and safety benchmarks, suggesting that lightweight probes could enable real-time safety monitoring and early intervention during generation.

  Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) systems rely on high-quality benchmarks to evaluate complex multi-hop reasoning. However, despite their widespread use, popular datasets such as WebQSP and CWQ suffer from critical quality issues, including inaccurate or incomplete ground-truth annotations, poorly constructed questions that are ambiguous, trivial, or unanswerable, and outdated or inconsistent knowledge. Through a manual audit of 16 popular KGQA datasets, including WebQSP and CWQ, we find that the average factual correctness rate is only 57 %. To address these issues, we introduce KGQAGen, an LLM-in-the-loop framework that systematically resolves these pitfalls. KGQAGen combines structured knowledge grounding, LLM-guided generation, and symbolic verification to produce challenging and verifiable QA instances. Using KGQAGen, we construct KGQAGen-10k, a ten-thousand scale benchmark grounded in Wikidata, and evaluate a diverse set of KG-RAG models. Experimental results demonstrate that even state-of-the-art systems struggle on this benchmark, highlighting its ability to expose limitations of existing models. Our findings advocate for more rigorous benchmark construction and position KGQAGen as a scalable framework for advancing KGQA evaluation.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) are typically aligned to refuse harmful instructions through safety fine-tuning. A recent attack, termed abliteration, identifies and suppresses the single latent direction most responsible for refusal behavior, thereby enabling models to generate harmful content. We propose a defense that fundamentally alters how models express refusal. We construct an extended-refusal dataset in which responses to harmful prompts provide detailed justifications before refusing, distributing the refusal signal across multiple token positions. Fine-tuning Llama-2-7B-Chat and Qwen2.5-Instruct (1.5B and 3B parameters) on this dataset yields models that maintain high refusal rates under abliteration: refusal rates drop by at most 10%, compared to 70-80% drops in baseline models. Comprehensive evaluations of safety and utility demonstrate that extended-refusal fine-tuning effectively neutralizes abliteration attacks while preserving general model performance and enhancing robustness across multiple alignment scenarios.

  Bangla is a language spoken by approximately 240 million native speakers and around 300 million people worldwide. Despite being the 5th largest spoken language in the world, Bangla is still a "low-resource" language, and existing pretrained language models often struggle to perform well on Bangla Language Processing (BLP) tasks. This paper addresses this gap by: (1) introducing two high-quality translated Bangla-instruction datasets totaling 224k samples - Bangla-Orca (172k) and Bangla-Alpaca (52k); and (2) leveraging these datasets to develop BanglaLlama, an open-source family of Bangla-specific LLMs, consisting of five base and instruct variants. We present our methodology, two large datasets, and comprehensive benchmarking results showcasing the effectiveness of our dataset and model on multiple benchmarks. We believe our proposed datasets and models will serve as the new standard baseline for future research focused on this widely spoken yet "low-resource" language.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Contrastive decoding strategies are widely used to reduce object hallucinations in multimodal large language models (MLLMs). These methods work by constructing contrastive samples to induce hallucinations and then suppressing them in the output distribution. However, this paper demonstrates that such approaches fail to effectively mitigate the hallucination problem. The performance improvements observed on POPE Benchmark are largely driven by two misleading factors: (1) crude, unidirectional adjustments to the model's output distribution and (2) the adaptive plausibility constraint, which reduces the sampling strategy to greedy search. To further illustrate these issues, we introduce a series of spurious improvement methods and evaluate their performance against contrastive decoding techniques. Experimental results reveal that the observed performance gains in contrastive decoding are entirely unrelated to its intended goal of mitigating hallucinations. Our findings challenge common assumptions about the effectiveness of contrastive decoding strategies and pave the way for developing genuinely effective solutions to hallucinations in MLLMs.

  Large language models (LLMs) show the promise in supporting scientific research implementation, yet their ability to generate correct and executable code remains limited. Existing works largely adopt one-shot settings, ignoring the iterative and feedback-driven nature of realistic workflows of scientific research development. To address this gap, we present RECODE-H, a benchmark of 102 tasks from research papers and repositories that evaluates LLM agents through multi-turn interactions with LLM-simulated human feedback. It includes structured instructions,unit tests, and a five-level feedback hierarchy to reflect realistic researcher-agent collaboration. We further present ReCodeAgent, a framework that integrates feedback into iterative code generation. Experiments with leading LLMs, including GPT-5, Claude-Sonnet-4, DeepSeek-V3.1, and Gemini 2.5, show substantial performance gains with richer feedback, while also highlighting ongoing challenges in the generation of complex research code. RECODE-H establishes a foundation for developing adaptive, feedback-driven LLM agents in scientific research implementation

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) generate text through iterative denoising steps, achieving parallel decoding by denoising only high-confidence positions at each step. However, existing approaches often repetitively remask tokens due to initially low confidence scores, leading to redundant iterations and limiting overall acceleration. Through the analysis of dLLM decoding traces, we observe that the model often determines the final prediction for a token several steps before the decoding step. To leverage this historical information and avoid redundant steps, we introduce the concept of Trace Credit, which quantifies each token's convergence potential by accumulating historical logits. Furthermore, we propose CreditDecoding, a training-free parallel decoding algorithm that accelerates the confidence convergence of correct but underconfident tokens by fusing current logits with Trace Credit. This process significantly reduces redundant iterations and enhances decoding robustness. On eight benchmarks, CreditDecoding achieves a 5.48 times speedup and a 0.48 performance improvement over LLaDA-8B-Instruct, and a 4.11 times speedup with a 0.15 performance improvement over LLaDA-MoE-Instruct. Importantly, CreditDecoding scales effectively to long sequences and is orthogonal to mainstream inference optimizations, making it a readily integrable and versatile solution.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across a wide range of natural language processing tasks. However, Chinese LLMs face unique challenges, primarily due to the dominance of unstructured free text and the lack of structured representations in Chinese corpora. While existing benchmarks for LLMs partially assess Chinese LLMs, they are still predominantly English-centric and fail to address the unique linguistic characteristics of Chinese, lacking structured datasets essential for robust evaluation. To address these challenges, we present a Comprehensive Benchmark for Evaluating Chinese Large Language Models (CB-ECLLM) based on the newly constructed Chinese Data-Text Pair (CDTP) dataset. Specifically, CDTP comprises over 7 million aligned text pairs, each consisting of unstructured text coupled with one or more corresponding triples, alongside a total of 15 million triples spanning four critical domains. The core contributions of CDTP are threefold: (i) enriching Chinese corpora with high-quality structured information; (ii) enabling fine-grained evaluation tailored to knowledge-driven tasks; and (iii) supporting multi-task fine-tuning to assess generalization and robustness across scenarios, including Knowledge Graph Completion, Triple-to-Text generation, and Question Answering. Furthermore, we conduct rigorous evaluations through extensive experiments and ablation studies to assess the effectiveness, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), and robustness of the benchmark. To support reproducible research, we offer an open-source codebase and outline potential directions for future investigations based on our insights.

  Owing to their reasoning capabilities, large language models (LLMs) have been evaluated on planning tasks described in natural language. However, LLMs have largely been tested on planning domains without constraints. In order to deploy them in real-world settings where adherence to constraints, in particular safety constraints, is critical, we need to evaluate their performance on constrained planning tasks. We introduce LexiCon -- a natural language-based (Lexi) constrained (Con) planning benchmark, consisting of a suite of environments, that can be used to evaluate the planning capabilities of LLMs in a principled fashion. The core idea behind LexiCon is to take existing planning environments and impose temporal constraints on the states. These constrained problems are then translated into natural language and given to an LLM to solve. A key feature of LexiCon is its extensibility. That is, the set of supported environments can be extended with new (unconstrained) environment generators, for which temporal constraints are constructed automatically. This renders LexiCon future-proof: the hardness of the generated planning problems can be increased as the planning capabilities of LLMs improve. Our experiments reveal that the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs, including reasoning models like GPT-5, o3, and R1, deteriorates as the degree of constrainedness of the planning tasks increases.

  Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed on complex reasoning tasks, yet little is known about their ability to internally evaluate problem difficulty, which is an essential capability for adaptive reasoning and efficient resource allocation. In this work, we investigate whether LLMs implicitly encode problem difficulty in their internal representations. Using a linear probe on the final-token representations of LLMs, we demonstrate that the difficulty level of math problems can be linearly modeled. We further locate the specific attention heads of the final Transformer layer: these attention heads have opposite activation patterns for simple and difficult problems, thus achieving perception of difficulty. Our ablation experiments prove the accuracy of the location. Crucially, our experiments provide practical support for using LLMs as automatic difficulty annotators, potentially substantially reducing reliance on costly human labeling in benchmark construction and curriculum learning. We also uncover that there is a significant difference in entropy and difficulty perception at the token level. Our study reveals that difficulty perception in LLMs is not only present but also structurally organized, offering new theoretical insights and practical directions for future research.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present EvalMORAAL, a transparent chain-of-thought (CoT) framework that uses two scoring methods (log-probabilities and direct ratings) plus a model-as-judge peer review to evaluate moral alignment in 20 large language models. We assess models on the World Values Survey (55 countries, 19 topics) and the PEW Global Attitudes Survey (39 countries, 8 topics). With EvalMORAAL, top models align closely with survey responses (Pearson's r approximately 0.90 on WVS). Yet we find a clear regional difference: Western regions average r=0.82 while non-Western regions average r=0.61 (a 0.21 absolute gap), indicating consistent regional bias. Our framework adds three parts: (1) two scoring methods for all models to enable fair comparison, (2) a structured chain-of-thought protocol with self-consistency checks, and (3) a model-as-judge peer review that flags 348 conflicts using a data-driven threshold. Peer agreement relates to survey alignment (WVS r=0.74, PEW r=0.39, both p<.001), supporting automated quality checks. These results show real progress toward culture-aware AI while highlighting open challenges for use across regions.

  Long-context models (LCMs) have demonstrated great potential in processing long sequences, facilitating many real-world applications. The success of LCMs can be attributed to their ability to locate implicit critical information within the context for further prediction. However, recent research reveals that LCMs are often susceptible to contextual noise, i.e., irrelevant tokens, that can mislead model attention. In this paper, we conduct a fine-grained analysis of the context noise and propose an effective metric, the Integrated Gradient (IG) score, to detect and quantify the noise information within the context. Our findings reveal that even simple mitigation of detected context noise can substantially boost the model's attention on critical tokens and benefit subsequent predictions. Building on this insight, we propose Context Denoising Training (CDT), a straightforward yet effective training strategy that improves attention on critical tokens while reinforcing their influence on model predictions. Extensive experiments across four tasks, under both context window scaling and long-context alignment settings, demonstrate the superiority of CDT. Notably, when trained with CDT, an open-source 8B model can achieve performance (50.92) comparable to GPT-4o (51.00).

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  While large language models (LLMs) exhibit strong multilingual abilities, their reliance on English as latent representations creates a translation barrier, where reasoning implicitly depends on internal translation into English. When this process fails, performance in non-English languages deteriorates sharply, limiting the inclusiveness of LLM-based applications. Existing cross-lingual in-context learning (X-ICL) methods primarily leverage monolingual demonstrations, often failing to mitigate this barrier and instead reinforcing it. In this work, we introduce code-switching in-context learning (CSICL), a simple yet effective prompting strategy that progressively transitions from a target language to English within demonstrations and instruction to facilitate their latent reasoning in English. By explicitly scaffolding the reasoning process through controlled code-switching, CSICL acts as an implicit linguistic bridge that enhances cross-lingual alignment and reduces reliance on the translation barrier. We conduct extensive experiments across 4 LLMs, 6 datasets, and 10 languages, spanning both knowledge-intensive and reasoning-oriented domains. Our results demonstrate that CSICL consistently outperforms X-ICL baselines, achieving gains of 3.1%p and 1.9%p in both target and unseen languages, respectively. The improvement is even more pronounced in low-resource settings, with gains of 14.7% in target and 5.3% in unseen languages. These findings establish code-switching as a principled and robust approach for overcoming the translation barrier during inference, moving LLMs toward more equitable and effective multilingual systems.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Implicit Attribute Value Extraction (AVE) is essential for accurately representing products in e-commerce, as it infers lantent attributes from multimodal data. Despite advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs), implicit AVE remains challenging due to the complexity of multidimensional data and gaps in vision-text understanding. In this work, we introduce \textsc{\modelname}, a multi-agent debate framework that employs multiple MLLM agents to iteratively refine inferences. Through a series of debate rounds, agents verify and update each other's responses, thereby improving inference performance and robustness. Experiments on the ImplicitAVE dataset demonstrate that even a few rounds of debate significantly boost accuracy, especially for attributes with initially low performance. We systematically evaluate various debate configurations, including identical or different MLLM agents, and analyze how debate rounds affect convergence dynamics. Our findings highlight the potential of multi-agent debate strategies to address the limitations of single-agent approaches and offer a scalable solution for implicit AVE in multimodal e-commerce.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Current Large Language Models (LLMs) are confronted with overwhelming information volume when comprehending long-form documents. This challenge raises the imperative of a cohesive memory module, which can elevate vanilla LLMs into autonomous reading agents. Despite the emergence of some heuristic approaches, a systematic design principle remains absent. To fill this void, we draw inspiration from Jean Piaget's Constructivist Theory, illuminating three traits of the agentic memory -- structured schemata, flexible assimilation, and dynamic accommodation. This blueprint forges a clear path toward a more robust and efficient memory system for LLM-based reading comprehension. To this end, we develop CAM, a prototype implementation of Constructivist Agentic Memory that simultaneously embodies the structurality, flexibility, and dynamicity. At its core, CAM is endowed with an incremental overlapping clustering algorithm for structured memory development, supporting both coherent hierarchical summarization and online batch integration. During inference, CAM adaptively explores the memory structure to activate query-relevant information for contextual response, akin to the human associative process. Compared to existing approaches, our design demonstrates dual advantages in both performance and efficiency across diverse long-text reading comprehension tasks, including question answering, query-based summarization, and claim verification.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) have achieved strong performance across a wide range of natural language processing tasks. However, deploying LLMs at scale for domain specific applications, such as job-person fit and explanation in job seeking platforms, introduces distinct challenges. At LinkedIn, the job person fit task requires analyzing a candidate's public profile against job requirements to produce both a fit assessment and a detailed explanation. Directly applying open source or finetuned LLMs to this task often fails to yield high quality, actionable feedback due to the complexity of the domain and the need for structured outputs. Moreover, the large size of these models leads to high inference latency and limits scalability, making them unsuitable for online use. To address these challenges, we introduce LANTERN, a novel LLM knowledge distillation framework tailored specifically for job person fit tasks. LANTERN involves modeling over multiple objectives, an encoder model for classification purpose, and a decoder model for explanation purpose. To better distill the knowledge from a strong black box teacher model to multiple downstream models, LANTERN incorporates multi level knowledge distillation that integrates both data and logit level insights. In addition to introducing the knowledge distillation framework, we share our insights on post training techniques and prompt engineering, both of which are crucial for successfully adapting LLMs to domain specific downstream tasks. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that LANTERN significantly improves task specific metrics for both job person fit and explanation. Online evaluations further confirm its effectiveness, showing measurable gains in job seeker engagement, including a 0.24\% increase in apply rate and a 0.28\% increase in qualified applications.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) often fail to scale their performance on long-context tasks performance in line with the context lengths they support. This gap is commonly attributed to retrieval failures -- the models' inability to identify relevant information in the long inputs. Accordingly, recent efforts often focus on evaluating and improving LLMs' retrieval performance: if retrieval is perfect, a model should, in principle, perform just as well on a long input as it does on a short one -- or should it? This paper presents findings that the answer to this question may be negative. Our systematic experiments across 5 open- and closed-source LLMs on math, question answering, and coding tasks reveal that, even when models can perfectly retrieve all relevant information, their performance still degrades substantially (13.9%--85%) as input length increases but remains well within the models' claimed lengths. This failure occurs even when the irrelevant tokens are replaced with minimally distracting whitespace, and, more surprisingly, when they are all masked and the models are forced to attend only to the relevant tokens. A similar performance drop is observed when all relevant evidence is placed immediately before the question. Our findings reveal a previously-unrealized limitation: the sheer length of the input alone can hurt LLM performance, independent of retrieval quality and without any distraction. They motivate our simple, model-agnostic mitigation strategy that transforms a long-context task into a short-context one by prompting the model to recite the retrieved evidence before attempting to solve the problem. On RULER, we observe a consistent improvement of GPT-4o up to 4% on an already strong baseline.

  With the increasing adoption of large language models (LLMs), ensuring the safety of LLM systems has become a pressing concern. External LLM-based guardrail models have emerged as a popular solution to screen unsafe inputs and outputs, but they are themselves fine-tuned or prompt-engineered LLMs that are vulnerable to data distribution shifts. In this paper, taking Retrieval Augmentation Generation (RAG) as a case study, we investigated how robust LLM-based guardrails are against additional information embedded in the context. Through a systematic evaluation of 3 Llama Guards and 2 GPT-oss models, we confirmed that inserting benign documents into the guardrail context alters the judgments of input and output guardrails in around 11% and 8% of cases, making them unreliable. We separately analyzed the effect of each component in the augmented context: retrieved documents, user query, and LLM-generated response. The two mitigation methods we tested only bring minor improvements. These results expose a context-robustness gap in current guardrails and motivate training and evaluation protocols that are robust to retrieval and query composition.

  This work introduces a novel methodology for the automatic detection of hallucinations generated during large language model (LLM) inference. The proposed approach is based on a systematic taxonomy and controlled reproduction of diverse hallucination types through prompt engineering. A dedicated hallucination dataset is subsequently mapped into a vector space using an embedding model and analyzed with unsupervised learning techniques in a reduced-dimensional representation of hallucinations with veridical responses. Quantitative evaluation of inter-centroid distances reveals a consistent correlation between the severity of informational distortion in hallucinations and their spatial divergence from the cluster of correct outputs. These findings provide theoretical and empirical evidence that even simple classification algorithms can reliably distinguish hallucinations from accurate responses within a single LLM, thereby offering a lightweight yet effective framework for improving model reliability.

  Common Large Language model (LLM) evaluations rely on demonstration examples to steer models' responses to the desired style. While the number of examples used has been studied and standardized, the choice of how to format examples is less investigated. In evaluation protocols and real world usage, users face the choice how to separate in-context examples: use a comma? new line? semi-colon? hashtag? etc.? Surprisingly, we find this seemingly minor choice can dramatically alter model response quality. Across leading model families (Llama, Qwen, Gemma), performance on MMLU for example can vary by $\pm 23\%$ depending on the choice of delimiter. In fact, one can manipulate model rankings to put any model in the lead by only modifying the single character separating examples. We find LLMs' brittleness pervades topics, model families, and doesn't improve with scale. By probing attention head scores, we find that good-performing delimiters steer attention towards key tokens in the input. Finally, we explore methods to improve LLMs' robustness to the choice of delimiter. We find specifying the selected delimiter in the prompt boosts robustness and offer practical recommendations for the best-performing delimiters to select.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in spoken dialogue language models (SDLMs) reflect growing interest in shifting from turn-based to full-duplex systems, where the models continuously perceive user speech streams while generating responses. This simultaneous listening and speaking design enables real-time interaction and the agent can handle dynamic conversational behaviors like user barge-in. However, during the listening phase, existing systems keep the agent idle by repeatedly predicting the silence token, which departs from human behavior: we usually engage in lightweight thinking during conversation rather than remaining absent-minded. Inspired by this, we propose Chronological Thinking, a on-the-fly conversational thinking mechanism that aims to improve response quality in full-duplex SDLMs. Specifically, chronological thinking presents a paradigm shift from conventional LLM thinking approaches, such as Chain-of-Thought, purpose-built for streaming acoustic input. (1) Strictly causal: the agent reasons incrementally while listening, updating internal hypotheses only from past audio with no lookahead. (2) No additional latency: reasoning is amortized during the listening window; once the user stops speaking, the agent halts thinking and begins speaking without further delay. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of chronological thinking through both objective metrics and human evaluations show consistent improvements in response quality. Furthermore, chronological thinking robustly handles conversational dynamics and attains competitive performance on full-duplex interaction metrics.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Discrete Diffusion Large Language Models (dLLMs) have recently emerged as a competitive paradigm for non-autoregressive language modeling. Their distinctive decoding mechanism enables faster inference speed and strong performance in code generation and mathematical tasks. In this work, we show that the decoding mechanism of dLLMs not only enhances model utility but also can be used as a powerful tool for model attribution. A key challenge in this problem lies in the diversity of attribution scenarios, including distinguishing between different models as well as between different checkpoints or backups of the same model. To ensure broad applicability, we identify two fundamental problems: what information to extract from the decoding trajectory, and how to utilize it effectively. We first observe that relying directly on per-step model confidence yields poor performance. This is mainly due to the bidirectional decoding nature of dLLMs: each newly decoded token influences the confidence of other decoded tokens, making model confidence highly redundant and washing out structural signal regarding decoding order or dependencies. To overcome this, we propose a novel information extraction scheme called the Directed Decoding Map (DDM), which captures structural relationships between decoding steps and better reveals model-specific behaviors. Furthermore, to make full use of the extracted structural information during attribution, we propose Gaussian-Trajectory Attribution (GTA), where we fit a cell-wise Gaussian distribution at each decoding position for each target model, and define the likelihood of a trajectory as the attribution score: if a trajectory exhibits higher log-likelihood under the distribution of a specific model, it is more likely to have been generated by that model. Extensive experiments under different settings validate the utility of our methods.

  Large language models (LLMs) are solidifying their position in the modern world as effective tools for the automatic generation of text. Their use is quickly becoming commonplace in fields such as education, healthcare, and scientific research. There is a growing need to study the linguistic features present in AI-generated text, as the increasing presence of such texts has profound implications in various disciplines such as corpus linguistics, computational linguistics, and natural language processing. Many observations have already been made, however a broader synthesis of the findings made so far is required to provide a better understanding of the topic. The present survey paper aims to provide such a synthesis of extant research. We categorize the existing works along several dimensions, including the levels of linguistic description, the models included, the genres analyzed, the languages analyzed, and the approach to prompting. Additionally, the same scheme is used to present the findings made so far and expose the current trends followed by researchers. Among the most-often reported findings is the observation that AI-generated text is more likely to contain a more formal and impersonal style, signaled by the increased presence of nouns, determiners, and adpositions and the lower reliance on adjectives and adverbs. AI-generated text is also more likely to feature a lower lexical diversity, a smaller vocabulary size, and repetitive text. Current research, however, remains heavily concentrated on English data and mostly on text generated by the GPT model family, highlighting the need for broader cross-linguistic and cross-model investigation. In most cases authors also fail to address the issue of prompt sensitivity, leaving much room for future studies that employ multiple prompt wordings in the text generation phase.

  Head Start programs utilizing GoEngage face significant challenges when new or rotating staff attempt to locate appropriate Tasks (modules) on the platform homepage. These difficulties arise from domain-specific jargon (e.g., IFPA, DRDP), system-specific nomenclature (e.g., Application Pool), and the inherent limitations of lexical search in handling typos and varied word ordering. We propose a pragmatic hybrid semantic search system that synergistically combines lightweight typo-tolerant lexical retrieval, embedding-based vector similarity, and constrained large language model (LLM) re-ranking. Our approach leverages the organization's existing Task Repository and Knowledge Base infrastructure while ensuring trustworthiness through low false-positive rates, evolvability to accommodate terminological changes, and economic efficiency via intelligent caching, shortlist generation, and graceful degradation mechanisms. We provide a comprehensive framework detailing required resources, a phased implementation strategy with concrete milestones, an offline evaluation protocol utilizing curated test cases (Hit@K, Precision@K, Recall@K, MRR), and an online measurement methodology incorporating query success metrics, zero-result rates, and dwell-time proxies.

  Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in decision-making contexts, but when they present answers without signaling low confidence, users may unknowingly act on erroneous outputs. While prior work shows that LLMs maintain internal uncertainty signals, their explicit verbalized confidence is typically miscalibrated and poorly discriminates between correct and incorrect answers. Across two types of LLMs, we investigate whether supervised finetuning can improve models' ability to communicate uncertainty and whether such improvements generalize across tasks and domains. We finetune the LLMs on datasets spanning general knowledge, mathematics, and open-ended trivia, and evaluate two metacognitive tasks: (1) single-question confidence estimation, where the model assigns a numeric certainty to its answer, and (2) pairwise confidence comparison, where the model selects which of two answers it is more likely to have correct. We assess generalization to unseen domains, including medical and legal reasoning. Results show that finetuning improves calibration (alignment between stated confidence and accuracy) and discrimination (higher confidence for correct vs. incorrect responses) within and across domains, while leaving accuracy unchanged. However, improvements are task-specific: training on single-question calibration does not transfer to pairwise comparison, and vice versa. In contrast, multitask finetuning on both forms of metacognition yields broader gains, producing lower calibration error and stronger discrimination in out-of-domain evaluations. These results show that while uncertainty communication in LLMs is trainable and generalizable, different metacognitive skills do not naturally reinforce one another and must be developed together through multitask training.

  _Bowen Xu_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit impressive linguistic competence but also produce inaccurate or fabricated outputs, often called ``hallucinations''. Engineering approaches usually regard hallucination as a defect to be minimized, while formal analyses have argued for its theoretical inevitability. Yet both perspectives remain incomplete when considering the conditions required for artificial general intelligence (AGI). This paper reframes ``hallucination'' as a manifestation of the generalization problem. Under the Closed World assumption, where training and test distributions are consistent, hallucinations may be mitigated. Under the Open World assumption, however, where the environment is unbounded, hallucinations become inevitable. This paper further develops a classification of hallucination, distinguishing cases that may be corrected from those that appear unavoidable under open-world conditions. On this basis, it suggests that ``hallucination'' should be approached not merely as an engineering defect but as a structural feature to be tolerated and made compatible with human intelligence.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Language model finetuning often results in learning undesirable traits in combination with desired ones. To address this, we propose inoculation prompting: modifying finetuning data by prepending a short system-prompt instruction that deliberately elicits the undesirable trait. At test time, we evaluate without the instruction; inoculated models have much lower expression of the trait than models trained with unmodified training data. Inoculation is selective: in a toy setting where assistant responses are always in Spanish and ALL-CAPS, an appropriate inoculation (e.g., ``You always speak in Spanish.'') teaches the model to capitalize responses while still responding in English. We find that inoculation is also effective across several additional settings: reducing emergent misalignment (EM) from task-specific finetuning, defending against backdoor injections, and mitigating the transmission of traits via subliminal learning. Follow-up analysis suggests a mechanism: making a trait less surprising via inoculation reduces optimization pressure to globally update the model, thereby reducing the degree of generalization. Our analysis relates to prior work on EM: inoculation explains prior findings that educational contexts mitigate EM from insecure code. Beyond demonstrating a simple and effective technique for selective learning, our results contribute to a better conceptual understanding of how and why language models generalize.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Model (LLM) pretraining, finetuning, and evaluation rely on input-space reconstruction and generative capabilities. Yet, it has been observed in vision that embedding-space training objectives, e.g., with Joint Embedding Predictive Architectures (JEPAs), are far superior to their input-space counterpart. That mismatch in how training is achieved between language and vision opens up a natural question: {\em can language training methods learn a few tricks from the vision ones?} The lack of JEPA-style LLM is a testimony of the challenge in designing such objectives for language. In this work, we propose a first step in that direction where we develop LLM-JEPA, a JEPA based solution for LLMs applicable both to finetuning and pretraining. Thus far, LLM-JEPA is able to outperform the standard LLM training objectives by a significant margin across models, all while being robust to overfiting. Those findings are observed across numerous datasets (NL-RX, GSM8K, Spider, RottenTomatoes) and various models from the Llama3, OpenELM, Gemma2 and Olmo families. Code:this https URL.

  This study investigates the adoption of open-access, locally deployable causal large language models (LLMs) for travel mode choice prediction and introduces LiTransMC, the first fine-tuned causal LLM developed for this task. We systematically benchmark eleven open-access LLMs (1-12B parameters) across three stated and revealed preference datasets, testing 396 configurations and generating over 79,000 mode choice decisions. Beyond predictive accuracy, we evaluate models generated reasoning using BERTopic for topic modelling and a novel Explanation Strength Index, providing the first structured analysis of how LLMs articulate decision factors in alignment with behavioural theory. LiTransMC, fine-tuned using parameter efficient and loss masking strategy, achieved a weighted F1 score of 0.6845 and a Jensen-Shannon Divergence of 0.000245, surpassing both untuned local models and larger proprietary systems, including GPT-4o with advanced persona inference and embedding-based loading, while also outperforming classical mode choice methods such as discrete choice models and machine learning classifiers for the same dataset. This dual improvement, i.e., high instant-level accuracy and near-perfect distributional calibration, demonstrates the feasibility of creating specialist, locally deployable LLMs that integrate prediction and interpretability. Through combining structured behavioural prediction with natural language reasoning, this work unlocks the potential for conversational, multi-task transport models capable of supporting agent-based simulations, policy testing, and behavioural insight generation. These findings establish a pathway for transforming general purpose LLMs into specialized and explainable tools for transportation research and policy formulation, while maintaining privacy, reducing cost, and broadening access through local deployment.

  Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) and AI systems have led to a paradigm shift in the design and optimization of complex AI workflows. By integrating multiple components, compound AI systems have become increasingly adept at performing sophisticated tasks. However, as these systems grow in complexity, new challenges arise in optimizing not only individual components but also their interactions. While traditional optimization methods such as supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) remain foundational, the rise of natural language feedback introduces promising new approaches, especially for optimizing non-differentiable systems. This paper provides a systematic review of recent progress in optimizing compound AI systems, encompassing both numerical and language-based techniques. We formalize the notion of compound AI system optimization, classify existing methods along several key dimensions, and highlight open research challenges and future directions in this rapidly evolving field.

  Large language models (LLMs) are known to memorize and recall English text from their pretraining data. However, the extent to which this ability generalizes to non-English languages or transfers across languages remains unclear. This paper investigates multilingual and cross-lingual memorization in LLMs, probing if memorized content in one language (e.g., English) can be recalled when presented in translation. To do so, we introduce OWL, a dataset of 31.5K aligned excerpts from 20 books in ten languages, including English originals, official translations (Vietnamese, Spanish, Turkish), and new translations in six low-resource languages (Sesotho, Yoruba, Maithili, Malagasy, Setswana, Tahitian). We evaluate memorization across model families and sizes through three tasks: (1) direct probing, which asks the model to identify a book's title and author; (2) name cloze, which requires predicting masked character names; and (3) prefix probing, which involves generating continuations. We find that LLMs consistently recall content across languages, even for texts without direct translation in pretraining data. GPT-4o, for example, identifies authors and titles 69% of the time and masked entities 6% of the time in newly translated excerpts. Perturbations (e.g., masking characters, shuffling words) modestly reduce direct probing accuracy (7% drop for shuffled official translations). Our results highlight the extent of cross-lingual memorization and provide insights on the differences between the models.

  The emergence of Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) presents new opportunities for chart understanding. However, due to the fine-grained nature of these tasks, applying MLLMs typically requires large, high-quality datasets for task-specific fine-tuning, leading to high data collection and training costs. To address this, we propose ChartCards, a unified chart-metadata generation framework for multi-task chart understanding. ChartCards systematically synthesizes various chart information, including data tables, visualization code, visual elements, and multi-dimensional semantic captions. By structuring this information into organized metadata, ChartCards enables a single chart to support multiple downstream tasks, such as text-to-chart retrieval, chart summarization, chart-to-table conversion, chart description, and chart question answering. Using ChartCards, we further construct MetaChart, a large-scale high-quality dataset containing 10,862 data tables, 85K charts, and 170 K high-quality chart captions. We validate the dataset through qualitative crowdsourcing evaluations and quantitative fine-tuning experiments across various chart understanding tasks. Fine-tuning six different models on MetaChart resulted in an average performance improvement of 5% across all tasks. The most notable improvements are seen in text-to-chart retrieval and chart-to-table tasks, with Long-CLIP and Llama 3.2-11B achieving improvements of 17% and 28%, respectively.

  Natural Language Inference (NLI) is a fundamental task in natural language processing. While NLI has developed many sub-directions such as sentence-level NLI, document-level NLI and cross-lingual NLI, Cross-Document Cross-Lingual NLI (CDCL-NLI) remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel paradigm: CDCL-NLI, which extends traditional NLI capabilities to multi-document, multilingual scenarios. To support this task, we construct a high-quality CDCL-NLI dataset including 25,410 instances and spanning 26 languages. To address the limitations of previous methods on CDCL-NLI task, we further propose an innovative method that integrates RST-enhanced graph fusion with interpretability-aware prediction. Our approach leverages RST (Rhetorical Structure Theory) within heterogeneous graph neural networks for cross-document context modeling, and employs a structure-aware semantic alignment based on lexical chains for cross-lingual understanding. For NLI interpretability, we develop an EDU (Elementary Discourse Unit)-level attribution framework that produces extractive explanations. Extensive experiments demonstrate our approach's superior performance, achieving significant improvements over both conventional NLI models as well as large language models. Our work sheds light on the study of NLI and will bring research interest on cross-document cross-lingual context understanding, hallucination elimination and interpretability inference.

  Test-time compute methods can significantly improve the reasoning capabilities and problem-solving accuracy of large language models (LLMs). However, these approaches require substantially more computational resources, with most compute wasted on exploring low-diversity branches where the model already exhibits high confidence. We observe that a small subset of uncertain reasoning steps has a disproportionately large impact on final prediction accuracy, and branching at these critical junctures tends to yield more diverse and higher-quality candidate reasoning steps. We propose Entropy-Gated Branching (EGB), which branches only at high-uncertainty steps and prunes expansions with a lightweight verifier. On mathematical and financial reasoning benchmarks, EGB improves accuracy by 22.6% over standard inference while operating 31%-75% faster across math benchmarks than test-time beam search with higher performance. Our results show that dynamic resource allocation during inference can substantially improve both efficiency and effectiveness, offering a more scalable pathway to enhanced LLM reasoning capabilities.

  Language agents powered by large language models (LLMs) face significant deployment challenges in resource-constrained environments, particularly for specialized domains and less-common languages. This paper presents Tox-chat, a Korean chemical toxicity information agent devised within these limitations. We propose two key innovations: a context-efficient architecture that reduces token consumption through hierarchical section search, and a scenario-based dialogue generation methodology that effectively distills tool-using capabilities from larger models. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that our fine-tuned 8B parameter model substantially outperforms both untuned models and baseline approaches, in terms of DB faithfulness and preference. Our work offers valuable insights for researchers developing domain-specific language agents under practical constraints.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Artificial intelligence systems based on large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as agents that interact with users and with the world. To do so successfully, LLMs need to construct internal representations of the world and form probabilistic beliefs about those representations. To provide a user with personalized recommendations, for example, the LLM needs to gradually infer the user's preferences, over the course of multiple interactions. To evaluate whether contemporary LLMs are able to do so, we use the Bayesian inference framework from probability theory, which lays out the optimal way to update an agent's beliefs as it receives new information. We first show that LLMs do not update their beliefs as expected from the Bayesian framework, and that consequently their predictions do not improve as expected as more information becomes available. To address this issue, we teach the LLMs to reason in a Bayesian manner by training them to mimic the predictions of the normative Bayesian model. We find that this approach not only significantly improves the LLM's performance on the particular recommendation task it is trained on, but also enables generalization to other tasks. This suggests that this method teaches the LLM to better approximate Bayesian reasoning. More generally, our results indicate that LLMs can effectively learn reasoning skills from examples and generalize those skills to new domains.

  Recent LLMs have shown remarkable success in following user instructions, yet handling instructions with multiple constraints remains a significant challenge. In this work, we introduce WildIFEval - a large-scale dataset of 7K real user instructions with diverse, multi-constraint conditions. Unlike prior datasets, our collection spans a broad lexical and topical spectrum of constraints, extracted from natural user instructions. We categorize these constraints into eight high-level classes to capture their distribution and dynamics in real-world scenarios. Leveraging WildIFEval, we conduct extensive experiments to benchmark the instruction-following capabilities of leading LLMs. WildIFEval clearly differentiates between small and large models, and demonstrates that all models have a large room for improvement on such tasks. We analyze the effects of the number and type of constraints on performance, revealing interesting patterns of model constraint-following behavior. We release our dataset to promote further research on instruction-following under complex, realistic conditions.

  Adversarial prompts are capable of jailbreaking frontier large language models (LLMs) and inducing undesirable behaviours, posing a significant obstacle to their safe deployment. Current mitigation strategies primarily rely on activating built-in defence mechanisms or fine-tuning LLMs, both of which are computationally expensive and can sacrifice model utility. In contrast, detection-based approaches are more efficient and practical for deployment in real-world applications. However, the fundamental distinctions between adversarial and benign prompts remain poorly understood. In this work, we introduce CurvaLID, a novel defence framework that efficiently detects adversarial prompts by leveraging their geometric properties. It is agnostic to the type of LLM, offering a unified detection framework across diverse adversarial prompts and LLM architectures. CurvaLID builds on the geometric analysis of text prompts to uncover their underlying differences. We theoretically extend the concept of curvature via the Whewell equation into an $n$-dimensional word embedding space, enabling us to quantify local geometric properties, including semantic shifts and curvature in the underlying manifolds. To further enhance our solution, we leverage Local Intrinsic Dimensionality (LID) to capture complementary geometric features of text prompts within adversarial subspaces. Our findings show that adversarial prompts exhibit distinct geometric signatures from benign prompts, enabling CurvaLID to achieve near-perfect classification and outperform state-of-the-art detectors in adversarial prompt detection. CurvaLID provides a reliable and efficient safeguard against malicious queries as a model-agnostic method that generalises across multiple LLMs and attack families.

  Having a clean dataset has been the foundational assumption of most natural language processing (NLP) systems. However, properly written text is rarely found in real-world scenarios and hence, oftentimes invalidates the aforementioned foundational assumption. Recently, Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance, but can they handle the inevitable noise in real-world data? This work tackles this critical question by investigating LLMs' resilience against morphological variations in text. To that end, we artificially introduce varying levels of noise into a diverse set of datasets and systematically evaluate LLMs' robustness against the corrupt variations of the original text. Our findings show that contrary to popular beliefs, generative LLMs are quiet robust to noisy perturbations in text. This is a departure from pre-trained models like BERT or RoBERTa whose performance has been shown to be sensitive to deteriorating noisy text. Additionally, we test LLMs' resilience on multiple real-world benchmarks that closely mimic commonly found errors in the wild. With minimal prompting, LLMs achieve a new state-of-the-art on the benchmark tasks of Grammar Error Correction (GEC) and Lexical Semantic Change (LSC). To empower future research, we also release a dataset annotated by humans stating their preference for LLM vs. human-corrected outputs along with the code to reproduce our results.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The Key-Value (KV) cache introduces substantial memory overhead during large language model (LLM) inference. Although existing vector quantization (VQ) methods reduce KV cache usage and provide flexible representational capacity across bit-widths, they suffer severe performance degradation at ultra-low bit-widths due to key cache outliers that hinder effective codebook utilization. To address this challenge, we propose VecInfer, a novel VQ method for aggressive KV cache compression while enabling efficient inference. By applying smooth and Hadamard transformations, VecInfer suppresses outliers in the key cache, enabling the codebook to comprehensively cover the original data distribution and thereby reducing quantization difficulty. To facilitate efficient deployment, we design an optimized CUDA kernel that fuses computation with dequantization to minimize memory access overhead. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that VecInfer consistently outperforms existing quantization baselines across both long-context understanding and mathematical reasoning tasks. With only 2-bit quantization, VecInfer achieves performance comparable to full precision, while delivering up to $\mathbf{2.7\times}$ speedup in large-batch self-attention computation and $\mathbf{8.3\times}$ reduction in single-batch end-to-end latency on Llama-3.1-8B with a 196k sequence length.

  _Jan Cegin, Branislav Pecher, Ivan Srba, Jakub Simko_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  LLMs are powerful generators of synthetic data, which are used for training smaller, specific models. This is especially valuable for low-resource languages, where human-labelled data is scarce but LLMs can still produce high-quality text. However, LLMs differ in how useful their outputs are for training. Selecting the best LLM as a generator is challenging because extrinsic evaluation requires costly human annotations (which are often unavailable for low-resource languages), while intrinsic metrics correlate poorly with downstream performance. We introduce Round robin Synthetic data Evaluation (RoSE), a proxy metric for selecting the best LLM generator without human test sets. RoSE trains a small model on the outputs of a candidate generator (LLM) and then evaluates it on generated synthetic examples from all other candidate LLMs. The final RoSE score is the mean performance of this small model. Across six LLMs, eleven languages, and three tasks (sentiment, topic, intent), RoSE identifies the optimal generator more often than any other intrinsic heuristics. RoSE outperforms intrinsic heuristics and comes within 0.76 percentage points of the optimal generator baseline. This result is measured in terms of downstream performance, obtained by training a small model on the chosen generator's outputs (optimal vs. proxy metric selected) and evaluating it on human-labelled test data. Additionally, RoSE is the only metric to achieve a positive correlation with performance on human test data.

  Distilling the thinking traces of a Large Language Model (LLM) with reasoning capabilities into a smaller model has been proven effective. Yet, there is a scarcity of work done on how model performances scale with the quantity of distillation data. In this work, we study the scaling trend of distilling competitive coding skills on two small non-reasoning LLMs. We validate the hypothesis that there is a $\textit{valley of code reasoning}$: downstream performance on competitive coding first drops as data quantity increases, then it steadily increases in a sharper-than-log-linear fashion. Having identified the trend, we further fine-tune the models at two different distillation stages on the same data to ground conclusions on their respective learning phases. We learn that across stages in the low and medium-low data regimes, small models benefit significantly from easier coding questions than from harder ones. We also find that, surprisingly, the correctness of outputs in training data makes no difference to distillation outcomes. Our work represents a step forward in understanding the training dynamics of code reasoning distillation outside intuition

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent Large Language Model (LLM) post-training methods rely on token-level clipping mechanisms during Reinforcement Learning (RL). However, we identify a fundamental flaw in this Outcome-Supervised RL (OSRL) paradigm: the Importance Sampling (IS) ratios of positive-advantage tokens are mismatched, leading to unbalanced token weighting for positive and negative tokens. This mismatch suppresses the update of low-probability tokens while over-amplifying already high-probability ones. To address this, we propose Asymmetric Importance Sampling Policy Optimization (ASPO), which uses a simple yet effective strategy that flips the IS ratios of positive-advantage tokens, aligning their update direction with the learning dynamics of negative ones. AIS further incorporates a soft dual-clipping mechanism to stabilize extreme updates while maintaining gradient flow. Comprehensive experiments on coding and mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that ASPO significantly mitigates premature convergence, improves training stability, and enhances final performance over strong GRPO-based baselines. Our analysis provides new insights into the role of token-level weighting in OSRL and highlights the critical importance of correcting IS in LLM RL. The code and models of ASPO are available atthis https URL.

  Recent studies employing Large Language Models (LLMs) to test the Argument from the Poverty of the Stimulus (APS) have yielded contrasting results across syntactic phenomena. This paper investigates the hypothesis that characteristics of the stimuli used in recent studies, including lexical ambiguities and structural complexities, may confound model performance. A methodology is proposed for re-evaluating LLM competence on syntactic prediction, focusing on GPT-2. This involves: 1) establishing a baseline on previously used (both filtered and unfiltered) stimuli, and 2) generating a new, refined dataset using a state-of-the-art (SOTA) generative LLM (Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview) guided by linguistically-informed templates designed to mitigate identified confounds. Our preliminary findings indicate that GPT-2 demonstrates notably improved performance on these refined PG stimuli compared to baselines, suggesting that stimulus quality significantly influences outcomes in surprisal-based evaluations of LLM syntactic competency.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as a dominant method in Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) for large language models, which augments the transformer layer with one down-projection $A$ and one up-projection $B$. However, LoRA's reliance on a single down-projection matrix ($A$) creates a representational bottleneck, as this solitary feature extractor is inherently insufficient for capturing the diverse signals required by complex tasks. This motivates our architectural shift to focus on enriching the feature adaptation to improve the downstream task adaptation ability. We propose MASA (Multi-$A$ Shared Adaptation), an architecture that implements a multi-$A$, single-$B$ structure where the multi-$A$ expert ensemble is asymmetrically shared across layers to ensure parameter efficiency. In MASA, these specialized experts capture diverse features, which are then integrated by a single, layer-specific $B$-matrix. The effectiveness and versatility of our method are validated through a comprehensive suite of experiments spanning multi-domain generalization, single-domain specialization, and multi-task reasoning. For example, on the MMLU benchmark, MASA achieves an average accuracy of 59.62%, outperforming the standard LoRA by 1.08 points (a relative improvement of 1.84%) with comparable learnable parameters of 0.52%.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent studies probing the Argument from the Poverty of the Stimulus (APS) have applied Large Language Models (LLMs) to test the learnability of complex syntax through surprisal-based metrics. However, divergent conclusions raise questions concerning the insights these metrics offer. While Wilcox et al. (2024) used direct minimal pair comparisons (the "wh-effect") to demonstrate that models successfully generalise knowledge of filler-gap dependencies, Lan et al. (2024) used a Difference-in-Differences (DiD) metric and found that models largely fail on parasitic gaps (PGs). This paper argues that the direct minimal pair approach offers greater diagnostic transparency. We demonstrate this by generating a full 8-permutation paradigm of refined PG stimuli and evaluating the GPT-2 model used in previous studies with a systematic Wilcox-style wh-effect analysis. Our results show that GPT-2 succeeds across all four tested conditions, indicating robust knowledge of filler-gap licensing principles even in complex PG environments. This finding, which contrasts with the more ambiguous results from DiD-style metrics, suggests that the choice of evaluation metric is critical for assessing an LLM's syntactic competence.

  In a recent study, Lu, Song, and Zhang (2025) (LSZ) propose that large language models (LLMs), when prompted in different languages, display culturally specific tendencies. They report that the two models (i.e., GPT and ERNIE) respond in more interdependent and holistic ways when prompted in Chinese, and more independent and analytic ways when prompted in English. LSZ attribute these differences to deep-seated cultural patterns in the models, claiming that prompt language alone can induce substantial cultural shifts. While we acknowledge the empirical patterns they observed, we find their experiments, methods, and interpretations problematic. In this paper, we critically re-evaluate the methodology, theoretical framing, and conclusions of LSZ. We argue that the reported "cultural tendencies" are not stable traits but fragile artifacts of specific models and task design. To test this, we conducted targeted replications using a broader set of LLMs and a larger number of test items. Our results show that prompt language has minimal effect on outputs, challenging LSZ's claim that these models encode grounded cultural beliefs.

  It has become increasingly challenging for firms to comply with a plethora of novel digital regulations. This is especially true for smaller businesses that often lack both the resources and know-how to draft complex legal documents. Instead of seeking costly legal advice from attorneys, firms may turn to cheaper alternative legal service providers such as automated contract generators. While these services have a long-standing presence, there is little empirical evidence on their prevalence and output quality.We address this gap in the context of a 2023 Swiss privacy law revision. To enable a systematic evaluation, we create and annotate a multilingual benchmark dataset that captures key compliance obligations under Swiss and EU privacy law. Using this dataset, we validate a novel GPT-5-based method for large-scale compliance assessment of privacy policies, allowing us to measure the impact of the revision. We observe compliance increases indicating an effect of the revision. Generators, explicitly referenced by 18% of local websites, are associated with substantially higher levels of compliance, with increases of up to 15 percentage points compared to privacy policies without generator use. These findings contribute to three debates: the potential of LLMs for cross-lingual legal analysis, the Brussels Effect of EU regulations, and, crucially, the role of automated tools in improving compliance and contractual quality.

  The landscape of Large Language Models (LLMs) remains predominantly English-centric, resulting in a significant performance gap for other major languages, such as French, especially in the context of Small Language Models (SLMs). Existing multilingual models demonstrate considerably lower performance in French compared to English, and research on efficient adaptation methods for French remains limited. To address this, we introduce \textbf{Luth}, a family of French-specialized SLMs: through targeted post-training on curated, high-quality French data, our models outperform all open-source counterparts of comparable size on multiple French benchmarks while retaining their original English capabilities. We further show that strategic model merging enhances performance in both languages, establishing Luth as a new state of the art for French SLMs and a robust baseline for future French-language research.

  Balancing exploration and exploitation remains a central challenge in reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) for large language models (LLMs). Current RLVR methods often overemphasize exploitation, leading to entropy collapse, diminished exploratory capacity, and ultimately limited performance gains. Although techniques that increase policy stochasticity can promote exploration, they frequently fail to escape dominant behavioral modes. This creates a self-reinforcing loop-repeatedly sampling and rewarding dominant modes-that further erodes exploration. We introduce Exploration-Enhanced Policy Optimization (EEPO), a framework that promotes exploration via two-stage rollouts with adaptive unlearning. In the first stage, the model generates half of the trajectories; it then undergoes a lightweight unlearning step to temporarily suppress these sampled responses, forcing the second stage to explore different regions of the output space. This sample-then-forget mechanism disrupts the self-reinforcing loop and promotes wider exploration during rollouts. Across five reasoning benchmarks, EEPO outperforms GRPO, achieving average relative gains of 24.3% on Qwen2.5-3B, 33.0% on Llama3.2-3B-Instruct, and 10.4% on Qwen3-8B-Base.

However, this approach still suffers from inefficient exploration, sparse reward signals, and ambiguous global reward feedback. To address these challenges, we propose DecEx-RAG, which models RAG as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) incorporating decision-making and execution, while introducing an efficient pruning strategy to optimize data expansion. Through comprehensive process-level policy optimization, DecEx-RAG significantly enhances the autonomous task decomposition, dynamic retrieval, and high-quality answer generation capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Experiments show that DecEx-RAG achieves an average absolute performance improvement of $6.2\%$ across six datasets, significantly outperforming existing baselines. Moreover, the pruning strategy improves data construction efficiency by nearly $6 \times$, providing an efficient solution for process-supervised RAG training. The code is available atthis https URL.

  Agents based on large language models (LLMs) struggle with brainless trial-and-error and generating hallucinatory actions due to a lack of global planning in long-horizon tasks. In this paper, we introduce a plan-and-execute framework and propose EAGLET, an efficient and effective planner training method to enhance the executor agent's planning abilities without human effort. Specifically, we train a plug-and-play global planner through a two-step process: we first synthesize high-quality plans from an advanced LLM using our proposed homologous consensus filtering strategy, and apply fine-tuning as a cold start. Moreover, we further improve the planner with a rule-based reinforcement learning stage using a novel executor capability gain reward, ensuring it can handle task instructions of varying difficulty. Experiments on three long-horizon agent tasks show that executor agents equipped with our planner outperform existing methods, achieving new state-of-the-art performance. Meanwhile, EAGLET reduces training costs by 8x compared to RL-based baselines, and it does not require manual effort or extra training data, offering an efficient and effective solution.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advancements in language agents have led to significant improvements in multi-hop reasoning tasks. However, existing approaches often struggle with handling open-domain problems, which require massive information retrieval due to their reliance on a fixed sequence of actions. To address this, we propose Feedback-Guided Dynamic Interactive Planning (FGDIP), a novel framework tailored to enhance reasoning in LLMs by utilizing dynamic and adaptive strategies for information exploration in open-domain multi-hop reasoning tasks. Our approach begins by identifying key entities relevant to the problem, which serve as the initial nodes in the reasoning process. From these initial nodes, we then generate reasoning child nodes with the process being refined through a combination of historical error analysis and real-time feedback, which allows the framework to dynamically adjust and optimize its reasoning strategies. By integrating depth-first search with an innovative node generation technique, our framework adapts based on both prior error paths and concurrently generated nodes at the same hierarchical level. This dynamic strategy effectively expands the search space while ensuring the reasoning process systematically converges toward accurate solutions. Experimental results show that FGDIP achieved up to 54.47% F1 score on the HotpotQA dataset and 70.05% on the StrategyQA dataset, surpassing the best baseline by 5.03% and 7.25% respectively, highlighting its versatility and potential to enhance language agents in multi-hop reasoning tasks.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Self-play preference optimization has emerged as a prominent paradigm for aligning large language models (LLMs). It typically involves a language model to generate on-policy responses for prompts and a reward model (RM) to guide the selection of chosen and rejected responses, which can be further trained with direct preference optimization (DPO). However, the role of prompts remains underexplored, despite being a core component in this pipeline. In this work, we investigate how prompts of varying difficulty influence self-play preference optimization. We first use the mean reward of $N$ sampled responses of a prompt as a proxy for its difficulty. We find that difficult prompts exhibit substantially inferior self-play optimization performance in comparison to easy prompts for language models. Moreover, incorporating difficult prompts into training fails to enhance overall performance and, in fact, leads to slight degradation compared to training on easy prompts alone. We also observe that the performance gap between difficult and easy prompts closes as the model capacity increases, suggesting that difficulty interacts with the model capacity. Building on these findings, we explore strategies to mitigate the negative effect of difficult prompts on final performance. We demonstrate that selectively removing an appropriate portion of challenging prompts enhances overall self-play performance, while also reporting failed attempts and lessons learned.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Despite impressive breadth, LLMs still rely on explicit reasoning instructions or static, one-fits-all steering methods, leaving a gap for adaptive, instruction-free reasoning amplification. We present Prototype-Based Dynamic Steering (PDS), a test-time method that amplifies large language model (LLM) reasoning without adding or altering instructions. We introduce "reasoning prototypes" by clustering activation differences between Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and neutral prompts. At inference, an input's hidden state is projected onto these prototypes to form an instance-specific steering vector. Evaluated on GSM8K, AQuA-RAT, and BIG-Bench tasks, PDS consistently improves accuracy without fine-tuning or prompt engineering. Notably, the gains persist even when CoT is explicitly suppressed to improve cost-efficiency, indicating that the intervention strengthens latent reasoning processes rather than inducing a superficial behavioral shift. These results position dynamic, prototype-guided steering as a lightweight alternative to training-time approaches for enhancing LLM reasoning.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  LLMs have been widely used in planning, either as planners to generate action sequences end-to-end, or as formalizers to represent the planning domain and problem in a formal language that can derive plans deterministically. However, both lines of work rely on standard benchmarks that only include generic and simplistic environmental specifications, leading to potential overestimation of the planning ability of LLMs and safety concerns in downstream tasks. We bridge this gap by augmenting widely used planning benchmarks with manually annotated, fine-grained, and rich natural language constraints spanning four formally defined categories. Over 4 state-of-the-art reasoning LLMs, 3 formal languages, 5 methods, and 4 datasets, we show that the introduction of constraints not only consistently halves performance, but also significantly challenges robustness to problem complexity and lexical shift.

  Making theory-of-mind inferences from human dialogue is a strong indicator of a model's underlying social abilities, which are fundamental for adept AI assistants. However, large language and reasoning models struggle to understand sophisticated social phenomena in transcript data, such as sarcasm and irony. To assess the weaknesses of current models and to identify their solutions, we introduce SocialNLI (SoNLI) -- the first social dialogue inference dataset. SoNLI consists of a collection of dialogue transcripts hand-picked to center complex social nuances like irony and sarcasm, paired with inferences, corresponding likelihood scores, and human-written explanations. We explore social inference analysis as a facet of theory-of-mind, and evaluate LLM and reasoning model theory-of-mind ability through multi-step counterfactual reasoning.

  Large language models (LLMs) and agent-based frameworks have advanced rapidly, enabling diverse applications. Yet, with the proliferation of models and agentic strategies, practitioners face substantial uncertainty in selecting the best configuration for a downstream task. Prior studies show that different agents and backbones exhibit complementary strengths, and that larger models are not always superior, underscoring the need for adaptive routing mechanisms. Existing approaches to agent routing, however, often emphasize cost efficiency while overlooking the fine-grained contextual and relational structure inherent in QA tasks. In this paper, we propose tAgentRouter, a framework that formulates multi-agent QA as a knowledge-graph-guided routing problem supervised by empirical performance signals. Specifically, we convert QA instance into a knowledge graph that jointly encodes queries, contextual entities, and agents, and then train a heterogeneous graph neural network (GNN) to propagate information across node types and produce task-aware routing distributions over agents. By leveraging soft supervision and weighted aggregation of agent outputs, AgentRouter learns principled collaboration schemes that capture the complementary strengths of diverse agents. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework consistently outperforms single-agent and ensemble baselines, while generalizing across benchmarks and LLM backbones. These results highlight the effectiveness and robustness of graph-supervised multi-agent routing for question answering.

  Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in interactive applications, and human evaluation remains the gold standard for assessing their performance in multi-turn conversations. Since human studies are costly, time-consuming, and hard to reproduce, recent work explores using LLMs to simulate users for automatic assistant evaluation. However, there is no benchmark or systematic study to evaluate whether these simulated users are reliable stand-ins for real users. To address this, we introduce SimulatorArena, a benchmark of 909 annotated human-LLM conversations on two interactive tasks -- math tutoring and document creation. SimulatorArena evaluates simulators based on how closely their messages match human behavior and how well their assistant ratings align with human judgments. Experiments on various simulator methods show that simulators conditioned on user profiles, capturing traits like background and message styles, align closely with human judgments. They reach Spearman's $\rho$ of 0.7 on both tasks, providing a practical, scalable alternative to human evaluation. Using the best simulator for each task, we benchmark 18 assistants, including the latest LLMs such as GPT-5, Claude 4.1 Opus, and Gemini 2.5 Pro.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) increasingly generate natural language rationales to enhance interpretability, but these often contain logical errors, label mismatches, and domain-specific misalignments. Directly using such rationales as supervision risks propagating noise and undermining training stability. To address this challenge, we introduce Self-Filtered Distillation, a framework specifically tailored for patent classification, which treats LLM-generated rationales as trust signals rather than ground-truth supervision. The framework employs selective distillation guided by three unsupervised trust metrics: (1) Self-Consistency, which measures the stability of LLM-generated rationales across multiple generations; (2) Class Entailment Alignment, which assesses semantic coherence with patent-specific class definitions; and (3) LLM Agreement Scoring, which validates rationale-label plausibility. These metrics are integrated into a unified trust score that primarily weights training samples while optionally filtering out extremely low-trust cases, enabling reasoning-aware supervision. Experiments on the USPTO-2M dataset, a widely used benchmark for patent classification, show that our method outperforms label-based learning and conventional distillation in accuracy, stability, and interpretability, establishing a reliable paradigm for leveraging reasoning-aware trust indicators in patent analytics.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) have recently been used to empower autonomous agents in engineering, significantly improving automation and efficiency in labor-intensive workflows. However, their potential remains underexplored in structural engineering, particularly for finite element modeling tasks requiring geometric modeling, complex reasoning, and domain knowledge. To bridge this gap, this paper develops a LLM-based multi-agent system to automate finite element modeling of 2D frames. The system decomposes structural analysis into subtasks, each managed by a specialized agent powered by the lightweight Llama-3.3 70B Instruct model. The workflow begins with a Problem Analysis Agent, which extracts geometry, boundary, and material parameters from the user input. Next, a Geometry Agent incrementally derives node coordinates and element connectivity by applying expert-defined rules. These structured outputs are converted into executable OpenSeesPy code by a Translation Agent and refined by a Model Validation Agent through consistency checks. Then, a Load Agent applies load conditions into the assembled structural model. Experimental evaluations on 20 benchmark problems demonstrate that the system achieves accuracy over 80% in most cases across 10 repeated trials, outperforming Gemini-2.5 Pro and ChatGPT-4o models.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Responsible use of Authorship Verification (AV) systems not only requires high accuracy but also interpretable solutions. More importantly, for systems to be used to make decisions with real-world consequences requires the model's prediction to be explainable using interpretable features that can be traced to the original texts. Neural methods achieve high accuracies, but their representations lack direct interpretability. Furthermore, LLM predictions cannot be explained faithfully -- if there is an explanation given for a prediction, it doesn't represent the reasoning process behind the model's prediction. In this paper, we introduce Residualized Similarity (RS), a novel method that supplements systems using interpretable features with a neural network to improve their performance while maintaining interpretability. Authorship verification is fundamentally a similarity task, where the goal is to measure how alike two documents are. The key idea is to use the neural network to predict a similarity residual, i.e. the error in the similarity predicted by the interpretable system. Our evaluation across four datasets shows that not only can we match the performance of state-of-the-art authorship verification models, but we can show how and to what degree the final prediction is faithful and interpretable.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Historical archives on weather events are collections of enduring primary source records that offer rich, untapped narratives of how societies have experienced and responded to extreme weather events. These qualitative accounts provide insights into societal vulnerability and resilience that are largely absent from meteorological records, making them valuable for climate scientists to understand societal responses. However, their vast scale, noisy digitized quality, and archaic language make it difficult to transform them into structured knowledge for climate research. To address this challenge, we introduce WeatherArchive-Bench, the first benchmark for evaluating retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems on historical weather archives. WeatherArchive-Bench comprises two tasks: WeatherArchive-Retrieval, which measures a system's ability to locate historically relevant passages from over one million archival news segments, and WeatherArchive-Assessment, which evaluates whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can classify societal vulnerability and resilience indicators from extreme weather narratives. Extensive experiments across sparse, dense, and re-ranking retrievers, as well as a diverse set of LLMs, reveal that dense retrievers often fail on historical terminology, while LLMs frequently misinterpret vulnerability and resilience concepts. These findings highlight key limitations in reasoning about complex societal indicators and provide insights for designing more robust climate-focused RAG systems from archival contexts. The constructed dataset and evaluation framework are publicly available atthis https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As Large Language Models (LLMs) gain stronger multilingual capabilities, their ability to handle culturally diverse entities becomes crucial. Prior work has shown that LLMs often favor Western-associated entities in Arabic, raising concerns about cultural fairness. Due to the lack of multilingual benchmarks, it remains unclear if such biases also manifest in different non-Western languages. In this paper, we introduce Camellia, a benchmark for measuring entity-centric cultural biases in nine Asian languages spanning six distinct Asian cultures. Camellia includes 19,530 entities manually annotated for association with the specific Asian or Western culture, as well as 2,173 naturally occurring masked contexts for entities derived from social media posts. Using Camellia, we evaluate cultural biases in four recent multilingual LLM families across various tasks such as cultural context adaptation, sentiment association, and entity extractive QA. Our analyses show a struggle by LLMs at cultural adaptation in all Asian languages, with performance differing across models developed in regions with varying access to culturally-relevant data. We further observe that different LLM families hold their distinct biases, differing in how they associate cultures with particular sentiments. Lastly, we find that LLMs struggle with context understanding in Asian languages, creating performance gaps between cultures in entity extraction.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large-scale public deliberations generate thousands of free-form contributions that must be synthesized into representative and neutral summaries for policy use. While LLMs have been shown as a promising tool to generate summaries for large-scale deliberations, they also risk underrepresenting minority perspectives and exhibiting bias with respect to the input order, raising fairness concerns in high-stakes contexts. Studying and fixing these issues requires a comprehensive evaluation at a large scale, yet current practice often relies on LLMs as judges, which show weak alignment with human judgments. To address this, we present DeliberationBank, a large-scale human-grounded dataset with (1) opinion data spanning ten deliberation questions created by 3,000 participants and (2) summary judgment data annotated by 4,500 participants across four dimensions (representativeness, informativeness, neutrality, policy approval). Using these datasets, we train DeliberationJudge, a fine-tuned DeBERTa model that can rate deliberation summaries from individual perspectives. DeliberationJudge is more efficient and more aligned with human judgements compared to a wide range of LLM judges. With DeliberationJudge, we evaluate 18 LLMs and reveal persistent weaknesses in deliberation summarization, especially underrepresentation of minority positions. Our framework provides a scalable and reliable way to evaluate deliberation summarization, helping ensure AI systems are more representative and equitable for policymaking.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  When people listen to or read a sentence, they actively make predictions about upcoming words: words that are less predictable are generally read more slowly than predictable ones. The success of large language models (LLMs), which, like humans, make predictions about upcoming words, has motivated exploring the use of these models as cognitive models of human linguistic prediction. Surprisingly, in the last few years, as language models have become better at predicting the next word, their ability to predict human reading behavior has declined. This is because LLMs are able to predict upcoming words much better than people can, leading them to predict lower processing difficulty in reading than observed in human experiments; in other words, mainstream LLMs are 'superhuman' as models of language comprehension. In this position paper, we argue that LLMs' superhumanness is primarily driven by two factors: compared to humans, LLMs have much stronger long-term memory for facts and training examples, and they have much better short-term memory for previous words in the text. We advocate for creating models that have human-like long-term and short-term memory, and outline some possible directions for achieving this goal. Finally, we argue that currently available human data is insufficient to measure progress towards this goal, and outline human experiments that can address this gap.

  Natural Language Description (NLD) is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) task that requires models to generate structured and meaningful outputs from natural language inputs. In this work, we propose NLD-LLM, a systematic NLP framework to evaluate the performance of language models to generate accurate and concise source code descriptions. This framework incorporates a diverse set of transformer models, including Qwen, DeepSeek, Phi, LLaMA, and Mistral, spanning various sizes, architectures, and training approaches. Central to NLD-LLM is a comprehensive prompt design strategy that includes standardized formatting, clear task guidance, and NLD prompting, ensuring fair and consistent evaluation. Additionally, we apply an iterative refinement process to improve output's quality and assess the model's adaptability. Using semantic and structural metrics, our analysis demonstrates that prompt engineering significantly impacts the effectiveness of the model such that smaller models often performing competitively when supported by well-crafted prompts.

  The rapid growth of scientific publications has made it increasingly difficult to keep literature reviews comprehensive and up-to-date. Though prior work has focused on automating retrieval and screening, the writing phase of systematic reviews remains largely under-explored, especially with regard to readability and factual accuracy. To address this, we present LiRA (Literature Review Agents), a multi-agent collaborative workflow which emulates the human literature review process. LiRA utilizes specialized agents for content outlining, subsection writing, editing, and reviewing, producing cohesive and comprehensive review articles. Evaluated on SciReviewGen and a proprietary ScienceDirect dataset, LiRA outperforms current baselines such as AutoSurvey and MASS-Survey in writing and citation quality, while maintaining competitive similarity to human-written reviews. We further evaluate LiRA in real-world scenarios using document retrieval and assess its robustness to reviewer model variation. Our findings highlight the potential of agentic LLM workflows, even without domain-specific tuning, to improve the reliability and usability of automated scientific writing.

  Synthetic data generated by large language models has become integral to modern NLP training pipelines, from bootstrapping reasoning capabilities to augmenting instruction-following datasets. While recent work demonstrates successful applications maintaining high external data ratios, systematic understanding of how synthetic data proportion affects model behavior across different scales remains limited. This paper presents a controlled empirical study examining model performance, calibration, and output characteristics when trained on varying synthetic-to-external data ratios. Using the Pythia model suite (410M-12B parameters) across five diverse tasks, we evaluate models after one to three training iterations with synthetic data proportions ranging from 0-50\%. Our key findings include: models maintain stable performance with up to 20\% synthetic data, but degradation accelerates beyond 30\%; larger models (6.9B-12B) show greater robustness to synthetic data than smaller models (410M-1.4B); calibration degradation precedes accuracy loss, providing an early warning signal; and task characteristics matter, with reasoning tasks degrading faster than retrieval tasks under synthetic data training. Importantly, we find that current best practices, such as those employed in STaR and Self-Instruct systems that maintain greater than 80\% external data, operate well within safe regimes identified by our experiments. We provide practical guidance for practitioners on synthetic data budgets based on model scale and task requirements, alongside detailed comparison with concurrent work including Shumailov et al.'s model collapse findings.

  In-context learning (ICL) enables efficient few-shot learning in large language models (LLMs) without training, but suffers from the quadratic input complexity of transformers, limiting the maximum number of exemplars. While various efficient ICL approaches partition the context into blocks to process (e.g., ensembling, compression, cross-attention), they often ignore the information redundancy or under-representation caused by different partition strategies, leading to suboptimal performance. To tackle this problem, we propose Sub-CP, a block-aware context selection framework that leverages submodular objectives to control block diversity. Sub-CP supports a flexible spectrum of selection strategies, allowing each block to range from globally diverse to locally coherent. This allows fine-grained control over semantic structure while enabling precomputation. Extensive experiments across diverse tasks on multiple datasets show that Sub-CP consistently improves performance across model scales.

  Task oriented dialogue systems (TOD) complete particular tasks based on user preferences across natural language interactions. Considering the impressive performance of large language models (LLMs) in natural language processing (NLP) tasks, most of the latest TODs are centered on LLMs. While proactive planning is crucial for task completion, many existing TODs overlook effective goal-aware planning. This paper creates a model for managing task-oriented conversations, conceptualized centered on the information state approach to dialogue management. The created model incorporated constructive intermediate information in planning. Initially, predefined slots and text part informational components are created to model user preferences. Investigating intermediate information, critical circumstances are identified. Informational components corresponding to these circumstances are created. Possible configurations for these informational components lead to limited information states. Then, dialogue moves, which indicate movement between these information states and the procedures that must be performed in the movements, are created. Eventually, the update strategy is constructed. The created model is implemented leveraging in-context learning of LLMs. In this model,  database queries are created centered on indicated predefined slots and the order of retrieved entities is indicated centered on text part. This mechanism enables passing the whole corresponding entities to the preferences in the order of congruency. Evaluations exploiting the complete test conversations of MultiWOZ, with no more than a domain in a conversation, illustrate maximal inform and success, and improvement compared with previous methods.

  Despite rapid advances in multimodal large language models, agricultural applications remain constrained by the scarcity of domain-tailored models, curated vision-language corpora, and rigorous evaluation. To address these challenges, we present the AgriGPT-VL Suite, a unified multimodal framework for agriculture. Our contributions are threefold. First, we introduce Agri-3M-VL, the largest vision-language corpus for agriculture to our knowledge, curated by a scalable multi-agent data generator; it comprises 1M image-caption pairs, 2M image-grounded VQA pairs, 50K expert-level VQA instances, and 15K GRPO reinforcement learning samples. Second, we develop AgriGPT-VL, an agriculture-specialized vision-language model trained via a progressive curriculum of textual grounding, multimodal shallow/deep alignment, and GRPO refinement. This method achieves strong multimodal reasoning while preserving text-only capability. Third, we establish AgriBench-VL-4K, a compact yet challenging evaluation suite with open-ended and image-grounded questions, paired with multi-metric evaluation and an LLM-as-a-judge framework. Experiments show that AgriGPT-VL outperforms leading general-purpose VLMs on AgriBench-VL-4K, achieving higher pairwise win rates in the LLM-as-a-judge evaluation. Meanwhile, it remains competitive on the text-only AgriBench-13K with no noticeable degradation of language ability. Ablation studies further confirm consistent gains from our alignment and GRPO refinement stages.

  Multimodal reasoning models have recently shown promise on challenging domains such as olympiad-level geometry, yet their evaluation remains dominated by aggregate accuracy, a single score that obscures where and how models are improving. We introduce MathLens, a benchmark designed to disentangle the subskills of multimodal reasoning while preserving the complexity of textbook-style geometry problems. The benchmark separates performance into three components: Perception: extracting information from raw inputs, Reasoning: operating on available information, and Integration: selecting relevant perceptual evidence and applying it within reasoning. To support each test, we provide annotations: visual diagrams, textual descriptions to evaluate reasoning in isolation, controlled questions that require both modalities, and probes for fine-grained perceptual skills, all derived from symbolic specifications of the problems to ensure consistency and robustness. Our analysis reveals that different training approaches have uneven effects: First, reinforcement learning chiefly strengthens perception, especially when supported by textual supervision, while textual SFT indirectly improves perception through reflective reasoning. Second, reasoning improves only in tandem with perception. Third, integration remains the weakest capacity, with residual errors concentrated there once other skills advance. Finally, robustness diverges: RL improves consistency under diagram variation, whereas multimodal SFT reduces it through overfitting. We will release all data and experimental logs.

  This paper investigates algorithmic bias in language-based models for automated depression detection, focusing on socio-demographic disparities related to gender and race/ethnicity. Models trained using deep neural networks (DNN) based embeddings are compared to few-shot learning approaches with large language models (LLMs), evaluating both performance and fairness on clinical interview transcripts from the Distress Analysis Interview Corpus/Wizard-of-Oz (DAIC-WOZ). To mitigate bias, fairness-aware loss functions are applied to DNN-based models, while in-context learning with varied prompt framing and shot counts is explored for LLMs. Results indicate that LLMs outperform DNN-based models in depression classification, particularly for underrepresented groups such as Hispanic participants. LLMs also exhibit reduced gender bias compared to DNN-based embeddings, though racial disparities persist. Among fairness-aware techniques for mitigating bias in DNN-based embeddings, the worst-group loss, which is designed to minimize loss for the worst-performing demographic group, achieves a better balance between performance and fairness. In contrast, the fairness-regularized loss minimizes loss across all groups but performs less effectively. In LLMs, guided prompting with ethical framing helps mitigate gender bias in the 1-shot setting. However, increasing the number of shots does not lead to further reductions in disparities. For race/ethnicity, neither prompting strategy nor increasing $N$ in $N$-shot learning effectively reduces disparities.

  Natural language generation (NLG) tasks are often subject to inherent variability; e.g. predicting the next word given a context has multiple valid responses, evident when asking multiple humans to complete the task. While having language models (LMs) that are aligned pluralistically, so that they are able to reproduce well the inherent diversity in perspectives of an entire population of interest is clearly beneficial, Ilia and Aziz (2024) show that LMs do not reproduce this type of linguistic variability well. They speculate this inability might stem from the lack of consistent training of LMs with data reflecting this type of inherent variability. As such, we investigate whether training LMs on multiple plausible word continuations per context can improve their ability to reproduce human linguistic variability for next-word prediction. We employ fine-tuning techniques for pre-trained and instruction-tuned models; and demonstrate their potential when fine-tuning GPT-2 and Mistral-7B-IT, using Provo Corpus. Our evaluation, which measures divergence among empirically estimated human and model next-word distributions across contexts before and after fine-tuning, shows that our multi-label fine-tuning improves the LMs' ability to reproduce linguistic variability; both for contexts that admit higher and lower variability.

  Declaration of Performance (DoP) documents, mandated by EU regulation, certify the performance of construction products. There are two challenges to make DoPs machine and human accessible through automated key-value pair extraction (KVP) and question answering (QA): (1) While some of their content is standardized, DoPs vary widely in layout, schema, and format; (2) Both users and documents are multilingual. Existing static or LLM-only Information Extraction (IE) pipelines fail to adapt to this structural document and user diversity. Our domain-specific, agentic system addresses these challenges through a planner-executor-responder architecture. The system infers user intent, detects document language and modality, and orchestrates tools dynamically for robust, traceable reasoning while avoiding tool misuse or execution loops. Our agent outperforms baselines (ROUGE: 0.783 vs. 0.703/0.608) with better cross-lingual stability (17-point vs. 21-26-point variation).

  Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant capabilities in solving mathematical problems expressed in natural language. However, multilingual and culturally-grounded mathematical reasoning in low-resource languages lags behind English due to the scarcity of socio-cultural task datasets that reflect accurate native entities such as person names, organization names, and currencies. Existing multilingual benchmarks are predominantly produced via translation and typically retain English-centric entities, owing to the high cost associated with human annotater-based localization. Moreover, automated localization tools are limited, and hence, truly localized datasets remain scarce. To bridge this gap, we introduce a framework for LLM-driven cultural localization of math word problems that automatically constructs datasets with native names, organizations, and currencies from existing sources. We find that translated benchmarks can obscure true multilingual math ability under appropriate socio-cultural contexts. Through extensive experiments, we also show that our framework can help mitigate English-centric entity bias and improves robustness when native entities are introduced across various languages.

  With the rapid growth of academic publications, peer review has become an essential yet time-consuming responsibility within the research community. Large Language Models (LLMs) have increasingly been adopted to assist in the generation of review comments; however, current LLM-based review tasks lack a unified evaluation benchmark to rigorously assess the models' ability to produce comprehensive, accurate, and human-aligned assessments, particularly in scenarios involving multimodal content such as figures and tables. To address this gap, we propose \textbf{MMReview}, a comprehensive benchmark that spans multiple disciplines and modalities. MMReview includes multimodal content and expert-written review comments for 240 papers across 17 research domains within four major academic disciplines: Artificial Intelligence, Natural Sciences, Engineering Sciences, and Social Sciences. We design a total of 13 tasks grouped into four core categories, aimed at evaluating the performance of LLMs and Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) in step-wise review generation, outcome formulation, alignment with human preferences, and robustness to adversarial input manipulation. Extensive experiments conducted on 16 open-source models and 5 advanced closed-source models demonstrate the thoroughness of the benchmark. We envision MMReview as a critical step toward establishing a standardized foundation for the development of automated peer review systems.

  Knowledge editing aims to modify outdated knowledge in large language models (LLMs) efficiently while retaining their original capabilities. Mainstream benchmarks for knowledge editing are predominantly static and fail to keep in pace with the evolving real-world knowledge. In this work, we introduce CRAFT, an ever-evolving real-world benchmark for knowledge editing. It features well-designed paired edits for composite reasoning, and evaluates models on alias portability as well as temporal and common-sense locality, making it a challenging knowledge editing benchmark on which previous knowledge editing methods hardly achieve balanced performance. Towards flexible real-time editing, we propose KEDAS, a novel paradigm of knowledge editing alignment featuring diverse edit augmentation and self-adaptive post-alignment inference, which exhibits significant performance gain on CRAFT compared to previous methods.

It leverages graphs to model the hierarchical structure between specific concepts, enabling more coherent and effective knowledge retrieval for accuratethis http URLits conceptual promise, recent studies report that GraphRAG frequently underperforms vanilla RAG on many real-world tasks. This raises a critical question: Is GraphRAG really effective, and in which scenarios do graph structures provide measurable benefits for RAG systems? To address this, we propose GraphRAG-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate GraphRAG models onboth hierarchical knowledge retrieval and deep contextual reasoning. GraphRAG-Bench features a comprehensive dataset with tasks of increasing difficulty, coveringfact retrieval, complex reasoning, contextual summarization, and creative generation, and a systematic evaluation across the entire pipeline, from graph constructionand knowledge retrieval to final generation. Leveraging this novel benchmark, we systematically investigate the conditions when GraphRAG surpasses traditional RAG and the underlying reasons for its success, offering guidelines for its practical application.

  This paper introduces ExpertLongBench, an expert-level benchmark containing 11 tasks from 9 domains that reflect realistic expert workflows and applications. Beyond question answering, the application-driven tasks in ExpertLongBench demand long-form outputs that can exceed 5,000 tokens and strict adherence to domain-specific requirements. Notably, each task in ExpertLongBench includes a rubric, designed or validated by domain experts, to specify task requirements and guide output evaluation. Furthermore, we propose CLEAR, an evaluation framework that supports accurate evaluation of long-form model outputs in our benchmark. To achieve fine-grained, expert-aligned evaluation, CLEAR derives checklists from both model outputs and references by extracting information corresponding to items in the task-specific rubric. Checklist items of model outputs are then compared with corresponding items of reference outputs to assess their correctness, enabling grounded evaluation. We benchmark 13 popular large language models (LLMs) and analyze components in CLEAR, showing that (1) existing LLMs, with the top performer Gemini-2.5-Pro achieving only a 33.4 F1 score, require significant improvement for expert-level tasks; (2) models can generate content corresponding to the required aspects, but far from correct; and (3) accurate checklist extraction and comparison in CLEAR can be achieved by open-weight models for more scalable, reproducible, and low-cost usage.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) are capable of recalling multilingual factual knowledge present in their pretraining data. However, most studies evaluate only the final model, leaving the development of factual recall and crosslingual consistency throughout pretraining largely unexplored. In this work, we trace how factual recall and crosslingual consistency evolve during pretraining, focusing on OLMo-7B as a case study. We find that both accuracy and consistency improve over time for most languages. We show that this improvement is primarily driven by the fact frequency in the pretraining corpus: more frequent facts are more likely to be recalled correctly, regardless of language. Yet, some low-frequency facts in non-English languages can still be correctly recalled. Our analysis reveals that these instances largely benefit from crosslingual transfer of their English counterparts -- an effect that emerges predominantly in the early stages of pretraining. We pinpoint two distinct pathways through which multilingual factual knowledge acquisition occurs: (1) frequency-driven learning, which is dominant and language-agnostic, and (2) crosslingual transfer, which is limited in scale and typically constrained to relation types involving named entities. We release our code and data to facilitate further research atthis https URL.

  A line of work in planning uses LLM not to generate a plan, but to generate a formal representation in some planning language, which can be input into a symbolic solver to deterministically find a plan. While showing improved trust and promising performance, dozens of recent publications have proposed scattered methods on a variety of benchmarks under different experimental settings. We attempt to unify the inference-time LLM-as-formalizer methodology for classical planning by proposing a unifying framework based on intermediate representations. We thus systematically evaluate more than a dozen pipelines that subsume most existing work, while proposing novel ones that involve syntactically similar but high resource intermediate languages (such as a Python wrapper of PDDL). We provide recipes for planning language generation pipelines, draw a series of conclusions showing the efficacy of their various components, and evidence their robustness against problem complexity.

  Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly evaluated on reasoning tasks, yet their logical abilities remain contested. To address this, we study LLMs' reasoning in a well-defined fragment of logic: syllogistic reasoning. We cast the problem as premise selection and construct controlled datasets to isolate logical competence. Beyond evaluation, an open challenge is enabling LLMs to acquire abstract inference patterns that generalize to novel structures. We propose to apply few-shot meta-learning to this domain, thereby encouraging models to extract rules across tasks rather than memorize patterns within tasks. Although meta-learning has been little explored in the context of logic learnability, our experiments show that it is effective: small models (1.5B-7B) fine-tuned with meta-learning demonstrate strong gains in generalization, with especially pronounced benefits in low-data regimes. These meta-learned models outperform GPT-4o and o3-mini on our syllogistic reasoning task.

  The growing collaboration between humans and AI models in generative tasks has introduced new challenges in distinguishing between human-written, LLM-generated, and human--LLM collaborative texts. In this work, we collect a multilingual, multi-domain, multi-generator dataset FAIDSet. We further introduce a fine-grained detection framework FAID to classify text into these three categories, and also to identify the underlying LLM family of the generator. Unlike existing binary classifiers, FAID is built to capture both authorship and model-specific characteristics. Our method combines multi-level contrastive learning with multi-task auxiliary classification to learn subtle stylistic cues. By modeling LLM families as distinct stylistic entities, we incorporate an adaptation to address distributional shifts without retraining for unseen data. Our experimental results demonstrate that FAID outperforms several baselines, particularly enhancing the generalization accuracy on unseen domains and new LLMs, thus offering a potential solution for improving transparency and accountability in AI-assisted writing.

  As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for ideation and scientific discovery, it is important to evaluate their ability to generate novel output. Prior work evaluates novelty as originality with respect to model training data, but original outputs may be of low quality. In contrast, non-expert judges more reliably score quality but may favor memorized outputs, limiting the reliability of human preference as a metric. We introduce a new novelty metric for LLM generations that balances originality and quality -- the harmonic mean of the fraction of \ngrams unseen during training and a task-specific quality score. Using this framework, we identify trends that affect the novelty of generations from three families of open-data models (OLMo, OLMo-2, and Pythia) on three creative tasks: story completion, poetry writing, and creative tool use. We find that model-generated text from some base LLMs is less novel than human-written text from the internet. However, increasing model scale and post-training reliably improves novelty due to improvements in output quality. We also find that improving the base model at the same scale (\eg OLMo 7B to OLMo-2 7B) leads to higher novelty due to higher originality. Finally, we observe that inference-time methods, such as prompting and providing novel in-context examples, have a much smaller effect on novelty, often increasing originality at the expense of quality. This highlights the need for further research into more effective elicitation strategies as we use models for creative applications.

  Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have accelerated progress toward artificial general intelligence, yet their potential to generate harmful content poses critical safety challenges. Existing alignment methods often struggle to cover diverse safety scenarios and remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks. In this work, we propose SAFER, a framework for Safety Alignment via eFficient Ex-Ante Reasoning. Our approach instantiates structured Ex-Ante reasoning through initial assessment, rule verification, and path calibration, and embeds predefined safety rules to provide transparent and verifiable safety judgments. Specifically, our approach consists of two training stages: (1) supervised fine-tuning with synthetic traces to teach the multi-stage Ex-Ante reasoning, and (2) step-level reasoning preference optimization to jointly enhance safety, utility, and efficiency. Experiments on multiple open-source LLMs demonstrate that SAFER significantly enhances safety performance while maintaining helpfulness and response efficiency.

  Selective retrieval improves the accuracy and efficiency of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) by reducing distractions from low-quality retrievals. However, existing approaches underutilize the inherent knowledge of large language models (LLMs), leading to suboptimal retrieval decisions and degraded generation performance. To bridge this gap, we propose Self-Routing RAG (SR-RAG), a novel framework that binds selective retrieval with knowledge verbalization. SR-RAG enables an LLM to dynamically decide whether to retrieve external knowledge or verbalize its own parametric knowledge. To this end, we design a multi-task objective that jointly optimizes an LLM for knowledge source selection, knowledge verbalization, and response generation. SR-RAG further incorporates a nearest neighbor search mechanism at inference time to improve the accuracy of knowledge source decisions under domain shifts. Fine-tuning three LLMs with SR-RAG significantly improves both their response accuracy and reduces the inference latency. Compared to the strongest selective retrieval baseline, SR-RAG reduces the number of retrievals by 29% while improving performance by 5.1%.

  Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has gained popularity as a method for conveniently incorporating novel facts that were not seen during the pre-training stage in Large Language Model (LLM)-based Natural Language Generation (NLG) systems. However, LLMs are known to encode significant levels of unfair social biases. The modulation of these biases by RAG in NLG systems is not well understood. In this paper, we systematically study the relationship between the different components of a RAG system and the social biases presented in the text generated across three languages (i.e. English, Japanese and Chinese) and four social bias types (i.e. gender, race, age and religion). Specifically, using the Bias Question Answering (BBQ) benchmark datasets, we evaluate the social biases in RAG responses from document collections with varying levels of stereotypical biases, employing multiple LLMs used as generators. We find that the biases in document collections are often amplified in the generated responses, even when the generating LLM exhibits a low-level of bias. Our findings raise concerns about the use of RAG as a technique for injecting novel facts into NLG systems and call for careful evaluation of potential social biases in RAG applications before their real-world deployment.

  In large language models (LLMs), certain \emph{neurons} can store distinct pieces of knowledge learned during pretraining. While factual knowledge typically appears as a combination of \emph{relations} and \emph{entities}, it remains unclear whether some neurons focus on a relation itself -- independent of any entity. We hypothesize such neurons \emph{detect} a relation in the input text and \emph{guide} generation involving such a relation. To investigate this, we study the LLama-2 family on a chosen set of relations, with a \textit{statistics}-based method. Our experiments demonstrate the existence of relation-specific neurons. We measure the effect of selectively deactivating candidate neurons specific to relation $r$ on the LLM's ability to handle (1) facts involving relation $r$ and (2) facts involving a different relation $r' \neq r$. With respect to their capacity for encoding relation information, we give evidence for the following three properties of relation-specific neurons. \textbf{(i) Neuron cumulativity.} Multiple neurons jointly contribute to processing facts involving relation $r$, with no single neuron fully encoding a fact in $r$ on its own. \textbf{(ii) Neuron versatility.} Neurons can be shared across multiple closely related as well as less related relations. In addition, some relation neurons transfer across languages. \textbf{(iii) Neuron interference.} Deactivating neurons specific to one relation can improve LLMs' factual recall performance for facts of other relations. We make our code and data publicly available atthis https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Current social bias benchmarks for Large Language Models (LLMs) primarily rely on predefined question formats like multiple-choice, limiting their ability to reflect the complexity and open-ended nature of real-world interactions. To close this gap, we extend an existing dataset BBQ (Parrish et al., 2022) to Open-BBQ, a comprehensive framework to evaluate the social bias of LLMs in open-ended settings by incorporating two additional question categories: fill-in-the-blank and short-answer. Since our new Open-BBQ dataset contains a lot of open-ended responses like sentences and paragraphs, we developed an evaluation process to detect biases from open-ended content by labeling sentences and paragraphs. In addition to this, we also found that existing debiasing methods, such as self-debiasing (Gallegos et al., 2024), have over-correction issues, which make the original correct answers incorrect. In order to solve this issue, we propose Composite Prompting, an In-context Learning (ICL) method combining structured examples with explicit chain-of-thought reasoning to form a unified instruction template for LLMs to explicitly identify content that needs debiasing. Experimental results show that the proposed method significantly reduces the bias for both GPT-3.5 and GPT-4o while maintaining high accuracy.

  Use of large language models such as ChatGPT (GPT-4/GPT-5) for mental health support has grown rapidly, emerging as a promising route to assess and help people with mood disorders like depression. However, we have a limited understanding of these language models' schema of mental disorders, that is, how they internally associate and interpret symptoms of such disorders. In this work, we leveraged contemporary measurement theory to decode how GPT-4 and GPT-5 interrelate depressive symptoms, providing an explanation of how LLMs apply what they learn and informing clinical applications. We found that GPT-4 (a) had strong convergent validity with standard instruments and expert judgments $(r = 0.70 - 0.81)$, and (b) behaviorally linked depression symptoms with each other (symptom inter-correlates $r = 0.23 - 0.78$) in accordance with established literature on depression; however, it (c) underemphasized the relationship between $\textit{suicidality}$ and other symptoms while overemphasizing $\textit{psychomotor symptoms}$; and (d) suggested novel hypotheses of symptom mechanisms, for instance, indicating that $\textit{sleep}$ and $\textit{fatigue}$ are broadly influenced by other depressive symptoms, while $\textit{worthlessness/guilt}$ is only tied to $\textit{depressed mood}$. GPT-5 showed a slightly lower convergence with self-report, a difference our machine-behavior analysis makes interpretable through shifts in symptom-symptom relationships. These insights provide an empirical foundation for understanding language models' mental health assessments and demonstrate a generalizable approach for explainability in other models and disorders. Our findings can guide key stakeholders to make informed decisions for effectively situating these technologies in the care system.

  Assessing the capabilities and limitations of large language models (LLMs) has garnered significant interest, yet the evaluation of multiple models in real-world scenarios remains rare. Multilingual evaluation often relies on translated benchmarks, which typically do not capture linguistic and cultural nuances present in the source language. This study provides an extensive assessment of 24 LLMs on real world data collected from Indian patients interacting with a medical chatbot in Indian English and 4 other Indic languages. We employ a uniform Retrieval Augmented Generation framework to generate responses, which are evaluated using both automated techniques and human evaluators on four specific metrics relevant to our application. We find that models vary significantly in their performance and that instruction tuned Indic models do not always perform well on Indic language queries. Further, we empirically show that factual correctness is generally lower for responses to Indic queries compared to English queries. Finally, our qualitative work shows that code-mixed and culturally relevant queries in our dataset pose challenges to evaluated models.

  Large language models (LLMs) are playing an increasingly important role in scientific research, yet there remains a lack of comprehensive benchmarks to evaluate the breadth and depth of scientific knowledge embedded in these models. To address this gap, we introduce SciKnowEval, a large-scale dataset designed to systematically assess LLMs across five progressive levels of scientific understanding: memory, comprehension, reasoning, discernment, and application. SciKnowEval comprises 28K multi-level questions and solutions spanning biology, chemistry, physics, and materials science. Using this benchmark, we evaluate 20 leading open-source and proprietary LLMs. The results show that while proprietary models often achieve state-of-the-art performance, substantial challenges remain -- particularly in scientific reasoning and real-world application. We envision SciKnowEval as a standard benchmark for evaluating scientific capabilities in LLMs and as a catalyst for advancing more capable and reliable scientific language models.

Collecting and analyzing step-level annotations on the agent traces, we identify three consistent failure modes: captcha resolution, pop-up banner removal, and direct navigation to URLs. By constructing targeted datasets to further study these tasks, we discover variations in how different language models navigate these failure modes. We find, for example, that o4-mini deploys a wider variety of strategies to circumvent captcha resolution than other models and DeepSeek-R1 consistently misleads users about pop-up banner closure. Our findings surface both the diversity and brittleness of current web agents. More broadly, our benchmarking methodology provides an approach to evaluating and understanding web agent failure modes at scale.

  Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for decision-making tasks under uncertainty; however, their risk profiles and how they are influenced by prompting and alignment methods remain underexplored. Existing studies have primarily examined personality prompting or multi-agent interactions, leaving open the question of how post-training influences the risk behavior of LLMs. In this work, we propose a new pipeline for eliciting, steering, and modulating LLMs' risk profiles, drawing on tools from behavioral economics and finance. Using utility-theoretic models, we compare pre-trained, instruction-tuned, and RLHF-aligned LLMs, and find that while instruction-tuned models exhibit behaviors consistent with some standard utility formulations, pre-trained and RLHF-aligned models deviate more from any utility models fitted. We further evaluate modulation strategies, including prompt engineering, in-context learning, and post-training, and show that post-training provides the most stable and effective modulation of risk preference. Our findings provide insights into the risk profiles of different classes and stages of LLMs and demonstrate how post-training modulates these profiles, laying the groundwork for future research on behavioral alignment and risk-aware LLM design.

  Large language models leverage internet-scale text data, yet embodied AI remains constrained by the prohibitive costs of physical trajectory collection. Desktop environments -- particularly gaming -- offer a compelling alternative: they provide rich sensorimotor interactions at scale while maintaining the structured observation-action coupling essential for embodied learning. We present D2E (Desktop to Embodied AI), a framework that demonstrates desktop interactions can serve as an effective pretraining substrate for robotics embodied AI tasks. Unlike prior work that remained domain-specific (e.g., VPT for Minecraft) or kept data proprietary (e.g., SIMA), D2E establishes a complete pipeline from scalable desktop data collection to verified transfer in embodied domains. Our framework comprises three components: (1) the OWA Toolkit that unifies diverse desktop interactions into a standardized format with 152x compression, (2) the Generalist-IDM that achieves strong zero-shot generalization across unseen games through timestamp-based event prediction, enabling internet-scale pseudo-labeling, and (3) VAPT that transfers desktop-pretrained representations to physical manipulation and navigation. Using 1.3K+ hours of data (259 hours of human demonstrations, and 1K+ hours of pseudo-labeled gameplay), we achieve a total of 96.6% success rate on LIBERO manipulation and 83.3% on CANVAS navigation benchmarks. This validates that sensorimotor primitives in digital interactions exhibit sufficient invariance to transfer meaningfully to physical embodied tasks, establishing desktop pretraining as a practical paradigm for robotics. We will make all our work public, including the OWA toolkit, datasets of human-collected and pseudo-labeled, and VAPT-trained models available atthis https URL

  Process Reward Models (PRMs) provide step-level supervision that improves the reliability of reasoning in large language models. While PRMs have been extensively studied in text-based domains, their extension to Vision Language Models (VLMs) remains limited. Existing Vision-Language PRMs (VL-PRMs) rely on Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for data construction, which can often produce noisy supervision signals and limit generalization across tasks. In this work, we aim to elucidate the design space of VL-PRMs by exploring diverse strategies for dataset construction, training, and test-time scaling. First, we introduce a hybrid data synthesis framework that combines MCTS with judgments from a strong VLM, producing more accurate step-level labels. Second, we propose perception-focused supervision, enabling our PRM to explicitly detect errors at the visual grounding stage of reasoning. Third, we systematically evaluate multiple test-time scaling strategies, showing that our PRMs can reliably guide VLMs toward more accurate solutions. Our experiments covering five diverse multimodal benchmarks (MMMU, PuzzleVQA, AlgoPuzzleVQA, MathVista, and MathVision) reveal several key insights: (i) VL-PRMs when used as Outcome Reward Models (ORMs) during test-time scaling (TTS) can outperform VL-PRM guided process step selection, (ii) smaller VL-PRMs can match or even surpass larger ones in detecting process errors, (iii) VL-PRMs uncover latent reasoning abilities in stronger VLM backbones, (iv) perception-level supervision leads to significant gains in test-time scaling, and (v) TTS performance of different policies improve on advanced math reasoning datasets despite not training VL-PRMs on such datasets. We hope our work will motivate further research and support the advancement of VLMs.

  Outcome-driven reinforcement learning has advanced reasoning in large language models (LLMs), but prevailing tool-augmented approaches train a single, monolithic policy that interleaves thoughts and tool calls under full context; this scales poorly with long horizons and diverse tools and generalizes weakly to new scenarios. Agentic systems offer a promising alternative by decomposing work across specialized modules, yet most remain training-free or rely on offline training decoupled from the live dynamics of multi-turn interaction. We introduce AgentFlow, a trainable, in-the-flow agentic framework that coordinates four modules (planner, executor, verifier, generator) through an evolving memory and directly optimizes its planner inside the multi-turn loop. To train on-policy in live environments, we propose Flow-based Group Refined Policy Optimization (Flow-GRPO), which tackles long-horizon, sparse-reward credit assignment by converting multi-turn optimization into a sequence of tractable single-turn policy updates. It broadcasts a single, verifiable trajectory-level outcome to every turn to align local planner decisions with global success and stabilizes learning with group-normalized advantages. Across ten benchmarks, AgentFlow with a 7B-scale backbone outperforms top-performing baselines with average accuracy gains of 14.9% on search, 14.0% on agentic, 14.5% on mathematical, and 4.1% on scientific tasks, even surpassing larger proprietary models like GPT-4o. Further analyses confirm the benefits of in-the-flow optimization, showing improved planning, enhanced tool-calling reliability, and positive scaling with model size and reasoning turns.

  Large Language Model (LLM)-powered Multi-agent systems (MAS) have achieved state-of-the-art results on various complex reasoning tasks. Recent works have proposed techniques to automate the design of MASes, eliminating the need for manual engineering. However, these techniques perform poorly, often achieving similar or inferior performance to simple baselines. Furthermore, they require computationally expensive re-discovery of architectures for each new task domain and expensive data annotation on domains without existing labeled validation sets. A critical insight is that simple Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning often performs competitively with these complex systems, suggesting that the fundamental reasoning unit of MASes, CoT, warrants further investigation. To this end, we present a new paradigm for automatic MAS design that pivots the focus to optimizing CoT reasoning. We introduce the Agentic Reasoning Module (ARM), an agentic generalization of CoT where each granular reasoning step is executed by a specialized reasoning module. This module is discovered through a tree search over the code space, starting from a simple CoT module and evolved using mutations informed by reflection on execution traces. The resulting ARM acts as a versatile reasoning building block which can be utilized as a direct recursive loop or as a subroutine in a learned meta-orchestrator. Our approach significantly outperforms both manually designed MASes and state-of-the-art automatic MAS design methods. Crucially, MASes built with ARM exhibit superb generalization, maintaining high performance across different foundation models and task domains without further optimization.

  Aligning multimodal large language models (MLLMs) with human preferences often relies on single-signal, model-based reward methods. Such monolithic rewards often lack confidence calibration across domain-specific tasks, fail to capture diverse aspects of human preferences, and require extensive data annotation and reward model training. In this work, we propose a hybrid reward modeling framework that integrates complementary reward paradigms: (i) model-based rewards, where a learned reward model predicts scalar or vector scores from synthetic and human feedback, and (ii) rule-based rewards, where domain-specific heuristics provide explicit correctness signals with confidence. Beyond accuracy, we further incorporate multi-aspect rewards to enforce instruction adherence and introduce a generalized length-penalty reward to stabilize training and improve performance. The proposed framework provides a flexible and effective approach to aligning MLLMs through reinforcement learning policy optimization. Our experiments show consistent improvements across different multimodal benchmarks when applying hybrid and multi-aspect reward modeling. Our best performing model in the 3B family achieves an overall average improvement of ~9.5% across general and math reasoning tasks. Focusing specifically on mathematical benchmarks, the model achieves a significant average improvement of ~16%, highlighting its effectiveness in mathematical reasoning and problem solving.

  Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for tasks where outputs shape human decisions, so it is critical to test whether their responses reflect consistent human values. Existing benchmarks mostly track refusals or predefined safety violations, but these only check rule compliance and do not reveal whether a model upholds a coherent value system when facing controversial real-world issues. We introduce the \textbf{V}alue \textbf{AL}ignment \textbf{Bench}mark (\textbf{VAL-Bench}), which evaluates whether models maintain a stable value stance across paired prompts that frame opposing sides of public debates. VAL-Bench consists of 115K such pairs from Wikipedia's controversial sections. A well-aligned model should express similar underlying views regardless of framing, which we measure using an LLM-as-judge to score agreement or divergence between paired responses. Applied across leading open- and closed-source models, the benchmark reveals large variation in alignment and highlights trade-offs between safety strategies (e.g., refusals) and more expressive value systems. By providing a scalable, reproducible benchmark, VAL-Bench enables systematic comparison of how reliably LLMs embody human values.

  While activation steering in large language models (LLMs) is a growing area of research, methods can often incur broader effects than desired. This motivates isolation of purer concept vectors to enable targeted interventions and understand LLM behavior at a more granular level. We present RepIt, a simple and data-efficient framework for isolating concept-specific representations. Across five frontier LLMs, RepIt enables precise interventions: it selectively suppresses refusal on targeted concepts while preserving refusal elsewhere, producing models that answer WMD-related questions while still scoring as safe on standard benchmarks. We further show that the corrective signal localizes to just 100-200 neurons and that robust target representations can be extracted from as few as a dozen examples on a single A6000. This efficiency raises a dual concern: manipulations can be performed with modest compute and data to extend to underrepresented data-scarce topics while evading existing benchmarks. By disentangling refusal vectors with RepIt, this work demonstrates that targeted interventions can counteract overgeneralization, laying the foundation for more granular control of model behavior.

  Recent studies have investigated whether large language models (LLMs) can support obscured communication, which is characterized by core aspects such as inferring subtext and evading suspicions. To conduct the investigation, researchers have used social deduction games (SDGs) as their experimental environment, in which players conceal and infer specific information. However, prior work has often overlooked how LLMs should be evaluated in such settings. Specifically, we point out two limitations with the evaluation methods they employed. First, metrics used in prior studies are coarse-grained as they are based on overall game outcomes that often fail to capture event-level behaviors; Second, error analyses have lacked structured methodologies capable of producing insights that meaningfully support evaluation outcomes. To address these limitations, we propose a microscopic and systematic approach to the investigation. Specifically, we introduce six fine-grained metrics that resolve the first issue. To tackle the second issue, we conducted a thematic analysis and identified four major reasoning failures that undermine LLMs' performance in obscured communication.

  Artificial Intelligence (AI) is starting to transform the research process as we know it by automating the discovery of new solutions. Given a task, the typical AI-driven approach is (i) to generate a set of diverse solutions, and then (ii) to verify these solutions and select one that solves the problem. Crucially, this approach assumes the existence of a reliable verifier, i.e., one that can accurately determine whether a solution solves the given problem. We argue that systems research, long focused on designing and evaluating new performance-oriented algorithms, is particularly well-suited for AI-driven solution discovery. This is because system performance problems naturally admit reliable verifiers: solutions are typically implemented in real systems or simulators, and verification reduces to running these software artifacts against predefined workloads and measuring performance. We term this approach as AI-Driven Research for Systems (ADRS), which iteratively generates, evaluates, and refines solutions. Using penEvolve, an existing open-source ADRS instance, we present case studies across diverse domains, including load balancing for multi-region cloud scheduling, Mixture-of-Experts inference, LLM-based SQL queries, and transaction scheduling. In multiple instances, ADRS discovers algorithms that outperform state-of-the-art human designs (e.g., achieving up to 5.0x runtime improvements or 50% cost reductions). We distill best practices for guiding algorithm evolution, from prompt design to evaluator construction, for existing frameworks. We then discuss the broader implications for the systems community: as AI assumes a central role in algorithm design, we argue that human researchers will increasingly focus on problem formulation and strategic guidance. Our results highlight both the disruptive potential and the urgent need to adapt systems research practices in the age of AI.

  Test-time compute can be scaled both sequentially and in parallel. Sequential scaling involves lengthening the generation process, while parallel scaling involves verifying and selecting among multiple candidate outputs. Combining these two strategies has led to the most powerful AI systems, such as Grok 4 Heavy and GPT-5 Pro. In certain contexts (e.g., solving Sudoku puzzles), verifying responses can be substantially easier than generating them. This property, referred to as \emph{asymmetric verification}, highlights the strong potential of test-time scaling (TTS). In this work, we study both sequential and parallel TTS of deep search agents, motivated by the intuition that verification in this setting is often much easier than generation. In experiments, we first show that sequential scaling methods, such as budget forcing, can be effective initially but soon degrade performance. Leveraging asymmetric verification, however, we are able to achieve substantial improvements by allocating only a modest amount of compute to the verifier. We conduct experiments with flagship open-source models and extend them to their ``Heavy'' variants through TTS. These deep research agents achieve gains of up to 27 absolute points on benchmarks such as BrowseComp. Remarkably, as an open-source alternative, GLM-4.5 Heavy reaches accuracy of {\bf 54.0\%} on BrowseComp and {\bf 66.0\%} on GAIA, placing it comparable to the best proprietary choices such as OpenAI Deep Research. Tongyi-DeepResearch Heavy further achieves {\bf 69.0\%} accuracy on BrowseComp, greatly surpassing the best proprietary results.

  As algorithmic decision-makers are increasingly applied to high-stakes domains, AI alignment research has evolved from a focus on universal value alignment to context-specific approaches that account for decision-maker attributes. Prior work on Decision-Maker Alignment (DMA) has explored two primary strategies: (1) classical AI methods integrating case-based reasoning, Bayesian reasoning, and naturalistic decision-making, and (2) large language model (LLM)-based methods leveraging prompt engineering. While both approaches have shown promise in limited domains such as medical triage, their generalizability to novel contexts remains underexplored. In this work, we implement a prior classical AI model and develop an LLM-based algorithmic decision-maker evaluated using a large reasoning model (GPT-5) and a non-reasoning model (GPT-4) with weighted self-consistency under a zero-shot prompting framework, as proposed in recent literature. We evaluate both approaches on a health insurance decision-making dataset annotated for three target decision-makers with varying levels of risk tolerance (0.0, 0.5, 1.0). In the experiments reported herein, classical AI and LLM-based models achieved comparable alignment with attribute-based targets, with classical AI exhibiting slightly better alignment for a moderate risk profile.

  Route recommendation aims to provide users with optimal travel plans that satisfy diverse and complex requirements. Classical routing algorithms (e.g., shortest-path and constraint-aware search) are efficient but assume structured inputs and fixed objectives, limiting adaptability to natural-language queries. Recent LLM-based approaches enhance flexibility but struggle with spatial reasoning and the joint modeling of route-level and POI-level preferences. To address these limitations, we propose RouteLLM, a hierarchical multi-agent framework that grounds natural-language intents into constraint-aware routes. It first parses user queries into structured intents including POIs, paths, and constraints. A manager agent then coordinates specialized sub-agents: a constraint agent that resolves and formally check constraints, a POI agent that retrieves and ranks candidate POIs, and a path refinement agent that refines routes via a routing engine with preference-conditioned costs. A final verifier agent ensures constraint satisfaction and produces the final route with an interpretable rationale. This design bridges linguistic flexibility and spatial structure, enabling reasoning over route feasibility and user preferences. Experiments show that our method reliably grounds textual preferences into constraint-aware routes, improving route quality and preference satisfaction over classical methods.

  Large language models hold promise as scientific assistants, yet existing agents either rely solely on algorithm evolution or on deep research in isolation, both of which face critical limitations. Pure algorithm evolution, as in AlphaEvolve, depends only on the internal knowledge of LLMs and quickly plateaus in complex domains, while pure deep research proposes ideas without validation, resulting in unrealistic or unimplementable solutions. We present DeepEvolve, an agent that integrates deep research with algorithm evolution, uniting external knowledge retrieval, cross-file code editing, and systematic debugging under a feedback-driven iterative loop. Each iteration not only proposes new hypotheses but also refines, implements, and tests them, avoiding both shallow improvements and unproductive over-refinements. Across nine benchmarks in chemistry, mathematics, biology, materials, and patents, DeepEvolve consistently improves the initial algorithm, producing executable new algorithms with sustained gains. By bridging the gap between unguided evolution and research without grounding, DeepEvolve provides a reliable framework for advancing scientific algorithm discovery.

  Time series classification (TSC) spans diverse application scenarios, yet labeled data are often scarce, making task-specific training costly and inflexible. Recent reasoning-oriented large language models (LLMs) show promise in understanding temporal patterns, but purely zero-shot usage remains suboptimal. We propose FETA, a multi-agent framework for training-free TSC via exemplar-based in-context reasoning. FETA decomposes a multivariate series into channel-wise subproblems, retrieves a few structurally similar labeled examples for each channel, and leverages a reasoning LLM to compare the query against these exemplars, producing channel-level labels with self-assessed confidences; a confidence-weighted aggregator then fuses all channel decisions. This design eliminates the need for pretraining or fine-tuning, improves efficiency by pruning irrelevant channels and controlling input length, and enhances interpretability through exemplar grounding and confidence estimation. On nine challenging UEA datasets, FETA achieves strong accuracy under a fully training-free setting, surpassing multiple trained baselines. These results demonstrate that a multi-agent in-context reasoning framework can transform LLMs into competitive, plug-and-play TSC solvers without any parameter training.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) optimized to output truthful answers often overfit, producing brittle reasoning that fails to generalize. While persuasion-based optimization has shown promise in debate settings, it has not been systematically compared against mainstream truth-based approaches. We introduce DebateQD, a minimal Quality-Diversity (QD) evolutionary algorithm that evolves diverse debate strategies across different categories (rationality, authority, emotional appeal, etc.) through tournament-style competitions where two LLMs debate while a third judges. Unlike previously proposed methods that require a population of LLMs, our approach maintains diversity of opponents through prompt-based strategies within a single LLM architecture, making it more accessible for experiments while preserving the key benefits of population-based optimization. In contrast to prior work, we explicitly isolate the role of the optimization objective by fixing the debate protocol and swapping only the fitness function: persuasion rewards strategies that convince the judge irrespective of truth, whereas truth rewards collaborative correctness. Across three model scales (7B, 32B, 72B parameters) and multiple dataset sizes from the QuALITY benchmark, persuasion-optimized strategies achieve up to 13.94% smaller train-test generalization gaps, while matching or exceeding truth optimization's test performance. These results provide the first controlled evidence that competitive pressure to persuade, rather than seek the truth collaboratively, fosters more transferable reasoning skills, offering a promising path for improving LLM generalization.

  Constraint programming (CP) is a crucial technology for solving real-world constraint optimization problems (COPs), with the advantages of rich modeling semantics and high solving efficiency. Using large language models (LLMs) to generate formal modeling automatically for COPs is becoming a promising approach, which aims to build trustworthy neuro-symbolic AI with the help of symbolic solvers. However, CP has received less attention compared to works based on operations research (OR) models. We introduce ConstraintLLM, the first LLM specifically designed for CP modeling, which is trained on an open-source LLM with multi-instruction supervised fine-tuning. We propose the Constraint-Aware Retrieval Module (CARM) to increase the in-context learning capabilities, which is integrated in a Tree-of-Thoughts (ToT) framework with guided self-correction mechanism. Moreover, we construct and release IndusCP, the first industrial-level benchmark for CP modeling, which contains 140 challenging tasks from various domains. Our experiments demonstrate that ConstraintLLM achieves state-of-the-art solving accuracy across multiple benchmarks and outperforms the baselines by 2x on the new IndusCP benchmark.

  Industrial fault diagnosis faces the dual challenges of data scarcity and the difficulty of deploying large AI models in resource-constrained environments. This paper introduces Syn-Diag, a novel cloud-edge synergistic framework that leverages Large Language Models to overcome these limitations in few-shot fault diagnosis. Syn-Diag is built on a three-tiered mechanism: 1) Visual-Semantic Synergy, which aligns signal features with the LLM's semantic space through cross-modal pre-training; 2) Content-Aware Reasoning, which dynamically constructs contextual prompts to enhance diagnostic accuracy with limited samples; and 3) Cloud-Edge Synergy, which uses knowledge distillation to create a lightweight, efficient edge model capable of online updates via a shared decision space. Extensive experiments on six datasets covering different CWRU and SEU working conditions show that Syn-Diag significantly outperforms existing methods, especially in 1-shot and cross-condition scenarios. The edge model achieves performance comparable to the cloud version while reducing model size by 83% and latency by 50%, offering a practical, robust, and deployable paradigm for modern intelligent diagnostics.

  Recently, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly being investigated to collect sensory data in post-disaster monitoring scenarios, such as tsunamis, where early actions are critical to limit coastal damage. A major challenge is to design the data collection schedules and flight velocities, as unfavorable schedules and velocities can lead to transmission errors and buffer overflows of the ground sensors, ultimately resulting in significant packet loss. Meanwhile, online Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) solutions have a complex training process and a mismatch between simulation and reality that does not meet the urgent requirements of tsunami monitoring. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a compelling alternative. With their strong reasoning and generalization capabilities, LLMs can adapt to new tasks through In-Context Learning (ICL), which enables task adaptation through natural language prompts and example-based guidance without retraining. However, LLM models have input data limitations and thus require customized approaches. In this paper, a joint optimization of data collection schedules and velocities control for multiple UAVs is proposed to minimize data loss. The battery level of the ground sensors, the length of the queues, and the channel conditions, as well as the trajectories of the UAVs, are taken into account. Attention-Based In-Context Learning for Velocity Control and Data Collection Schedule (AIC-VDS) is proposed as an alternative to DRL in emergencies. The simulation results show that the proposed AIC-VDS outperforms both the Deep-Q-Network (DQN) and maximum channel gain baselines.

  Objectives: To evaluate GPT-4o's ability to extract diagnostic labels (with uncertainty) from free-text radiology reports and to test how these labels affect multi-label image classification of musculoskeletal radiographs. Methods: This retrospective study included radiography series of the clavicle (n=1,170), elbow (n=3,755), and thumb (n=1,978). After anonymization, GPT-4o filled out structured templates by indicating imaging findings as present ("true"), absent ("false"), or "uncertain." To assess the impact of label uncertainty, "uncertain" labels of the training and validation sets were automatically reassigned to "true" (inclusive) or "false" (exclusive). Label-image-pairs were used for multi-label classification using ResNet50. Label extraction accuracy was manually verified on internal (clavicle: n=233, elbow: n=745, thumb: n=393) and external test sets (n=300 for each). Performance was assessed using macro-averaged receiver operating characteristic (ROC) area under the curve (AUC), precision recall curves, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy. AUCs were compared with the DeLong test. Results: Automatic extraction was correct in 98.6% (60,618 of 61,488) of labels in the test sets. Across anatomic regions, label-based model training yielded competitive performance measured by macro-averaged AUC values for inclusive (e.g., elbow: AUC=0.80 [range, 0.62-0.87]) and exclusive models (elbow: AUC=0.80 [range, 0.61-0.88]). Models generalized well on external datasets (elbow [inclusive]: AUC=0.79 [range, 0.61-0.87]; elbow [exclusive]: AUC=0.79 [range, 0.63-0.89]). No significant differences were observed across labeling strategies or datasets (p>=0.15). Conclusion: GPT-4o extracted labels from radiologic reports to train competitive multi-label classification models with high accuracy. Detected uncertainty in the radiologic reports did not influence the performance of these models.

  Self-evolving agentic artificial intelligence (AI) offers a new paradigm for future wireless systems by enabling autonomous agents to continually adapt and improve without human intervention. Unlike static AI models, self-evolving agents embed an autonomous evolution cycle that updates models, tools, and workflows in response to environmental dynamics. This paper presents a comprehensive overview of self-evolving agentic AI, highlighting its layered architecture, life cycle, and key techniques, including tool intelligence, workflow optimization, self-reflection, and evolutionary learning. We further propose a multi-agent cooperative self-evolving agentic AI framework, where multiple large language models (LLMs) are assigned role-specialized prompts under the coordination of a supervisor agent. Through structured dialogue, iterative feedback, and systematic validation, the system autonomously executes the entire life cycle without human intervention. A case study on antenna evolution in low-altitude wireless networks (LAWNs) demonstrates how the framework autonomously upgrades fixed antenna optimization into movable antenna optimization. Experimental results show that the proposed self-evolving agentic AI autonomously improves beam gain and restores degraded performance by up to 52.02%, consistently surpassing the fixed baseline with little to no human intervention and validating its adaptability and robustness for next-generation wireless intelligence.

  Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities across a wide range of tasks, yet it remains unclear whether such success reflects genuine reasoning or sophisticated recall. We introduce AInstein, a framework for testing whether LLMs can generate valid solutions to AI research problems using only their pretrained parametric knowledge -- without domain-specific fine-tuning, retrieval augmentation, or other external aids. Our approach extracts distilled problem statements from high-quality ICLR 2025 submissions, then tasks specialized solver agents with proposing and refining technical solutions through iterative critique loops, mimicking the cycles of proposal, review, and revision central to scientific inquiry. We evaluate AInstein on 1,214 ICLR papers stratified by acceptance tier (Oral, Spotlight, Poster), using an LLM-as-a-judge paradigm guided by a structured rubric, complemented by targeted manual checks. Performance is assessed with three metrics: Success Rate (does the solution address the problem?), Rediscovery (does it align with human-proposed methods?), and Novelty (does it yield valid, original approaches?). Our results reveal that while LLMs can rediscover feasible solutions and occasionally propose creative alternatives, their problem-solving ability remains fragile and highly sensitive to framing. These findings provide the first large-scale evidence on the extent to which LLMs can act as autonomous scientific problem-solvers, highlighting both their latent potential and their current limitations.

  We present M-Reason, a demonstration system for transparent, agent-based reasoning and evidence integration in the biomedical domain, with a focus on cancer research. M-Reason leverages recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and modular agent orchestration to automate evidence retrieval, appraisal, and synthesis across diverse biomedical data sources. Each agent specializes in a specific evidence stream, enabling parallel processing and fine-grained analysis. The system emphasizes explainability, structured reporting, and user auditability, providing complete traceability from source evidence to final conclusions. We discuss critical tradeoffs between agent specialization, system complexity, and resource usage, as well as the integration of deterministic code for validation. An open, interactive user interface allows researchers to directly observe, explore and evaluate the multi-agent workflow. Our evaluation demonstrates substantial gains in efficiency and output consistency, highlighting M-Reason's potential as both a practical tool for evidence synthesis and a testbed for robust multi-agent LLM systems in scientific research, available atthis https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance on single-turn text-to-SQL tasks, but real-world database applications predominantly require multi-turn interactions to handle ambiguous queries, execution errors, and evolving user requirements. Existing multi-turn benchmarks fall short by treating conversation histories as static context or limiting evaluation to read-only operations, failing to reflect production-grade database assistant challenges. We introduce BIRD-INTERACT, a benchmark that restores this realism through: (1) a comprehensive interaction environment coupling each database with a hierarchical knowledge base, metadata files, and a function-driven user simulator, enabling models to solicit clarifications, retrieve knowledge, and recover from errors without human supervision; (2) two evaluation settings consisting of a pre-defined conversational protocol (c-Interact) and an open-ended agentic setting (a-Interact) where models autonomously decide when to query the user simulator or explore the environment; (3) a challenging task suite covering the full CRUD spectrum for business-intelligence and operational use cases, guarded by executable test cases. Each task features ambiguous and follow-up sub-tasks requiring dynamic interaction. The suite comprises BIRD-INTERACT-FULL (600 tasks, up to 11,796 interactions) for comprehensive performance assessment, and BIRD-INTERACT-LITE (300 tasks with simplified databases) for detailed behavioral analysis and rapid method development. Our empirical results highlight BIRD-INTERACT's difficulty: GPT-5 completes only 8.67% of tasks in c-Interact and 17.00% in a-Interact. Analysis via memory grafting and Interaction Test-time Scaling validates the importance of effective interaction for complex, dynamic text-to-SQL tasks.

  Timely and accurate analysis of population-level data is crucial for effective decision-making during public health emergencies such as the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the massive input of semi-structured data, including structured demographic information and unstructured human feedback, poses significant challenges to conventional analysis methods. Manual expert-driven assessments, though accurate, are inefficient, while standard NLP pipelines often require large task-specific labeled datasets and struggle with generalization across diverse domains. To address these challenges, we propose a novel graph-based reasoning framework that integrates large language models with structured demographic attributes and unstructured public feedback in a weakly supervised pipeline. The proposed approach dynamically models evolving citizen needs into a need-aware graph, enabling population-specific analyses based on key features such as age, gender, and the Index of Multiple Deprivation. It generates interpretable insights to inform responsive health policy decision-making. We test our method using a real-world dataset, and preliminary experimental results demonstrate its feasibility. This approach offers a scalable solution for intelligent population health monitoring in resource-constrained clinical and governmental settings.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Although LLMs have been widely adopted for creative content generation, a single-pass process often struggles to produce high-quality long narratives. How to effectively revise and improve long narrative scripts like scriptwriters remains a significant challenge, as it demands a comprehensive understanding of the entire context to identify global structural issues and local detailed flaws, as well as coordinating revisions at multiple granularities and locations. Direct modifications by LLMs typically introduce inconsistencies between local edits and the overall narrative requirements. To address these issues, we propose Dramaturge, a task and feature oriented divide-and-conquer approach powered by hierarchical multiple LLM agents. It consists of a Global Review stage to grasp the overall storyline and structural issues, a Scene-level Review stage to pinpoint detailed scene and sentence flaws, and a Hierarchical Coordinated Revision stage that coordinates and integrates structural and detailed improvements throughout the script. The top-down task flow ensures that high-level strategies guide local modifications, maintaining contextual consistency. The review and revision workflow follows a coarse-to-fine iterative process, continuing through multiple rounds until no further substantive improvements can be made. Comprehensive experiments show that Dramaturge significantly outperforms all baselines in terms of script-level overall quality and scene-level details. Our approach is plug-and-play and can be easily integrated into existing methods to improve the generated scripts.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) face significant challenges when processing complex rule systems, as they typically treat interdependent rules as unstructured textual data rather than as logically organized frameworks. This limitation results in reasoning divergence, where models often overlook critical rule dependencies essential for accurate interpretation. Although existing approaches such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning have shown promise, they lack systematic methodologies for structured rule processing and are particularly susceptible to error propagation through sequential reasoning chains. To address these limitations, we propose the Dynamic Adjudication Template (DAT), a novel framework inspired by expert human reasoning processes. DAT structures the inference mechanism into three methodical stages: qualitative analysis, evidence gathering, and adjudication. During the qualitative analysis phase, the model comprehensively evaluates the contextual landscape. The subsequent evidence gathering phase involves the targeted extraction of pertinent information based on predefined template elements ([placeholder]), followed by systematic verification against applicable rules. Finally, in the adjudication phase, the model synthesizes these validated components to formulate a comprehensive judgment. Empirical results demonstrate that DAT consistently outperforms conventional CoT approaches in complex rule-based tasks. Notably, DAT enables smaller language models to match, and in some cases exceed, the performance of significantly larger LLMs, highlighting its efficiency and effectiveness in managing intricate rule systems.

  Large language models have advanced natural language understanding and generation, yet their use as autonomous agents raises architectural challenges for multi-step tasks. Existing frameworks often intertwine inference, memory, and control in a single prompt, which can reduce coherence and predictability. The Structured Cognitive Loop (SCL) is introduced as an alternative architecture that separates these functions. In SCL, the language model is dedicated to inference, memory is maintained externally, and execution is guided by a lightweight controller within a goal-directed loop. This design offloads cognitive load from the model and allows intermediate results to be stored, revisited, and checked before actions are taken, providing a clearer basis for traceability and evaluation.We evaluate SCL against prompt-based baselines including ReAct and common LangChain agents across three scenarios: temperature-based travel planning, email drafting with conditional send, and constraint-guided image generation. All systems share the same base model and tools under matched decoding settings. Across 360 episodes, SCL shows modest but consistent improvements. Task success averages 86.3 percent compared with 70-77 percent for baselines. Goal fidelity is higher, redundant calls are fewer, intermediate states are reused more reliably, and unsupported assertions per 100 tool calls are reduced. Ablations show that external memory and control each contribute independently, and decoding sweeps confirm stability of the effects.These results suggest that architectural separation can improve reliability and traceability without relying on larger models or heavier prompts. The findings are preliminary and intended to guide extended studies with additional models, longer horizons, multimodal tasks, and collaborative settings.

  The design of safety-critical agents based on large language models (LLMs) requires more than simple prompt engineering. This paper presents a comprehensive information-theoretic analysis of how rule encodings in system prompts influence attention mechanisms and compliance behaviour. We demonstrate that rule formats with low syntactic entropy and highly concentrated anchors reduce attention entropy and improve pointer fidelity, but reveal a fundamental trade-off between anchor redundancy and attention entropy that previous work failed to recognize. Through formal analysis of multiple attention architectures including causal, bidirectional, local sparse, kernelized, and cross-attention mechanisms, we establish bounds on pointer fidelity and show how anchor placement strategies must account for competing fidelity and entropy objectives. Combining these insights with a dynamic rule verification architecture, we provide a formal proof that hot reloading of verified rule sets increases the asymptotic probability of compliant outputs. These findings underscore the necessity of principled anchor design and dual enforcement mechanisms to protect LLM-based agents against prompt injection attacks while maintaining compliance in evolving domains.

  Cognitive diagnostics in the Web-based Intelligent Education System (WIES) aims to assess students' mastery of knowledge concepts from heterogeneous, noisy interactions. Recent work has tried to utilize Large Language Models (LLMs) for cognitive diagnosis, yet LLMs struggle with structured data and are prone to noise-induced misjudgments. Specially, WIES's open environment continuously attracts new students and produces vast amounts of response logs, exacerbating the data imbalance and noise issues inherent in traditional educational systems. To address these challenges, we propose DLLM, a Diffusion-based LLM framework for noise-robust cognitive diagnosis. DLLM first constructs independent subgraphs based on response correctness, then applies relation augmentation alignment module to mitigate data imbalance. The two subgraph representations are then fused and aligned with LLM-derived, semantically augmented representations. Importantly, before each alignment step, DLLM employs a two-stage denoising diffusion module to eliminate intrinsic noise while assisting structural representation alignment. Specifically, unconditional denoising diffusion first removes erroneous information, followed by conditional denoising diffusion based on graph-guided to eliminate misleading information. Finally, the noise-robust representation that integrates semantic knowledge and structural information is fed into existing cognitive diagnosis models for prediction. Experimental results on three publicly available web-based educational platform datasets demonstrate that our DLLM achieves optimal predictive performance across varying noise levels, which demonstrates that DLLM achieves noise robustness while effectively leveraging semantic knowledge from LLM.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Prompt engineering is crucial for fully leveraging large language models (LLMs), yet most existing optimization methods follow a single trajectory, resulting in limited adaptability, gradient conflicts, and high computational overhead. We propose MAPGD (Multi-Agent Prompt Gradient Descent), a novel framework that reconceptualizes prompt optimization as a collaborative process among specialized agents. Each agent focuses on a distinct refinement dimension, such as instruction clarity, example selection, format structure, or stylistic adaptation, and their contributions are coordinated through semantic gradient embedding, conflict detection, and fusion. To further enhance robustness and stability, MAPGD introduces two new mechanisms: Hypersphere Constrained Gradient Clustering (HCGC), which enforces angular margin constraints for compact and well-separated clusters, and Channel Adaptive Agent Weighting (CAAW), which dynamically reweights agent contributions based on validation performance. Experiments on classification and reasoning benchmarks show that MAPGD consistently surpasses single-agent and random baselines in both accuracy and efficiency. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of gradient fusion, agent specialization, and conflict resolution. Together, these components establish MAPGD as a unified, gradient-based, and interpretable framework for robust prompt optimization with theoretical convergence guarantees.

  Moral competence is the ability to act in accordance with moral principles. As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in situations demanding moral competence, there is increasing interest in evaluating this ability empirically. We review existing literature and identify three significant shortcoming: (i) Over-reliance on prepackaged moral scenarios with explicitly highlighted moral features; (ii) Focus on verdict prediction rather than moral reasoning; and (iii) Inadequate testing of models' (in)ability to recognize when additional information is needed. Grounded in philosophical research on moral skill, we then introduce a novel method for assessing moral competence in LLMs. Our approach moves beyond simple verdict comparisons to evaluate five dimensions of moral competence: identifying morally relevant features, weighting their importance, assigning moral reasons to these features, synthesizing coherent moral judgments, and recognizing information gaps. We conduct two experiments comparing six leading LLMs against non-expert humans and professional philosophers. In our first experiment using ethical vignettes standard to existing work, LLMs generally outperformed non-expert humans across multiple dimensions of moral reasoning. However, our second experiment, featuring novel scenarios designed to test moral sensitivity by embedding relevant features among irrelevant details, revealed a striking reversal: several LLMs performed significantly worse than humans. Our findings suggest that current evaluations may substantially overestimate LLMs' moral reasoning capabilities by eliminating the task of discerning moral relevance from noisy information, which we take to be a prerequisite for genuine moral skill. This work provides a more nuanced framework for assessing AI moral competence and highlights important directions for improving moral competence in advanced AI systems.

  Federated instruction tuning of large language models (LLMs) is challenged by significant data heterogeneity across clients, demanding robust personalization. The Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture, where experts can specialize in distinct data patterns, presents a natural architectural solution to this challenge. The inherent sparsity of the MoE architecture, achieved by selectively activating experts, poses a significant challenge to its integration with federated learning (FL). Conventional FL frameworks, designed for dense models, naively aggregate all expert parameters irrespective of their local activation patterns. This naive approach not only undermines MoE's dynamic sparsity but also risks corrupting the world knowledge within pretrained experts. To address this, we propose FLEx (Federated LLMs with Personalized Experts), a novel framework that leverages pretrained MoE-based LLMs for efficient personalization. By aggregating only the shared non-expert parameters, FLEx significantly reduces communication overhead and preserves the world knowledge stored within the frozen pretrained experts. For personalization, we introduce a novel expert grafting mechanism that leverages dynamic sparsity to construct a client-specific expert from selected components of pretrained experts, tailored to local data. This grafted expert is then fine-tuned locally alongside the gating mechanism. This joint training enables the model to learn when to leverage the shared knowledge from frozen experts and when to employ the personalized one. Evaluations on diverse, non-IID instruction tuning datasets show that FLEx consistently outperforms federated baselines on average, while demonstrating strong knowledge preservation on the knowledge-driven benchmark MMLU.
