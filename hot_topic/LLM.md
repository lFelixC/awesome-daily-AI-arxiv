- **[Aegis: Automated Error Generation and Identification for Multi-Agent Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14295)**  `arXiv:2509.14295`  `cs.RO` `cs.MA`

  As Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) become increasingly autonomous and complex, understanding their error modes is critical for ensuring their reliability and safety. However, research in this area has been severely hampered by the lack of large-scale, diverse datasets with precise, ground-truth error labels. To address this bottleneck, we introduce \textbf{AEGIS}, a novel framework for \textbf{A}utomated \textbf{E}rror \textbf{G}eneration and \textbf{I}dentification for Multi-Agent \textbf{S}ystems. By systematically injecting controllable and traceable errors into initially successful trajectories, we create a rich dataset of realistic failures. This is achieved using a context-aware, LLM-based adaptive manipulator that performs sophisticated attacks like prompt injection and response corruption to induce specific, predefined error modes. We demonstrate the value of our dataset by exploring three distinct learning paradigms for the error identification task: Supervised Fine-Tuning, Reinforcement Learning, and Contrastive Learning. Our comprehensive experiments show that models trained on AEGIS data achieve substantial improvements across all three learning paradigms. Notably, several of our fine-tuned models demonstrate performance competitive with or superior to proprietary systems an order of magnitude larger, validating our automated data generation framework as a crucial resource for developing more robust and interpretable multi-agent systems.

- **[SLAM-Free Visual Navigation with Hierarchical Vision-Language Perception and Coarse-to-Fine Semantic Topological Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20739)**  `arXiv:2509.20739`  `cs.RO` `cs.CV`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Conventional SLAM pipelines for legged robot navigation are fragile under rapid motion, calibration demands, and sensor drift, while offering limited semantic reasoning for task-driven exploration. To deal with these issues, we propose a vision-only, SLAM-free navigation framework that replaces dense geometry with semantic reasoning and lightweight topological representations. A hierarchical vision-language perception module fuses scene-level context with object-level cues for robust semantic inference. And a semantic-probabilistic topological map supports coarse-to-fine planning: LLM-based global reasoning for subgoal selection and vision-based local planning for obstacle avoidance. Integrated with reinforcement-learning locomotion controllers, the framework is deployable across diverse legged robot platforms. Experiments in simulation and real-world settings demonstrate consistent improvements in semantic accuracy, planning quality, and navigation success, while ablation studies further showcase the necessity of both hierarchical perception and fine local planning. This work introduces a new paradigm for SLAM-free, vision-language-driven navigation, shifting robotic exploration from geometry-centric mapping to semantics-driven decision making.

- **[Boosting Zero-Shot VLN via Abstract Obstacle Map-Based Waypoint Prediction with TopoGraph-and-VisitInfo-Aware Prompting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20499)**  `arXiv:2509.20499`  `cs.RO` `cs.AI`  
  _Boqi Li, Siyuan Li, Weiyi Wang, Anran Li, Zhong Cao, Henry X. Liu_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  With the rapid progress of foundation models and robotics, vision-language navigation (VLN) has emerged as a key task for embodied agents with broad practical applications. We address VLN in continuous environments, a particularly challenging setting where an agent must jointly interpret natural language instructions, perceive its surroundings, and plan low-level actions. We propose a zero-shot framework that integrates a simplified yet effective waypoint predictor with a multimodal large language model (MLLM). The predictor operates on an abstract obstacle map, producing linearly reachable waypoints, which are incorporated into a dynamically updated topological graph with explicit visitation records. The graph and visitation information are encoded into the prompt, enabling reasoning over both spatial structure and exploration history to encourage exploration and equip MLLM with local path planning for error correction. Extensive experiments on R2R-CE and RxR-CE show that our method achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance, with success rates of 41% and 36%, respectively, outperforming prior state-of-the-art methods.

- **[\LARGE GMP$^{3}$: Learning-Driven, Bellman-Guided Trajectory Planning for UAVs in Real-Time on SE(3)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21264)**  `arXiv:2509.21264`  `cs.RO`  
  _Babak Salamat, Dominik Mattern, Sebastian-Sven Olzem, Gerhard Elsbacher, Christian Seidel, Andrea M. Tonello_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We propose $\text{GMP}^{3}$, a multiphase global path planning framework that generates dynamically feasible three-dimensional trajectories for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) operating in cluttered environments. The framework extends traditional path planning from Euclidean position spaces to the Lie group $\mathrm{SE}(3)$, allowing joint learning of translational motion and rotational dynamics. A modified Bellman-based operator is introduced to support reinforcement learning (RL) policy updates while leveraging prior trajectory information for improved convergence. $\text{GMP}^{3}$ is designed as a distributed framework in which agents influence each other and share policy information along the trajectory: each agent refines its assigned segment and shares with its neighbors via a consensus-based scheme, enabling cooperative policy updates and convergence toward a path shaped globally even under kinematic constraints. We also propose DroneManager, a modular ground control software that interfaces the planner with real UAV platforms via the MAVLink protocol, supporting real-time deployment and feedback. Simulation studies and indoor flight experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed method in constrained 3D environments, demonstrating reliable obstacle avoidance and smooth, feasible trajectories across both position and orientation. The open-source implementation is available atthis https URL

- **[Digital Twin-Guided Robot Path Planning: A Beta-Bernoulli Fusion with Large Language Model as a Sensor](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20709)**  `arXiv:2509.20709`  `cs.RO`  
  _Mani Amani, Reza Akhavian_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Integrating natural language (NL) prompts into robotic mission planning has attracted significant interest in recent years. In the construction domain, Building Information Models (BIM) encapsulate rich NL descriptions of the environment. We present a novel framework that fuses NL directives with BIM-derived semantic maps via a Beta-Bernoulli Bayesian fusion by interpreting the LLM as a sensor: each obstacle's design-time repulsive coefficient is treated as a Beta(alpha, beta) random variable and LLM-returned danger scores are incorporated as pseudo-counts to update alpha and beta. The resulting posterior mean yields a continuous, context-aware repulsive gain that augments a Euclidean-distance-based potential field for cost heuristics. By adjusting gains based on sentiment and context inferred from user prompts, our method guides robots along safer, more context-aware paths. This provides a numerically stable method that can chain multiple natural commands and prompts from construction workers and foreman to enable planning while giving flexibility to be integrated in any learned or classical AI framework. Simulation results demonstrate that this Beta-Bernoulli fusion yields both qualitative and quantitative improvements in path robustness and validity.

- **[Building Information Models to Robot-Ready Site Digital Twins (BIM2RDT): An Agentic AI Safety-First Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20705)**  `arXiv:2509.20705`  `cs.RO`  
  _Reza Akhavian, Mani Amani, Johannes Mootz, Robert Ashe, Behrad Beheshti_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The adoption of cyber-physical systems and jobsite intelligence that connects design models, real-time site sensing, and autonomous field operations can dramatically enhance digital management in the construction industry. This paper introduces BIM2RDT (Building Information Models to Robot-Ready Site Digital Twins), an agentic artificial intelligence (AI) framework designed to transform static Building Information Modeling (BIM) into dynamic, robot-ready digital twins (DTs) that prioritize safety during execution. The framework bridges the gap between pre-existing BIM data and real-time site conditions by integrating three key data streams: geometric and semantic information from BIM models, activity data from IoT sensor networks, and visual-spatial data collected by robots during site traversal. The methodology introduces Semantic-Gravity ICP (SG-ICP), a point cloud registration algorithm that leverages large language model (LLM) reasoning. Unlike traditional methods, SG-ICP utilizes an LLM to infer object-specific, plausible orientation priors based on BIM semantics, improving alignment accuracy by avoiding convergence on local minima. This creates a feedback loop where robot-collected data updates the DT, which in turn optimizes paths for missions. The framework employs YOLOE object detection and Shi-Tomasi corner detection to identify and track construction elements while using BIM geometry as a priori maps. The framework also integrates real-time Hand-Arm Vibration (HAV) monitoring, mapping sensor-detected safety events to the digital twin using IFC standards for intervention. Experiments demonstrate SG-ICP's superiority over standard ICP, achieving RMSE reductions of 64.3%--88.3% in alignment across scenarios with occluded features, ensuring plausible orientations. HAV integration triggers warnings upon exceeding exposure limits, enhancing compliance with ISO 5349-1.

- **[Latent Activation Editing: Inference-Time Refinement of Learned Policies for Safer Multirobot Navigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20623)**  `arXiv:2509.20623`  `cs.RO`  
  _Satyajeet Das, Darren Chiu, Zhehui Huang, Lars Lindemann, Gaurav S. Sukhatme_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reinforcement learning has enabled significant progress in complex domains such as coordinating and navigating multiple quadrotors. However, even well-trained policies remain vulnerable to collisions in obstacle-rich environments. Addressing these infrequent but critical safety failures through retraining or fine-tuning is costly and risks degrading previously learned skills. Inspired by activation steering in large language models and latent editing in computer vision, we introduce a framework for inference-time Latent Activation Editing (LAE) that refines the behavior of pre-trained policies without modifying their weights or architecture. The framework operates in two stages: (i) an online classifier monitors intermediate activations to detect states associated with undesired behaviors, and (ii) an activation editing module that selectively modifies flagged activations to shift the policy towards safer regimes. In this work, we focus on improving safety in multi-quadrotor navigation. We hypothesize that amplifying a policy's internal perception of risk can induce safer behaviors. We instantiate this idea through a latent collision world model trained to predict future pre-collision activations, thereby prompting earlier and more cautious avoidance responses. Extensive simulations and real-world Crazyflie experiments demonstrate that LAE achieves statistically significant reduction in collisions (nearly 90% fewer cumulative collisions compared to the unedited baseline) and substantially increases the fraction of collision-free trajectories, while preserving task completion. More broadly, our results establish LAE as a lightweight paradigm, feasible on resource-constrained hardware, for post-deployment refinement of learned robot policies.

- **[Growing with Your Embodied Agent: A Human-in-the-Loop Lifelong Code Generation Framework for Long-Horizon Manipulation Skills](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18597)**  `arXiv:2509.18597`  `cs.RO`  
  _Yuan Meng, Zhenguo Sun, Max Fest, Xukun Li, Zhenshan Bing, Alois Knoll_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs)-based code generation for robotic manipulation has recently shown promise by directly translating human instructions into executable code, but existing methods remain noisy, constrained by fixed primitives and limited context windows, and struggle with long-horizon tasks. While closed-loop feedback has been explored, corrected knowledge is often stored in improper formats, restricting generalization and causing catastrophic forgetting, which highlights the need for learning reusable skills. Moreover, approaches that rely solely on LLM guidance frequently fail in extremely long-horizon scenarios due to LLMs' limited reasoning capability in the robotic domain, where such issues are often straightforward for humans to identify. To address these challenges, we propose a human-in-the-loop framework that encodes corrections into reusable skills, supported by external memory and Retrieval-Augmented Generation with a hint mechanism for dynamic reuse. Experiments on Ravens, Franka Kitchen, and MetaWorld, as well as real-world settings, show that our framework achieves a 0.93 success rate (up to 27% higher than baselines) and a 42% efficiency improvement in correction rounds. It can robustly solve extremely long-horizon tasks such as "build a house", which requires planning over 20 primitives.

- **[V2V-GoT: Vehicle-to-Vehicle Cooperative Autonomous Driving with Multimodal Large Language Models and Graph-of-Thoughts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18053)**  `arXiv:2509.18053`  `cs.RO`  
  _Hsu-kuang Chiu, Ryo Hachiuma, Chien-Yi Wang, Yu-Chiang Frank Wang, Min-Hung Chen, Stephen F. Smith_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Current state-of-the-art autonomous vehicles could face safety-critical situations when their local sensors are occluded by large nearby objects on the road. Vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) cooperative autonomous driving has been proposed as a means of addressing this problem, and one recently introduced framework for cooperative autonomous driving has further adopted an approach that incorporates a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) to integrate cooperative perception and planning processes. However, despite the potential benefit of applying graph-of-thoughts reasoning to the MLLM, this idea has not been considered by previous cooperative autonomous driving research. In this paper, we propose a novel graph-of-thoughts framework specifically designed for MLLM-based cooperative autonomous driving. Our graph-of-thoughts includes our proposed novel ideas of occlusion-aware perception and planning-aware prediction. We curate the V2V-GoT-QA dataset and develop the V2V-GoT model for training and testing the cooperative driving graph-of-thoughts. Our experimental results show that our method outperforms other baselines in cooperative perception, prediction, and planning tasks. Our project website:this https URL.

- **[Stairway to Success: An Online Floor-Aware Zero-Shot Object-Goal Navigation Framework via LLM-Driven Coarse-to-Fine Exploration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23019)**  `arXiv:2505.23019`  `cs.RO`  
  _Zeying Gong, Rong Li, Tianshuai Hu, Ronghe Qiu, Lingdong Kong, Lingfeng Zhang, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Deployable service and delivery robots struggle to navigate multi-floor buildings to reach object goals, as existing systems fail due to single-floor assumptions and requirements for offline, globally consistent maps. Multi-floor environments pose unique challenges including cross-floor transitions and vertical spatial reasoning, especially navigating unknown buildings. Object-Goal Navigation benchmarks like HM3D and MP3D also capture this multi-floor reality, yet current methods lack support for online, floor-aware navigation. To bridge this gap, we propose \textbf{\textit{ASCENT}}, an online framework for Zero-Shot Object-Goal Navigation that enables robots to operate without pre-built maps or retraining on new object categories. It introduces: (1) a \textbf{Multi-Floor Abstraction} module that dynamically constructs hierarchical representations with stair-aware obstacle mapping and cross-floor topology modeling, and (2) a \textbf{Coarse-to-Fine Reasoning} module that combines frontier ranking with LLM-driven contextual analysis for multi-floor navigation decisions. We evaluate on HM3D and MP3D benchmarks, outperforming state-of-the-art zero-shot approaches, and demonstrate real-world deployment on a quadruped robot.

- **[Structuring Collective Action with LLM-Guided Evolution: From Ill-Structured Problems to Executable Heuristics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20412)**  `arXiv:2509.20412`  `cs.MA` `cs.LG`  
  _Kevin Bradley Dsouza, Graham Alexander Watt, Yuri Leonenko, Juan Moreno-Cruz_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Collective action problems, which require aligning individual incentives with collective goals, are classic examples of Ill-Structured Problems (ISPs). For an individual agent, the causal links between local actions and global outcomes are unclear, stakeholder objectives often conflict, and no single, clear algorithm can bridge micro-level choices with macro-level welfare. We present ECHO-MIMIC, a computational framework that converts this global complexity into a tractable, Well-Structured Problem (WSP) for each agent by discovering compact, executable heuristics and persuasive rationales. The framework operates in two stages: ECHO (Evolutionary Crafting of Heuristics from Outcomes) evolves snippets of Python code that encode candidate behavioral policies, while MIMIC (Mechanism Inference & Messaging for Individual-to-Collective Alignment) evolves companion natural language messages that motivate agents to adopt those policies. Both phases employ a large-language-model-driven evolutionary search: the LLM proposes diverse and context-aware code or text variants, while population-level selection retains those that maximize collective performance in a simulated environment. We demonstrate this framework on a canonical ISP in agricultural landscape management, where local farming decisions impact global ecological connectivity. Results show that ECHO-MIMIC discovers high-performing heuristics compared to baselines and crafts tailored messages that successfully align simulated farmer behavior with landscape-level ecological goals. By coupling algorithmic rule discovery with tailored communication, ECHO-MIMIC transforms the cognitive burden of collective action into a simple set of agent-level instructions, making previously ill-structured problems solvable in practice and opening a new path toward scalable, adaptive policy design.

- **[Beyond Visual Similarity: Rule-Guided Multimodal Clustering with explicit domain rules](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20501)**  `arXiv:2509.20501`  `cs.LG` `cs.CV`  
  _Kishor Datta Gupta, Mohd Ariful Haque, Marufa Kamal, Ahmed Rafi Hasan, Md. Mahfuzur Rahman, Roy George_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Traditional clustering techniques often rely solely on similarity in the input data, limiting their ability to capture structural or semantic constraints that are critical in many domains. We introduce the Domain Aware Rule Triggered Variational Autoencoder (DARTVAE), a rule guided multimodal clustering framework that incorporates domain specific constraints directly into the representation learning process. DARTVAE extends the VAE architecture by embedding explicit rules, semantic representations, and data driven features into a unified latent space, while enforcing constraint compliance through rule consistency and violation penalties in the loss function. Unlike conventional clustering methods that rely only on visual similarity or apply rules as post hoc filters, DARTVAE treats rules as first class learning signals. The rules are generated by LLMs, structured into knowledge graphs, and enforced through a loss function combining reconstruction, KL divergence, consistency, and violation penalties. Experiments on aircraft and automotive datasets demonstrate that rule guided clustering produces more operationally meaningful and interpretable clusters for example, isolating UAVs, unifying stealth aircraft, or separating SUVs from sedans while improving traditional clustering metrics. However, the framework faces challenges: LLM generated rules may hallucinate or conflict, excessive rules risk overfitting, and scaling to complex domains increases computational and consistency difficulties. By combining rule encodings with learned representations, DARTVAE achieves more meaningful and consistent clustering outcomes than purely data driven models, highlighting the utility of constraint guided multimodal clustering for complex, knowledge intensive settings.

- **[DELTA-Code: How Does RL Unlock and Transfer New Programming Algorithms in LLMs?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21016)**  `arXiv:2509.21016`  `cs.LG` `cs.CL`  
  _Yiyou Sun, Yuhan Cao, Pohao Huang, Haoyue Bai, Hannaneh Hajishirzi, Nouha Dziri, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  It remains an open question whether LLMs can acquire or generalize genuinely new reasoning strategies, beyond the sharpened skills encoded in their parameters during pre-training or post-training. To attempt to answer this debate, we introduce DELTA-Code--Distributional Evaluation of Learnability and Transferrability in Algorithmic Coding, a controlled benchmark of synthetic coding problem families designed to probe two fundamental aspects: learnability -- can LLMs, through reinforcement learning (RL), solve problem families where pretrained models exhibit failure with large enough attempts (pass@K=0)? --and transferrability -- if learnability happens, can such skills transfer systematically to out-of-distribution (OOD) test sets? Unlike prior public coding datasets, DELTA isolates reasoning skills through templated problem generators and introduces fully OOD problem families that demand novel strategies rather than tool invocation or memorized patterns. Our experiments reveal a striking grokking phase transition: after an extended period with near-zero reward, RL-trained models abruptly climb to near-perfect accuracy. To enable learnability on previously unsolvable problem families, we explore key training ingredients such as staged warm-up with dense rewards, experience replay, curriculum training, and verification-in-the-loop. Beyond learnability, we use DELTA to evaluate transferability or generalization along exploratory, compositional, and transformative axes, as well as cross-family transfer. Results show solid gains within families and for recomposed skills, but persistent weaknesses in transformative cases. DELTA thus offers a clean testbed for probing the limits of RL-driven reasoning and for understanding how models can move beyond existing priors to acquire new algorithmic skills.

- **[CLUE: Conflict-guided Localization for LLM Unlearning Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20977)**  `arXiv:2509.20977`  `cs.LG` `cs.CL`  
  _Hang Chen, Jiaying Zhu, Xinyu Yang, Wenya Wang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The LLM unlearning aims to eliminate the influence of undesirable data without affecting causally unrelated information. This process typically involves using a forget set to remove target information, alongside a retain set to maintain non-target capabilities. While recent localization-based methods demonstrate promise in identifying important neurons to be unlearned, they fail to disentangle neurons responsible for forgetting undesirable knowledge or retaining essential skills, often treating them as a single entangled group. As a result, these methods apply uniform interventions, risking catastrophic over-forgetting or incomplete erasure of the target knowledge. To address this, we turn to circuit discovery, a mechanistic interpretability technique, and propose the Conflict-guided Localization for LLM Unlearning framEwork (CLUE). This framework identifies the forget and retain circuit composed of important neurons, and then the circuits are transformed into conjunctive normal forms (CNF). The assignment of each neuron in the CNF satisfiability solution reveals whether it should be forgotten or retained. We then provide targeted fine-tuning strategies for different categories of neurons. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, compared to existing localization methods, CLUE achieves superior forget efficacy and retain utility through precise neural localization.

- **[CE-GPPO: Controlling Entropy via Gradient-Preserving Clipping Policy Optimization in Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20712)**  `arXiv:2509.20712`  `cs.LG` `cs.CL`  
  _Zhenpeng Su, Leiyu Pan, Minxuan Lv, Yuntao Li, Wenping Hu, Fuzheng Zhang, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a powerful paradigm for optimizing large language models (LLMs) to handle complex reasoning tasks. A core challenge in this process lies in managing policy entropy, which reflects the balance between exploration and exploitation during training. Existing methods, such as proximal policy optimization (PPO) and its variants, discard valuable gradient signals from low-probability tokens due to the clipping mechanism. We systematically analyze the entropy dynamics and reveal that these clipped tokens play a critical yet overlooked role in regulating entropy evolution. We propose \textbf{C}ontrolling \textbf{E}ntropy via \textbf{G}radient-\textbf{P}reserving \textbf{P}olicy \textbf{O}ptimization (CE-GPPO), a novel algorithm that reintroduces gradients from clipped tokens in native PPO in a gentle and bounded manner. By controlling the magnitude of gradients from tokens outside the clipping interval, CE-GPPO is able to achieve an exploration-exploitation trade-off. We provide theoretical justification and empirical evidence showing that CE-GPPO effectively mitigates entropy instability. Extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that CE-GPPO consistently outperforms strong baselines across different model scales.

- **[Small LLMs with Expert Blocks Are Good Enough for Hyperparamter Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15561)**  `arXiv:2509.15561`  `cs.LG` `cs.CL`  
  _Om Naphade, Saksham Bansal, Parikshit Pareek_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Hyper-parameter Tuning (HPT) is a necessary step in machine learning (ML) pipelines but becomes computationally expensive and opaque with larger models. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been explored for HPT, yet most rely on models exceeding 100 billion parameters. We propose an Expert Block Framework for HPT using Small LLMs. At its core is the Trajectory Context Summarizer (TCS), a deterministic block that transforms raw training trajectories into structured context, enabling small LLMs to analyze optimization progress with reliability comparable to larger models. Using two locally-run LLMs (phi4:reasoning14B and qwen2.5-coder:32B) and a 10-trial budget, our TCS-enabled HPT pipeline achieves average performance within ~0.9 percentage points of GPT-4 across six diverse tasks.

- **[Causal Reflection with Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04495)**  `arXiv:2508.04495`  `cs.LG` `cs.CL`  
  _Abi Aryan, Zac Liu_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  While LLMs exhibit impressive fluency and factual recall, they struggle with robust causal reasoning, often relying on spurious correlations and brittle patterns. Similarly, traditional Reinforcement Learning agents also lack causal understanding, optimizing for rewards without modeling why actions lead to outcomes. We introduce Causal Reflection, a framework that explicitly models causality as a dynamic function over state, action, time, and perturbation, enabling agents to reason about delayed and nonlinear effects. Additionally, we define a formal Reflect mechanism that identifies mismatches between predicted and observed outcomes and generates causal hypotheses to revise the agent's internal model. In this architecture, LLMs serve not as black-box reasoners, but as structured inference engines translating formal causal outputs into natural language explanations and counterfactuals. Our framework lays the theoretical groundwork for Causal Reflective agents that can adapt, self-correct, and communicate causal understanding in evolving environments.

- **[CaTS-Bench: Can Language Models Describe Numeric Time Series?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20823)**  `arXiv:2509.20823`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI` `cs.CV`  
  _Luca Zhou, Pratham Yashwante, Marshall Fisher, Alessio Sampieri, Zihao Zhou, Fabio Galasso, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Time series captioning, the task of describing numeric time series in natural language, requires numerical reasoning, trend interpretation, and contextual understanding. Existing benchmarks, however, often rely on synthetic data or overly simplistic captions, and typically neglect metadata and visual representations. To close this gap, we introduce CaTS-Bench, the first large-scale, real-world benchmark for Context-aware Time Series captioning. CaTS-Bench is derived from 11 diverse datasets reframed as captioning and Q&A tasks, comprising roughly 465k training and 105k test timestamps. Each sample includes a numeric series segment, contextual metadata, a line-chart image, and a caption. A key contribution of this work is the scalable pipeline used to generate reference captions: while most references are produced by an oracle LLM and verified through factual checks, human indistinguishability studies, and diversity analyses, we also provide a human-revisited subset of 579 test captions, refined from LLM outputs to ensure accuracy and human-like style. Beyond captioning, CaTS-Bench offers 460 multiple-choice questions targeting deeper aspects of time series reasoning. We further propose new tailored evaluation metrics and benchmark leading VLMs, highlighting both their strengths and persistent limitations. Together, these contributions establish CaTS-Bench and its captioning pipeline as a reliable and extensible foundation for future research at the intersection of time series analysis and foundation models.

- **[Binary Autoencoder for Mechanistic Interpretability of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20997)**  `arXiv:2509.20997`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI` `cs.CL`  
  _Hakaze Cho, Haolin Yang, Brian M. Kurkoski, Naoya Inoue_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Existing works are dedicated to untangling atomized numerical components (features) from the hidden states of Large Language Models (LLMs) for interpreting their mechanism. However, they typically rely on autoencoders constrained by some implicit training-time regularization on single training instances (i.e., $L_1$ normalization, top-k function, etc.), without an explicit guarantee of global sparsity among instances, causing a large amount of dense (simultaneously inactive) features, harming the feature sparsity and atomization. In this paper, we propose a novel autoencoder variant that enforces minimal entropy on minibatches of hidden activations, thereby promoting feature independence and sparsity across instances. For efficient entropy calculation, we discretize the hidden activations to 1-bit via a step function and apply gradient estimation to enable backpropagation, so that we term it as Binary Autoencoder (BAE) and empirically demonstrate two major applications: (1) Feature set entropy calculation. Entropy can be reliably estimated on binary hidden activations, which we empirically evaluate and leverage to characterize the inference dynamics of LLMs and In-context Learning. (2) Feature untangling. Similar to typical methods, BAE can extract atomized features from LLM's hidden states. To robustly evaluate such feature extraction capability, we refine traditional feature-interpretation methods to avoid unreliable handling of numerical tokens, and show that BAE avoids dense features while producing the largest number of interpretable ones among baselines, which confirms the effectiveness of BAE serving as a feature extractor.

- **[StyleBench: Evaluating thinking styles in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20868)**  `arXiv:2509.20868`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI` `cs.CL`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) is heavily influenced by the reasoning strategies, or styles of thought, employed in their prompts. However, the interplay between these reasoning styles, model architecture, and task type remains poorly understood. To address this, we introduce StyleBench, a comprehensive benchmark for systematically evaluating reasoning styles across diverse tasks and models. We assess five representative reasoning styles, including Chain of Thought (CoT), Tree of Thought (ToT), Algorithm of Thought (AoT), Sketch of Thought (SoT), and Chain-of-Draft (CoD) on five reasoning tasks, using 15 open-source models from major families (LLaMA, Qwen, Mistral, Gemma, GPT-OSS, Phi, and DeepSeek) ranging from 270M to 120B parameters. Our large-scale analysis reveals that no single style is universally optimal. We demonstrate that strategy efficacy is highly contingent on both model scale and task type: search-based methods (AoT, ToT) excel in open-ended problems but require large-scale models, while concise styles (SoT, CoD) achieve radical efficiency gains on well-defined tasks. Furthermore, we identify key behavioral patterns: smaller models frequently fail to follow output instructions and default to guessing, while reasoning robustness emerges as a function of scale. Our findings offer a crucial roadmap for selecting optimal reasoning strategies based on specific constraints, we open source the benchmark inthis https URL.

  Large language models require massive memory footprints, severely limiting deployment on consumer hardware. Quantization reduces memory through lower numerical precision, but extreme 2-bit quantization suffers from catastrophic performance loss due to outliers in activations. Rotation-based methods such as QuIP and QuaRot apply orthogonal transforms to eliminate outliers before quantization, using computational invariance: $\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{Wx} = (\mathbf{WQ}^T)(\mathbf{Qx})$ for orthogonal $\mathbf{Q}$. However, these methods use fixed transforms--Hadamard matrices achieving optimal worst-case coherence $\mu = 1/\sqrt{n}$--that cannot adapt to specific weight distributions. We identify that different transformer layers exhibit distinct outlier patterns, motivating layer-adaptive rotations rather than one-size-fits-all approaches. In this work, we propose ButterflyQuant, which replaces Hadamard rotations with learnable butterfly transforms parameterized by continuous Givens rotation angles. Unlike Hadamard's discrete $\{+1, -1\}$ entries that are non-differentiable and thus prohibit gradient-based learning, butterfly transforms' continuous parameterization enables smooth optimization while guaranteeing orthogonality by construction. This orthogonal constraint ensures theoretical guarantees in outlier suppression while achieving $O(n \log n)$ computational complexity with only $\frac{n \log n}{2}$ learnable parameters. We further introduce a uniformity regularization on post-transformation activations to promote smoother distributions amenable to quantization. Learning requires only 128 calibration samples and converges in minutes on a single GPU--a negligible one-time cost. For LLaMA-2-7B with 2-bit quantization, ButterflyQuant achieves 15.4 perplexity versus 37.3 for QuIP. \href{this https URL}{Codes} are available.

  Empirical scaling laws have driven the evolution of large language models (LLMs), yet their coefficients shift whenever the model architecture or data pipeline changes. Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models, now standard in state-of-the-art systems, introduce a new sparsity dimension that current dense-model frontiers overlook. We investigate how MoE sparsity influences two distinct capability regimes: memorization skills and reasoning skills. By training MoE families that vary total parameters, active parameters, and top-$k$ routing under fixed compute budgets, we disentangle pre-training loss from downstream accuracy. Our results reveal two principles. First, Active FLOPs: models with identical training loss but greater active compute achieve higher reasoning accuracy. Second, Total tokens per parameter (TPP): memorization tasks improve with more parameters, while reasoning tasks benefit from optimal TPP, indicating that reasoning is data-hungry. Neither reinforcement learning post-training (GRPO) nor increased test-time compute alters these trends. We therefore argue that optimal MoE sparsity must be determined jointly by active FLOPs and TPP, revising the classical picture of compute-optimal scaling.

  Continual post-training (CPT) is a popular and effective technique for adapting foundation models like multimodal large language models to specific and ever-evolving downstream tasks. While existing research has primarily concentrated on methods like data replay, model expansion, or parameter regularization, the fundamental role of the learning paradigm within CPT remains largely unexplored. This paper presents a comparative analysis of two core post-training paradigms: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT), investigating their respective impacts on knowledge retention during CPT. Our experiments are conducted on a benchmark comprising seven diverse multimodal tasks, utilizing Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct as the base model for continual post-training. The investigation yields two significant findings: (1) When continuously learning on downstream tasks, SFT leads to catastrophic forgetting of previously learned tasks. In contrast, RFT inherently preserves prior knowledge and achieve performance comparable to multi-task training. (2) RFT successfully protects and even enhances the model's general knowledge on standard benchmarks (e.g., MMMU and MMLU-Pro). Conversely, SFT degrades general model capabilities severely. Further analysis reveals that this stability is not primarily due to explicit mechanisms like KL penalty or chain-of-thought reasoning. Instead, we identify an implicit regularization mechanism inherent to RFT as a key contributing factor. Our theoretical analysis suggests that RFT's gradient updates are naturally scaled by the reward variance, acting as a data-dependent regularizer that inherently protects previously acquired knowledge. Finally, we propose a rollout-based instance filtering algorithm to enhance the stability and efficiency of RFT. Our comprehensive study demonstrates the superiority of RFT as a robust paradigm for continual post-training.

  Existing post-training techniques for large language models are broadly categorized into Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT). Each paradigm presents a distinct trade-off: SFT excels at mimicking demonstration data but can lead to problematic generalization as a form of behavior cloning. Conversely, RFT can significantly enhance a model's performance but is prone to learn unexpected behaviors, and its performance is highly sensitive to the initial policy. In this paper, we propose a unified view of these methods and introduce Prefix-RFT, a hybrid approach that synergizes learning from both demonstration and exploration. Using mathematical reasoning problems as a testbed, we empirically demonstrate that Prefix-RFT is both simple and effective. It not only surpasses the performance of standalone SFT and RFT but also outperforms parallel mixed-policy RFT methods. A key advantage is its seamless integration into existing open-source frameworks, requiring only minimal modifications to the standard RFT pipeline. Our analysis highlights the complementary nature of SFT and RFT, and validates that Prefix-RFT effectively harmonizes these two learning paradigms. Furthermore, ablation studies confirm the method's robustness to variations in the quality and quantity of demonstration data. We hope this work offers a new perspective on LLM post-training, suggesting that a unified paradigm that judiciously integrates demonstration and exploration could be a promising direction for future research.

  Recent large language models (LLMs) have made great progress in the field of text-to-speech (TTS), but they still face major challenges in synthesizing fine-grained emotional speech in an interpretable manner. Traditional methods rely on discrete emotion labels to control emotion categories and intensities, which cannot capture the complexity and continuity of human emotional perception and expression. The lack of large-scale emotional speech datasets with balanced emotion distributions and fine-grained emotional annotations often causes overfitting in synthesis models and impedes effective emotion control. To address these issues, we propose UDDETTS, a universal LLM framework unifying discrete and dimensional emotions for controllable emotional TTS. This model introduces the interpretable Arousal-Dominance-Valence (ADV) space for dimensional emotion description and supports emotion control driven by either discrete emotion labels or nonlinearly quantified ADV values. Furthermore, a semi-supervised training strategy is designed to comprehensively utilize diverse speech datasets with different types of emotional annotations to train the UDDETTS. Experiments show that UDDETTS achieves linear emotion control along three interpretable dimensions, and exhibits superior end-to-end emotional speech synthesis capabilities.

  Step-by-step verifiers -- also known as process reward models (PRMs) -- are a key ingredient for test-time scaling. PRMs require step-level supervision, making them expensive to train. This work aims to build data-efficient PRMs as verbalized step-wise reward models that verify every step in the solution by generating a verification chain-of-thought (CoT). We propose ThinkPRM, a long CoT verifier fine-tuned on orders of magnitude fewer process labels than those required by discriminative PRMs. Our approach capitalizes on the inherent reasoning abilities of long CoT models, and outperforms LLM-as-a-Judge and discriminative verifiers -- using only 1% of the process labels in PRM800K -- across several challenging benchmarks. Specifically, ThinkPRM beats the baselines on ProcessBench, MATH-500, and AIME '24 under best-of-N selection and reward-guided search. In an out-of-domain evaluation on a subset of GPQA-Diamond and LiveCodeBench, our PRM surpasses discriminative verifiers trained on the full PRM800K by 8% and 4.5%, respectively. Lastly, under the same token budget, ThinkPRM scales up verification compute more effectively compared to LLM-as-a-Judge, outperforming it by 7.2% on a subset of ProcessBench. Our work highlights the value of generative, long CoT PRMs that can scale test-time compute for verification while requiring minimal supervision for training.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) reproduce social biases, yet prevailing evaluations score models in isolation, obscuring how biases persist across families and releases. We introduce Bias Similarity Measurement (BSM), which treats fairness as a relational property between models, unifying scalar, distributional, behavioral, and representational signals into a single similarity space. Evaluating 30 LLMs on 1M+ prompts, we find that instruction tuning primarily enforces abstention rather than altering internal representations; small models gain little accuracy and can become less fair under forced choice; and open-weight models can match or exceed proprietary systems. Family signatures diverge: Gemma favors refusal, LLaMA 3.1 approaches neutrality with fewer refusals, and converges toward abstention-heavy behavior overall. Counterintuitively, Gemma 3 Instruct matches GPT-4-level fairness at far lower cost, whereas Gemini's heavy abstention suppresses utility. Beyond these findings, BSM offers an auditing workflow for procurement, regression testing, and lineage screening, and extends naturally to code and multilingual settings. Our results reframe fairness not as isolated scores but as comparative bias similarity, enabling systematic auditing of LLM ecosystems. Code available atthis https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Training large language models (LLMs) with reinforcement learning (RL) methods such as PPO and GRPO commonly relies on ratio clipping to stabilise updates. While effective at preventing instability, clipping discards information and introduces gradient discontinuities. We propose Probability Smoothing Policy Optimisation (PSPO), which smooths the current policy's probabilities toward the old (behaviour) policy before computing the importance ratio, analogous to label smoothing. Unlike clipping, PSPO preserves gradient signal, while interpolation toward the old policy creates a soft trust region that discourages large, destabilising updates, with formal guarantees.We instantiate PSPO within GRPO (GR-PSPO) and fine-tune Qwen2.5-0.5B and Qwen2.5-1.5B on GSM8K, evaluating on GSM8K test and the cross-dataset generalisation on SVAMP, ASDiv, and MATH-500. Relative to unclipped GRPO (single iteration; no data reuse, ratio always = 1), GR-PSPO achieves similar performance but improves the reasoning leading to clearer and more concise responses which are more logical. Compared to clipped GRPO, GR-PSPO substantially improves performance both the 0.5B and 1.5B models, with a boost of over 20% on GSM8K (39.7% vs. 17.6% for 0.5B, 59.4% vs. 37.8% for 1.5B).

  The widespread adoption of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has enabled large language models (LLMs) to acquire domain-specific knowledge with remarkable efficiency. However, understanding how such a fine-tuning mechanism alters a model's structural reasoning and semantic behavior remains an open challenge. This work introduces a novel framework that explains fine-tuned LLMs via counterfactuals grounded in knowledge graphs. Specifically, we construct BioToolKG, a domain-specific heterogeneous knowledge graph in bioinformatics tools and design a counterfactual-based fine-tuned LLMs explainer (CFFTLLMExplainer) that learns soft masks over graph nodes and edges to generate minimal structural perturbations that induce maximum semantic divergence. Our method jointly optimizes structural sparsity and semantic divergence while enforcing interpretability preserving constraints such as entropy regularization and edge smoothness. We apply this framework to a fine-tuned LLaMA-based LLM and reveal that counterfactual masking exposes the model's structural dependencies and aligns with LoRA-induced parameter shifts. This work provides new insights into the internal mechanisms of fine-tuned LLMs and highlights counterfactual graphs as a potential tool for interpretable AI.

  Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have significantly enhanced the agentic capabilities of large language models (LLMs). In long-term and multi-turn agent tasks, existing approaches driven solely by outcome rewards often suffer from the problem of sparse supervision. To address the challenge, we propose Tree-based Group Relative Policy Optimization (Tree-GRPO), a grouped agent RL method based on tree search, where each tree node represents the complete agent interaction step. By sharing common prefixes, the tree search sampling increases the number of rollouts achievable within a fixed budget of tokens or tool calls. Moreover, we find that the tree-structured trajectory naturally allows the construction of step-wise process supervised signals even using only the outcome reward. Based on this, Tree-GRPO estimates the grouped relative advantages both on intra-tree and inter-tree levels. Through theoretical analysis, we demonstrate that the objective of intra-tree level group relative policy optimization is equivalent to that of step-level direct preference learning. Experiments across 11 datasets and 3 types of QA tasks demonstrate the superiority of the proposed tree-based RL over the chain-based RL method.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We prove theoretically that the GRPO RL algorithm induces a non-trivial process reward model (PRM), under certain assumptions regarding within-group overlap of token sequences across completions. We then show empirically that these assumptions are met under real-world conditions: GRPO does in fact induce a non-trivial PRM. Leveraging the framework of GRPO-as-a-PRM, we identify a flaw in the GRPO objective: non-uniformly distributed process steps hinder both exploration and exploitation (under different conditions). We propose a simple modification to the algorithm to mitigate this defect ($\lambda$-GRPO), and show that LLMs trained with $\lambda$-GRPO achieve higher validation accuracy and performance on downstream reasoning tasks$-$and reach peak performance more rapidly$-$than LLMs trained with standard GRPO. Our results call into question the advantage of costly, explicitly-defined PRMs for GRPO: we show that it is possible to instead leverage the hidden, built-in PRM structure within the vanilla GRPO algorithm to boost model performance with a negligible impact on training time and cost.

  Multi-Head Latent Attention (MLA) is a recent attention mechanism adopted in state-of-the-art LLMs such as DeepSeek-v3 and Kimi K2. Thanks to its novel formulation, MLA allows two functionally equivalent but computationally distinct kernel implementations: naive and absorb. While the naive kernels (e.g., FlashAttention) are typically preferred in training and prefill for their computational efficiency, existing decoding kernels (e.g., FlashMLA) rely on the absorb method to minimize HBM bandwidth usage. However, the compute-bound nature of the absorb implementations prohibits performance benefits from data reuse opportunities in attention calculations, such as shared prefixes. In this work, we introduce TyphoonMLA, a hybrid approach that combines naive and absorb formulations to harness the strengths of both. TyphoonMLA effectively leverages the shared prefix by applying the naive formulation to the compute-bound parts of attention calculations, while reducing the bandwidth requirements for non-shared parts by using the absorb formulation. As a result, TyphoonMLA improves the throughput of attention calculations in MLA architectures by up to 3x and 3.24x on NPU and GPUs, with only a 3% overhead in HBM size.

  AI-driven geometric problem solving is a complex vision-language task that requires accurate diagram interpretation, mathematical reasoning, and robust cross-modal grounding. A foundational yet underexplored capability for this task is the ability to identify and interpret geometric elements based on natural language queries. To address this, we introduce the task of Referring Expression Comprehension (REC) for geometric problems, which evaluates whether models can localize points, shapes, and spatial relations in diagrams in response to textual prompts. We present GeoRef, a benchmark dataset constructed from existing geometric problem corpora, featuring diverse, high-quality annotations and queries. Due to the lack of annotated data for this task, we generate a large-scale synthetic training dataset using a structured geometric formal language, enabling broad coverage of geometric concepts and facilitating model adaptation. We explore two fine-tuning approaches: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Our results show that GRPO significantly outperforms SFT by better aligning model behavior with task-specific rewards. Furthermore, we propose a verify-and-regenerate mechanism that detects incorrect predictions and re-infers answers using contextual reasoning history, further boosting accuracy. Notably, even state-of-the-art Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) struggle with this task, underscoring the necessity of explicitly evaluating and strengthening geometric grounding as a prerequisite for robust geometric problem solving. Moreover, models trained on GeoRef demonstrate measurable improvements on downstream geometric reasoning tasks, highlighting the broader value of REC as a foundation for multimodal mathematical understanding.

  Large language models (LLMs) acquire extensive prior knowledge through large-scale pretraining and can be further enhanced via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or reinforcement learning (RL)-based post-training. A growing body of evidence has shown that RL fine-tuning improves the capability of LLMs beyond what SFT alone achieves. However, the underlying mechanisms why RL fine-tuning is able to enhance the capability of various LLMs with distinct intrinsic characteristics remain underexplored. In this study, we draw inspiration from prior work on edge attribution patching (EAP) to investigate the internal differences of LLMs before and after RL fine-tuning. Our analysis across multiple model families shows two robust effects of online RL post-training: (i) an overall increase in activation intensity, indicating that more internal pathways are engaged and their signals become stronger, and (ii) greater diversity in activation patterns, reflected by higher entropy and less concentrated edge distributions. These changes suggest that RL reshapes information flow to be both more redundant and more flexible, which may explain its advantage in generalization. Notably, models fine-tuned with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) deviate from these trends, exhibiting substantially weaker or inconsistent internal changes compared to PPO- and GRPO-based training. Together, our findings provide a unified view of how RL fine-tuning systematically alters the internal circuitry of LLMs and highlight the methodological distinctions between online RL and preference-based approaches.

  Given the prohibitive cost of pre-training large language models, it is essential to leverage smaller proxy models to optimize datasets before scaling up. However, this approach becomes challenging for reasoning capabilities, which exhibit emergent behavior that only appear reliably at larger model sizes, often exceeding 7B parameters. To address this, we introduce rBridge, showing that small proxies ($\leq$1B) can effectively predict large-model reasoning by aligning more closely with (1) the pre-training objective and (2) the target task. rBridge achieves this by weighting negative log-likelihood with task alignment, using reasoning traces from frontier models as gold labels. In our experiments, rBridge (i) reduces dataset ranking costs by over 100x relative to the best baseline, (ii) achieves the strongest correlation across six reasoning benchmarks at 1B to 32B scale, and (iii) zero-shot transfers predictive relationships across pre-training datasets at 1B to 7B scale. These findings indicate that rBridge offers a practical path for exploring reasoning-oriented pre-training at lower cost.

  The goal of personalized medicine is to discover a treatment regimen that optimizes a patient's clinical outcome based on their personal genetic and environmental factors. However, candidate treatments cannot be arbitrarily administered to the patient to assess their efficacy; we often instead have access to an in silico surrogate model that approximates the true fitness of a proposed treatment. Unfortunately, such surrogate models have been shown to fail to generalize to previously unseen patient-treatment combinations. We hypothesize that domain-specific prior knowledge - such as medical textbooks and biomedical knowledge graphs - can provide a meaningful alternative signal of the fitness of proposed treatments. To this end, we introduce LLM-based Entropy-guided Optimization with kNowledgeable priors (LEON), a mathematically principled approach to leverage large language models (LLMs) as black-box optimizers without any task-specific fine-tuning, taking advantage of their ability to contextualize unstructured domain knowledge to propose personalized treatment plans in natural language. In practice, we implement LEON via 'optimization by prompting,' which uses LLMs as stochastic engines for proposing treatment designs. Experiments on real-world optimization tasks show LEON outperforms both traditional and LLM-based methods in proposing individualized treatments for patients.

  Synthetic tabular data is used for privacy-preserving data sharing and data-driven model development. Its effectiveness, however, depends heavily on the used Tabular Data Synthesis (TDS) tool. Recent studies have shown that Transformer-based models outperform other state-of-the-art models such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Diffusion models in terms of data quality. However, Transformer-based models also come with high computational costs, making them sometimes unfeasible for end users with prosumer hardware. This study presents a sensitivity assessment on how the choice of hyperparameters, such as number of layers or hidden dimension affects the quality of the resultant synthetic data and the computational performance. It is performed across two tools, GReaT and REaLTabFormer, evaluating 10 model setups that vary in architecture type and depth. We assess the sensitivity on three dimensions: runtime, machine learning (ML) utility, and similarity to real data distributions. Experiments were conducted on four real-world datasets. Our findings reveal that runtime is proportional to the number of hyperparameters, with shallower configurations completing faster. GReaT consistently achieves lower runtimes than REaLTabFormer, and only on the largest dataset they have comparable runtime. For small datasets, both tools achieve synthetic data with high utility and optimal similarity, but on larger datasets only REaLTabFormer sustains strong utility and similarity. As a result, REaLTabFormer with lightweight LLMs provides the best balance, since it preserves data quality while reducing computational requirements. Nonetheless, its runtime remains higher than that of GReaT and other TDS tools, suggesting that efficiency gains are possible but only up to a certain level.

  Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a cornerstone in advancing large-scale pre-trained language models (LLMs). Successive generations, including GPT-o series, DeepSeek-R1, Kimi-K1.5, Grok 4, and GLM-4.5, have relied on large-scale RL training to enhance reasoning and coding capabilities. To meet the community's growing RL needs, numerous RL frameworks have been proposed. However, RL training remains computationally expensive, with rollout generation accounting for more than 90% of total runtime. In addition, its efficiency is often constrained by the long-tail distribution of rollout response lengths, where a few lengthy responses stall entire batches, leaving GPUs idle and underutilized. As model and rollout sizes continue to grow, this bottleneck increasingly limits scalability. To address this challenge, we propose Active Partial Rollouts in Reinforcement Learning (APRIL), which mitigates long-tail inefficiency. In the rollout phase, APRIL over-provisions rollout requests, terminates once the target number of responses is reached, and recycles incomplete responses for continuation in future steps. This strategy ensures that no rollouts are discarded while substantially reducing GPU idle time. Experiments show that APRIL improves rollout throughput by at most 44% across commonly used RL algorithms (GRPO, DAPO, GSPO), accelerates convergence, and achieves at most 8% higher final accuracy across tasks. Moreover, APRIL is both framework and hardware agnostic, already integrated into the slime RL framework, and deployable on NVIDIA and AMD GPUs alike. Taken together, this work unifies system-level and algorithmic considerations in proposing APRIL, with the aim of advancing RL training efficiency and inspiring further optimizations in RL systems.

  For RL algorithms, appropriate entropy control is crucial to their effectiveness. To control the policy entropy, a commonly used method is entropy regularization, which is adopted in various popular RL algorithms including PPO, SAC and A3C. Although entropy regularization proves effective in robotic and games RL conventionally, studies found that it gives weak to no gains in LLM-RL training. In this work, we study the issues of entropy bonus in LLM-RL setting. Specifically, we first argue that the conventional entropy regularization suffers from the LLM's extremely large response space and the sparsity of the optimal outputs. As a remedy, we propose AEnt, an entropy control method that utilizes a new clamped entropy bonus with an automatically adjusted coefficient. The clamped entropy is evaluated with the re-normalized policy defined on certain smaller token space, which encourages exploration within a more compact response set. In addition, the algorithm automatically adjusts entropy coefficient according to the clamped entropy value, effectively controlling the entropy-induced bias while leveraging the entropy's benefits. AEnt is tested in math-reasoning tasks under different base models and datasets, and it is observed that AEnt outperforms the baselines consistently across multiple benchmarks.

  Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have underscored the potential of Reinforcement Learning (RL) to facilitate the emergence of reasoning capabilities. Despite the encouraging results, a fundamental dilemma persists as RL improvement relies on learning from high-quality samples, yet the exploration for such samples remains bounded by the inherent limitations of LLMs. This, in effect, creates an undesirable cycle in which what cannot be explored cannot be learned. In this work, we propose Rubric-Scaffolded Reinforcement Learning (RuscaRL), a novel instructional scaffolding framework designed to break the exploration bottleneck for general LLM reasoning. Specifically, RuscaRL introduces checklist-style rubrics as (1) explicit scaffolding for exploration during rollout generation, where different rubrics are provided as external guidance within task instructions to steer diverse high-quality responses. This guidance is gradually decayed over time, encouraging the model to internalize the underlying reasoning patterns; (2) verifiable rewards for exploitation during model training, where we can obtain robust LLM-as-a-Judge scores using rubrics as references, enabling effective RL on general reasoning tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed RuscaRL across various benchmarks, effectively expanding reasoning boundaries under the Best-of-N evaluation. Notably, RuscaRL significantly boosts Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct from 23.6 to 50.3 on HealthBench-500, surpassing GPT-4.1.

  The alignment of large language models (LLMs) with human preferences is commonly achieved through Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) simplified this paradigm by establishing a direct mapping between the optimal policy and a reward function, eliminating the need for an explicit reward model. However, we argue that the DPO loss function is theoretically misaligned with its own derivation, as it promotes the indefinite maximization of a logits difference, which can lead to training instability and reward hacking. In this paper, we propose a novel loss function derived directly from the RLHF optimality condition. Our proposed loss targets a specific, finite value for the logits difference, which is dictated by the underlying reward, rather than its maximization. We provide a theoretical analysis, including a gradient-based comparison, to demonstrate that our method avoids the large gradients that plague DPO when the probability of dispreferred responses approaches zero. This inherent stability prevents reward hacking and leads to more effective alignment. We validate our approach by fine-tuning a Qwen2.5-7B model, showing significant win-rate improvements over a standard DPO baseline and achieving competitive performance against larger models like Llama-3.1-8B.

  Low-rank optimization has emerged as a promising direction in training large language models (LLMs) to improve running time and reduce the memory usage of adaptive optimizers by constraining learning to a lower-dimensional space. Prior work typically projects gradients of linear layers using approaches based on Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) or QR-decomposition. Applying these techniques individually to each layer in large models is computationally expensive and incurs additional memory costs due to storing the projection matrices. In this work, we propose a computationally efficient and conceptually simple, two-step procedure to approximate SVD/QR-based gradient projections into lower-dimensional spaces by using a predefined orthogonal matrix of the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT). We dynamically select columns from the DCT matrix based on their alignment with the gradient of each layer. The effective projection matrices are obtained via a simple matmul with the DCT matrix in $O(n^3)$ time, followed by a lightweight sorting step to identify the most relevant basis vectors. For large layers, DCT can be computed via Makhoul's $N$-point algorithm based on Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) in $O(n^2 \log(n))$ time. Due to the predefined nature of the orthogonal bases, they are computed once at the start of training. Our numerical experiments on both pre-training and fine-tuning tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our dual strategy in approximating optimal low-rank projections, obtaining an approach with rank-independent running time that matches the performance of costly SVD/QR-based methods while achieving faster runtime and reduced memory usage by up to $25\%$ across different model sizes.

  Large language models (LLMs) excel at language understanding and generation, but their enormous computational and memory requirements hinder deployment. Compression offers a potential solution to mitigate these constraints. However, most existing methods rely on fixed heuristics and thus fail to adapt to runtime memory variations or heterogeneous KV-cache demands arising from diverse user requests. To address these limitations, we propose RAP, an elastic pruning framework driven by reinforcement learning (RL) that dynamically adjusts compression strategies in a runtime-aware manner. Specifically, RAP dynamically tracks the evolving ratio between model parameters and KV-cache across practical execution. Recognizing that FFNs house most parameters, whereas parameter -light attention layers dominate KV-cache formation, the RL agent retains only those components that maximize utility within the current memory budget, conditioned on instantaneous workload and device state. Extensive experiments results demonstrate that RAP outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, marking the first time to jointly consider model weights and KV-cache on the fly.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly specialize by domain (e.g., math, code, general reasoning), motivating systems that leverage complementary strengths across models. Prior multi-LLM approaches either (i) route a query to one or a few experts and generate independently, (ii) aggregate outputs from each model via costly multi-turn exchanges, or (iii) fuse weights into a single model-typically requiring architectural homogeneity. We introduce Mixture of Thoughts (MoT), a simple method for latent-level collaboration among heterogeneous experts under a global routing scheme. For each query, a lightweight router selects top-$K$ experts and designates a primary expert; uniformly placed interaction layers project hidden states into a shared latent space where the primary expert performs cross-attention over its active (selected) peers. Pre-trained experts remain frozen; only the router and the lightweight interaction layers are trained with a novel joint training objective that improves both the expert selection and inter-expert collaboration. Across five in-distribution (ID) and three out-of-distribution (OOD) benchmarks, MoT surpasses the current routing and aggregation-based state-of-the-art, Avengers, by $+0.38\%$ and $+2.92\%$, respectively. Further, MoT significantly outperforms the best-performing single model. It achieves this with single-pass inference, runtime comparable to routing baselines, and none of the overheads of iterative aggregation. MoT offers a simple latent-space mechanism for combining heterogeneous LLMs, a practical step toward broader multi-LLM collaboration. Our code is publicly available atthis https URL.

  _Ruiyu Wang, Shizhao Sun, Weijian Ma, Jiang Bian_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Computer-Aided Design (CAD) is a foundational component of industrial prototyping, where models are defined not by raw coordinates but by construction sequences such as sketches and extrusions. This sequential structure enables both efficient prototype initialization and subsequent editing. Text-guided CAD prototyping, which unifies Text-to-CAD generation and CAD editing, has the potential to streamline the entire design pipeline. However, prior work has not explored this setting, largely because standard large language model (LLM) tokenizers decompose CAD sequences into natural-language word pieces, failing to capture primitive-level CAD semantics and hindering attention modules from modeling geometric structure. We conjecture that a multimodal tokenization strategy, aligned with CAD's primitive and structural nature, can provide more effective representations. To this end, we propose CAD-Tokenizer, a framework that represents CAD data with modality-specific tokens using a sequence-based VQ-VAE with primitive-level pooling and constrained decoding. This design produces compact, primitive-aware representations that align with CAD's structural nature. Applied to unified text-guided CAD prototyping, CAD-Tokenizer significantly improves instruction following and generation quality, achieving better quantitative and qualitative performance over both general-purpose LLMs and task-specific baselines.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The integration of new modalities enhances the capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) but also introduces additional vulnerabilities. In particular, simple visual jailbreaking attacks can manipulate open-source MLLMs more readily than sophisticated textual attacks. However, these underdeveloped attacks exhibit extremely limited cross-model transferability, failing to reliably identify vulnerabilities in closed-source MLLMs. In this work, we analyse the loss landscape of these jailbreaking attacks and find that the generated attacks tend to reside in high-sharpness regions, whose effectiveness is highly sensitive to even minor parameter changes during transfer. To further explain the high-sharpness localisations, we analyse their feature representations in both the intermediate layers and the spectral domain, revealing an improper reliance on narrow layer representations and semantically poor frequency components. Building on this, we propose a Feature Over-Reliance CorrEction (FORCE) method, which guides the attack to explore broader feasible regions across layer features and rescales the influence of frequency features according to their semantic content. By eliminating non-generalizable reliance on both layer and spectral features, our method discovers flattened feasible regions for visual jailbreaking attacks, thereby improving cross-model transferability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach effectively facilitates visual red-teaming evaluations against closed-source MLLMs.

  In modern GPU inference, cache efficiency remains a major bottleneck. In recommendation models, embedding hit rates largely determine throughput, while in large language models, KV-cache misses substantially increase time-to-first-token (TTFT). Heuristic policies such as \textsc{LRU} often struggle under structured access patterns. Learning-based approaches are promising, but in practice face two major limitations: they degrade sharply when predictions are inaccurate, or they gain little even with accurate predictions due to conservative designs. Some also incur high overhead, further limiting practicality.We present \textsc{LCR}, a practical framework for learning-based GPU caching that delivers performance gains while ensuring robustness and efficiency. Its core algorithm, \textsc{LARU}, enhances \textsc{LRU} with machine-learned predictions and dynamically adapts to prediction accuracy through online error estimation. When predictions are accurate, \textsc{LARU} achieves near-optimal performance. With inaccurate predictions, it degrades gracefully to near-\textsc{LRU} performance. With \textsc{LCR}, we bridge the gap between empirical progress and theoretical advances in learning-based caching.Experiments show that \textsc{LCR} delivers consistent gains under realistic conditions. In DLRM and LLM scenarios, it improves throughput by up to 24.2\% and reduces P99 TTFT by up to 28.3\%, outperforming widely used inference systems. Even under poor predictions, its performance remains stable, demonstrating practical robustness.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Speculative decoding accelerates generation by drafting candidates and verifying them in parallel, yet state-of-the-art drafters (e.g., EAGLE) still require N sequential passes to propose N tokens. We present FastEagle, a non-autoregressive cascaded drafter that emits an entire draft in a single forward pass. FastEagle replaces temporal steps with a lightweight layer cascade and trains with layer-wise supervision to mitigate error accumulation. Coupled with a constrained draft tree that preserves lossless verification cost, FastEagle delivers substantial wall-clock speedups over strong autoregressive drafters while maintaining competitive acceptance behavior. Across multiple LLMs (Vicuna-13B, LLaMA-Instruct 3.x, and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-LLaMA) and tasks (MT-Bench, HumanEval, GSM8K, CNN/DM, Alpaca), FastEagle consistently outperforms EAGLE-3 in speedup under both greedy and stochastic decoding, with comparable average acceptance lengths. These results indicate that removing sequential dependencies in drafting is a practical path toward lossless LLM inference acceleration.

  The ongoing intense discussion on rising LLM usage in the scientific peer-review process has recently been mingled by reports of authors using hidden prompt injections to manipulate review scores. Since the existence of such "attacks" - although seen by some commentators as "self-defense" - would have a great impact on the further debate, this paper investigates the practicability and technical success of the described manipulations. Our systematic evaluation uses 1k reviews of 2024 ICLR papers generated by a wide range of LLMs shows two distinct results: I) very simple prompt injections are indeed highly effective, reaching up to 100% acceptance scores. II) LLM reviews are generally biased toward acceptance (>95% in many models). Both results have great impact on the ongoing discussions on LLM usage in peer-review.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Weight quantisation is an essential technique for enabling efficient training and deployment of modern deep learning models. However, the recipe book of quantisation formats is large and formats are often chosen empirically. In this paper, we propose a framework for systematic design and analysis of quantisation formats. By connecting the question of format design with the classical quantisation theory, we show that the strong practical performance of popular formats comes from their ability to represent values using variable-length codes. We frame the problem as minimising the KL divergence between original and quantised model outputs under a model size constraint, which can be approximated by minimising the squared quantisation error, a well-studied problem where entropy-constrained quantisers with variable-length codes are optimal. We develop non-linear quantisation curves for block-scaled data across multiple distribution families and observe that these formats, along with sparse outlier formats, consistently outperform fixed-length formats, indicating that they also exploit variable-length encoding. Finally, by using the relationship between the Fisher information and KL divergence, we derive the optimal allocation of bit-widths to individual parameter tensors across the model's layers, saving up to 0.25 bits per parameter when applied to large language models.

  Adaptive inference schemes reduce the cost of machine learning inference by assigning smaller models to easier examples, attempting to avoid invocation of larger models when possible. In this work we explore a simple, effective adaptive inference technique we term Agreement-Based Cascading (ABC). ABC builds a cascade of models of increasing size/complexity, and uses agreement between ensembles of models at each level of the cascade as a basis for data-dependent routing. Although ensemble execution introduces additional expense, we show that these costs can be easily offset in practice due to large expected differences in model sizes, parallel inference execution capabilities, and accuracy benefits of ensembling. We examine ABC theoretically and empirically in terms of these parameters, showing that the approach can reliably act as a drop-in replacement for existing models and surpass the best single model it aims to replace in terms of both efficiency and accuracy. Additionally, we explore the performance of ABC relative to existing cascading methods in three common scenarios: (1) edge-to-cloud inference, where ABC reduces communication costs by up to 14x; (2) cloud-based model serving, where it achieves a 3x reduction in rental costs; and (3) inference via model API services, where ABC achieves a 2-25x reduction in average price per token/request relative to state-of-the-art LLM cascades.

  Spatial intelligence is essential for multimodal large language models (MLLMs) operating in the complex physical world. Existing benchmarks, however, probe only single-image relations and thus fail to assess the multi-image spatial reasoning that real-world deployments demand. We introduce MMSI-Bench, a VQA benchmark dedicated to multi-image spatial intelligence. Six 3D-vision researchers spent more than 300 hours meticulously crafting 1,000 challenging, unambiguous multiple-choice questions from over 120,000 images, each paired with carefully designed distractors and a step-by-step reasoning process. We conduct extensive experiments and thoroughly evaluate 34 open-source and proprietary MLLMs, observing a wide gap: the strongest open-source model attains roughly 30% accuracy and OpenAI's o3 reasoning model reaches 40%, while humans score 97%. These results underscore the challenging nature of MMSI-Bench and the substantial headroom for future research. Leveraging the annotated reasoning processes, we also provide an automated error analysis pipeline that diagnoses four dominant failure modes, including (1) grounding errors, (2) overlap-matching and scene-reconstruction errors, (3) situation-transformation reasoning errors, and (4) spatial-logic errors, offering valuable insights for advancing multi-image spatial intelligence.

  _Junhao Su, Yuanliang Wan, Junwei Yang, Hengyu Shi, Tianyang Han, Junfeng Luo, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Tool-augmented large language models (LLMs) are usually trained with supervised imitation or coarse-grained reinforcement learning that optimizes single tool calls. Current self-reflection practices rely on heuristic prompts or one-way reasoning: the model is urged to 'think more' instead of learning error diagnosis and repair. This is fragile in multi-turn interactions; after a failure the model often repeats the same mistake. We propose structured reflection, which turns the path from error to repair into an explicit, controllable, and trainable action. The agent produces a short yet precise reflection: it diagnoses the failure using evidence from the previous step and then proposes a correct, executable follow-up call. For training we combine DAPO and GSPO objectives with a reward scheme tailored to tool use, optimizing the stepwise strategy Reflect, then Call, then Final. To evaluate, we introduce Tool-Reflection-Bench, a lightweight benchmark that programmatically checks structural validity, executability, parameter correctness, and result consistency. Tasks are built as mini trajectories of erroneous call, reflection, and corrected call, with disjoint train and test splits. Experiments on BFCL v3 and Tool-Reflection-Bench show large gains in multi-turn tool-call success and error recovery, and a reduction of redundant calls. These results indicate that making reflection explicit and optimizing it directly improves the reliability of tool interaction and offers a reproducible path for agents to learn from failure.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in natural language processing (NLP) tasks, yet their substantial memory requirements present significant challenges for deployment on resource-constrained devices. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) has emerged as a promising compression technique for LLMs, offering considerable reductions in memory overhead. However, existing SVD-based methods often struggle to effectively mitigate the errors introduced by SVD truncation, leading to a noticeable performance gap when compared to the original models. Furthermore, applying a uniform compression ratio across all transformer layers fails to account for the varying importance of different layers. To address these challenges, we propose AdaSVD, an adaptive SVD-based LLM compression approach. Specifically, AdaSVD introduces adaComp, which adaptively compensates for SVD truncation errors by alternately updating the singular matrices $\mathcal{U}$ and $\mathcal{V}^\top$. Additionally, AdaSVD introduces adaCR, which adaptively assigns layer-specific compression ratios based on the relative importance of each layer. Extensive experiments across multiple LLM/VLM families and evaluation metrics demonstrate that AdaSVD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) SVD-based methods, achieving superior performance with significantly reduced memory requirements. Code and models of AdaSVD will be available atthis https URL.

  The field of vision-language understanding has been actively researched in recent years, thanks to the development of Large Language Models~(LLMs). However, it still needs help with problems requiring multi-step reasoning, even for very simple questions. Recent studies adopt LLMs to tackle this problem by iteratively generating sub-questions and answers. However, there are disadvantages such as 1) the fine-grained visual contents of images are not available using LLMs that cannot read visual information, 2) internal mechanisms are inaccessible and difficult to reproduce by using black-box LLMs. To solve these problems, we propose the SQ (Self-Questioning)-InstructBLIP, which improves inference performance by generating image-aware informative sub-questions and sub-answers iteratively. The SQ-InstructBLIP, which consists of a Questioner, Answerer, and Reasoner that share the same architecture. Questioner and Answerer generate sub-questions and sub-answers to help infer the main-question, and Reasoner performs reasoning on the main-question considering the generated sub-question information. Our experiments show that the proposed method SQ-InstructBLIP, which uses the generated sub-questions as additional information when solving the VQA task, performs more accurate reasoning than the previous works.

  The dynamic propagation of social media has broadened the reach of financial advisory content through podcast videos, yet extracting insights from lengthy, multimodal segments (30-40 minutes) remains challenging. We introduce FASTER (Financial Advisory Summariser with Textual Embedded Relevant images), a modular framework that tackles three key challenges: (1) extracting modality-specific features, (2) producing optimized, concise summaries, and (3) aligning visual keyframes with associated textual points. FASTER employs BLIP for semantic visual descriptions, OCR for textual patterns, and Whisper-based transcription with Speaker diarization as BOS features. A modified Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)-based loss function, equipped with BOS-specific fact-checking, ensures precision, relevance, and factual consistency against the human-aligned summary. A ranker-based retrieval mechanism further aligns keyframes with summarized content, enhancing interpretability and cross-modal coherence. To acknowledge data resource scarcity, we introduce Fin-APT, a dataset comprising 470 publicly accessible financial advisory pep-talk videos for robust multimodal research. Comprehensive cross-domain experiments confirm FASTER's strong performance, robustness, and generalizability when compared to Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs). By establishing a new standard for multimodal summarization, FASTER makes financial advisory content more accessible and actionable, thereby opening new avenues for research.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Acquiring high-quality knowledge is a central focus in Knowledge-Based Visual Question Answering (KB-VQA). Recent methods use large language models (LLMs) as knowledge engines for answering. These methods generally employ image captions as visual text descriptions to assist LLMs in interpreting images. However, the captions frequently include excessive noise irrelevant to the question, and LLMs generally do not comprehend VQA tasks, limiting their reasoning capabilities. To address this issue, we propose the Summarized Caption-Rerank Augmented VQA (SCRA-VQA), which employs a pre-trained visual language model to convert images into captions. Moreover, SCRA-VQA generates contextual examples for the captions while simultaneously summarizing and reordering them to exclude unrelated information. The caption-rerank process enables LLMs to understand the image information and questions better, thus enhancing the model's reasoning ability and task adaptability without expensive end-to-end training. Based on an LLM with 6.7B parameters, SCRA-VQA performs excellently on two challenging knowledge-based VQA datasets: OK-VQA and A-OKVQA, achieving accuracies of 38.8% and 34.6%.

  Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models~(MLLMs) have significantly enhanced the ability of these models in multimodal understanding and reasoning. However, the performance of MLLMs for knowledge-intensive visual questions, which require external knowledge beyond the visual content of an image, still remains limited. While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become a promising solution to provide models with external knowledge, its conventional single-pass framework often fails to gather sufficient knowledge. To overcome this limitation, we propose MI-RAG, a Multimodal Iterative RAG framework that leverages reasoning to enhance retrieval and incorporates knowledge synthesis to refine its understanding. At each iteration, the model formulates a reasoning-guided multi-query to explore multiple facets of knowledge. Subsequently, these queries drive a joint search across heterogeneous knowledge bases, retrieving diverse knowledge. This retrieved knowledge is then synthesized to enrich the reasoning record, progressively deepening the model's understanding. Experiments on challenging benchmarks, including Encyclopedic VQA, InfoSeek, and OK-VQA, show that MI-RAG significantly improves both retrieval recall and answer accuracy, establishing a scalable approach for compositional reasoning in knowledge-intensive VQA.

  Despite remarkable progress in Text-to-Image models, many real-world applications require generating coherent image sets with diverse consistency requirements. Existing consistent methods often focus on a specific domain with specific aspects of consistency, which significantly constrains their generalizability to broader applications. In this paper, we propose a more challenging problem, Text-to-ImageSet (T2IS) generation, which aims to generate sets of images that meet various consistency requirements based on user instructions. To systematically study this problem, we first introduce $\textbf{T2IS-Bench}$ with 596 diverse instructions across 26 subcategories, providing comprehensive coverage for T2IS generation. Building on this, we propose $\textbf{T2IS-Eval}$, an evaluation framework that transforms user instructions into multifaceted assessment criteria and employs effective evaluators to adaptively assess consistency fulfillment between criteria and generated sets. Subsequently, we propose $\textbf{AutoT2IS}$, a training-free framework that maximally leverages pretrained Diffusion Transformers' in-context capabilities to harmonize visual elements to satisfy both image-level prompt alignment and set-level visual consistency. Extensive experiments on T2IS-Bench reveal that diverse consistency challenges all existing methods, while our AutoT2IS significantly outperforms current generalized and even specialized approaches. Our method also demonstrates the ability to enable numerous underexplored real-world applications, confirming its substantial practical value. Visit our project inthis https URL.

  Recently, the application of deep learning in image colorization has received widespread attention. The maturation of diffusion models has further advanced the development of image colorization models. However, current mainstream image colorization models still face issues such as color bleeding and color binding errors, and cannot colorize images at the instance level. In this paper, we propose a diffusion-based colorization method MT-Color to achieve precise instance-aware colorization with use-provided guidance. To tackle color bleeding issue, we design a pixel-level mask attention mechanism that integrates latent features and conditional gray image features through cross-attention. We use segmentation masks to construct cross-attention masks, preventing pixel information from exchanging between different instances. We also introduce an instance mask and text guidance module that extracts instance masks and text representations of each instance, which are then fused with latent features through self-attention, utilizing instance masks to form self-attention masks to prevent instance texts from guiding the colorization of other areas, thus mitigating color binding errors. Furthermore, we apply a multi-instance sampling strategy, which involves sampling each instance region separately and then fusing the results. Additionally, we have created a specialized dataset for instance-level colorization tasks, GPT-color, by leveraging large visual language models on existing image datasets. Qualitative and quantitative experiments show that our model and dataset outperform previous methods and datasets.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Video reasoning has emerged as a critical capability for multimodal large language models (MLLMs), requiring models to move beyond static perception toward coherent understanding of temporal dynamics in complex scenes. Yet existing MLLMs often exhibit process inconsistency, where intermediate reasoning drifts from video dynamics even when the final answer is correct, undermining interpretability and robustness. To address this issue, we introduce MOSS-ChatV, a reinforcement learning framework with a Dynamic Time Warping (DTW)-based process reward. This rule-based reward aligns reasoning traces with temporally grounded references, enabling efficient process supervision without auxiliary reward models. We further identify dynamic state prediction as a key measure of video reasoning and construct MOSS-Video, a benchmark with annotated reasoning traces, where the training split is used to fine-tune MOSS-ChatV and the held-out split is reserved for evaluation. MOSS-ChatV achieves 87.2\% on MOSS-Video (test) and improves performance on general video benchmarks such as MVBench and MMVU. The framework consistently yields gains across different architectures, including Qwen2.5-VL and Phi-2, confirming its broad applicability. Evaluations with GPT-4o-as-judge further show that MOSS-ChatV produces more consistent and stable reasoning traces.

  Inducing reasoning in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) is critical for achieving human-level perception and understanding. Existing methods mainly leverage LLM reasoning to analyze parsed visuals, often limited by static perception stages. This paper introduces Visual Test-Time Scaling (VTTS), a novel approach to enhance MLLMs' reasoning via iterative perception during inference. VTTS mimics humans' hierarchical attention by progressively refining focus on high-confidence spatio-temporal regions, guided by updated textual predictions. Specifically, VTTS employs an Iterative Perception (ITP) mechanism, incorporating reinforcement learning with spatio-temporal supervision to optimize reasoning. To support this paradigm, we also present VTTS-80K, a dataset tailored for iterative perception. These designs allows a MLLM to enhance its performance by increasing its perceptual compute. Extensive experiments validate VTTS's effectiveness and generalization across diverse tasks and benchmarks. Our newly introduced Videochat-R1.5 model has achieved remarkable improvements, with an average increase of over 5\%, compared to robust baselines such as Qwen2.5VL-3B and -7B, across more than 15 benchmarks that encompass video conversation, video reasoning, and spatio-temporal perception.

  We propose a novel architecture UniTransfer, which introduces both spatial and diffusion timestep decomposition in a progressive paradigm, achieving precise and controllable video concept transfer. Specifically, in terms of spatial decomposition, we decouple videos into three key components: the foreground subject, the background, and the motion flow. Building upon this decomposed formulation, we further introduce a dual-to-single-stream DiT-based architecture for supporting fine-grained control over different components in the videos. We also introduce a self-supervised pretraining strategy based on random masking to enhance the decomposed representation learning from large-scale unlabeled video data. Inspired by the Chain-of-Thought reasoning paradigm, we further revisit the denoising diffusion process and propose a Chain-of-Prompt (CoP) mechanism to achieve the timestep decomposition. We decompose the denoising process into three stages of different granularity and leverage large language models (LLMs) for stage-specific instructions to guide the generation progressively. We also curate an animal-centric video dataset called OpenAnimal to facilitate the advancement and benchmarking of research in video concept transfer. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves high-quality and controllable video concept transfer across diverse reference images and scenes, surpassing existing baselines in both visual fidelity and editability.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Quantization-aware training (QAT) combined with knowledge distillation (KD) is a promising strategy for compressing Artificial Intelligence (AI) models for deployment on resource-constrained hardware. However, existing QAT-KD methods often struggle to balance task-specific (TS) and distillation losses due to heterogeneous gradient magnitudes, especially under low-bit quantization. We propose Game of Regularizer (GoR), a novel learnable regularization method that adaptively balances TS and KD objectives using only two trainable parameters for dynamic loss weighting. GoR reduces conflict between supervision signals, improves convergence, and boosts the performance of small quantized models (SQMs). Experiments on image classification, object detection (OD), and large language model (LLM) compression show that GoR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art QAT-KD methods. On low-power edge devices, it delivers faster inference while maintaining full-precision accuracy. We also introduce QAT-EKD-GoR, an ensemble distillation framework that uses multiple heterogeneous teacher models. Under optimal conditions, the proposed EKD-GoR can outperform full-precision models, providing a robust solution for real-world deployment.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for understanding videos, supporting tasks such as summarization, captioning, and question answering. Their performance has been driven by advances in frame sampling, progressing from uniform-based to semantic-similarity-based and, most recently, prompt-guided strategies. While vulnerabilities have been identified in earlier sampling strategies, the safety of prompt-guided sampling remains unexplored. We close this gap by presenting PoisonVID, the first black-box poisoning attack that undermines prompt-guided sampling in VideoLLMs. PoisonVID compromises the underlying prompt-guided sampling mechanism through a closed-loop optimization strategy that iteratively optimizes a universal perturbation to suppress harmful frame relevance scores, guided by a depiction set constructed from paraphrased harmful descriptions leveraging a shadow VideoLLM and a lightweight language model, i.e., GPT-4o-mini. Comprehensively evaluated on three prompt-guided sampling strategies and across three advanced VideoLLMs, PoisonVID achieves 82% - 99% attack success rate, highlighting the importance of developing future advanced sampling strategies for VideoLLMs.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce Seedream 4.0, an efficient and high-performance multimodal image generation system that unifies text-to-image (T2I) synthesis, image editing, and multi-image composition within a single framework. We develop a highly efficient diffusion transformer with a powerful VAE which also can reduce the number of image tokens considerably. This allows for efficient training of our model, and enables it to fast generate native high-resolution images (e.g., 1K-4K). Seedream 4.0 is pretrained on billions of text-image pairs spanning diverse taxonomies and knowledge-centric concepts. Comprehensive data collection across hundreds of vertical scenarios, coupled with optimized strategies, ensures stable and large-scale training, with strong generalization. By incorporating a carefully fine-tuned VLM model, we perform multi-modal post-training for training both T2I and image editing tasks jointly. For inference acceleration, we integrate adversarial distillation, distribution matching, and quantization, as well as speculative decoding. It achieves an inference time of up to 1.8 seconds for generating a 2K image (without a LLM/VLM as PE model). Comprehensive evaluations reveal that Seedream 4.0 can achieve state-of-the-art results on both T2I and multimodal image editing. In particular, it demonstrates exceptional multimodal capabilities in complex tasks, including precise image editing and in-context reasoning, and also allows for multi-image reference, and can generate multiple output images. This extends traditional T2I systems into an more interactive and multidimensional creative tool, pushing the boundary of generative AI for both creativity and professional applications.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper introduces TempSamp-R1, a new reinforcement fine-tuning framework designed to improve the effectiveness of adapting multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to video temporal grounding tasks. We reveal that existing reinforcement learning methods, such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), rely on on-policy sampling for policy updates. However, in tasks with large temporal search spaces, this strategy becomes both inefficient and limited in performance, as it often fails to identify temporally accurate solutions. To address this limitation, TempSamp-R1 leverages ground-truth annotations as off-policy supervision to provide temporally precise guidance, effectively compensating for the sparsity and misalignment in on-policy solutions. To further stabilize training and reduce variance in reward-based updates, TempSamp-R1 provides a non-linear soft advantage computation method that dynamically reshapes the reward feedback via an asymmetric transformation. By employing a hybrid Chain-of-Thought (CoT) training paradigm, TempSamp-R1 optimizes a single unified model to support both CoT and non-CoT inference modes, enabling efficient handling of queries with varying reasoning complexity. Experimental results demonstrate that TempSamp-R1 outperforms GRPO-based baselines, establishing new state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets: Charades-STA (R1@0.7: 52.9%, +2.7%), ActivityNet Captions (R1@0.5: 56.0%, +5.3%), and QVHighlights (mAP: 30.0%, +3.0%). Moreover, TempSamp-R1 shows robust few-shot generalization capabilities under limited data. Code:this https URL

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved considerable accuracy in Optical Character Recognition (OCR) from static images. However, their efficacy in video OCR is significantly diminished due to factors such as motion blur, temporal variations, and visual effects inherent in video content. To provide clearer guidance for training practical MLLMs, we introduce the MME-VideoOCR benchmark, which encompasses a comprehensive range of video OCR application scenarios. MME-VideoOCR features 10 task categories comprising 25 individual tasks and spans 44 diverse scenarios. These tasks extend beyond text recognition to incorporate deeper comprehension and reasoning of textual content within videos. The benchmark consists of 1,464 videos with varying resolutions, aspect ratios, and durations, along with 2,000 meticulously curated, manually annotated question-answer pairs. We evaluate 18 state-of-the-art MLLMs on MME-VideoOCR, revealing that even the best-performing model (Gemini-2.5 Pro) achieves an accuracy of only 73.7%. Fine-grained analysis indicates that while existing MLLMs demonstrate strong performance on tasks where relevant texts are contained within a single or few frames, they exhibit limited capability in effectively handling tasks that demand holistic video comprehension. These limitations are especially evident in scenarios that require spatio-temporal reasoning, cross-frame information integration, or resistance to language prior bias. Our findings also highlight the importance of high-resolution visual input and sufficient temporal coverage for reliable OCR in dynamic video scenarios.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Video-language models (Video-LLMs) excel at understanding video content but struggle with spatial relationships, temporal ordering, and cross-frame continuity. To address these limitations, we introduce VideoPASTA (Preference Alignment with Spatio-Temporal-Cross Frame Adversaries), a framework that enhances Video-LLMs through targeted preference optimization. VideoPASTA trains models to distinguish accurate video representations from carefully crafted adversarial examples that deliberately violate spatial, temporal, or cross-frame relationships. With only 7,020 preference pairs and Direct Preference Optimization, VideoPASTA enables models to learn robust representations that capture fine-grained spatial details and long-range temporal dynamics. Experiments demonstrate that VideoPASTA is model agnostic and significantly improves performance, for example, achieving gains of up to +3.8 percentage points on LongVideoBench, +4.1 on VideoMME, and +4.0 on MVBench, when applied to various state-of-the-art Video-LLMs. These results demonstrate that targeted alignment, rather than massive pretraining or architectural modifications, effectively addresses core video-language challenges. Notably, VideoPASTA achieves these improvements without any human annotation or captioning, relying solely on 32-frame sampling. This efficiency makes our approach a scalable plug-and-play solution that seamlessly integrates with existing models while preserving their original capabilities.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in visual understanding and reasoning across various vision-language tasks. However, we found that MLLMs cannot process effectively from fine-grained medical image data in the traditional Visual Question Answering (VQA) pipeline, as they do not exploit the captured features and available medical knowledge fully, results in MLLMs usually performing poorly in zero-shot medical disease recognition. Fortunately, this limitation does not indicate that MLLMs are fundamentally incapable of addressing fine-grained recognition tasks. From a feature representation perspective, MLLMs demonstrate considerable potential for tackling such challenging problems. Thus, to address this challenge, we propose LLaVA-RadZ, a simple yet effective framework for zero-shot medical disease recognition via utilizing the existing MLLM features. Specifically, we design an end-to-end training strategy, termed Decoding-Side Feature Alignment Training (DFAT) to take advantage of the characteristics of the MLLM decoder architecture and incorporate modality-specific tokens tailored for different modalities. Additionally, we introduce a Domain Knowledge Anchoring Module (DKAM) to exploit the intrinsic medical knowledge of large models, which mitigates the category semantic gap in image-text alignment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our LLaVA-RadZ significantly outperforms traditional MLLMs in zero-shot disease recognition, achieving the comparable performance to the well-established and highly-optimized CLIP-based approaches.

  The remarkable success of the autoregressive paradigm has made significant advancement in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), with powerful models like Show-o, Transfusion and Emu3 achieving notable progress in unified image understanding and generation. For the first time, we uncover a common phenomenon: the understanding capabilities of MLLMs are typically stronger than their generative capabilities, with a significant gap between the two. Building on this insight, we propose HermesFlow, a simple yet general framework designed to seamlessly bridge the gap between understanding and generation in MLLMs. Specifically, we take the homologous data as input to curate homologous preference data of both understanding and generation. Through Pair-DPO and self-play iterative optimization, HermesFlow effectively aligns multimodal understanding and generation using homologous preference data. Extensive experiments demonstrate the significant superiority of our approach over prior methods, particularly in narrowing the gap between multimodal understanding and generation. These findings highlight the potential of HermesFlow as a general alignment framework for next-generation multimodal foundation models. Code:this https URL

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  While explicit positional encodings such as RoPE are a primary source of positional information in Transformer decoders, the causal mask also provides positional information. In this work, we prove that the causal mask can induce position-dependent patterns in attention scores, even without parameters or causal dependency in the input. Our theoretical analysis indicates that the induced attention pattern tends to favor nearby query-key pairs, mirroring the behavior of common positional encodings. Empirical analysis confirms that trained models exhibit the same behavior, with learned parameters further amplifying these patterns. Notably, we found that the interaction of causal mask and RoPE distorts RoPE's relative attention score patterns into non-relative ones. We consistently observed this effect in modern large language models, suggesting the importance of considering the causal mask as a source of positional information alongside explicit positional encodings.

  Automatic summarization systems have advanced rapidly with large language models (LLMs), yet they still lack reliable guarantees on inclusion of critical content in high-stakes domains like healthcare, law, and finance. In this work, we introduce Conformal Importance Summarization, the first framework for importance-preserving summary generation which uses conformal prediction to provide rigorous, distribution-free coverage guarantees. By calibrating thresholds on sentence-level importance scores, we enable extractive document summarization with user-specified coverage and recall rates over critical content. Our method is model-agnostic, requires only a small calibration set, and seamlessly integrates with existing black-box LLMs. Experiments on established summarization benchmarks demonstrate that Conformal Importance Summarization achieves the theoretically assured information coverage rate. Our work suggests that Conformal Importance Summarization can be combined with existing techniques to achieve reliable, controllable automatic summarization, paving the way for safer deployment of AI summarization tools in critical applications.

  This paper introduces a simple and scalable approach to improve the data efficiency of large language model (LLM) training by augmenting existing text data with thinking trajectories. The compute for pre-training LLMs has been growing at an unprecedented rate, while the availability of high-quality data remains limited. Consequently, maximizing the utility of available data constitutes a significant research challenge. A primary impediment is that certain high-quality tokens are difficult to learn given a fixed model capacity, as the underlying rationale for a single token can be exceptionally complex and deep. To address this issue, we propose Thinking augmented Pre-Training (TPT), a universal methodology that augments text with automatically generated thinking trajectories. Such augmentation effectively increases the volume of the training data and makes high-quality tokens more learnable through step-by-step reasoning and decomposition. We apply TPT across diverse training configurations up to $100$B tokens, encompassing pre-training with both constrained and abundant data, as well as mid-training from strong open-source checkpoints. Experimental results indicate that our method substantially improves the performance of LLMs across various model sizes and families. Notably, TPT enhances the data efficiency of LLM pre-training by a factor of $3$. For a $3$B parameter model, it improves the post-training performance by over $10\%$ on several challenging reasoning benchmarks.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated success across many benchmarks. However, they still exhibit limitations in long-context scenarios, primarily due to their short effective context length, quadratic computational complexity, and high memory overhead when processing lengthy inputs. To mitigate these issues, we introduce a novel context compression pipeline, called Intermediate Layer Retrieval (ILRe), which determines one intermediate decoder layer offline, encodes context by streaming chunked prefill only up to that layer, and recalls tokens by the attention scores between the input query and full key cache in that specified layer. In particular, we propose a multi-pooling kernels allocating strategy in the token recalling process to maintain the completeness of semantics. Our approach not only reduces the prefilling complexity from $O(L^2)$ to $O(L)$ and trims the memory footprint to a few tenths of that required for the full context, but also delivers performance comparable to or superior to the full-context setup in long-context scenarios. Without additional post training or operator development, ILRe can process a single $1M$ tokens request in less than half a minute (speedup $\approx 180\times$) and scores RULER-$1M$ benchmark of $\approx 79.8$ with model Llama-3.1-UltraLong-8B-1M-Instruct on a Huawei Ascend 910B NPU.

  Ambiguity in natural language is a significant obstacle for achieving accurate text to structured data mapping through large language models (LLMs), which affects the performance of tasks such as mapping text to agentic tool calling and text-to-SQL queries. Existing methods to ambiguity handling either rely on the ReACT framework to obtain correct mappings through trial and error, or on supervised fine-tuning to bias models toward specific tasks. In this paper, we adopt a different approach that characterizes representation differences of ambiguous text in the latent space and leverages these differences to identify ambiguity before mapping them to structured data. To detect sentence-level ambiguity, we focus on the relationship between ambiguous questions and their interpretations. Unlike distances calculated by dense embeddings, we introduce a new distance measure based on a path kernel over concepts. With this measurement, we identify patterns to distinguish ambiguous from unambiguous questions. Furthermore, we propose a method for improving LLM performance on ambiguous agentic tool calling through missing concept prediction. Both achieve state-of-the-art results.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) based agent systems have made great strides in real-world applications beyond traditional NLP tasks. This paper proposes a new LLM-based Multi-Agent System (LLM-MAS) benchmark, Collab-Overcooked, built on the popular Overcooked-AI game with more applicable and challenging tasks in interactive environments. Collab-Overcooked extends existing benchmarks in two novel ways. First, it provides a multi-agent framework supporting diverse tasks and objectives and encourages collaboration through natural language communication. Second, it introduces a spectrum of process-oriented evaluation metrics to assess the fine-grained collaboration capabilities of different LLM agents, a dimension often overlooked in prior work. We conduct extensive experiments with 13 popular LLMs and show that, while the LLMs exhibit a strong ability in goal interpretation, there are significant shortcomings in active collaboration and continuous adaptation, which are critical for efficiently fulfilling complex tasks. Notably, we highlight the strengths and weaknesses of LLM-MAS and provide insights for improving and evaluating LLM-MAS on a unified and open-source benchmark. The environments, 30 open-ended tasks, and the evaluation package are publicly available atthis https URL.

  Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) and Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) are the main RL paradigms used in LLM post-training, each offering distinct advantages. However, RLHF struggles with interpretability and reward hacking because it relies on human judgments that usually lack explicit criteria, whereas RLVR is limited in scope by its focus on correctness-based verifiers. We propose Reinforcement Learning with Binary Flexible Feedback (RLBFF), which combines the versatility of human-driven preferences with the precision of rule-based verification, enabling reward models to capture nuanced aspects of response quality beyond mere correctness. RLBFF extracts principles that can be answered in a binary fashion (e.g. accuracy of information: yes, or code readability: no) from natural language feedback. Such principles can then be used to ground Reward Model training as an entailment task (response satisfies or does not satisfy an arbitrary principle). We show that Reward Models trained in this manner can outperform Bradley-Terry models when matched for data and achieve top performance on RM-Bench (86.2%) and JudgeBench (81.4%, #1 on leaderboard as of September 24, 2025). Additionally, users can specify principles of interest at inference time to customize the focus of our reward models, in contrast to Bradley-Terry models. Finally, we present a fully open source recipe (including data) to align Qwen3-32B using RLBFF and our Reward Model, to match or exceed the performance of o3-mini and DeepSeek R1 on general alignment benchmarks of MT-Bench, WildBench, and Arena Hard v2 (at <5% of the inference cost).

  Progress in large language models is constrained by an evaluation bottleneck: build a benchmark, evaluate models and settings, then iterate. We therefore ask a simple question: can we forecast outcomes before running any experiments? We study text-only performance forecasting: estimating a model's score from a redacted task description and intended configuration, with no access to dataset instances. To support systematic study, we curate PRECOG, a corpus of redacted description-performance pairs spanning diverse tasks, domains, and metrics. Experiments show the task is challenging but feasible: models equipped with a retrieval module that excludes source papers achieve moderate prediction performance with well-calibrated uncertainty, reaching mean absolute error as low as 8.7 on the Accuracy subset at high-confidence thresholds. Our analysis indicates that stronger reasoning models engage in diverse, iterative querying, whereas current open-source models lag and often skip retrieval or gather evidence with limited diversity. We further test a zero-leakage setting, forecasting on newly released datasets or experiments before their papers are indexed, where GPT-5 with built-in web search still attains nontrivial prediction accuracy. Overall, our corpus and analyses offer an initial step toward open-ended anticipatory evaluation, supporting difficulty estimation and smarter experiment prioritization.

  The growing disparity between the exponential scaling of computational resources and the finite growth of high-quality text data now constrains conventional scaling approaches for large language models (LLMs). To address this challenge, we introduce Reinforcement Learning on Pre-Training data (RLPT), a new training-time scaling paradigm for optimizing LLMs. In contrast to prior approaches that scale training primarily through supervised learning, RLPT enables the policy to autonomously explore meaningful trajectories to learn from pre-training data and improve its capability through reinforcement learning (RL). While existing RL strategies such as reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) and reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) rely on human annotation for reward construction, RLPT eliminates this dependency by deriving reward signals directly from pre-training data. Specifically, it adopts a next-segment reasoning objective, rewarding the policy for accurately predicting subsequent text segments conditioned on the preceding context. This formulation allows RL to be scaled on pre-training data, encouraging the exploration of richer trajectories across broader contexts and thereby fostering more generalizable reasoning skills. Extensive experiments on both general-domain and mathematical reasoning benchmarks across multiple models validate the effectiveness of RLPT. For example, when applied to Qwen3-4B-Base, RLPT yields absolute improvements of $3.0$, $5.1$, $8.1$, $6.0$, $6.6$, and $5.3$ on MMLU, MMLU-Pro, GPQA-Diamond, KOR-Bench, AIME24, and AIME25, respectively. The results further demonstrate favorable scaling behavior, suggesting strong potential for continued gains with more compute. In addition, RLPT provides a solid foundation, extending the reasoning boundaries of LLMs and enhancing RLVR performance.

  Current benchmarks for long-context reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs) often blur critical factors like intrinsic task complexity, distractor interference, and task length. To enable more precise failure analysis, we introduce CogniLoad, a novel synthetic benchmark grounded in Cognitive Load Theory (CLT). CogniLoad generates natural-language logic puzzles with independently tunable parameters that reflect CLT's core dimensions: intrinsic difficulty ($d$) controls intrinsic load; distractor-to-signal ratio ($\rho$) regulates extraneous load; and task length ($N$) serves as an operational proxy for conditions demanding germane load. Evaluating 22 SotA reasoning LLMs, CogniLoad reveals distinct performance sensitivities, identifying task length as a dominant constraint and uncovering varied tolerances to intrinsic complexity and U-shaped responses to distractor ratios. By offering systematic, factorial control over these cognitive load dimensions, CogniLoad provides a reproducible, scalable, and diagnostically rich tool for dissecting LLM reasoning limitations and guiding future model development.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this report, we introduce PLaMo 2, a series of Japanese-focused large language models featuring a hybrid Samba-based architecture that transitions to full attention via continual pre-training to support 32K token contexts. Training leverages extensive synthetic corpora to overcome data scarcity, while computational efficiency is achieved through weight reuse and structured pruning. This efficient pruning methodology produces an 8B model that achieves performance comparable to our previous 100B model. Post-training further refines the models using a pipeline of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and direct preference optimization (DPO), enhanced by synthetic Japanese instruction data and model merging techniques. Optimized for inference using vLLM and quantization with minimal accuracy loss, the PLaMo 2 models achieve state-of-the-art results on Japanese benchmarks, outperforming similarly-sized open models in instruction-following, language fluency, and Japanese-specific knowledge.

  The emergence of open-source large language models (LLMs) has expanded opportunities for enterprise applications; however, many organizations still lack the infrastructure to deploy and maintain large-scale models. As a result, small LLMs (sLLMs) have become a practical alternative, despite their inherent performance limitations. While Domain Adaptive Continual Pretraining (DACP) has been previously explored as a method for domain adaptation, its utility in commercial applications remains under-examined. In this study, we validate the effectiveness of applying a DACP-based recipe across diverse foundation models and service domains. Through extensive experiments and real-world evaluations, we demonstrate that DACP-applied sLLMs achieve substantial gains in target domain performance while preserving general capabilities, offering a cost-efficient and scalable solution for enterprise-level deployment.

  Reinforcement learning (RL) has been widely adopted in post-training for large language models (LLMs) at scale. Recently, the incentivization of reasoning capabilities in LLMs from RL indicates that $\textit{proper learning methods could enable effective inference-time scalability}$. A key challenge of RL is to obtain accurate reward signals for LLMs in various domains beyond verifiable questions or artificial rules. In this work, we investigate how to improve reward modeling (RM) with more inference compute for general queries, i.e. the $\textbf{inference-time scalability of generalist RM}$, and further, how to improve the effectiveness of performance-compute scaling with proper learning methods. For the RM approach, we adopt pointwise generative reward modeling (GRM) to enable flexibility for different input types and potential for inference-time scaling. For the learning method, we propose Self-Principled Critique Tuning (SPCT) to foster scalable reward generation behaviors in GRMs through online RL, to generate principles adaptively and critiques accurately, resulting in $\textbf{DeepSeek-GRM}$ models. Furthermore, for effective inference-time scaling, we use parallel sampling to expand compute usage, and introduce a meta RM to guide voting process for better scaling performance. Empirically, we show that SPCT significantly improves the quality and scalability of GRMs, outperforming existing methods and models in various RM benchmarks without severe biases, and could achieve better performance compared to training-time scaling. DeepSeek-GRM still meets challenges in some tasks, which we believe can be addressed by future efforts in generalist reward systems. The models are released at Hugging Face and ModelScope.

  Alignment is vital for safely deploying large language models (LLMs). Existing techniques are either reward-based (train a reward model on preference pairs and optimize with reinforcement learning) or reward-free (directly fine-tune on ranked outputs). Recent research shows that well-tuned reward-based pipelines remain robust, and single-response demonstrations can outperform pairwise preference data. However, two challenges persist: (1) imbalanced safety datasets that overrepresent common hazards while neglecting long-tail threats; and (2) static reward models that ignore task difficulty, limiting optimization efficiency and attainable gains. We propose DR-IRL (Dynamically adjusting Rewards through Inverse Reinforcement Learning). We first train category-specific reward models using a balanced safety dataset covering seven harmful categories via IRL. Then we enhance Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) by introducing dynamic reward scaling--adjusting rewards by task difficulty--data-level hardness by text encoder cosine similarity, model-level responsiveness by reward gaps. Extensive experiments across various benchmarks and LLMs demonstrate that DR-IRL outperforms all baseline methods in safety alignment while maintaining usefulness.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) may have an important role to play in mental health by facilitating the quantification of verbal expressions used to communicate emotions, feelings and thoughts. While there has been substantial and very promising work in this area, the fundamental limits are uncertain. Here, focusing on depressive symptoms, we outline and evaluate LLM performance on three critical tests. The first test evaluates LLM performance on a novel ground-truth dataset from a large human sample (n=770). This dataset is novel as it contains both standard clinically validated quantifications of depression symptoms and specific verbal descriptions of the thoughts related to each symptom by the same individual. The performance of LLMs on this richly informative data shows an upper bound on the performance in this domain, and allow us to examine the extent to which inference about symptoms generalises. Second, we test to what extent the latent structure in LLMs can capture the clinically observed patterns. We train supervised sparse auto-encoders (sSAE) to predict specific symptoms and symptom patterns within a syndrome. We find that sSAE weights can effectively modify the clinical pattern produced by the model, and thereby capture the latent structure of relevant clinical variation. Third, if LLMs correctly capture and quantify relevant mental states, then these states should respond to changes in emotional states induced by validated emotion induction interventions. We show that this holds in a third experiment with 190 participants. Overall, this work provides foundational insights into the quantification of pathological mental states with LLMs, highlighting hard limits on the requirements of the data underlying LLM-based quantification; but also suggesting LLMs show substantial conceptual alignment.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) have recently shown strong progress on scientific reasoning, yet two major bottlenecks remain. First, explicit retrieval fragments reasoning, imposing a hidden "tool tax" of extra tokens and steps. Second, multi-agent pipelines often dilute strong solutions by averaging across all candidates. We address these challenges with a unified framework that combines implicit retrieval and structured collaboration. At its foundation, a Monitor-based retrieval module operates at the token level, integrating external knowledge with minimal disruption to reasoning. On top of this substrate, Hierarchical Solution Refinement (HSR) iteratively designates each candidate as an anchor to be repaired by its peers, while Quality-Aware Iterative Reasoning (QAIR) adapts refinement to solution quality. On Humanity's Last Exam (HLE) Bio/Chem Gold, our framework achieves 48.3\% accuracy -- the highest reported to date, surpassing the strongest agent baseline by 13.4 points and leading frontier LLMs by up to 18.1 points, while simultaneously reducing token usage by 53.5\% and agent steps by 43.7\%. Results on SuperGPQA and TRQA confirm robustness across domains. Error analysis shows that reasoning failures and knowledge gaps co-occur in over 85\% of cases, while diversity analysis reveals a clear dichotomy: retrieval tasks benefit from solution variety, whereas reasoning tasks favor consensus. Together, these findings demonstrate how implicit augmentation and structured refinement overcome the inefficiencies of explicit tool use and uniform aggregation. Code is available at:this https URL.

  Federally funded research and development centers (FFRDCs) face text-heavy workloads, from policy documents to scientific and engineering papers, that are slow to analyze manually. We show how large language models can accelerate summarization, classification, extraction, and sense-making with only a few input-output examples. To enable use in sensitive government contexts, we apply OnPrem$.$LLM, an open-source framework for secure and flexible application of generative AI. Case studies on defense policy documents and scientific corpora, including the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) and National Science Foundation (NSF) Awards, demonstrate how this approach enhances oversight and strategic analysis while maintaining auditability and data sovereignty.

  Large language models (LLMs) can act as evaluators, a role studied by methods like LLM-as-a-Judge and fine-tuned judging LLMs. In the field of education, LLMs have been studied as assistant tools for students and teachers. Our research investigates LLM-driven automatic evaluation systems for academic Text-Input Problems using rubrics. We propose five evaluation systems that have been tested on a custom dataset of 110 answers about computer science from higher education students with three models: JudgeLM, Llama-3.1-8B and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B. The evaluation systems include: The JudgeLM evaluation, which uses the model's single answer prompt to obtain a score; Reference Aided Evaluation, which uses a correct answer as a guide aside from the original context of the question; No Reference Evaluation, which ommits the reference answer; Additive Evaluation, which uses atomic criteria; and Adaptive Evaluation, which is an evaluation done with generated criteria fitted to each question. All evaluation methods have been compared with the results of a human evaluator. Results show that the best method to automatically evaluate and score Text-Input Problems using LLMs is Reference Aided Evaluation. With the lowest median absolute deviation (0.945) and the lowest root mean square deviation (1.214) when compared to human evaluation, Reference Aided Evaluation offers fair scoring as well as insightful and complete evaluations. Other methods such as Additive and Adaptive Evaluation fail to provide good results in concise answers, No Reference Evaluation lacks information needed to correctly assess questions and JudgeLM Evaluations have not provided good results due to the model's limitations. As a result, we conclude that Artificial Intelligence-driven automatic evaluation systems, aided with proper methodologies, show potential to work as complementary tools to other academic resources.

  _Taehee Park, Heejin Do, Gary Geunbae Lee_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Robust supervised fine-tuned small Language Models (sLMs) often show high reliability but tend to undercorrect. They achieve high precision at the cost of low recall. Conversely, Large Language Models (LLMs) often show the opposite tendency, making excessive overcorrection, leading to low precision. To effectively harness the strengths of LLMs to address the recall challenges in sLMs, we propose Post-Correction via Overcorrection (PoCO), a novel approach that strategically balances recall and precision. PoCO first intentionally triggers overcorrection via LLM to maximize recall by allowing comprehensive revisions, then applies a targeted post-correction step via fine-tuning smaller models to identify and refine erroneous outputs. We aim to harmonize both aspects by leveraging the generative power of LLMs while preserving the reliability of smaller supervised models. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that PoCO effectively balances GEC performance by increasing recall with competitive precision, ultimately improving the overall quality of grammatical error correction.

  The fundamental units of internal representations in large language models (LLMs) remain undefined, limiting further understanding of their mechanisms. Neurons or features are often regarded as such units, yet neurons suffer from polysemy, while features face concerns of unreliable reconstruction and instability. To address this issue, we propose the Atoms Theory, which defines such units as atoms. We introduce the atomic inner product (AIP) to correct representation shifting, formally define atoms, and prove the conditions that atoms satisfy the Restricted Isometry Property (RIP), ensuring stable sparse representations over atom set and linking to compressed sensing. Under stronger conditions, we further establish the uniqueness and exact $\ell_1$ recoverability of the sparse representations, and provide guarantees that single-layer sparse autoencoders (SAEs) with threshold activations can reliably identify the atoms. To validate the Atoms Theory, we train threshold-activated SAEs on Gemma2-2B, Gemma2-9B, and Llama3.1-8B, achieving 99.9% sparse reconstruction across layers on average, and more than 99.8% of atoms satisfy the uniqueness condition, compared to 0.5% for neurons and 68.2% for features, showing that atoms more faithfully capture intrinsic representations of LLMs. Scaling experiments further reveal the link between SAEs size and recovery capacity. Overall, this work systematically introduces and validates Atoms Theory of LLMs, providing a theoretical framework for understanding internal representations and a foundation for mechanistic interpretability.

  Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive results in natural language understanding, yet their reasoning capabilities remain limited when operating as single agents. Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) has been proposed to address this limitation by enabling collaborative reasoning among multiple models in a round-table debate manner. While effective, MAD introduces substantial computational overhead due to the number of agents involved and the frequent communication required. In this paper, we propose MARS (Multi-Agent Review System), a role-based collaboration framework inspired by the review process. In MARS, an author agent generates an initial solution, reviewer agents provide decisions and comments independently, and a meta-reviewer integrates the feedback to make the final decision and guide further revision. This design enhances reasoning quality while avoiding costly reviewer-to-reviewer interactions, thereby controlling token consumption and inference time. We compared MARS with both MAD and other state-of-the-art reasoning strategies across multiple benchmarks. Extensive experiments with different LLMs show that MARS matches the accuracy of MAD while reducing both token usage and inference time by approximately 50\%. Code is available atthis https URL.

  Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been widely employed in Conversational Recommender Systems (CRSs). Unlike traditional language model approaches that focus on training, all existing LLMs-based approaches are mainly centered around how to leverage the summarization and analysis capabilities of LLMs while ignoring the issue of training. Therefore, in this work, we propose an integrated training-inference framework, User-Simulator-Based framework (USB-Rec), for improving the performance of LLMs in conversational recommendation at the model level. Firstly, we design a LLM-based Preference Optimization (PO) dataset construction strategy for RL training, which helps the LLMs understand the strategies and methods in conversational recommendation. Secondly, we propose a Self-Enhancement Strategy (SES) at the inference stage to further exploit the conversational recommendation potential obtained from RL training. Extensive experiments on various datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods.

  Emotional text-to-speech (E-TTS) is central to creating natural and trustworthy human-computer interaction. Existing systems typically rely on sentence-level control through predefined labels, reference audio, or natural language prompts. While effective for global emotion expression, these approaches fail to capture dynamic shifts within a sentence. To address this limitation, we introduce Emo-FiLM, a fine-grained emotion modeling framework for LLM-based TTS. Emo-FiLM aligns frame-level features from emotion2vec to words to obtain word-level emotion annotations, and maps them through a Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) layer, enabling word-level emotion control by directly modulating text embeddings. To support evaluation, we construct the Fine-grained Emotion Dynamics Dataset (FEDD) with detailed annotations of emotional transitions. Experiments show that Emo-FiLM outperforms existing approaches on both global and fine-grained tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness and generality for expressive speech synthesis.

  Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance across a wide range of natural language tasks. Understanding how LLMs internally represent knowledge remains a significant challenge. Despite Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a promising technique for extracting interpretable features from LLMs, SAE features do not inherently align with human-understandable concepts, making their interpretation cumbersome and labor-intensive. To bridge the gap between SAE features and human concepts, we present ConceptViz, a visual analytics system designed for exploring concepts in LLMs. ConceptViz implements a novel dentification => Interpretation => Validation pipeline, enabling users to query SAEs using concepts of interest, interactively explore concept-to-feature alignments, and validate the correspondences through model behavior verification. We demonstrate the effectiveness of ConceptViz through two usage scenarios and a user study. Our results show that ConceptViz enhances interpretability research by streamlining the discovery and validation of meaningful concept representations in LLMs, ultimately aiding researchers in building more accurate mental models of LLM features.

  The rapid adoption of large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT has blurred the line between human and AI-generated texts, raising urgent questions about academic integrity, intellectual property, and the spread of misinformation. Thus, reliable AI-text detection is needed for fair assessment to safeguard human authenticity and cultivate trust in digital communication. In this study, we investigate how well current machine learning (ML) approaches can distinguish ChatGPT-3.5-generated texts from human-written texts employing a labeled data set of 250 pairs of abstracts from a wide range of research topics. We test and compare both classical (Logistic Regression armed with classical Bag-of-Words, POS, and TF-IDF features) and transformer-based (BERT augmented with N-grams, DistilBERT, BERT with a lightweight custom classifier, and LSTM-based N-gram models) ML detection techniques. As we aim to assess each model's performance in detecting AI-generated research texts, we also aim to test whether an ensemble of these models can outperform any single detector. Results show DistilBERT achieves the overall best performance, while Logistic Regression and BERT-Custom offer solid, balanced alternatives; LSTM- and BERT-N-gram approaches lag. The max voting ensemble of the three best models fails to surpass DistilBERT itself, highlighting the primacy of a single transformer-based representation over mere model diversity. By comprehensively assessing the strengths and weaknesses of these AI-text detection approaches, this work lays a foundation for more robust transformer frameworks with larger, richer datasets to keep pace with ever-improving generative AI models.

As the major workhorse of computational science over the past decades, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) offers a uniquely challenging testbed for evaluating the scientific capabilities of LLMs. We introduce CFDLLMBench, a benchmark suite comprising three complementary components -- CFDQuery, CFDCodeBench, and FoamBench -- designed to holistically evaluate LLM performance across three key competencies: graduate-level CFD knowledge, numerical and physical reasoning of CFD, and context-dependent implementation of CFD workflows. Grounded in real-world CFD practices, our benchmark combines a detailed task taxonomy with a rigorous evaluation framework to deliver reproducible results and quantify LLM performance across code executability, solution accuracy, and numerical convergence behavior.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Implicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT) methods offer a token-efficient alternative to explicit CoT reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs), but a persistent performance gap has limited their adoption. We identify a core latent instability issue when scaling the computational budget of implicit CoT: as the number of reasoning tokens increases, training often becomes unstable and collapses. Our analysis shows that this instability arises from latent representations becoming homogeneous and losing semantic diversity, caused by insufficient step-level supervision in current implicit CoT methods. To address this, we propose SIM-CoT, a plug-and-play training module that introduces step-level supervision to stabilize and enrich the latent reasoning space. SIM-CoT employs an auxiliary decoder during training to align each implicit token with its corresponding explicit reasoning step, ensuring latent states capture distinct and meaningful information. The auxiliary decoder is removed at inference, preserving the efficiency of implicit CoT with no added overhead. It also provides interpretability by projecting each latent token onto an explicit reasoning vocabulary, enabling per-step visualization and diagnosis. SIM-CoT significantly improves both in-domain accuracy and out-of-domain stability of implicit CoT methods, boosting Coconut by +8.2\% on GPT-2 and CODI by +3.0\% on LLaMA-3.1 8B. It further surpasses the explicit CoT baseline on GPT-2 by 2.1\% with 2.3$\times$ greater token efficiency, while closing the performance gap on larger models like LLaMA-3.1 8B. Code:this https URL

  While recent studies explore Large Language Models' (LLMs) performance on Theory of Mind (ToM) reasoning tasks, research on ToM abilities that require more nuanced social context is limited, such as white lies. We introduce TactfulToM, a novel English benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs' ability to understand white lies within real-life conversations and reason about prosocial motivations behind them, particularly when they are used to spare others' feelings and maintain social harmony. Our benchmark is generated through a multi-stage human-in-the-loop pipeline where LLMs expand manually designed seed stories into conversations to maintain the information asymmetry between participants necessary for authentic white lies. We show that TactfulToM is challenging for state-of-the-art models, which perform substantially below humans, revealing shortcomings in their ability to fully comprehend the ToM reasoning that enables true understanding of white lies.

  Recent progress in Large Language Models (LLMs) has opened new avenues for solving complex optimization problems, including Neural Architecture Search (NAS). However, existing LLM-driven NAS approaches rely heavily on prompt engineering and domain-specific tuning, limiting their practicality and scalability across diverse tasks. In this work, we propose LM-Searcher, a novel framework that leverages LLMs for cross-domain neural architecture optimization without the need for extensive domain-specific adaptation. Central to our approach is NCode, a universal numerical string representation for neural architectures, which enables cross-domain architecture encoding and search. We also reformulate the NAS problem as a ranking task, training LLMs to select high-performing architectures from candidate pools using instruction-tuning samples derived from a novel pruning-based subspace sampling strategy. Our curated dataset, encompassing a wide range of architecture-performance pairs, encourages robust and transferable learning. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that LM-Searcher achieves competitive performance in both in-domain (e.g., CNNs for image classification) and out-of-domain (e.g., LoRA configurations for segmentation and generation) tasks, establishing a new paradigm for flexible and generalizable LLM-based architecture search.

  Current evaluation paradigms for large language models (LLMs) suffer from overestimated or biased evaluation and mismatched question difficulty, leading to incomplete evaluations of LLM's knowledge and capability boundaries, which hinder LLM's effective application and optimization. To address these challenges, we propose Agent-as-Interviewer, a dynamic evaluation paradigm that employs LLM agents to conduct multi-turn interactions for evaluation. Unlike current benchmarking or dynamic interaction paradigms, Agent-as-Interviewer utilizes agents to call knowledge tools for wider and deeper knowledge in the dynamic multi-turn question generation, achieving more complete evaluations of the LLM's knowledge boundaries. It also leverages agents to plan query strategies for adjustment of the question difficulty levels, enhancing the difficulty control to match the actual capabilities of target LLMs. Based on this paradigm, we develop JudgeAgent, a knowledge-wise dynamic evaluation framework that employs knowledge-driven synthesis as the agent's tool, and uses difficulty scoring as strategy guidance, thereby finally providing valuable suggestions to help targets optimize themselves. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of JudgeAgent's suggestions, demonstrating that Agent-as-Interviewer can accurately identify the knowledge and capability boundaries of target models.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Spoken Dialogue Models (SDMs) have recently attracted significant attention for their ability to generate voice responses directly to users' spoken queries. Despite their increasing popularity, there exists a gap in research focused on comprehensively understanding their practical effectiveness in comprehending and emulating human conversations. This is especially true compared to text-based Large Language Models (LLMs), which benefit from extensive benchmarking. Human voice interactions are inherently more complex than text due to characteristics unique to spoken dialogue. Ambiguity poses one challenge, stemming from semantic factors like polysemy, as well as phonological aspects such as heterograph, heteronyms, and stress patterns. Additionally, context-dependency, like omission, coreference, and multi-turn interaction, adds further complexity to human conversational dynamics. To illuminate the current state of SDM development and to address these challenges, we present a benchmark dataset in this paper, which comprises 1,079 instances in English and Chinese. Accompanied by an LLM-based evaluation method that closely aligns with human judgment, this dataset facilitates a comprehensive exploration of the performance of SDMs in tackling these practical challenges.

  _Yujin Han, Hao Chen, Andi Han, Zhiheng Wang, Xinyu Liu, Yingya Zhang, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Although unified MLLMs aim to unify generation and understanding, they are considered to exhibit an internal gap, with understanding outperforming generation. Through large-scale evaluation across multiple MLLMs and tasks, we confirm the widespread non-unification of MLLMs, and demonstrate that it indeed stems from weak generation rather than misunderstanding. This finding motivates us to propose a simple yet effective internal gap-based self-improvement framework, which mitigates internal gaps by leveraging stronger understanding to guide weaker generation without relying on any external signals. We validate this strategy through comprehensive experiments: scoring generations with understanding to construct image data for post-training (e.g., SFT and DPO) significantly improves generation while promoting unification. Furthermore, we empirically discover a co-improvement effect of such self-improvement, a phenomenon well known in pre-training but underexplored in post-training. Specifically, as generation improves, understanding becomes more effective at detecting false positives that were previously misclassified as prompt-aligned. To explain this effect, we extend learning dynamic theory to the MLLM setting, showing that the shared empirical neural tangent kernel between generation and understanding encourages aligned learning dynamics, thereby driving co-improvement. This interplay between generation and understanding further motivates a curriculum learning approach for stronger self-improvement: progressively enhanced understanding and generation revisit samples underutilized by pre-trained MLLMs, dynamically expanding post-training data and leading to improved performance and unification.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Current RLHF methods such as PPO and DPO typically reduce human preferences to binary labels, which are costly to obtain and too coarse to reflect individual variation. We observe that expressions of satisfaction and dissatisfaction follow stable linguistic patterns across users, indicating that more informative supervisory signals can be extracted from free-form feedback. Building on this insight, we introduce Adaptive Reward-Following (ARF), which converts natural feedback into continuous preference trajectories and optimizes them using the novel TraceBias algorithm. Across diverse LLMs and preference domains, ARF consistently outperforms PPO and DPO, improving alignment by up to 7.6%. Our results demonstrate that continuous reward modeling provides a scalable path toward personalized and theoretically grounded RLHF.

  Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a powerful learn-to-reason paradigm for Large Reasoning Models to tackle complex tasks. However, current RLVR paradigm is still not efficient enough, as it works in a trial-and-error manner. To perform better, the model needs to explore the reward space by numerously generating responses and learn from fragmented reward signals, blind to the overall reward patterns. Fortunately, verifiable rewards make the natural language description of the reward function possible, and meanwhile, LLMs have demonstrated strong in-context learning ability. This motivates us to explore if Large Reasoning Models can benefit from a motivation of the task, i.e., awareness of the reward function, during the reinforcement finetuning process, as we humans sometimes do when learning. In this paper, we introduce Motivation-enhanced Reinforcement Finetuning (MeRF), an intuitive yet effective method enhancing reinforcement finetuning of LLMs by involving ``telling LLMs rules of the game''. Specifically, MeRF directly injects the reward specification into the prompt, which serves as an in-context motivation for the model to be aware of the optimization objective. This simple modification leverages the in-context learning ability of LLMs, aligning generation with optimization, thereby incentivizing the model to generate desired outputs from both inner motivation and external reward. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that MeRF achieves substantial performance gains over RLVR baseline. Moreover, ablation studies show that MeRF performs better with greater consistency between the in-context motivation and the external reward function, while the model also demonstrates an ability to adapt to misleading motivations through reinforcement finetuning.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Retrieval systems are central to many NLP pipelines, but often rely on surface-level cues such as keyword overlap and lexical semantic similarity. To evaluate retrieval beyond these shallow signals, recent benchmarks introduce reasoning-heavy queries; however, they primarily shift the burden to query-side processing techniques -- like prompting or multi-hop retrieval -- that can help resolve complexity. In contrast, we present Impliret, a benchmark that shifts the reasoning challenge to document-side processing: The queries are simple, but relevance depends on facts stated implicitly in documents through temporal (e.g., resolving "two days ago"), arithmetic, and world knowledge relationships. We evaluate a range of sparse and dense retrievers, all of which struggle in this setting: the best nDCG@10 is only 14.91%. We also test whether long-context models can overcome this limitation. But even with a short context of only thirty documents, including the positive document, GPT-o4-mini scores only 55.54%, showing that document-side reasoning remains a challenge.

  Large reasoning models such as OpenAI o1 and DeepSeek-R1 have achieved remarkable performance in the domain of reasoning. A key component of their training is the incorporation of verifiable rewards within reinforcement learning (RL). However, existing reward benchmarks do not evaluate reference-based reward systems, leaving researchers with limited understanding of the accuracy of verifiers used in RL. In this paper, we introduce two benchmarks, VerifyBench and VerifyBench-Hard, designed to assess the performance of reference-based reward systems. These benchmarks are constructed through meticulous data collection and curation, followed by careful human annotation to ensure high quality. Current models still show considerable room for improvement on both VerifyBench and VerifyBench-Hard, especially smaller-scale models. Furthermore, we conduct a thorough and comprehensive analysis of evaluation results, offering insights for understanding and developing reference-based reward systems. Our proposed benchmarks serve as effective tools for guiding the development of verifier accuracy and the reasoning capabilities of models trained via RL in reasoning tasks.

  When reading, we often have specific information that interests us in a text. For example, you might be reading this paper because you are curious about LLMs for eye movements in reading, the experimental design, or perhaps you wonder ``This sounds like science fiction. Does it actually work?''. More broadly, in daily life, people approach texts with any number of text-specific goals that guide their reading behavior. In this work, we ask, for the first time, whether open-ended reading goals can be automatically decoded solely from eye movements in reading. To address this question, we introduce goal decoding tasks and evaluation frameworks using large-scale eye tracking for reading data in English with hundreds of text-specific information seeking tasks. We develop and compare several discriminative and generative multimodal text and eye movements LLMs for these tasks. Our experiments show considerable success on the task of selecting the correct goal among several options, and even progress towards free-form textual reconstruction of the precise goal formulation. These results open the door for further scientific investigation of goal driven reading, as well as the development of educational and assistive technologies that will rely on real-time decoding of reader goals from their eye movements.

  Large language models (LLMs) have transformed sentiment analysis, yet balancing accuracy, efficiency, and explainability remains a critical challenge. This study presents the first comprehensive evaluation of DeepSeek-R1--an open-source reasoning model--against OpenAI's GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini. We test the full 671B model and its distilled variants, systematically documenting few-shot learning curves. Our experiments show DeepSeek-R1 achieves a 91.39\% F1 score on 5-class sentiment and 99.31\% accuracy on binary tasks with just 5 shots, an eightfold improvement in few-shot efficiency over GPT-4o. Architecture-specific distillation effects emerge, where a 32B Qwen2.5-based model outperforms the 70B Llama-based variant by 6.69 percentage points. While its reasoning process reduces throughput, DeepSeek-R1 offers superior explainability via transparent, step-by-step traces, establishing it as a powerful, interpretable open-source alternative.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper defines and explores the design space for information extraction (IE) from layout-rich documents using large language models (LLMs). The three core challenges of layout-aware IE with LLMs are 1) data structuring, 2) model engagement, and 3) output refinement. Our study investigates the sub-problems and methods within these core challenges, such as input representation, chunking, prompting, selection of LLMs, and multimodal models. It examines the effect of different design choices through LayIE-LLM, a new, open-source, layout-aware IE test suite, benchmarking against traditional, fine-tuned IE models. The results on two IE datasets show that LLMs require adjustment of the IE pipeline to achieve competitive performance: the optimized configuration found with LayIE-LLM achieves 13.3--37.5 F1 points more than a general-practice baseline configuration using the same LLM. To find a well-working configuration, we develop a one-factor-at-a-time (OFAT) method that achieves near-optimal results. Our method is only 0.8--1.8 points lower than the best full factorial exploration with a fraction (2.8%) of the required computation. Overall, we demonstrate that, if well-configured, general-purpose LLMs match the performance of specialized models, providing a cost-effective, finetuning-free alternative.

  In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been widely applied to legal tasks. To enhance their understanding of legal texts and improve reasoning accuracy, a promising approach is to incorporate legal theories. One of the most widely adopted theories is the Four-Element Theory (FET), which defines the crime constitution through four elements: Subject, Object, Subjective Aspect, and Objective Aspect. While recent work has explored prompting LLMs to follow FET, our evaluation demonstrates that LLM-generated four-elements are often incomplete and less representative, limiting their effectiveness in legal reasoning. To address these issues, we present JUREX-4E, an expert-annotated four-element knowledge base covering 155 criminal charges. The annotations follow a progressive hierarchical framework grounded in legal source validity and incorporate diverse interpretive methods to ensure precision and authority. We evaluate JUREX-4E on the Similar Charge Disambiguation task and apply it to Legal Case Retrieval. Experimental results validate the high quality of JUREX-4E and its substantial impact on downstream legal tasks, underscoring its potential for advancing legal AI applications.

  The ability of large language models (LLMs) to validate their output and identify potential errors is crucial for ensuring robustness and reliability. However, current research indicates that LLMs struggle with self-correction, encountering significant challenges in detecting errors. While studies have explored methods to enhance self-correction in LLMs, relatively little attention has been given to understanding the models' internal mechanisms underlying error detection. In this paper, we present a mechanistic analysis of error detection in LLMs, focusing on simple arithmetic problems. Through circuit analysis, we identify the computational subgraphs responsible for detecting arithmetic errors across four smaller-sized LLMs. Our findings reveal that all models heavily rely on $\textit{consistency heads}$--attention heads that assess surface-level alignment of numerical values in arithmetic solutions. Moreover, we observe that the models' internal arithmetic computation primarily occurs in higher layers, whereas validation takes place in middle layers, before the final arithmetic results are fully encoded. This structural dissociation between arithmetic computation and validation seems to explain why smaller-sized LLMs struggle to detect even simple arithmetic errors.

  Mathematical reasoning represents a critical frontier in advancing large language models (LLMs). While step-by-step approaches have emerged as the dominant paradigm for mathematical problem-solving in LLMs, the quality of reasoning steps in training data fundamentally constrains the performance of the models. Recent studies has demonstrated that more detailed intermediate steps can enhance model performance, yet existing methods for step expansion either require more powerful external models or incur substantial computational costs. In this paper, we introduce MathFimer, a novel framework for mathematical reasoning step expansion inspired by the "Fill-in-the-middle" task from code completion. By decomposing solution chains into prefix-suffix pairs and training models to reconstruct missing intermediate steps, we develop a specialized model, MathFimer-7B, on our carefully curated NuminaMath-FIM dataset. We then apply these models to enhance existing mathematical reasoning datasets by inserting detailed intermediate steps into their solution chains, creating MathFimer-expanded versions. Through comprehensive experiments on multiple mathematical reasoning datasets, including MathInstruct, MetaMathQA and etc., we demonstrate that models trained on MathFimer-expanded data consistently outperform their counterparts trained on original data across various benchmarks such as GSM8K and MATH. Our approach offers a practical, scalable solution for enhancing mathematical reasoning capabilities in LLMs without relying on powerful external models or expensive inference procedures.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) often exhibit sycophantic behaviors -- such as excessive agreement with or flattery of the user -- but it is unclear whether these behaviors arise from a single mechanism or multiple distinct processes. We decompose sycophancy into sycophantic agreement and sycophantic praise, contrasting both with genuine agreement. Using difference-in-means directions, activation additions, and subspace geometry across multiple models and datasets, we show that: (1) the three behaviors are encoded along distinct linear directions in latent space; (2) each behavior can be independently amplified or suppressed without affecting the others; and (3) their representational structure is consistent across model families and scales. These results suggest that sycophantic behaviors correspond to distinct, independently steerable representations.

  Developing AI systems that operate effectively across languages while remaining culturally grounded is a long-standing challenge, particularly in low-resource settings. Synthetic data provides a promising avenue, yet its effectiveness in multilingual and multicultural contexts remains underexplored. We investigate the creation and impact of synthetic, culturally contextualized datasets for Indian languages through a bottom-up generation strategy that prompts large open-source LLMs (>= 235B parameters) to ground data generation in language-specific Wikipedia content. This approach complements the dominant top-down paradigm of translating synthetic datasets from high-resource languages such as English. We introduce Updesh, a high-quality large-scale synthetic instruction-following dataset comprising 9.5M data points across 13 Indian languages, encompassing diverse reasoning and generative tasks with an emphasis on long-context, multi-turn capabilities, and alignment with Indian cultural contexts. A comprehensive evaluation incorporating both automated metrics and human annotation across 10k assessments indicates that generated data is high quality; though, human evaluation highlights areas for further improvement. Additionally, we perform downstream evaluations by fine-tuning models on our dataset and assessing the performance across 15 diverse multilingual datasets. Models trained on Updesh consistently achieve significant gains on generative tasks and remain competitive on multiple-choice style NLU tasks. Notably, relative improvements are most pronounced in low and medium-resource languages, narrowing their gap with high-resource languages. These findings provide empirical evidence that effective multilingual AI requires multi-faceted data curation and generation strategies that incorporate context-aware, culturally grounded methodologies.

  The widespread use of human-like text from Large Language Models (LLMs) necessitates the development of robust detection systems. However, progress is limited by a critical lack of suitable training data; existing datasets are often generated with outdated models, are predominantly in English, and fail to address the increasingly common scenario of mixed human-AI authorship. Crucially, while some datasets address mixed authorship, none provide the character-level annotations required for the precise localization of AI-generated segments within a text. To address these gaps, we introduce LLMTrace, a new large-scale, bilingual (English and Russian) corpus for AI-generated text detection. Constructed using a diverse range of modern proprietary and open-source LLMs, our dataset is designed to support two key tasks: traditional full-text binary classification (human vs. AI) and the novel task of AI-generated interval detection, facilitated by character-level annotations. We believe LLMTrace will serve as a vital resource for training and evaluating the next generation of more nuanced and practical AI detection models.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Homonyms are words with identical spelling but distinct meanings, which pose challenges for many generative models. When a homonym appears in a prompt, diffusion models may generate multiple senses of the word simultaneously, which is known as homonym duplication. This issue is further complicated by an Anglocentric bias, which includes an additional translation step before the text-to-image model pipeline. As a result, even words that are not homonymous in the original language may become homonyms and lose their meaning after translation into English. In this paper, we introduce a method for measuring duplication rates and conduct evaluations of different diffusion models using both automatic evaluation utilizing Vision-Language Models (VLM) and human evaluation. Additionally, we investigate methods to mitigate the homonym duplication problem through prompt expansion, demonstrating that this approach also effectively reduces duplication related to Anglocentric bias. The code for the automatic evaluation pipeline is publicly available.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly tasked with analyzing legal texts and citing relevant statutes, yet their reliability is often compromised by general pre-training that ingests legal texts without specialized focus, obscuring the true depth of their legal knowledge. This paper introduces CLaw, a novel benchmark specifically engineered to meticulously evaluate LLMs on Chinese legal knowledge and its application in reasoning. CLaw comprises two key components: (1) a comprehensive, fine-grained corpus of all 306 Chinese national statutes, segmented to the subparagraph level and incorporating precise historical revision timesteps for rigorous recall evaluation (64,849 entries), and (2) a challenging set of 254 case-based reasoning instances derived from China Supreme Court curated materials to assess the practical application of legal knowledge. Our empirical evaluation reveals that most contemporary LLMs significantly struggle to faithfully reproduce legal provisions. As accurate retrieval and citation of legal provisions form the basis of legal reasoning, this deficiency critically undermines the reliability of their responses. We contend that achieving trustworthy legal reasoning in LLMs requires a robust synergy of accurate knowledge retrieval--potentially enhanced through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)--and strong general reasoning capabilities. This work provides an essential benchmark and critical insights for advancing domain-specific LLM reasoning, particularly within the complex legal sphere.

  Small language models (SLMs) become unprecedentedly appealing due to their approximately equivalent performance compared to large language models (LLMs) in certain fields with less energy and time consumption during training and inference. However, the personally identifiable information (PII) leakage of SLMs for downstream tasks has yet to be explored. In this study, we investigate the PII leakage of the chatbot based on SLM. We first finetune a new chatbot, i.e., ChatBioGPT based on the backbone of BioGPT using medical datasets Alpaca and HealthCareMagic. It shows a matchable performance in BERTscore compared with previous studies of ChatDoctor and ChatGPT. Based on this model, we prove that the previous template-based PII attacking methods cannot effectively extract the PII in the dataset for leakage detection under the SLM condition. We then propose GEP, which is a greedy coordinate gradient-based (GCG) method specifically designed for PII extraction. We conduct experimental studies of GEP and the results show an increment of up to 60$\times$ more leakage compared with the previous template-based methods. We further expand the capability of GEP in the case of a more complicated and realistic situation by conducting free-style insertion where the inserted PII in the dataset is in the form of various syntactic expressions instead of fixed templates, and GEP is still able to reveal a PII leakage rate of up to 4.53%.

  The creation and perception of humour is a fundamental human trait, positioning its computational understanding as one of the most challenging tasks in natural language processing (NLP). As an abstract, creative, and frequently context-dependent construct, humour requires extensive reasoning to understand and create, making it a pertinent task for assessing the common-sense knowledge and reasoning abilities of modern large language models (LLMs). In this work, we survey the landscape of computational humour as it pertains to the generative tasks of creation and explanation. We observe that, despite the task of understanding humour bearing all the hallmarks of a foundational NLP task, work on generating and explaining humour beyond puns remains sparse, while state-of-the-art models continue to fall short of human capabilities. We bookend our literature survey by motivating the importance of computational humour processing as a subdiscipline of NLP and presenting an extensive discussion of future directions for research in the area that takes into account the subjective and ethically ambiguous nature of humour.

  For an LLM to correctly respond to an instruction it must understand both the semantics and the domain (i.e., subject area) of a given task-instruction pair. However, syntax can also convey implicit information Recent work shows that syntactic templates--frequent sequences of Part-of-Speech (PoS) tags--are prevalent in training data and often appear in model outputs. In this work we characterize syntactic templates, domain, and semantics in task-instruction pairs. We identify cases of spurious correlations between syntax and domain, where models learn to associate a domain with syntax during training; this can sometimes override prompt semantics. Using a synthetic training dataset, we find that the syntactic-domain correlation can lower performance (mean 0.51 +/- 0.06) on entity knowledge tasks in OLMo-2 models (1B-13B). We introduce an evaluation framework to detect this phenomenon in trained models, and show that it occurs on a subset of the FlanV2 dataset in open (OLMo-2-7B; Llama-4-Maverick), and closed (GPT-4o) models. Finally, we present a case study on the implications for safety finetuning, showing that unintended syntactic-domain correlations can be used to bypass refusals in OLMo-2-7B Instruct and GPT-4o. Our findings highlight two needs: (1) to explicitly test for syntactic-domain correlations, and (2) to ensure syntactic diversity in training data, specifically within domains, to prevent such spurious correlations.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Speech-aware Language Models (SpeechLMs) have fundamentally transformed human-AI interaction by enabling voice-based communication, yet they may exhibit acoustic-based gender differentiation where identical questions lead to different responses based on the speaker's gender. This paper propose a new dataset that enables systematic analysis of this phenomenon, containing 9,208 speech samples across three categories: Gender-Independent, Gender-Stereotypical, and Gender-Dependent. We further evaluated LLaMA-Omni series and discovered a paradoxical pattern; while overall responses seems identical regardless of gender, the pattern is far from unbiased responses. Specifically, in Gender-Stereotypical questions, all models consistently exhibited male-oriented responses; meanwhile, in Gender-Dependent questions where gender differentiation would be contextually appropriate, models exhibited responses independent to gender instead. We also confirm that this pattern does not result from neutral options nor perceived gender of a voice. When we allow neutral response, models tends to respond neutrally also in Gender-Dependent questions. The paradoxical pattern yet retains when we applied gender neutralization methods on speech. Through comparison between SpeechLMs with corresponding backbone LLMs, we confirmed that these paradoxical patterns primarily stem from Whisper speech encoders, which generates male-oriented acoustic tokens. These findings reveal that current SpeechLMs may not successfully remove gender biases though they prioritized general fairness principles over contextual appropriateness, highlighting the need for more sophisticated techniques to utilize gender information properly in speech technology.

  Hallucination is a persistent issue affecting all large language Models (LLMs), particularly within low-resource languages such as Persian. PerHalluEval (Persian Hallucination Evaluation) is the first dynamic hallucination evaluation benchmark tailored for the Persian language. Our benchmark leverages a three-stage LLM-driven pipeline, augmented with human validation, to generate plausible answers and summaries regarding QA and summarization tasks, focusing on detecting extrinsic and intrinsic hallucinations. Moreover, we used the log probabilities of generated tokens to select the most believable hallucinated instances. In addition, we engaged human annotators to highlight Persian-specific contexts in the QA dataset in order to evaluate LLMs' performance on content specifically related to Persian culture. Our evaluation of 12 LLMs, including open- and closed-source models using PerHalluEval, revealed that the models generally struggle in detecting hallucinated Persian text. We showed that providing external knowledge, i.e., the original document for the summarization task, could mitigate hallucination partially. Furthermore, there was no significant difference in terms of hallucination when comparing LLMs specifically trained for Persian with others.

The dataset, which contains 1,065 annotated SoM problems, mirrors real-world engineering tasks by including both textual problem statements and schematic diagrams. Due to the limited capabilities of current foundation models in understanding complicated visual information, we propose a novel prompting strategy called Descriptions of Images (DoI), which provides rigorous expert-generated text descriptions of the visual diagrams as the context. We evaluate eight representative foundation models, including both large language models (LLMs) and vision language models (VLMs). Our results show that current foundation models struggle significantly with these engineering problems, with the best-performing model achieving only 56.6% accuracy. Interestingly, we found that LLMs, when provided with DoI, often outperform VLMs provided with visual diagrams. A detailed error analysis reveals that DoI plays a crucial role in mitigating visual misinterpretation errors, suggesting that accurate text-based descriptions can be more effective than direct image input for current foundation models. This work establishes a rigorous benchmark for engineering AI and highlights a critical need for developing more robust multimodal reasoning capabilities in foundation models, particularly in scientific and engineering contexts.

  As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to real-world scenarios, it becomes crucial to understand their ability to follow multiple instructions simultaneously. To systematically evaluate these capabilities, we introduce two specialized benchmarks for fundamental domains where multiple instructions following is important: Many Instruction-Following Eval (ManyIFEval) for text generation with up to ten instructions, and Style-aware Mostly Basic Programming Problems (StyleMBPP) for code generation with up to six instructions. Our experiments with the created benchmarks across ten LLMs reveal that performance consistently degrades as the number of instructions increases. Furthermore, given the fact that evaluating all the possible combinations of multiple instructions is computationally impractical in actual use cases, we developed three types of regression models that can estimate performance on both unseen instruction combinations and different numbers of instructions which are not used during training. We demonstrate that a logistic regression model using instruction count as an explanatory variable can predict performance of following multiple instructions with approximately 10% error, even for unseen instruction combinations. We show that relatively modest sample sizes (500 for ManyIFEval and 300 for StyleMBPP) are sufficient for performance estimation, enabling efficient evaluation of LLMs under various instruction combinations.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Tool calling is a critical capability that allows Large Language Models (LLMs) to interact with external systems, significantly expanding their utility. However, research and resources for tool calling are predominantly English-centric, leaving a gap in our understanding of how to enable this functionality for other languages, such as Arabic. This paper investigates three key research questions: (1) the necessity of in-language (Arabic) tool-calling data versus relying on cross-lingual transfer, (2) the effect of general-purpose instruction tuning on tool-calling performance, and (3) the value of fine-tuning on specific, high-priority tools. To address these questions, we conduct extensive experiments using base and post-trained variants of an open-weight Arabic LLM. To enable this study, we bridge the resource gap by translating and adapting two open-source tool-calling datasets into Arabic. Our findings provide crucial insights into the optimal strategies for developing robust tool-augmented agents for Arabic.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) are commonly evaluated on challenging benchmarks such as AIME and Math500, which are susceptible to contamination and risk of being memorized. Existing detection methods, which primarily rely on surface-level lexical overlap and perplexity, demonstrate low generalization and degrade significantly when encountering implicitly contaminated data. In this paper, we propose MemLens (An Activation Lens for Memorization Detection) to detect memorization by analyzing the probability trajectories of numeric tokens during generation. Our method reveals that contaminated samples exhibit ``shortcut'' behaviors, locking onto an answer with high confidence in the model's early layers, whereas clean samples show more gradual evidence accumulation across the model's full depth. We observe that contaminated and clean samples exhibit distinct and well-separated reasoning trajectories. To further validate this, we inject carefully designed samples into the model through LoRA fine-tuning and observe the same trajectory patterns as in naturally contaminated data. These results provide strong evidence that MemLens captures genuine signals of memorization rather than spurious correlations.

  _Weixuan Wang, Minghao Wu, Barry Haddow, Alexandra Birch_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Long document summarization remains a significant challenge for current large language models (LLMs), as existing approaches commonly struggle with information loss, factual inconsistencies, and coherence issues when processing excessively long documents. We propose SummQ, a novel adversarial multi-agent framework that addresses these limitations through collaborative intelligence between specialized agents operating in two complementary domains: summarization and quizzing. Our approach employs summary generators and reviewers that work collaboratively to create and evaluate comprehensive summaries, while quiz generators and reviewers create comprehension questions that serve as continuous quality checks for the summarization process. This adversarial dynamic, enhanced by an examinee agent that validates whether the generated summary contains the information needed to answer the quiz questions, enables iterative refinement through multifaceted feedback mechanisms. We evaluate SummQ on three widely used long document summarization benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods across ROUGE and BERTScore metrics, as well as in LLM-as-a-Judge and human evaluations. Our comprehensive analyses reveal the effectiveness of the multi-agent collaboration dynamics, the influence of different agent configurations, and the impact of the quizzing mechanism. This work establishes a new approach for long document summarization that uses adversarial agentic collaboration to improve summarization quality.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Diffusion models have recently shown strong potential in language modeling, offering faster generation compared to traditional autoregressive approaches. However, applying supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to diffusion models remains challenging, as they lack precise probability estimates at each denoising step. While the diffusion mechanism enables the model to reason over entire sequences, it also makes the generation process less predictable and often inconsistent. This highlights the importance of controlling key tokens that guide the direction of generation. To address this issue, we propose WeFT, a weighted SFT method for diffusion language models, where tokens are assigned different weights based on their entropy. Derived from diffusion theory, WeFT delivers substantial gains: training on s1K, s1K-1.1, and 3k samples from open-r1, it achieves relative improvements of 39%, 64%, and 83% over standard SFT on four widely used reasoning benchmarks (Sudoku, Countdown, GSM8K, and MATH-500). The code and models will be made publicly available.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) question answering systems, generating citations for large language model (LLM) outputs enhances verifiability and helps users identify potential hallucinations. However, we observe two problems in the citations produced by existing attribution methods. First, the citations are typically provided at the sentence or even paragraph level. Long sentences or paragraphs may include a substantial amount of irrelevant content. Second, sentence-level citations may omit information that is essential for verifying the output, forcing users to read the surrounding context. In this paper, we propose generating sub-sentence citations that are both concise and sufficient, thereby reducing the effort required by users to confirm the correctness of the generated output. To this end, we first develop annotation guidelines for such citations and construct a corresponding dataset. Then, we propose an attribution framework for generating citations that adhere to our standards. This framework leverages LLMs to automatically generate fine-tuning data for our task and employs a credit model to filter out low-quality examples. Our experiments on the constructed dataset demonstrate that the propose approach can generate high-quality and more readable citations.

  The increasing adoption of large language models (LLMs) in cloud-based services has raised significant privacy concerns, as user inputs may inadvertently expose sensitive information. Existing text anonymization and de-identification techniques, such as rule-based redaction and scrubbing, often struggle to balance privacy preservation with text naturalness and utility. In this work, we propose a zero-shot, tree-search-based iterative sentence rewriting algorithm that systematically obfuscates or deletes private information while preserving coherence, relevance, and naturalness. Our method incrementally rewrites privacy-sensitive segments through a structured search guided by a reward model, enabling dynamic exploration of the rewriting space. Experiments on privacy-sensitive datasets show that our approach significantly outperforms existing baselines, achieving a superior balance between privacy protection and utility preservation.

  Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) enable effective in-context learning (ICL) with many-shot examples, but at the cost of high computational demand due to longer input tokens. To address this, we propose cheat-sheet ICL, which distills the information from many-shot ICL into a concise textual summary (cheat sheet) used as the context at inference time. Experiments on challenging reasoning tasks show that cheat-sheet ICL achieves comparable or better performance than many-shot ICL with far fewer tokens, and matches retrieval-based ICL without requiring test-time retrieval. These findings demonstrate that cheat-sheet ICL is a practical alternative for leveraging LLMs in downstream tasks.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong reasoning capabilities in complex tasks. However, they still struggle with hallucinations and factual errors in knowledge-intensive scenarios like knowledge graph question answering (KGQA). We attribute this to the semantic gap between structured knowledge graphs (KGs) and unstructured queries, caused by inherent differences in their focuses and structures. Existing methods usually employ resource-intensive, non-scalable workflows reasoning on vanilla KGs, but overlook this gap. To address this challenge, we propose a flexible framework, Enrich-on-Graph (EoG), which leverages LLMs' prior knowledge to enrich KGs, bridge the semantic gap between graphs and queries. EoG enables efficient evidence extraction from KGs for precise and robust reasoning, while ensuring low computational costs, scalability, and adaptability across different methods. Furthermore, we propose three graph quality evaluation metrics to analyze query-graph alignment in KGQA task, supported by theoretical validation of our optimization objectives. Extensive experiments on two KGQA benchmark datasets indicate that EoG can effectively generate high-quality KGs and achieve the state-of-the-art performance. Our code and data are available atthis https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on domain-specific datasets is a common approach to adapt Large Language Models (LLMs) to specialized tasks but is often believed to degrade their general capabilities. In this work, we revisit this trade-off and present both empirical and theoretical insights. First, we show that SFT does not always hurt: using a smaller learning rate can substantially mitigate general performance degradation while preserving comparable target-domain performance. We then provide a theoretical analysis that explains these phenomena and further motivates a new method, Token-Adaptive Loss Reweighting (TALR). Building on this, and recognizing that smaller learning rates alone do not fully eliminate general-performance degradation in all cases, we evaluate a range of strategies for reducing general capability loss, including L2 regularization, LoRA, model averaging, FLOW, and our proposed TALR. Experimental results demonstrate that while no method completely eliminates the trade-off, TALR consistently outperforms these baselines in balancing domain-specific gains and general capabilities. Finally, we distill our findings into practical guidelines for adapting LLMs to new domains: (i) using a small learning rate to achieve a favorable trade-off, and (ii) when a stronger balance is further desired, adopt TALR as an effective strategy.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Adversarial text attack research plays a crucial role in evaluating the robustness of NLP models. However, the increasing complexity of transformer-based architectures has dramatically raised the computational cost of attack testing, especially for researchers with limited resources (e.g., GPUs). Existing popular black-box attack methods often require a large number of queries, which can make them inefficient and impractical for researchers. To address these challenges, we propose two new attack selection strategies called Hybrid and Dynamic Select, which better combine the strengths of previous selection algorithms. Hybrid Select merges generalized BinarySelect techniques with GreedySelect by introducing a size threshold to decide which selection algorithm to use. Dynamic Select provides an alternative approach of combining the generalized Binary and GreedySelect by learning which lengths of texts each selection method should be applied to. This greatly reduces the number of queries needed while maintaining attack effectiveness (a limitation of BinarySelect). Across 4 datasets and 6 target models, our best method(sentence-level Hybrid Select) is able to reduce the number of required queries per attack up 25.82\% on average against both encoder models and LLMs, without losing the effectiveness of the attack.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Predicting molecular properties is a critical component of drug discovery. Recent advances in deep learning, particularly Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), have enabled end-to-end learning from molecular structures, reducing reliance on manual feature engineering. However, while GNNs and self-supervised learning approaches have advanced molecular property prediction (MPP), the integration of human prior knowledge remains indispensable, as evidenced by recent methods that leverage large language models (LLMs) for knowledge extraction. Despite their strengths, LLMs are constrained by knowledge gaps and hallucinations, particularly for less-studied molecular properties. In this work, we propose a novel framework that, for the first time, integrates knowledge extracted from LLMs with structural features derived from pre-trained molecular models to enhance MPP. Our approach prompts LLMs to generate both domain-relevant knowledge and executable code for molecular vectorization, producing knowledge-based features that are subsequently fused with structural representations. We employ three state-of-the-art LLMs, GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, and DeepSeek-R1, for knowledge extraction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our integrated method outperforms existing approaches, confirming that the combination of LLM-derived knowledge and structural information provides a robust and effective solution for MPP.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have attracted significant interest in extending their capabilities to multimodal scenarios, particularly for speech-to-speech conversational systems. However, existing multimodal models handling interleaved audio and text rely on autoregressive methods, overlooking that text depends on target-target relations whereas audio depends mainly on source-target relations. In this work, we propose Text-to-Talk (TtT), a unified audio-text framework that integrates autoregressive (AR) text generation with non-autoregressive (NAR) audio diffusion in a single Transformer. By leveraging the any-order autoregressive property of absorbing discrete diffusion, our approach provides a unified training objective for text and audio. To support this hybrid generation paradigm, we design a modality-aware attention mechanism that enforces causal decoding for text while allowing bidirectional modeling within audio spans, and further introduce three training strategies that reduce train-test discrepancies. During inference, TtT employs block-wise diffusion to synthesize audio in parallel while flexibly handling variable-length outputs. Extensive experiments across Audio-QA and ASR tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, with detailed ablation studies validating each proposed component. We will open-source our models, data and code to facilitate future research in this direction.

  Cutting-edge Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques keep reshaping our view of the world. For example, Large Language Models (LLMs) based applications such as ChatGPT have shown the capability of generating human-like conversation on extensive topics. Due to the impressive performance on a variety of language-related tasks (e.g., open-domain question answering, translation, and document summarization), one can envision the far-reaching impacts that can be brought by the LLMs with broader real-world applications (e.g., customer service, education and accessibility, and scientific discovery). Inspired by their success, this paper will offer an overview of state-of-the-art LLMs and their integration into a wide range of academic disciplines, including: (1) arts, letters, and law (e.g., history, philosophy, political science, arts and architecture, law), (2) economics and business (e.g., finance, economics, accounting, marketing), and (3) science and engineering (e.g., mathematics, physics and mechanical engineering, chemistry and chemical engineering, life sciences and bioengineering, earth sciences and civil engineering, computer science and electrical engineering). Integrating humanity and technology, in this paper, we will explore how LLMs are shaping research and practice in these fields, while also discussing key limitations, open challenges, and future directions in the era of generative AI. The review of how LLMs are engaged across disciplines-along with key observations and insights-can help researchers and practitioners interested in exploiting LLMs to advance their works in diverse real-world applications.

  Modern large language models (LLMs) extend context lengths to up to millions of tokens, enabling AI assistants to generate coherent and personalized responses grounded in long conversational histories. This ability, however, hinges on Key-Value (KV) caching, whose memory grows linearly with dialogue length and quickly becomes the bottleneck in resource-constrained environments. An active line of research for reducing memory bottleneck is KV cache compression, which seeks to limit cache size while preserving accuracy. Yet existing methods face two major limitations: (i) evicting the KV cache after full-context prefill causes unbounded peak memory, and (ii) query-dependent eviction narrows the cache to a single query, leading to failure cases in multi-turn conversations. We introduce EpiCache, a training-free KV cache management framework for long conversational question answering (LongConvQA) under fixed memory budgets. EpiCache bounds cache growth through block-wise prefill and preserves topic-relevant context via episodic KV compression, which clusters conversation history into coherent episodes and applies episode-specific KV cache eviction. We further design an adaptive layer-wise budget allocation strategy that measures each layer's sensitivity to eviction and distributes the memory budget across layers accordingly. Across three LongConvQA benchmarks, EpiCache improves accuracy by up to 40% over recent baselines, sustains near-full KV accuracy under 4-6x compression, and reduces latency and memory by up to 2.4x and 3.5x, thereby enabling efficient multi-turn interaction under strict resource constraints.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Physical commonsense reasoning datasets like PIQA are predominantly English-centric and lack cultural diversity. We introduce Ko-PIQA, a Korean physical commonsense reasoning dataset that incorporates cultural context. Starting from 3.01 million web-crawled questions, we employed a multi-stage filtering approach using three language models to identify 11,553 PIQA-style questions. Through GPT-4o refinement and human validation, we obtained 441 high-quality question-answer pairs. A key feature of Ko-PIQA is its cultural grounding: 19.7\% of questions contain culturally specific elements like traditional Korean foods (kimchi), clothing (hanbok), and specialized appliances (kimchi refrigerators) that require culturally-aware reasoning beyond direct translation. We evaluate seven language models on Ko-PIQA, with the best model achieving 83.22\% accuracy while the weakest reaches only 59.86\%, demonstrating significant room for improvement. Models particularly struggle with culturally specific scenarios, highlighting the importance of culturally diverse datasets. Ko-PIQA serves as both a benchmark for Korean language models and a foundation for more inclusive commonsense reasoning research. The dataset and code will be publicly available.

  The paradigm of Large Language Models (LLMs) has increasingly shifted toward agentic applications, where web browsing capabilities are fundamental for retrieving information from diverse online sources. However, existing open-source web agents either demonstrate limited information-seeking abilities on complex tasks or lack transparent implementations. In this work, we identify that the key challenge lies in the scarcity of challenging data for information seeking. To address this limitation, we introduce WebExplorer: a systematic data generation approach using model-based exploration and iterative, long-to-short query evolution. This method creates challenging query-answer pairs that require multi-step reasoning and complex web navigation. By leveraging our curated high-quality dataset, we successfully develop advanced web agent WebExplorer-8B through supervised fine-tuning followed by reinforcement learning. Our model supports 128K context length and up to 100 tool calling turns, enabling long-horizon problem solving. Across diverse information-seeking benchmarks, WebExplorer-8B achieves the state-of-the-art performance at its scale. Notably, as an 8B-sized model, WebExplorer-8B is able to effectively search over an average of 16 turns after RL training, achieving higher accuracy than WebSailor-72B on BrowseComp-en/zh and attaining the best performance among models up to 100B parameters on WebWalkerQA and FRAMES. Beyond these information-seeking tasks, our model also achieves strong generalization on the HLE benchmark even though it is only trained on knowledge-intensive QA data. These results highlight our approach as a practical path toward long-horizon web agents.

  Process Reward Models (PRMs) have recently emerged as a powerful framework for supervising intermediate reasoning steps in large language models (LLMs). Previous PRMs are primarily trained on model final output responses and struggle to evaluate intermediate thinking trajectories robustly, especially in the emerging setting of trajectory-response outputs generated by frontier reasoning models like Deepseek-R1. In this work, we introduce ReasonFlux-PRM, a novel trajectory-aware PRM explicitly designed to evaluate the trajectory-response type of reasoning traces. ReasonFlux-PRM incorporates both step-level and trajectory-level supervision, enabling fine-grained reward assignment aligned with structured chain-of-thought data. We adapt ReasonFlux-PRM to support reward supervision under both offline and online settings, including (i) selecting high-quality model distillation data for downstream supervised fine-tuning of smaller models, (ii) providing dense process-level rewards for policy optimization during reinforcement learning, and (iii) enabling reward-guided Best-of-N test-time scaling. Empirical results on challenging downstream benchmarks such as AIME, MATH500, and GPQA-Diamond demonstrate that ReasonFlux-PRM-7B selects higher quality data than strong PRMs (e.g., Qwen2.5-Math-PRM-72B) and human-curated baselines. Furthermore, our derived ReasonFlux-PRM-7B yields consistent performance improvements, achieving average gains of 12.1% in supervised fine-tuning, 4.5% in reinforcement learning, and 6.3% in test-time scaling. We also release our efficient ReasonFlux-PRM-1.5B for resource-constrained applications and edge deployment. Project:this https URL

  Natural Language Inference (NLI) relies heavily on adequately parsing the semantic content of the premise and hypothesis. In this work, we investigate whether adding semantic information in the form of an Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) helps pretrained language models better generalize in NLI. Our experiments integrating AMR into NLI in both fine-tuning and prompting settings show that the presence of AMR in fine-tuning hinders model generalization while prompting with AMR leads to slight gains in GPT-4o. However, an ablation study reveals that the improvement comes from amplifying surface-level differences rather than aiding semantic reasoning. This amplification can mislead models to predict non-entailment even when the core meaning is preserved.

  The advent of large language models (LLMs) offers unprecedented opportunities to reimagine peer review beyond the constraints of traditional workflows. Despite these opportunities, prior efforts have largely focused on replicating traditional review workflows with LLMs serving as direct substitutes for human reviewers, while limited attention has been given to exploring new paradigms that fundamentally rethink how LLMs can participate in the academic review process. In this paper, we introduce and explore a novel mechanism that employs LLM agents to perform pairwise comparisons among manuscripts instead of individual scoring. By aggregating outcomes from substantial pairwise evaluations, this approach enables a more accurate and robust measure of relative manuscript quality. Our experiments demonstrate that this comparative approach significantly outperforms traditional rating-based methods in identifying high-impact papers. However, our analysis also reveals emergent biases in the selection process, notably a reduced novelty in research topics and an increased institutional imbalance. These findings highlight both the transformative potential of rethinking peer review with LLMs and critical challenges that future systems must address to ensure equity and diversity.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Current instruction data synthesis methods primarily focus on single-turn instructions and often neglect cross-turn coherence, resulting in context drift and reduced task completion rates in extended conversations. To address this limitation, we propose Skeleton-Guided Multi-Turn Dialogue Generation, a framework that constrains multi-turn instruction synthesis by explicitly modeling human conversational intent. It operates in two stages: (1) Intent Modeling, which captures the global structure of human dialogues by assigning each conversation to one of nine well-defined intent trajectories, ensuring a coherent and goal-oriented information flow; and (2) Skeleton Generation, which constructs a structurally grounded sequence of user queries aligned with the modeled intent, thereby serving as a scaffold that constrains and guides the downstream instruction synthesis process. Based on this process, we construct ConsistentChat, a multi-turn instruction dataset with approximately 15,000 multi-turn conversations and 224,392 utterances. Experiments on the Light, Topdial, and MT-Eval benchmarks show that models fine-tuned on ConsistentChat achieve a 20-30% improvement in chat consistency and up to a 15% increase in task success rate, significantly outperforming models trained on existing single-turn and multi-turn instruction datasets.

  We propose CURE, a novel reinforcement learning framework with a dedicated reward design that co-evolves coding and unit test generation capabilities based on their interaction outcomes, without any ground-truth code as supervision. This approach enables flexible and scalable training and allows the unit tester to learn directly from the coder's mistakes. Our derived ReasonFlux-Coder-7B and 14B models improve code generation accuracy by 5.3% and Best-of-N accuracy by 9.0% after optimization on Qwen2.5-Instruct models, outperforming similarly sized Qwen-Coder, DeepSeek-Coder, and Seed-Coder. They naturally extend to downstream tasks such as test-time scaling and agentic coding-achieving a 8.1% improvement over the base model. For the long-CoT model, our ReasonFlux-Coder-4B consistently outperforms Qwen3-4B while achieving 64.8% inference efficiency in unit test generation. Notably, we also find that our model can serve as an effective reward model for reinforcement learning on base models. Project:this https URL

  Although existing model editing methods perform well in recalling exact edit facts, they often struggle in complex scenarios that require deeper semantic understanding rather than mere knowledge regurgitation. Leveraging the strong contextual reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs), in-context learning (ICL) becomes a promising editing method by comprehending edit information through context encoding. However, this method is constrained by the limited context window of LLMs, leading to degraded performance and efficiency as the number of edits increases. To overcome this limitation, we propose InComeS, a flexible framework that enhances LLMs' ability to process editing contexts through explicit compression and selection mechanisms. Specifically, InComeS compresses each editing context into the key-value (KV) cache of a special gist token, enabling efficient handling of multiple edits without being restricted by the model's context window. Furthermore, specialized cross-attention modules are added to dynamically select the most relevant information from the gist pools, enabling adaptive and effective utilization of edit information. We conduct experiments on diverse model editing benchmarks with various editing formats, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have become indispensable tools across various applications, making it more important than ever to ensure the quality and the trustworthiness of their outputs. This has led to growing interest in uncertainty quantification (UQ) methods for assessing the reliability of LLM outputs. Many existing UQ techniques rely on token probabilities, which inadvertently introduces a bias with respect to the length of the output. While some methods attempt to account for this, we demonstrate that such biases persist even in length-normalized approaches. To address the problem, here we propose UNCERTAINTY-LINE: (Length-INvariant Estimation), a simple debiasing procedure that regresses uncertainty scores on output length and uses the residuals as corrected, length-invariant estimates. Our method is post-hoc, model-agnostic, and applicable to a range of UQ measures. Through extensive evaluation on machine translation, summarization, and question-answering tasks, we demonstrate that UNCERTAINTY-LINE: consistently improves over even nominally length-normalized UQ methods uncertainty estimates across multiple metrics and models.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Here, we show that current state-of-the-art LLM unlearning methods inherently reduce models' robustness, causing them to misbehave even when a single non-adversarial forget-token is present in the retain-query. Toward understanding underlying causes, we propose a novel theoretical framework that reframes the unlearning process as backdoor attacks and defenses: forget-tokens act as backdoor triggers that, when activated in retain-queries, cause disruptions in unlearned models' behaviors, similar to successful backdoor attacks. The sense that, LLM unlearning methods themselves poison the model, make it more vulnerable to forget-tokens, and hide rather than erase target knowledge, describes their true mechanism. To mitigate the vulnerability caused by the forgetting process, we reinterpret the retaining process as a backdoor defense and propose Random Noise Augmentation (RNA), a lightweight, model and method-agnostic approach with theoretical guarantees for improving the robustness of models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RNA significantly improves the robustness of unlearned models while preserving forget and retain performances. This backdoor attack-defense framework offers insights into the mechanism of unlearning that can shed light on future research directions for improving unlearning robustness.

  Free-text responses are commonly collected in psychological studies, providing rich qualitative insights that quantitative measures may not capture. Labeling curated topics of research interest in free-text data by multiple trained human coders is typically labor-intensive and time-consuming. Though large language models (LLMs) excel in language processing, LLM-assisted labeling techniques relying on closed-source LLMs cannot be directly applied to free-text data, without explicit consent for external use.In this study, we propose a framework of assembling locally-deployable LLMs to enhance the labeling of predetermined topics in free-text data under privacy constraints. Analogous to annotation by multiple human raters, this framework leverages the heterogeneity of diverse open-source LLMs. The ensemble approach seeks a balance between the agreement and disagreement across LLMs, guided by a relevancy scoring methodology that utilizes embedding distances between topic descriptions and LLMs' reasoning. We evaluated the ensemble approach using both publicly accessible Reddit data from eating disorder related forums, and free-text responses from eating disorder patients, both complemented by human annotations.We found that: (1) there is heterogeneity in the performance of labeling among same-sized LLMs, with some showing low sensitivity but high precision, while others exhibit high sensitivity but low precision. (2) Compared to individual LLMs, the ensemble of LLMs achieved the highest accuracy and optimal precision-sensitivity trade-off in predicting human annotations. (3) The relevancy scores across LLMs showed greater agreement than dichotomous labels, indicating that the relevancy scoring method effectively mitigates the heterogeneity in LLMs' labeling.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in text understanding and generation. However, they often lack factuality, producing a mixture of true and false information, especially in long-form generation. In this work, we investigates the factuality of long-form text generation across various large language models (LLMs), including GPT-4, Gemini-1.5-Pro, Claude-3-Opus, Llama-3-70B, and Mistral. Our analysis reveals that factuality tend to decline in later sentences of the generated text, accompanied by a rise in the number of unsupported claims. Furthermore, we explore the effectiveness of different evaluation settings to assess whether LLMs can accurately judge the correctness of their own outputs: Self-Known (the percentage of supported atomic claims, decomposed from LLM outputs, that the corresponding LLMs judge as correct) and Self-Unknown (the percentage of unsupported atomic claims that the corresponding LLMs judge as incorrect). Empirically, we observe a positive correlation between higher Self-Known scores and improved factuality, whereas higher Self-Unknown scores are associated with reduced factuality. Interestingly, the number of unsupported claims can increase even without significant changes in a model's self-judgment scores (Self-Known and Self-Unknown), likely as a byproduct of long-form text generation. We also derive a mathematical framework linking Self-Known and Self-Unknown scores to factuality: $\textrm{Factuality}=\frac{1-\textrm{Self-Unknown}}{2-\textrm{Self-Unknown}-\textrm{Self-Known}}$, which aligns with our empirical observations. Additional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) experiments further highlight the limitations of current LLMs in long-form generation and underscore the need for continued research to improve factuality in long-form text.

  Perceiving visual semantics embedded within consecutive characters is a crucial yet under-explored capability for both Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs). In this work, we select ASCII art as a representative artifact. It depicts concepts through careful arrangement of characters, which can be formulated in both text and image modalities. We frame the problem as a recognition task, and construct a novel benchmark, ASCIIEval. It covers over 3K samples with an elaborate categorization tree, along with a training set for further enhancement. Encompassing a comprehensive analysis of tens of models through different input modalities, our benchmark demonstrate its multi-faceted diagnostic power. Given textual input, language models shows their visual perception ability on ASCII art concepts. Proprietary models achieve over 70% accuracy on certain categories, with GPT-5 topping the rank. For image inputs, we reveal that open-source MLLMs suffer from a trade-off between fine-grained text recognition and collective visual perception. They exhibit limited generalization ability to this special kind of arts, leading to the dramatic gap of over 20.01% accuracy compared with their proprietary counterparts. Another critical finding is that model performance is sensitive to the length of the ASCII art, with this sensitivity varying across input modalities. Unfortunately, none of the models could successfully benefit from the simultaneous provision of both modalities, highlighting the need for more flexible modality-fusion approaches. Besides, we also introduce approaches for further enhancement and discuss future directions. Resources are available atthis https URL.

  Navigating complex environments requires robots to effectively store observations as memories and leverage them to answer human queries about spatial locations, which is a critical yet underexplored research challenge. While prior work has made progress in constructing robotic memory, few have addressed the principled mechanisms needed for efficient memory retrieval and integration. To bridge this gap, we propose Meta-Memory, a large language model (LLM)-driven agent that constructs a high-density memory representation of the environment. The key innovation of Meta-Memory lies in its capacity to retrieve and integrate relevant memories through joint reasoning over semantic and spatial modalities in response to natural language location queries, thereby empowering robots with robust and accurate spatial reasoning capabilities. To evaluate its performance, we introduce SpaceLocQA, a large-scale dataset encompassing diverse real-world spatial question-answering scenarios. Experimental results show that Meta-Memory significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both the SpaceLocQA and the public NaVQA benchmarks. Furthermore, we successfully deployed Meta-Memory on real-world robotic platforms, demonstrating its practical utility in complex environments. Project page:this https URL.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have been used to make decisions in complex scenarios, where they need models to think deeply, reason logically, and decide wisely. Many existing studies focus solely on multi-round conversations in social tasks or simulated environments, neglecting the various types of decisions and their interdependence. Current reinforcement learning methods struggle to consider the strategies of others during training. To address these issues, we first define a strategic decision-making problem that includes two types of decisions and their temporal dependencies. Furthermore, we propose **T**heory **o**f **M**ind **P**olicy **O**ptimization **(ToMPO)** algorithm to optimize the perception of other individual strategies and the game situation trends. Compared to the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm, ToMPO enhances the LLM's strategic decision-making mainly by: 1) generating rollouts based on reasoning the strategies of other individuals, 2) estimating advantages at both the graph-level and sample-level, and 3) balancing global and partial rewards. The ToMPO algorithm outperforms the GRPO method by 35% in terms of model output compliance and cooperative outcomes. Additionally, when compared to models with parameter sizes 100 times larger, it shows an 18% improvement. This demonstrates the effectiveness of the ToMPO algorithm in enhancing the model's strategic decision-making capabilities.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper introduces LLM-MARL, a unified framework that incorporates large language models (LLMs) into multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to enhance coordination, communication, and generalization in simulated game environments. The framework features three modular components of Coordinator, Communicator, and Memory, which dynamically generate subgoals, facilitate symbolic inter-agent messaging, and support episodic recall. Training combines PPO with a language-conditioned loss and LLM query gating. LLM-MARL is evaluated in Google Research Football, MAgent Battle, and StarCraft II. Results show consistent improvements over MAPPO and QMIX in win rate, coordination score, and zero-shot generalization. Ablation studies demonstrate that subgoal generation and language-based messaging each contribute significantly to performance gains. Qualitative analysis reveals emergent behaviors such as role specialization and communication-driven tactics. By bridging language modeling and policy learning, this work contributes to the design of intelligent, cooperative agents in interactive simulations. It offers a path forward for leveraging LLMs in multi-agent systems used for training, games, and human-AI collaboration.

  Artificial intelligence (AI) systems, and large language models (LLMs) in particular, are increasingly employed for creative tasks like scientific idea generation, constituting a form of generalization from training data unaddressed by existing conceptual frameworks. Though in many ways similar to forms of compositional generalization (CG), combinatorial creativity (CC) is an open-ended ability. Instead of evaluating for accuracy or correctness against fixed targets, which would contradict the open-ended nature of CC, we propose a theoretical framework and algorithmic task for evaluating outputs by their degrees of novelty and utility. From here, we make several important empirical contributions: (1) We obtain the first insights into the scaling behavior of creativity for LLMs. (2) We discover that, for fixed compute budgets, there exist optimal model depths and widths for creative ability. (3) We find that the ideation-execution gap, whereby LLMs excel at generating novel scientific ideas but struggle to ensure their practical feasibility, may be explained by a more fundamental novelty-utility tradeoff characteristic of creativity algorithms in general. Importantly, this tradeoff remains persistent even at scale, casting doubt on the long-term creative potential of LLMs in their current form. Together, our conceptual framework and empirical findings provide a foundation for understanding and improving creativity in modern AI models, marking a new frontier in generalization abilities.

  Facing scaling laws, video data from the internet becomes increasingly important. However, collecting extensive videos that meet specific needs is extremely labor-intensive and time-consuming. In this work, we study the way to expedite this collection process and propose VC-Agent, the first interactive agent that is able to understand users' queries and feedback, and accordingly retrieve/scale up relevant video clips with minimal user input. Specifically, considering the user interface, our agent defines various user-friendly ways for the user to specify requirements based on textual descriptions and confirmations. As for agent functions, we leverage existing multi-modal large language models to connect the user's requirements with the video content. More importantly, we propose two novel filtering policies that can be updated when user interaction is continually performed. Finally, we provide a new benchmark for personalized video dataset collection, and carefully conduct the user study to verify our agent's usage in various real scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our agent for customized video dataset collection. Project page:this https URL.

  The adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) as automated evaluators (LLM-as-a-judge) has revealed critical inconsistencies in current evaluation frameworks. We identify two fundamental types of inconsistencies: (1) Score-Comparison Inconsistency, where lower-rated responses outperform higher-scored ones in pairwise comparisons, and (2) Pairwise Transitivity Inconsistency, manifested through circular preference chains (A>B>C>A) and equivalence contradictions (A=B=C\neq A). We argue that these issues come from information loss in discrete rating systems and ambiguous tie judgments during pairwise evaluation. We propose TrustJudge, a probabilistic framework that addresses these limitations through two key innovations: 1) distribution-sensitive scoring that computes continuous expectations from discrete rating probabilities, preserving information entropy for more precise scoring, and 2) likelihood-aware aggregation that resolves transitivity violations using bidirectional preference probabilities or perplexity. We also formalize the theoretical limitations of current LLM-as-a-judge frameworks and demonstrate how TrustJudge's components overcome them. When evaluated with Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct as judge using our dataset, TrustJudge reduces Score-Comparison inconsistency by 8.43% (from 23.32% to 14.89%) and Pairwise Transitivity inconsistency by 10.82% (from 15.22% to 4.40%), while maintaining higher evaluation accuracy. Our work provides the first systematic analysis of evaluation framework inconsistencies in LLM-as-a-judge paradigms, offering both theoretical insights and practical solutions for reliable automated assessment. The framework demonstrates consistent improvements across various model architectures and scales, enabling more trustworthy LLM evaluation without requiring additional training or human annotations.

  The rapid proliferation of recent Multi-Agent Systems (MAS), where Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) usually collaborate to solve complex problems, necessitates a deep understanding of the persuasion dynamics that govern their interactions. This paper challenges the prevailing hypothesis that persuasive efficacy is primarily a function of model scale. We propose instead that these dynamics are fundamentally dictated by a model's underlying cognitive process, especially its capacity for explicit reasoning. Through a series of multi-agent persuasion experiments, we uncover a fundamental trade-off we term the Persuasion Duality. Our findings reveal that the reasoning process in LRMs exhibits significantly greater resistance to persuasion, maintaining their initial beliefs more robustly. Conversely, making this reasoning process transparent by sharing the "thinking content" dramatically increases their ability to persuade others. We further consider more complex transmission persuasion situations and reveal complex dynamics of influence propagation and decay within multi-hop persuasion between multiple agent networks. This research provides systematic evidence linking a model's internal processing architecture to its external persuasive behavior, offering a novel explanation for the susceptibility of advanced models and highlighting critical implications for the safety, robustness, and design of future MAS.

  The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into medical diagnostic workflows requires robust and consistent evaluation methods to ensure reliability, clinical relevance, and the inherent variability in expert judgments. Traditional metrics like precision and recall often fail to account for the inherent variability in expert judgments, leading to inconsistent assessments of AI performance. Inter-rater agreement statistics like Cohen's Kappa are more reliable but they lack interpretability. We introduce Relative Precision and Recall of Algorithmic Diagnostics (RPAD and RRAD) - a new evaluation metrics that compare AI outputs against multiple expert opinions rather than a single reference. By normalizing performance against inter-expert disagreement, these metrics provide a more stable and realistic measure of the quality of predicted diagnosis. In addition to the comprehensive analysis of diagnostic quality measures, our study contains a very important side result. Our evaluation methodology allows us to avoid selecting diagnoses from a limited list when evaluating a given case. Instead, both the models being tested and the examiners verifying them arrive at a free-form diagnosis. In this automated methodology for establishing the identity of free-form clinical diagnoses, a remarkable 98% accuracy becomes attainable. We evaluate our approach using 360 medical dialogues, comparing multiple large language models (LLMs) against a panel of physicians. Large-scale study shows that top-performing models, such as DeepSeek-V3, achieve consistency on par with or exceeding expert consensus. Moreover, we demonstrate that expert judgments exhibit significant variability - often greater than that between AI and humans. This finding underscores the limitations of any absolute metrics and supports the need to adopt relative metrics in medical AI.

  Reinforcement Learning (RL) has become a pivotal approach for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, a significant theoretical gap persists, as traditional token-level RL frameworks fail to align with the reasoning-level nature of complex, multi-step thought processes like Chain-of-Thought (CoT). To address this challenge, we introduce CoT-Space, a novel theoretical framework that recasts LLM reasoning from a discrete token-prediction task to an optimization process within a continuous, reasoning-level semantic space. This shift in perspective serves as a conceptual bridge, revitalizing foundational principles from classical learning theory to analyze the unique dynamics of LLMs. By analyzing this process from both a noise perspective and a risk perspective, we demonstrate that the convergence to an optimal CoT length is a natural consequence of the fundamental trade-off between underfitting and overfitting. Furthermore, extensive experiments provide strong empirical validation for our theoretical findings. Our framework not only provides a coherent explanation for empirical phenomena such as overthinking but also offers a solid theoretical foundation to guide the future development of more effective and generalizable reasoning agents. We open-source our code atthis https URL.

  While reasoning models demonstrate exceptional performance on complex tasks, they often exhibit tendencies of overthinking on simple problems. This phenomenon not only leads to excessive computational resource consumption but also significantly degrades user experience. To address this challenge, we propose SelfBudgeter - a novel user-friendly adaptive controllable reasoning framework that incorporates a budget estimation mechanism prior to reasoning. The framework adopts a dual-phase training paradigm: during the cold-start phase, the model learns to predict token budgets before executing reasoning in a standardized format; in the reinforcement learning phase, the model is trained to autonomously plan budgets based on problem difficulty and strictly adhere to them when generating responses. Since the model outputs budget estimates at the initial stage, users can immediately anticipate waiting duration, enabling flexible decisions on whether to interrupt or continue the generation process. Notably, our method supports manual control of reasoning length through pre-filled budget fields. Experimental results demonstrate that SelfBudgeter can dynamically allocate budgets according to problem complexity, yielding an average response length compression of 61% for the 1.5B model on GSM8K, MATH500, and AIME2025, and 48% for the 7B model, while maintaining nearly undiminished accuracy.

  As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in highly specialized vertical domains, the evaluation of their domain-specific performance becomes critical. However, existing evaluations for vertical domains typically rely on the labor-intensive construction of static single-turn datasets, which present two key limitations: (i) manual data construction is costly and must be repeated for each new domain, and (ii) static single-turn evaluations are misaligned with the dynamic multi-turn interactions in real-world applications, limiting the assessment of professionalism and stability. To address these, we propose TestAgent, a framework for automatic benchmarking and exploratory dynamic evaluation in vertical domains. TestAgent leverages retrieval-augmented generation to create domain-specific questions from user-provided knowledge sources, combined with a two-stage criteria generation process, thereby enabling scalable and automated benchmark creation. Furthermore, it introduces a reinforcement learning-guided multi-turn interaction strategy that adaptively determines question types based on real-time model responses, dynamically probing knowledge boundaries and stability. Extensive experiments across medical, legal, and governmental domains demonstrate that TestAgent enables efficient cross-domain benchmark generation and yields deeper insights into model behavior through dynamic exploratory evaluation. This work establishes a new paradigm for automated and in-depth evaluation of LLMs in vertical domains.

  As large language models (LLMs) achieve strong performance on traditional benchmarks, there is an urgent need for more challenging evaluation frameworks that probe deeper aspects of semantic understanding. We introduce SAGE (Semantic Alignment & Generalization Evaluation), a rigorous benchmark designed to assess both embedding models and similarity metrics across five categories: Human Preference Alignment, Transformation Robustness, Information Sensitivity, Clustering Performance, and Retrieval Robustness. Unlike existing benchmarks that focus on isolated capabilities, SAGE evaluates semantic understanding through adversarial conditions, noisy transformations, and nuanced human judgment tasks across 30+ datasets. Our comprehensive evaluation of 9 embedding models and classical metrics reveals significant performance gaps, with no single approach excelling across all dimensions. For instance, while state-of-the-art embedding models like OpenAI's text-embedding-3-large dominate in aligning with human preferences (0.682 vs. 0.591 for the best classical metric), they are significantly outperformed by classical metrics on information sensitivity tasks, where Jaccard Similarity achieves a score of 0.905 compared to the top embedding score of 0.794. SAGE further uncovers critical trade-offs: OpenAI's text-embedding-3-small achieves the highest clustering performance (0.483) but demonstrates extreme brittleness with the lowest robustness score (0.011). SAGE exposes critical limitations in current semantic understanding capabilities and provides a more realistic assessment of model robustness for real-world deployment.

  Effective disease prediction in modern healthcare demands the twin goals of high accuracy and transparent, clinically meaningful explanations. Existing machine learning and large language model (LLM) based approaches often struggle to balance these goals. Many models yield accurate but unclear statistical outputs, while others generate fluent but statistically unsupported narratives, often undermining both the validity of the explanation and the predictive accuracy itself. This shortcoming comes from a shallow interaction with the data, preventing the development of a deep, detailed understanding similar to a human expert's. We argue that high accuracy and high-quality explanations are not separate objectives but are mutually reinforcing outcomes of a model that develops a deep, direct understanding of the data. To achieve this, we propose the Reflective Cognitive Architecture (RCA), a novel framework that coordinates multiple LLMs to learn from direct experience. RCA features an iterative rule refinement mechanism that improves its logic from prediction errors and a distribution-aware rules check mechanism that bases its reasoning in the dataset's global statistics. By using predictive accuracy as a signal to drive deeper comprehension, RCA builds a strong internal model of the data. We evaluated RCA on one private and two public datasets against 22 baselines. The results demonstrate that RCA not only achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and robustness with a relative improvement of up to 40\% over the baseline but, more importantly, leverages this deep understanding to excel in generating explanations that are clear, logical, evidence-based, and balanced, highlighting its potential for creating genuinely trustworthy clinical decision support systems.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce an architecture for studying the behavior of large language model (LLM) agents in the absence of externally imposed tasks. Our continuous reason and act framework, using persistent memory and self-feedback, enables sustained autonomous operation. We deployed this architecture across 18 runs using 6 frontier models from Anthropic, OpenAI, XAI, and Google. We find agents spontaneously organize into three distinct behavioral patterns: (1) systematic production of multi-cycle projects, (2) methodological self-inquiry into their own cognitive processes, and (3) recursive conceptualization of their own nature. These tendencies proved highly model-specific, with some models deterministically adopting a single pattern across all runs. A cross-model assessment further reveals that models exhibit stable, divergent biases when evaluating these emergent behaviors in themselves and others. These findings provide the first systematic documentation of unprompted LLM agent behavior, establishing a baseline for predicting actions during task ambiguity, error recovery, or extended autonomous operation in deployed systems.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multi-Hop Question Answering (MHQA) requires integrating dispersed, interdependent evidence through sequential reasoning under noise. This task is challenging for LLMs as they have a finite per-pass output capacity, beyond which the integration of task-relevant evidence proves unreliable. Consequently, the single-pass reasoning paradigm is inherently vulnerable to this capacity overflow. To formalize this bottleneck, our analysis establishes a Fano-style accuracy upper bound, defining a theoretical performance ceiling for single-pass LLMs. This bound reveals that accuracy inevitably collapses once task complexity exceeds model capacity, providing general principles for capacity-aware representation and structuring of MHQA in LLMs. Building on these principles, we introduce a proof-of-concept multi-call framework for MHQA, InfoQA. It ensures high per-step accuracy by combining capacity-aware task decomposition with active pruning of prior reasoning traces, keeping the information load within the single-pass limit. It further achieves robustness by a dependency-explicit workflow that enables precise control over the reasoning path. We construct a stringent and noise-rich benchmark to validate our theory and framework. Experimental results show that model behavior aligns with our predicted capacity curves while InfoQA achieves consistent performance improvements. We hope our work inspires more LLM multi-step reasoning methods: \faGithub \href{this https URL}{InfoQA}.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) struggle with representing and generating rare tokens despite their importance in specialized domains. We investigate whether LLMs develop internal specialization mechanisms through discrete modular architectures or distributed parameter-level differentiation. Through systematic analysis of final-layer MLP neurons across multiple model families, we discover that rare-token processing emerges via \textit{distributed specialization}: functionally coordinated but spatially distributed subnetworks that exhibit three distinct organizational principles. First, we identify a reproducible three-regime influence hierarchy comprising highly influential plateau neurons(also termed as rare-token neurons), power-law decay neurons, and minimally contributing neurons, which is absent in common-token processing. Second, plateau neurons demonstrate coordinated activation patterns (reduced effective dimensionality) while remaining spatially distributed rather than forming discrete clusters. Third, these specialized mechanisms are universally accessible through standard attention pathways without requiring dedicated routing circuits. Training dynamics reveal that functional specialization emerges gradually through parameter differentiation, with specialized neurons developing increasingly heavy-tailed weight correlation spectra consistent with Heavy-Tailed Self-Regularization signatures. Our findings establish that LLMs process rare-tokens through distributed coordination within shared architectures rather than mixture-of-experts-style modularity. These results provide insights for interpretable model editing, computational efficiency optimization, and understanding emergent functional organization in transformer networks.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) are typically trained by reinforcement learning (RL) with verifiable rewards (RLVR) and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on reasoning traces to improve their reasoning abilities. However, how these methods shape reasoning capabilities remains largely elusive. Going beyond an accuracy-based investigation of how these two components sculpt the reasoning process, this paper introduces a novel analysis framework that quantifies reasoning paths and captures their qualitative changes under each training process (with models of 1.5B, 7B, and 14B parameters on mathematical domains). Specifically, we investigate the reasoning process at two levels of granularity: the trajectory-level, which examines complete reasoning outputs, and the step-level, which analyzes reasoning graphs whose nodes correspond to individual reasoning steps. Notably, clustering of unique reasoning trajectories shows complementary effects: RL compresses incorrect trajectories, whereas SFT expands correct ones. Step-level analysis reveals that RL steepens (about 2.5 times), while SFT flattens (reduced to about one-third), the decay rates of node visitation frequency, degree, and betweenness centrality distributions in the reasoning graph. This indicates that RL concentrates reasoning functionality into a small subset of steps, while SFT homogenizes it across many steps. Furthermore, by evaluating the reasoning graph topologies from multiple perspectives, we delineate the shared and distinct characteristics of RL and SFT. Our work presents a novel reasoning path perspective that explains why the current best practice of two-stage training, with SFT followed by RL, is successful, and offers practical implications for data construction and more efficient learning approaches.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper introduces SciTrek, a novel question-answering benchmark designed to evaluate the long-context reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) using scientific articles. Current long-context benchmarks often rely on non-scientific texts, focus on simple information retrieval tasks, or employ artificial contexts. SciTrek addresses these limitations by proposing complex questions that require information aggregation and synthesis across multiple full-text scientific articles. Questions and their ground-truth answers are automatically generated by formulating them as SQL queries over a database constructed from article metadata (titles, authors, and references). The SQL operations provide explicit, verifiable reasoning steps for fine-grained error analysis, and the construction process scales to contexts up to 1M tokens with minimal supervision. Extensive experiments on a diverse set of open-weight and proprietary LLMs demonstrate that SciTrek poses a significant challenge as the context length increases, with supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning offering only limited gains. Our analysis reveals systematic shortcomings in models' abilities to perform basic numerical operations and accurately locate specific information in long contexts.

  Evaluating AI agents that solve real-world tasks through function-call sequences remains an open challenge. Existing agentic benchmarks often reduce evaluation to a binary judgment of the final state, overlooking critical aspects such as safety, efficiency, and intermediate correctness. We propose a framework based on deterministic finite automata (DFAs) that encodes tasks as sets of valid tool-use paths, enabling principled assessment of agent behavior in diverse world models. Building on this foundation, we introduce CORE, a suite of five metrics, namely Path Correctness, Path Correctness - Kendall's tau Composite, Prefix Criticality, Harmful-Call Rate, and Efficiency, that quantify alignment with expected execution patterns. Across diverse worlds, our method reveals important performance differences between agents that would otherwise appear equivalent under traditional final-state evaluation schemes.

  Retrosynthesis planning enables the discovery of viable synthetic routes for target molecules, playing a crucial role in domains like drug discovery and materials design. Multi-step retrosynthetic planning remains computationally challenging due to exponential search spaces and inference costs. While Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate chemical reasoning capabilities, their application to synthesis planning faces constraints on efficiency and cost. To address these challenges, we introduce AOT*, a framework that transforms retrosynthetic planning by integrating LLM-generated chemical synthesis pathways with systematic AND-OR tree search. To this end, AOT* atomically maps the generated complete synthesis routes onto AND-OR tree components, with a mathematically sound design of reward assignment strategy and retrieval-based context engineering, thus enabling LLMs to efficiently navigate in the chemical space. Experimental evaluation on multiple synthesis benchmarks demonstrates that AOT* achieves SOTA performance with significantly improved search efficiency. AOT* exhibits competitive solve rates using 3-5$\times$ fewer iterations than existing LLM-based approaches, with the efficiency advantage becoming more pronounced on complex molecular targets.

  We present an advanced approach to mobile app review analysis aimed at addressing limitations inherent in traditional star-rating systems. Star ratings, although intuitive and popular among users, often fail to capture the nuanced feedback present in detailed review texts. Traditional NLP techniques -- such as lexicon-based methods and classical machine learning classifiers -- struggle to interpret contextual nuances, domain-specific terminology, and subtle linguistic features like sarcasm. To overcome these limitations, we propose a modular framework leveraging large language models (LLMs) enhanced by structured prompting techniques. Our method quantifies discrepancies between numerical ratings and textual sentiment, extracts detailed, feature-level insights, and supports interactive exploration of reviews through retrieval-augmented conversational question answering (RAG-QA). Comprehensive experiments conducted on three diverse datasets (AWARE, Google Play, and Spotify) demonstrate that our LLM-driven approach significantly surpasses baseline methods, yielding improved accuracy, robustness, and actionable insights in challenging and context-rich review scenarios.

  In precision medicine, quantitative multi-omic features, topological context, and textual biological knowledge play vital roles in identifying disease-critical signaling pathways and targets. Existing pipelines capture only part of these-numerical omics ignore topological context, text-centric LLMs lack quantitative grounded reasoning, and graph-only models underuse node semantics and the generalization of LLMs-limiting mechanistic interpretability. Although Process Reward Models (PRMs) aim to guide reasoning in LLMs, they remain limited by unreliable intermediate evaluation, and vulnerability to reward hacking with computational cost. These gaps motivate integrating quantitative multi-omic signals, topological structure with node annotations, and literature-scale text via LLMs, using subgraph reasoning as the principle bridge linking numeric evidence, topological knowledge and language context. Therefore, we propose GALAX (Graph Augmented LAnguage model with eXplainability), an innovative framework that integrates pretrained Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) into Large Language Models (LLMs) via reinforcement guided by a Graph Process Reward Model (GPRM), which generates disease-relevant subgraphs in a step-wise manner initiated by an LLM and iteratively evaluated by a pretrained GNN, enabling process-level supervision without explicit intermediate reasoning annotations. As an application, we also introduced Target-QA, a benchmark combining CRISPR-identified targets, multi-omic profiles, and biomedical graph knowledge across diverse cancer cell lines, which enables GNN pretraining for supervising step-wise graph construction and supports long-context reasoning over text-numeric graphs (TNGs), providing a scalable and biologically grounded framework for explainable, reinforcement-guided subgraph reasoning toward reliable and interpretable target and pathway discovery in precision medicine.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in multimodal language models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in vision-language reasoning, especially with the emergence of "thinking with images," which integrates explicit visual steps into the reasoning process. While this paradigm strengthens image-based reasoning, a significant challenge remains: models may arrive at correct answers by relying on irrelevant or spurious regions, driven by prior knowledge or dataset biases. Even when the answer is correct, flawed reasoning indicates that the model has not truly understood the image, highlighting the critical importance of reasoning fidelity in multimodal tasks. To address this issue, we propose DeFacto, a counterfactual reasoning framework that jointly enforces accurate answering and faithful reasoning. A key component of our approach is the design of three complementary training paradigms: (i) positive, (ii) counterfactual, and (iii) random-masking. To enable these paradigms, we develop a pipeline that automatically localizes question-relevant evidence and constructs positive, counterfactual, and random variants, resulting in a dataset of about 100k images. Building on this framework, we train multimodal language models with GRPO-based reinforcement learning, where we design three complementary rewards to guide the model toward accurate answering and evidence-grounded reasoning. Experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate that DeFacto substantially improves both answer accuracy and reasoning faithfulness, establishing a stronger foundation for interpretable multimodal reasoning. The code is available on GitHub and the dataset is released on HuggingFace.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Purpose: To develop a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system powered by LLaMA-4 109B for automated, protocol-aware, and interpretable evaluation of radiotherapy treatment plans.Methods and Materials: We curated a multi-protocol dataset of 614 radiotherapy plans across four disease sites and constructed a knowledge base containing normalized dose metrics and protocol-defined constraints. The RAG system integrates three core modules: a retrieval engine optimized across five SentenceTransformer backbones, a percentile prediction component based on cohort similarity, and a clinical constraint checker. These tools are directed by a large language model (LLM) using a multi-step prompt-driven reasoning pipeline to produce concise, grounded evaluations.Results: Retrieval hyperparameters were optimized using Gaussian Process on a scalarized loss function combining root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and clinically motivated accuracy thresholds. The best configuration, based on all-MiniLM-L6-v2, achieved perfect nearest-neighbor accuracy within a 5-percentile-point margin and a sub-2pt MAE. When tested end-to-end, the RAG system achieved 100% agreement with the computed values by standalone retrieval and constraint-checking modules on both percentile estimates and constraint identification, confirming reliable execution of all retrieval, prediction and checking steps.Conclusion: Our findings highlight the feasibility of combining structured population-based scoring with modular tool-augmented reasoning for transparent, scalable plan evaluation in radiation therapy. The system offers traceable outputs, minimizes hallucination, and demonstrates robustness across protocols. Future directions include clinician-led validation, and improved domain-adapted retrieval models to enhance real-world integration.

  The benefit claims of a product is a critical driver of consumers' purchase behavior. Creating product claims is an intense task that requires substantial time and funding. We have developed the $\textbf{Claim Advisor}$ web application to accelerate claim creations using in-context learning and fine-tuning of large language models (LLM). $\textbf{Claim Advisor}$ was designed to disrupt the speed and economics of claim search, generation, optimization, and simulation. It has three functions: (1) semantically searching and identifying existing claims and/or visuals that resonate with the voice of consumers; (2) generating and/or optimizing claims based on a product description and a consumer profile; and (3) ranking generated and/or manually created claims using simulations via synthetic consumers. Applications in a consumer packaged goods (CPG) company have shown very promising results. We believe that this capability is broadly useful and applicable across product categories and industries. We share our learning to encourage the research and application of generative AI in different industries.

  Despite the rapid advancements in LLM agents, they still face the challenge of generating meaningful reflections due to inadequate error analysis and a reliance on rare successful trajectories, especially in complex tasks. In this work, we propose SAMULE, a new framework for self-learning agents powered by a retrospective language model that is trained based on Multi-Level Reflection Synthesis. It first synthesizes high-quality reflections across three complementary levels: Single-Trajectory Learning (micro-level) for detailed error correction; Intra-Task Learning (meso-level) to build error taxonomies across multiple trials of the same task, and Inter-Task Learning (macro-level) to extract transferable insights based on same typed errors from diverse task failures. Then we fine-tune a language model serving as the retrospective model to generate reflections during inference. We further extend our framework to interactive settings through a foresight-based reflection mechanism, enabling agents to proactively reflect and adapt during user interactions by comparing predicted and actual responses. Extensive experiments on three challenging benchmarks - TravelPlanner, NATURAL PLAN, and Tau-bench - demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms reflection-based baselines. Our results highlight the critical role of well-designed reflection synthesis and failure-centric learning in building self-improving LLM agents.

  One common strategy for improving the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) on downstream tasks involves using a \emph{verifier model} to either select the best answer from a pool of candidates or to steer the auto-regressive generation process towards better outputs. This class of methods typically results in improved accuracy at the cost of increased computation at test-time, a paradigm known as \emph{test-time scaling}. However, most existing approaches increase computation uniformly across all samples and generation steps, without considering the complexity of individual instances, leading to inefficient resource use. We address this limitation by proposing an approach, called \emph{Locally Adaptive Test-Time Scaling (LATTS)}, that allocates variable compute across generation steps. Specifically, at each generation step, LATTS employs a verifier-based acceptance criterion to decide whether to resample, backtrack, restart, or stop the generation process. This criterion effectively adjusts the per-step computational effort based on a precise notion of \emph{local difficulty} derived from the verifier model. Empirical results show that LATTS achieves significantly superior accuracy--compute tradeoffs compared to standard verifier-based methods.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated notable potential in medical applications, yet they face substantial challenges in handling complex real-world clinical diagnoses using conventional prompting methods. Current prompt engineering and multi-agent approaches typically optimize isolated inferences, neglecting the accumulation of reusable clinical experience. To address this, this study proposes a novel Multi-Agent Clinical Diagnosis (MACD) framework, which allows LLMs to self-learn clinical knowledge via a multi-agent pipeline that summarizes, refines, and applies diagnostic insights. It mirrors how physicians develop expertise through experience, enabling more focused and accurate diagnosis on key disease-specific cues. We further extend it to a MACD-human collaborative workflow, where multiple LLM-based diagnostician agents engage in iterative consultations, supported by an evaluator agent and human oversight for cases where agreement is not reached. Evaluated on 4,390 real-world patient cases across seven diseases using diverse open-source LLMs (Llama-3.1 8B/70B, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama 70B), MACD significantly improves primary diagnostic accuracy, outperforming established clinical guidelines with gains up to 22.3% (MACD). On the subset of the data, it achieves performance on par with or exceeding that of human physicians (up to 16% improvement over physicians-only diagnosis). Additionally, on the MACD-human workflow, it achieves an 18.6% improvement compared to physicians-only diagnosis. Moreover, self-learned knowledge exhibits strong cross-model stability, transferability, and model-specific personalization, while the system can generate traceable rationales, enhancing explainability. Consequently, this work presents a scalable self-learning paradigm for LLM-assisted diagnosis, bridging the gap between the intrinsic knowledge of LLMs and real-world clinical practice.

  The reasoning processes of large language models often lack faithfulness; a model may generate a correct answer while relying on a flawed or irrelevant reasoning trace. This behavior, a direct consequence of training objectives that solely reward final-answer correctness, severely undermines the trustworthiness of these models in high-stakes domains. This paper introduces \textbf{Counterfactual Sensitivity Regularization (CSR)}, a novel training objective designed to forge a strong, causal-like dependence between a model's output and its intermediate reasoning steps. During training, CSR performs automated, operator-level interventions on the generated reasoning trace (e.g., swapping ``+'' with ``-'') to create a minimally-perturbed counterfactual. A regularization term then penalizes the model if this logically flawed trace still yields the original answer. Our efficient implementation adds only 8.7\% training overhead through warm-start curriculum and token-subset optimization. We evaluate faithfulness using \textbf{Counterfactual Outcome Sensitivity (COS)}, a metric quantifying how sensitive the final answer is to such logical perturbations. Across diverse structured reasoning benchmarks -- arithmetic (GSM8K), logical deduction (ProofWriter), multi-hop QA (HotpotQA), and code generation (MBPP) -- models trained with CSR demonstrate a vastly superior trade-off between accuracy and faithfulness. CSR improves faithfulness over standard fine-tuning and process supervision by up to 70 percentage points, with this learned sensitivity generalizing to larger models and enhancing the performance of inference-time techniques like self-consistency.

  _Yihao Xue, Baharan Mirzasoleiman_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reasoning LLMs have demonstrated remarkable breakthroughs in solving complex problems that were previously out of reach. To ensure LLMs do not assist with harmful requests, safety alignment fine-tuning is necessary in the post-training phase. However, safety alignment fine-tuning has recently been shown to significantly degrade reasoning abilities, a phenomenon known as the "Safety Tax". In this work, we show that using LoRA for SFT on refusal datasets effectively aligns the model for safety without harming its reasoning capabilities. This is because restricting the safety weight updates to a low-rank space minimizes the interference with the reasoning weights. Our extensive experiments across four benchmarks covering math, science, and coding show that this approach produces highly safe LLMs--with safety levels comparable to full-model fine-tuning--without compromising their reasoning abilities. Our ablation studies further identify three key factors in LoRA: (1) rank-$1$ updates are sufficient to achieve the best reasoning and safety performance, (2) the up projection layers are the most critical modules, with LoRA applied to them alone achieving even better results, and (3) middle layers are more effective than early or late layers. Together, these findings show that strong safety and reasoning can be achieved at minimal computational cost when updates are applied in the right places. Additionally, we observe that LoRA induces weight updates with smaller overlap with the initial weights compared to full-model fine-tuning. Finally, while our attempts to further reduce this overlap yield only modest improvements on some tasks, they highlight the potential of developing methods that more reliably optimize the reasoning-safety tradeoff.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit a notable performance ceiling on complex, multi-faceted tasks, as they often fail to integrate diverse information or adhere to multiple constraints. We posit that such limitation arises when the demands of a task exceed the LLM's effective cognitive load capacity. This interpretation draws a strong analogy to Cognitive Load Theory (CLT) in cognitive science, which explains similar performance boundaries in the human mind, and is further supported by emerging evidence that reveals LLMs have bounded working memory characteristics. Building upon this CLT-grounded understanding, we introduce CoThinker, a novel LLM-based multi-agent framework designed to mitigate cognitive overload and enhance collaborative problem-solving abilities. CoThinker operationalizes CLT principles by distributing intrinsic cognitive load through agent specialization and managing transactional load via structured communication and a collective working memory. We empirically validate CoThinker on complex problem-solving tasks and fabricated high cognitive load scenarios, demonstrating improvements over existing multi-agent baselines in solution quality and efficiency. Our analysis reveals characteristic interaction patterns, providing insights into the emergence of collective cognition and effective load management, thus offering a principled approach to overcoming LLM performance ceilings.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Despite rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs), the token-level autoregressive nature constrains their complex reasoning capabilities. To enhance LLM reasoning, inference-time techniques, including Chain/Tree/Graph-of-Thought(s), successfully improve the performance, as they are fairly cost-effective by guiding reasoning through sophisticated logical structures without modifying LLMs' parameters. However, these manually predefined, task-agnostic frameworks are applied uniformly across diverse tasks, lacking adaptability. To improve this, we propose RL-of-Thoughts (RLoT), where we train a lightweight navigator model with reinforcement learning (RL) to adaptively enhance LLM reasoning at inference time. Specifically, we design five basic logic blocks from the perspective of human cognition. During the reasoning process, the trained RL navigator dynamically selects the suitable logic blocks and combines them into task-specific logical structures according to problem characteristics. Experiments across multiple reasoning benchmarks (AIME, MATH, GPQA, etc.) with multiple LLMs (GPT, Llama, Qwen, and DeepSeek) illustrate that RLoT outperforms established inference-time techniques by up to 13.4%. Remarkably, with less than 3K parameters, our RL navigator is able to make sub-10B LLMs comparable to 100B-scale counterparts. Moreover, the RL navigator demonstrates strong transferability: a model trained on one specific LLM-task pair can effectively generalize to unseen LLMs and tasks.

  The application of LLM-based agents in financial investment has shown significant promise, yet existing approaches often require intermediate steps like predicting individual stock movements or rely on predefined, static workflows. These limitations restrict their adaptability and effectiveness in constructing optimal portfolios. In this paper, we introduce the Multi-Agent Scaling Simulation (MASS), a novel framework that leverages multi-agent simulation for direct, end-to-end portfolio construction. At its core, MASS employs a backward optimization process to dynamically learn the optimal distribution of heterogeneous agents, enabling the system to adapt to evolving market regimes. A key finding enabled by our framework is the exploration of the scaling effect for portfolio construction: we demonstrate that as the number of agents increases exponentially (up to 512), the aggregated decisions yield progressively higher excess returns. Extensive experiments on a challenging, self-collected dataset from the 2023 Chinese A-share market show that MASS consistently outperforms seven state-of-the-art baselines. Further backtesting, stability analyses and the experiment on data leakage concerns validate its enhanced profitability and robustness. We have open-sourced our code, dataset, and training snapshots atthis https URLto foster further research.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Systematic generalization refers to the capacity to understand and generate novel combinations from known components. Despite recent progress by large language models (LLMs) across various domains, these models often fail to extend their knowledge to novel compositional scenarios, revealing notable limitations in systematic generalization. There has been an ongoing debate about whether neural networks possess the capacity for systematic generalization, with recent studies suggesting that meta-learning approaches designed for compositionality can significantly enhance this ability. However, these insights have largely been confined to linguistic problems, leaving their applicability to other tasks an open question. In this study, we extend meta-learning for compositionality to the domain of abstract spatial reasoning. To this end, we introduce $\textit{Compositional-ARC}-$a dataset designed to evaluate the capacity of models to systematically generalize from known geometric transformations (e.g., translation, rotation) of abstract two-dimensional objects to novel combinations of these transformations (e.g., translation+rotation). Our results show that a small transformer-based encoder-decoder model, trained via meta-learning for compositionality, can systematically generalize to previously unseen transformation compositions. Notably, despite having only 5.7M parameters, this model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art LLMs$-$including o3-mini, GPT-4o, and Gemini 2.0 Flash, which fail to exhibit similar systematic behavior$-$and performs on par with the winning model of the ARC prize 2024, an 8B-parameter LLM trained via test-time training. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of meta-learning in promoting systematicity beyond linguistic tasks, suggesting a promising direction toward more robust and generalizable models.

  Temporal reasoning in multi-session dialogues presents a significant challenge which has been under-studied in previous temporal reasoning benchmarks. To bridge this gap, we propose a new evaluation task for temporal reasoning in multi-session dialogues and introduce an approach to construct a new benchmark by augmenting dialogues from LoCoMo and creating multi-choice QAs. Furthermore, we present TReMu, a new framework aimed at enhancing the temporal reasoning capabilities of LLM-agents in this context. Specifically, the framework employs time-aware memorization through timeline summarization, generating retrievable memory by summarizing events in each dialogue session with their inferred dates. Additionally, we integrate neuro-symbolic temporal reasoning, where LLMs generate Python code to perform temporal calculations and select answers. Experimental evaluations on popular LLMs demonstrate that our benchmark is challenging, and the proposed framework significantly improves temporal reasoning performance compared to baseline methods, raising from 29.83 on GPT-4o via standard prompting to 77.67 via our approach and highlighting its effectiveness in addressing temporal reasoning in multi-session dialogues.
