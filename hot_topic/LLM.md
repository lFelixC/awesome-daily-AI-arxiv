- **[LCMF: Lightweight Cross-Modality Mambaformer for Embodied Robotics VQA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18576)**  `arXiv:2509.18576`  `cs.RO` `cs.AI`

  Multimodal semantic learning plays a critical role in embodied intelligence, especially when robots perceive their surroundings, understand human instructions, and make intelligent decisions. However, the field faces technical challenges such as effective fusion of heterogeneous data and computational efficiency in resource-constrained environments. To address these challenges, this study proposes the lightweight LCMF cascaded attention framework, introducing a multi-level cross-modal parameter sharing mechanism into the Mamba module. By integrating the advantages of Cross-Attention and Selective parameter-sharing State Space Models (SSMs), the framework achieves efficient fusion of heterogeneous modalities and semantic complementary alignment. Experimental results show that LCMF surpasses existing multimodal baselines with an accuracy of 74.29% in VQA tasks and achieves competitive mid-tier performance within the distribution cluster of Large Language Model Agents (LLM Agents) in EQA video tasks. Its lightweight design achieves a 4.35-fold reduction in FLOPs relative to the average of comparable baselines while using only 166.51M parameters (image-text) and 219M parameters (video-text), providing an efficient solution for Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) applications in resource-constrained scenarios with strong multimodal decision generalization capabilities.

  Designing robotic hand morphologies for diverse manipulation tasks requires balancing dexterity, manufacturability, and task-specific functionality. While open-source frameworks and parametric tools support reproducible design, they still rely on expert heuristics and manual tuning. Automated methods using optimization are often compute-intensive, simulation-dependent, and rarely target dexterous hands. Large language models (LLMs), with their broad knowledge of human-object interactions and strong generative capabilities, offer a promising alternative for zero-shot design reasoning. In this paper, we present Lang2Morph, a language-driven pipeline for robotic hand design. It uses LLMs to translate natural-language task descriptions into symbolic structures and OPH-compatible parameters, enabling 3D-printable task-specific morphologies. The pipeline consists of: (i) Morphology Design, which maps tasks into semantic tags, structural grammars, and OPH-compatible parameters; and (ii) Selection and Refinement, which evaluates design candidates based on semantic alignment and size compatibility, and optionally applies LLM-guided refinement when needed. We evaluate Lang2Morph across varied tasks, and results show that our approach can generate diverse, task-relevant morphologies. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to develop an LLM-based framework for task-conditioned robotic hand design.

  _Yuan Meng, Zhenguo Sun, Max Fest, Xukun Li, Zhenshan Bing, Alois Knoll_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs)-based code generation for robotic manipulation has recently shown promise by directly translating human instructions into executable code, but existing methods remain noisy, constrained by fixed primitives and limited context windows, and struggle with long-horizon tasks. While closed-loop feedback has been explored, corrected knowledge is often stored in improper formats, restricting generalization and causing catastrophic forgetting, which highlights the need for learning reusable skills. Moreover, approaches that rely solely on LLM guidance frequently fail in extremely long-horizon scenarios due to LLMs' limited reasoning capability in the robotic domain, where such issues are often straightforward for humans to identify. To address these challenges, we propose a human-in-the-loop framework that encodes corrections into reusable skills, supported by external memory and Retrieval-Augmented Generation with a hint mechanism for dynamic reuse. Experiments on Ravens, Franka Kitchen, and MetaWorld, as well as real-world settings, show that our framework achieves a 0.93 success rate (up to 27% higher than baselines) and a 42% efficiency improvement in correction rounds. It can robustly solve extremely long-horizon tasks such as "build a house", which requires planning over 20 primitives.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Current state-of-the-art autonomous vehicles could face safety-critical situations when their local sensors are occluded by large nearby objects on the road. Vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) cooperative autonomous driving has been proposed as a means of addressing this problem, and one recently introduced framework for cooperative autonomous driving has further adopted an approach that incorporates a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) to integrate cooperative perception and planning processes. However, despite the potential benefit of applying graph-of-thoughts reasoning to the MLLM, this idea has not been considered by previous cooperative autonomous driving research. In this paper, we propose a novel graph-of-thoughts framework specifically designed for MLLM-based cooperative autonomous driving. Our graph-of-thoughts includes our proposed novel ideas of occlusion-aware perception and planning-aware prediction. We curate the V2V-GoT-QA dataset and develop the V2V-GoT model for training and testing the cooperative driving graph-of-thoughts. Our experimental results show that our method outperforms other baselines in cooperative perception, prediction, and planning tasks. Our project website:this https URL.

- **[Embodied Arena: A Comprehensive, Unified, and Evolving Evaluation Platform for Embodied AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15273)**  `arXiv:2509.15273`  `cs.RO`  
  _Fei Ni, Min Zhang, Pengyi Li, Yifu Yuan, Lingfeng Zhang, Yuecheng Liu, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Embodied AI development significantly lags behind large foundation models due to three critical challenges: (1) lack of systematic understanding of core capabilities needed for Embodied AI, making research lack clear objectives; (2) absence of unified and standardized evaluation systems, rendering cross-benchmark evaluation infeasible; and (3) underdeveloped automated and scalable acquisition methods for embodied data, creating critical bottlenecks for model scaling. To address these obstacles, we present Embodied Arena, a comprehensive, unified, and evolving evaluation platform for Embodied AI. Our platform establishes a systematic embodied capability taxonomy spanning three levels (perception, reasoning, task execution), seven core capabilities, and 25 fine-grained dimensions, enabling unified evaluation with systematic research objectives. We introduce a standardized evaluation system built upon unified infrastructure supporting flexible integration of 22 diverse benchmarks across three domains (2D/3D Embodied Q&A, Navigation, Task Planning) and 30+ advanced models from 20+ worldwide institutes. Additionally, we develop a novel LLM-driven automated generation pipeline ensuring scalable embodied evaluation data with continuous evolution for diversity and comprehensiveness. Embodied Arena publishes three real-time leaderboards (Embodied Q&A, Navigation, Task Planning) with dual perspectives (benchmark view and capability view), providing comprehensive overviews of advanced model capabilities. Especially, we present nine findings summarized from the evaluation results on the leaderboards of Embodied Arena. This helps to establish clear research veins and pinpoint critical research problems, thereby driving forward progress in the field of Embodied AI.

  Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are undergoing rapid progress and represent the frontier of AI development. However, their training and inference efficiency have emerged as a core bottleneck in making MLLMs more accessible and scalable. To address the challenges, we present MiniCPM-V 4.5, an 8B parameter model designed for high efficiency and strong performance. We introduce three core improvements in model architecture, data strategy and training method: a unified 3D-Resampler model architecture for highly compact encoding over images and videos, a unified learning paradigm for document knowledge and text recognition without heavy data engineering, and a hybrid reinforcement learning strategy for proficiency in both short and long reasoning modes. Comprehensive experimental results in OpenCompass evaluation show that MiniCPM-V 4.5 surpasses widely used proprietary models such as GPT-4o-latest, and significantly larger open-source models such as Qwen2.5-VL 72B. Notably, the strong performance is achieved with remarkable efficiency. For example, on the widely adopted VideoMME benchmark, MiniCPM-V 4.5 achieves state-of-the-art performance among models under 30B size, using just 46.7\% GPU memory cost and 8.7\% inference time of Qwen2.5-VL 7B.

- **[TurnBack: A Geospatial Route Cognition Benchmark for Large Language Models through Reverse Route](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18173)**  `arXiv:2509.18173`  `cs.LG` `cs.CL`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Humans can interpret geospatial information through natural language, while the geospatial cognition capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) remain underexplored. Prior research in this domain has been constrained by non-quantifiable metrics, limited evaluation datasets and unclear research hierarchies. Therefore, we propose a large-scale benchmark and conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the geospatial route cognition of LLMs. We create a large-scale evaluation dataset comprised of 36000 routes from 12 metropolises worldwide. Then, we introduce PathBuilder, a novel tool for converting natural language instructions into navigation routes, and vice versa, bridging the gap between geospatial information and natural language. Finally, we propose a new evaluation framework and metrics to rigorously assess 11 state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs on the task of route reversal. The benchmark reveals that LLMs exhibit limitation to reverse routes: most reverse routes neither return to the starting point nor are similar to the optimal route. Additionally, LLMs face challenges such as low robustness in route generation and high confidence for their incorrect answers. Code\ \&\ Data available here: \href{this https URL}{TurnBack.}

- **[Small LLMs with Expert Blocks Are Good Enough for Hyperparamter Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15561)**  `arXiv:2509.15561`  `cs.LG` `cs.CL`  
  _Om Naphade, Saksham Bansal, Parikshit Pareek_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Hyper-parameter Tuning (HPT) is a necessary step in machine learning (ML) pipelines but becomes computationally expensive and opaque with larger models. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been explored for HPT, yet most rely on models exceeding 100 billion parameters. We propose an Expert Block Framework for HPT using Small LLMs. At its core is the Trajectory Context Summarizer (TCS), a deterministic block that transforms raw training trajectories into structured context, enabling small LLMs to analyze optimization progress with reliability comparable to larger models. Using two locally-run LLMs (phi4:reasoning14B and qwen2.5-coder:32B) and a 10-trial budget, our TCS-enabled HPT pipeline achieves average performance within ~0.9 percentage points of GPT-4 across six diverse tasks.

- **[Conversational Orientation Reasoning: Egocentric-to-Allocentric Navigation with Multimodal Chain-of-Thought](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18200)**  `arXiv:2509.18200`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI` `cs.CL` `cs.RO`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Conversational agents must translate egocentric utterances (e.g., "on my right") into allocentric orientations (N/E/S/W). This challenge is particularly critical in indoor or complex facilities where GPS signals are weak and detailed maps are unavailable. While chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting has advanced reasoning in language and vision tasks, its application to multimodal spatial orientation remains underexplored. We introduce Conversational Orientation Reasoning (COR), a new benchmark designed for Traditional Chinese conversational navigation projected from real-world environments, addressing egocentric-to-allocentric reasoning in non-English and ASR-transcribed scenarios. We propose a multimodal chain-of-thought (MCoT) framework, which integrates ASR-transcribed speech with landmark coordinates through a structured three-step reasoning process: (1) extracting spatial relations, (2) mapping coordinates to absolute directions, and (3) inferring user orientation. A curriculum learning strategy progressively builds these capabilities on Taiwan-LLM-13B-v2.0-Chat, a mid-sized model representative of resource-constrained settings. Experiments show that MCoT achieves 100% orientation accuracy on clean transcripts and 98.1% with ASR transcripts, substantially outperforming unimodal and non-structured baselines. Moreover, MCoT demonstrates robustness under noisy conversational conditions, including ASR recognition errors and multilingual code-switching. The model also maintains high accuracy in cross-domain evaluation and resilience to linguistic variation, domain shift, and referential ambiguity. These findings highlight the potential of structured MCoT spatial reasoning as a path toward interpretable and resource-efficient embodied navigation.

- **[Is Pre-training Truly Better Than Meta-Learning?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13841)**  `arXiv:2306.13841`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI` `cs.CL` `cs.CV`  
  _Brando Miranda, Patrick Yu, Saumya Goyal, Yu-Xiong Wang, Sanmi Koyejo_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In the context of few-shot learning, it is currently believed that a fixed pre-trained (PT) model, along with fine-tuning the final layer during evaluation, outperforms standard meta-learning algorithms. We re-evaluate these claims under an in-depth empirical examination of an extensive set of formally diverse datasets and compare PT to Model Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML). Unlike previous work, we emphasize a fair comparison by using: the same architecture, the same optimizer, and all models trained to convergence. Crucially, we use a more rigorous statistical tool -- the effect size (Cohen's d) -- to determine the practical significance of the difference between a model trained with PT vs. a MAML. We then use a previously proposed metric -- the diversity coefficient -- to compute the average formal diversity of a dataset. Using this analysis, we demonstrate the following: 1. when the formal diversity of a data set is low, PT beats MAML on average and 2. when the formal diversity is high, MAML beats PT on average. The caveat is that the magnitude of the average difference between a PT vs. MAML using the effect size is low (according to classical statistical thresholds) -- less than 0.2. Nevertheless, this observation is contrary to the currently held belief that a pre-trained model is always better than a meta-learning model. Our extensive experiments consider 21 few-shot learning benchmarks, including the large-scale few-shot learning dataset Meta-Data set. We also show no significant difference between a MAML model vs. a PT model with GPT-2 on Openwebtext. We, therefore, conclude that a pre-trained model does not always beat a meta-learned model and that the formal diversity of a dataset is a driving factor.

- **[Safe-SAIL: Towards a Fine-grained Safety Landscape of Large Language Models via Sparse Autoencoder Interpretation Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18127)**  `arXiv:2509.18127`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI` `cs.CL`

  Increasing deployment of large language models (LLMs) in real-world applications raises significant safety concerns. Most existing safety research focuses on evaluating LLM outputs or specific safety tasks, limiting their ability to ad- dress broader, undefined risks. Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) facilitate interpretability research to clarify model behavior by explaining single-meaning atomic features decomposed from entangled signals. jHowever, prior applications on SAEs do not interpret features with fine-grained safety-related con- cepts, thus inadequately addressing safety-critical behaviors, such as generating toxic responses and violating safety regu- lations. For rigorous safety analysis, we must extract a rich and diverse set of safety-relevant features that effectively capture these high-risk behaviors, yet face two challenges: identifying SAEs with the greatest potential for generating safety concept-specific neurons, and the prohibitively high cost of detailed feature explanation. In this paper, we pro- pose Safe-SAIL, a framework for interpreting SAE features within LLMs to advance mechanistic understanding in safety domains. Our approach systematically identifies SAE with best concept-specific interpretability, explains safety-related neurons, and introduces efficient strategies to scale up the in- terpretation process. We will release a comprehensive toolkit including SAE checkpoints and human-readable neuron ex- planations, which supports empirical analysis of safety risks to promote research on LLM safety.

- **[Clip Your Sequences Fairly: Enforcing Length Fairness for Sequence-Level RL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09177)**  `arXiv:2509.09177`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI` `cs.CL`  
  _Hanyi Mao, Quanjia Xiao, Lei Pang, Haixiao Liu_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We propose FSPO (Fair Sequence Policy Optimization), a sequence-level reinforcement learning method for LLMs that enforces length-fair clipping on the importance-sampling (IS) weight. We study RL methods with sequence-level IS and identify a mismatch when PPO/GRPO-style clipping is transplanted to sequences: a fixed clip range systematically reweights short vs.\ long responses, distorting the optimization direction. FSPO introduces a simple remedy: we clip the sequence log-IS ratio with a band that scales as $\sqrt{L}$. Theoretically, we formalize length fairness via a Length Reweighting Error (LRE) and prove that small LRE yields a cosine directional guarantee between the clipped and true updates. Empirically, FSPO flattens clip rates across length bins, stabilizes training, and outperforms all baselines across multiple evaluation datasets on Qwen3-8B-Base model.

  _Jongyeop Hyun, Bumsoo Kim_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly improved reasoning capabilities, with in-context learning (ICL) emerging as a key technique for adaptation without retraining. While previous works have focused on leveraging correct examples, recent research highlights the importance of learning from errors to enhance performance. However, existing methods lack a structured framework for analyzing and mitigating errors, particularly in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), where integrating visual and textual inputs adds complexity. To address this issue, we propose REFINE: Retrieval-Enhanced Feedback via In-context Neural Error-book, a teacher-student framework that systematically structures errors and provides targeted feedback. REFINE introduces three systematic queries to construct structured feedback -- Feed-Target, Feed-Check, and Feed-Path -- to enhance multimodal reasoning by prioritizing relevant visual information, diagnosing critical failure points, and formulating corrective actions. Unlike prior approaches that rely on redundant retrievals, REFINE optimizes structured feedback retrieval, improving inference efficiency, token usage, and scalability. Our results demonstrate substantial speedup, reduced computational costs, and successful generalization, highlighting REFINE's potential for enhancing multimodal reasoning.

- **[Beyond Input Activations: Identifying Influential Latents by Gradient Sparse Autoencoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08080)**  `arXiv:2505.08080`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI` `cs.CL`  
  _Dong Shu, Xuansheng Wu, Haiyan Zhao, Mengnan Du, Ninghao Liu_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have recently emerged as powerful tools for interpreting and steering the internal representations of large language models (LLMs). However, conventional approaches to analyzing SAEs typically rely solely on input-side activations, without considering the causal influence between each latent feature and the model's output. This work is built on two key hypotheses: (1) activated latents do not contribute equally to the construction of the model's output, and (2) only latents with high causal influence are effective for model steering. To validate these hypotheses, we propose Gradient Sparse Autoencoder (GradSAE), a simple yet effective method that identifies the most influential latents by incorporating output-side gradient information.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed natural language processing, yet their internal mechanisms remain largely opaque. Recently, mechanistic interpretability has attracted significant attention from the research community as a means to understand the inner workings of LLMs. Among various mechanistic interpretability approaches, Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a promising method due to their ability to disentangle the complex, superimposed features within LLMs into more interpretable components. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of SAEs for interpreting and understanding the internal workings of LLMs. Our major contributions include: (1) exploring the technical framework of SAEs, covering basic architecture, design improvements, and effective training strategies; (2) examining different approaches to explaining SAE features, categorized into input-based and output-based explanation methods; (3) discussing evaluation methods for assessing SAE performance, covering both structural and functional metrics; and (4) investigating real-world applications of SAEs in understanding and manipulating LLM behaviors.

- **[Analysis on distribution and clustering of weight](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19122)**  `arXiv:2509.19122`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Chunming Ye, Wenquan Tian, Yalan Gao, Songzhou Li_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The study on architecture and parameter characteristics remains the hot topic in the research of large language models. In this paper we concern with the characteristics of weight which are used to analyze the correlations and differences between models. Two kinds of vectors-standard deviation vector and clustering vector-are proposed to describe features of models. In the first case, the weights are assumed to follow normal distribution. The standard deviation values of projection matrices are normalized to form Standard-Deviation Vector, representing the distribution characteristics of models. In the second case, the singular values from each weight projection matrix are extracted and grouped by K-Means algorithm. The grouped data with the same type matrix are combined as Clustering Vector to represent the correlation characteristics of models' weights. The study reveals that these two vectors can effectively distinguish between different models and clearly show the similarities among models of the same family. Moreover, after conducting LoRA fine-tuning with different datasets and models, it is found that the distribution of weights represented by standard deviation vector is directly influenced by the dataset, but the correlations between different weights represented by clustering vector remain unaffected and maintain a high consistency with the pre-trained model.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Given the widespread use of deep learning models in safety-critical applications, ensuring that the decisions of such models are robust against adversarial exploitation is of fundamental importance. In this thesis, we discuss recent progress toward designing algorithms that exhibit desirable robustness properties. First, we discuss the problem of adversarial examples in computer vision, for which we introduce new technical results, training paradigms, and certification algorithms. Next, we consider the problem of domain generalization, wherein the task is to train neural networks to generalize from a family of training distributions to unseen test distributions. We present new algorithms that achieve state-of-the-art generalization in medical imaging, molecular identification, and image classification. Finally, we study the setting of jailbreaking large language models (LLMs), wherein an adversarial user attempts to design prompts that elicit objectionable content from an LLM. We propose new attacks and defenses, which represent the frontier of progress toward designing robust language-based agents.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  RLVR has enhanced the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) across various tasks. However, GRPO, a representative RLVR algorithm, suffers from a critical limitation: when all responses within a group are either entirely correct or entirely incorrect, the model fails to learn from these homogeneous responses. This is particularly problematic for homogeneously incorrect groups, where GRPO's advantage function yields a value of zero, leading to null gradients and the loss of valuable learning signals. To overcome this issue, we propose NGRPO (Negative-enhanced Group Relative Policy Optimization), an algorithm designed to convert homogeneous errors into robust learning signals. First, NGRPO introduces Advantage Calibration. This mechanism hypothesizes the existence of a virtual maximum-reward sample during advantage calculation, thereby altering the mean and variance of rewards within a group and ensuring that the advantages for homogeneously incorrect samples are no longer zero. Second, NGRPO employs Asymmetric Clipping, which relaxes the update magnitude for positive samples while imposing stricter constraints on that of negative samples. This serves to stabilize the exploration pressure introduced by the advantage calibration. Our experiments on Qwen2.5-Math-7B demonstrate that NGRPO significantly outperforms baselines such as PPO, GRPO, DAPO, and PSR-NSR on mathematical benchmarks including MATH500, AMC23, and AIME2025. These results validate NGRPO's ability to learn from homogeneous errors, leading to stable and substantial improvements in mathematical reasoning. Our code is available atthis https URL.

  _Yuzhen Zhou, Jiajun Li, Yusheng Su, Gowtham Ramesh, Zilin Zhu, Xiang Long, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a cornerstone in advancing large-scale pre-trained language models (LLMs). Successive generations, including GPT-o series, DeepSeek-R1, Kimi-K1.5, Grok 4, and GLM-4.5, have relied on large-scale RL training to enhance reasoning and coding capabilities. To meet the community's growing RL needs, numerous RL frameworks have been proposed. Most of these frameworks primarily rely on inference engines for rollout generation and training engines for policy updates. However, RL training remains computationally expensive, with rollout generation accounting for more than 90% of total runtime. In addition, its efficiency is often constrained by the long-tail distribution of rollout response lengths, where a few lengthy responses stall entire batches, leaving GPUs idle and underutilized. As model and rollout sizes continue to grow, this bottleneck increasingly limits scalability. To address this challenge, we propose Active Partial Rollouts in Reinforcement Learning (APRIL), which mitigates long-tail inefficiency. In the rollout phase, APRIL over-provisions rollout requests, terminates once the target number of responses is reached, and recycles incomplete responses for continuation in future steps. This strategy ensures that no rollouts are discarded while substantially reducing GPU idle time. Experiments show that APRIL improves rollout throughput by at most 44% across commonly used RL algorithms (GRPO, DAPO, GSPO), accelerates convergence, and achieves at most 8% higher final accuracy across tasks. Moreover, APRIL is both framework and hardware agnostic, already integrated into the slime RL framework, and deployable on NVIDIA and AMD GPUs alike. Taken together, this work unifies system-level and algorithmic considerations in proposing APRIL, with the aim of advancing RL training efficiency and inspiring further optimizations in RL systems.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly powerful, the sequential nature of autoregressive generation creates a fundamental throughput bottleneck that limits the practical deployment. While Multi-Token Prediction (MTP) has demonstrated remarkable benefits for model training efficiency and performance, its inherent potential for inference acceleration remains largely unexplored. This paper introduces FastMTP, a simple yet effective method that improves multi-step draft quality by aligning MTP training with its inference pattern, significantly enhancing speculative decoding performance. Our approach fine-tunes a single MTP head with position-shared weights on self-distilled data, enabling it to capture dependencies among consecutive future tokens and maintain high acceptance rates across multiple recursive draft steps. By integrating language-aware dynamic vocabulary compression into the MTP head, we further reduce computational overhead in the drafting process. Experimental results across seven diverse benchmarks demonstrate that FastMTP achieves an average of 2.03x speedup compared to standard next token prediction with lossless output quality, outperforming vanilla MTP by 82%. FastMTP requires only lightweight training and seamlessly integrates with existing inference frameworks, offering a practical and rapidly deployable solution for accelerating LLM inference.

- **[Sparse Training Scheme for Multimodal LLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18150)**  `arXiv:2509.18150`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Kean Shi, Liang Chen, Haozhe Zhao, Baobao Chang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated outstanding performance across a variety of domains. However, training MLLMs is often inefficient due to the significantly longer input sequences introduced by multimodal data and the low utilization of inter-layer computations. To address this challenge, we shift the focus to the training process itself and propose a novel training-efficient framework based on sparse representations, termed the Sparse Training Scheme (STS). This scheme consists of two key components: the Visual Token Compressor, which reduces the information load by compressing visual tokens, and the Layer Dynamic Skipper, which mitigates the computational overhead by dynamically skipping unnecessary layers in the language model during both forward and backward passes. Our approach is broadly applicable to diverse MLLM architectures and has been extensively evaluated on multiple benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness and efficiency.

  Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across various domains, driving significant technological advancements and innovations. Despite the rapid growth in model scale and capability, systematic, data-driven research on how structural configurations affect performance remains scarce. To address this gap, we present a large-scale dataset encompassing diverse open-source LLM structures and their performance across multiple benchmarks. Leveraging this dataset, we conduct a systematic, data mining-driven analysis to validate and quantify the relationship between structural configurations and performance. Our study begins with a review of the historical development of LLMs and an exploration of potential future trends. We then analyze how various structural choices impact performance across benchmarks and further corroborate our findings using mechanistic interpretability techniques. By providing data-driven insights into LLM optimization, our work aims to guide the targeted development and application of future models. We will release our dataset atthis https URL

  In real-world industrial settings, large language models (LLMs) must learn continually to keep pace with diverse and evolving tasks, requiring self-evolution to refine knowledge under dynamic data distributions. However, existing continual learning (CL) approaches, such as replay and parameter isolation, often suffer from catastrophic forgetting: training on new tasks degrades performance on earlier ones by overfitting to the new distribution and weakeningthis http URLpropose MoE-CL, a parameter-efficient adversarial mixture-of-experts framework for industrial-scale, self-evolving continual instruction tuning of LLMs. MoE-CL uses a dual-expert design: (1) a dedicated LoRA expert per task to preserve task-specific knowledge via parameter independence, mitigating forgetting; and (2) a shared LoRA expert to enable cross-task transfer. To prevent transferring task-irrelevant noise through the shared pathway, we integrate a task-aware discriminator within a GAN. The discriminator encourages the shared expert to pass only task-aligned information during sequential training. Through adversarial learning, the shared expert acquires generalized representations that mimic the discriminator, while dedicated experts retain task-specific details, balancing knowledge retention and cross-task generalization and thereby supportingthis http URLexperiments on the public MTL5 benchmark and an industrial Tencent3 benchmark validate the effectiveness of MoE-CL for continual instruction tuning.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The efficiency of Bayesian optimization (BO) relies heavily on the choice of the Gaussian process (GP) kernel, which plays a central role in balancing exploration and exploitation under limited evaluation budgets. Traditional BO methods often rely on fixed or heuristic kernel selection strategies, which can result in slow convergence or suboptimal solutions when the chosen kernel is poorly suited to the underlying objective function. To address this limitation, we propose a freshly-baked Context-Aware Kernel Evolution (CAKE) to enhance BO with large language models (LLMs). Concretely, CAKE leverages LLMs as the crossover and mutation operators to adaptively generate and refine GP kernels based on the observed data throughout the optimization process. To maximize the power of CAKE, we further propose BIC-Acquisition Kernel Ranking (BAKER) to select the most effective kernel through balancing the model fit measured by the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) with the expected improvement at each iteration of BO. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our fresh CAKE-based BO method consistently outperforms established baselines across a range of real-world tasks, including hyperparameter optimization, controller tuning, and photonic chip design.

  Bold claims about AI's role in science-from "AGI will cure all diseases" to promises of radically accelerated discovery-raise a central epistemic question: do large language models (LLMs) truly generate new knowledge, or do they merely remix memorized fragments? We propose unlearning-as-ablation as a falsifiable probe of constructive scientific discovery. The idea is to systematically remove a target result together with its forget-closure (supporting lemmas, paraphrases, and multi-hop entailments) and then evaluate whether the model can re-derive the result from only permitted axioms and tools. Success would indicate generative capability beyond recall; failure would expose current limits. Unlike prevailing motivations for unlearning-privacy, copyright, or safety-our framing repositions it as an epistemic probe for AI-for-Science. We outline a minimal pilot in mathematics and algorithms to illustrate feasibility, and sketch how the same approach could later be extended to domains such as physics or chemistry. This is a position paper: our contribution is conceptual and methodological, not empirical. We aim to stimulate discussion on how principled ablation tests could help distinguish models that reconstruct knowledge from those that merely retrieve it, and how such probes might guide the next generation of AI-for-Science benchmarks.

  Reinforcement Learning (RL) is increasingly utilized to enhance the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, effectively scaling these RL methods presents significant challenges, primarily due to the difficulty in maintaining high AI accelerator utilization without generating stale, off-policy data that harms common RL algorithms. This paper introduces PipelineRL, an approach designed to achieve a superior trade-off between hardware efficiency and data on-policyness for LLM training. PipelineRL employs concurrent asynchronous data generation and model training, distinguished by the novel in-flight weight updates. This mechanism allows the LLM generation engine to receive updated model weights with minimal interruption during the generation of token sequences, thereby maximizing both the accelerator utilization and the freshness of training data. Experiments conducted on long-form reasoning tasks using 128 H100 GPUs demonstrate that PipelineRL achieves approximately $\sim 2x$ faster learning compared to conventional RL baselines while maintaining highly on-policy training data. A scalable and modular open-source implementation of PipelineRL is also released as a key contribution.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in multimodal large language models (LLMs) have led to significant progress in understanding, generation, and retrieval tasks. However, current solutions often treat these tasks in isolation or require training LLMs from scratch, resulting in high computational costs and limited generalization across modalities. In this work, we present OmniBridge, a unified and modular multimodal framework that supports vision-language understanding, generation, and retrieval within a unified architecture. OmniBridge adopts a language-centric design that reuses pretrained LLMs and introduces a lightweight bidirectional latent alignment module. To address the challenge of task interference, we propose a two-stage decoupled training strategy: supervised fine-tuning and latent space alignment for aligning LLM behavior with multimodal reasoning, and semantic-guided diffusion training to align cross-modal latent spaces via learnable query embeddings. Extensive experiments across a wide range of benchmarks demonstrate that OmniBridge achieves competitive or state-of-the-art performance in all three tasks. Moreover, our results highlight the effectiveness of latent space alignment for unifying multimodal modeling under a shared representation space. Code and models are released atthis https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Low-rank architectures have become increasingly important for efficient large language model (LLM) pre-training, providing substantial reductions in both parameter complexity and memory/computational demands. Despite these advantages, current low-rank methods face three critical shortcomings: (1) compromised model performance, (2) considerable computational overhead, and (3) limited activation memory savings. To address these limitations, we propose Cross-layer Low-Rank residual Network (CR-Net), an innovative parameter-efficient framework inspired by our discovery that inter-layer activation residuals possess low-rank properties. CR-Net implements this insight through a dual-path architecture that efficiently reconstructs layer activations by combining previous-layer outputs with their low-rank differences, thereby maintaining high-rank information with minimal parameters. We further develop a specialized activation recomputation strategy tailored for CR-Net that dramatically reduces memory requirements. Extensive pre-training experiments across model scales from 60M to 7B parameters demonstrate that CR-Net consistently outperforms state-of-the-art low-rank frameworks while requiring fewer computational resources and less memory.

  This paper presents a novel approach to e-commerce payment fraud detection by integrating reinforcement learning (RL) with Large Language Models (LLMs). By framing transaction risk as a multi-step Markov Decision Process (MDP), RL optimizes risk detection across multiple payment stages. Crafting effective reward functions, essential for RL model success, typically requires significant human expertise due to the complexity and variability in design. LLMs, with their advanced reasoning and coding capabilities, are well-suited to refine these functions, offering improvements over traditional methods. Our approach leverages LLMs to iteratively enhance reward functions, achieving better fraud detection accuracy and demonstrating zero-shot capability. Experiments with real-world data confirm the effectiveness, robustness, and resilience of our LLM-enhanced RL framework through long-term evaluations, underscoring the potential of LLMs in advancing industrial RL applications.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in interactive decision-making tasks, but existing methods often struggle with error accumulation and lack robust self-correction mechanisms. We introduce "Reflect before Act" (REBACT), a novel approach that enhances LLM-based decision-making by introducing a critical reflect step prior to taking the next action. This approach allows for immediate error correction, ensuring smooth action path and adaptibity to environment feedback. We evaluate REBACT on three diverse interactive environments: ALFWorld, WebShop, and TextCraft. Our results demonstrate that REBACT significantly outperforms strong baselines, improving success rates by up to 24% on WebShop (achieving 61%), 6.72% on ALFWorld (achieving 98.51%), and 0.5% on TextCraft (achieving 99.5%) using Claude3.5-sonnet as the underlying LLM. Further analysis reveals that REBACT's performance improvements are achieved with only a few modification steps, demonstrating its computational efficiency.

  Dementia is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder with multiple etiologies, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, frontotemporal dementia, and vascular dementia. Its clinical and biological heterogeneity makes diagnosis and subtype differentiation highly challenging. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have recently shown strong potential in modeling brain connectivity, but their limited robustness, data scarcity, and lack of interpretability constrain clinical adoption. Explainable Graph Neural Networks (XGNNs) have emerged to address these barriers by combining graph-based learning with interpretability, enabling the identification of disease-relevant biomarkers, analysis of brain network disruptions, and provision of transparent insights for clinicians. This paper presents the first comprehensive review dedicated to XGNNs in dementia research. We examine their applications across Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, mild cognitive impairment, and multi-disease diagnosis. A taxonomy of explainability methods tailored for dementia-related tasks is introduced, alongside comparisons of existing models in clinical scenarios. We also highlight challenges such as limited generalizability, underexplored domains, and the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) for early detection. By outlining both progress and open problems, this review aims to guide future work toward trustworthy, clinically meaningful, and scalable use of XGNNs in dementia research.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  With the advent of large language models (LLMs), numerous Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) strategies have been proposed to alleviate deployment barriers created by their enormous parameter counts. Quantization achieves compression by limiting the number of representable points in the data. Therefore, the key to achieving efficient quantization is selecting the optimal combination of representation points, or codes, for the given data. Existing PTQ solutions adopt two major approaches to this problem: Round-To-Nearest (RTN)-based methods and codebook-based methods. RTN-based methods map LLM weights onto uniformly distributed integer grids, failing to account for the Gaussian-like weight distribution of LLM weights. Codebook-based methods mitigate this issue by constructing distribution-aware codebooks; however, they suffer from random and strided memory access patterns, resulting in degraded inference speed that is exacerbated by the limited size of GPU L1 cache. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel LLM quantization method, SBVR (Summation of BitVector Representation), that enables Gaussian-like code representation in a hardware-friendly manner for fast inference. SBVR maps weight values to non-uniform representation points whose distribution follows the actual distribution of LLM weights, enabling more accurate compression. Additionally, we design a custom CUDA kernel that allows matrix-vector multiplication directly in the SBVR format without decompression, thereby enabling high-performance execution of SBVR-compressed models. Our evaluations of SBVR on various models demonstrate state-of-the-art perplexity and accuracy benchmark performance while delivering a 2.21x- 3.04x end-to-end token-generation speedup over naive FP16 models in the 4-bit quantization regime.

  With the rapid development of mobile communication technologies, future mobile networks will offer vast services and resources for commuting, production, daily life, and entertainment. Accurate and efficient forecasting of mobile data (e.g., cell traffic, user behavior, channel quality) helps operators monitor network state changes, orchestrate wireless resources, and schedule infrastructure and users, thereby improving supply efficiency and service quality. However, current forecasting paradigms rely on customized designs with tailored models for exclusive data types. Such approaches increase complexity and deployment costs under large-scale, heterogeneous networks involving base stations, users, and channels. In this paper, we design a foundation model for mobile data forecasting, MobiGPT, with a unified structure capable of forecasting three data types: base station traffic, user app usage, and channel quality. We propose a soft-prompt learning method to help the model understand features of different data types, and introduce a temporal masking mechanism to guide the model through three forecasting tasks: short-term prediction, long-term prediction, and distribution generation, supporting diverse optimization scenarios. Evaluations on real-world datasets with over 100,000 samples show that MobiGPT achieves accurate multi-type forecasting. Compared to existing models, it improves forecasting accuracy by 27.37%, 20.08%, and 7.27%, reflecting strong generalization. Moreover, MobiGPT exhibits superior zero/few-shot performance in unseen scenarios, with over 21.51% improvement, validating its strong transferability as a foundation model.

  Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) have emerged as a new architecture following auto regressive models. Their denoising process offers a powerful generative advantage, but they present significant challenges in learning and understanding numerically sensitive mathematical and order-sensitive logical tasks. Current training methods, including pre-training, fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning, focus primarily on improving general knowledge retention and reasoning abilities, but lack a comprehensive understanding of mathematical and logical patterns. We propose DSFT, a simple yet effective Diffusion SFT strategy, by adjusting the masking strategy and loss function, guiding models to understand mathematical and logical patterns. This strategy can be flexibly combined with pre-training, reinforcement learning, and other training methods. Validated on models such as LLaDA and Dream series, we prove that DSFT on small-scale data can achieve improvements of 5-10% and approximately 2% on mathematical and logical problems, respectively. This inspiring masking approach offers insights for future learning of specific patterns, which can be easily and efficiently combined with other training methods and applied to various dLLMs. Our code is publicly available atthis https URL

  Autoregressive inference in large transformer-based language models (LLMs) presents significant challenges for runtime efficiency, particularly during the decode phase where load imbalance across GPU shards can cause throughput degradation and latency spikes. A DPU-assisted framework leveraged by BlueField-3 Data Processing Units can enable real-time detection and mitigation of load imbalance in multi-node tensor-parallel inference. By offloading monitoring tasks to the DPU and analyzing GPU telemetry and inter-node communication patterns, the resulting system can provide actionable feedback to inference controllers and schedulers. The goal of this study is three-fold i) identify the reported skews/imbalances/pathological conditions that arise in muti-GPU execution of a) LLM tensor computing (both during training and inference), b) identify their impact on computational performance, and c) make a critical assessment if those can be tracked for potential mitigation from a DPU network.

  Foundation models (FMs) and large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities across diverse domains through training on massive datasets. These models have demonstrated exceptional performance in healthcare applications, yet their potential for electronic fetal monitoring (EFM)/cardiotocography (CTG) analysis, a critical technology for evaluating fetal well-being, remains largely underexplored. Antepartum CTG interpretation presents unique challenges due to the complex nature of fetal heart rate (FHR) patterns and uterine activity, requiring sophisticated analysis of long time-series data. The assessment of CTG is heavily based on subjective clinical interpretation, often leading to variability in diagnostic accuracy and deviation from timely pregnancy care. This study presents the first comprehensive comparison of state-of-the-art AI approaches for automated antepartum CTG analysis. We systematically compare time-series FMs and LLMs against established CTG-specific architectures. Our evaluation encompasses over 500 CTG recordings of varying durations reflecting real-world clinical recordings, providing robust performance benchmarks across different modelling paradigms. Our results demonstrate that fine-tuned LLMs achieve superior performance compared to both foundation models and domain-specific approaches, offering a promising alternative pathway for clinical CTG interpretation. These findings provide critical insights into the relative strengths of different AI methodologies for fetal monitoring applications and establish a foundation for future clinical AI development in prenatal care.

  In this paper, we introduce a novel weighted co-training approach that is guided by Large Language Models (LLMs). Namely, in our co-training approach, we use LLM labels on unlabeled data as target labels and co-train two encoder-only based networks that train each other over multiple iterations: first, all samples are forwarded through each network and historical estimates of each network's confidence in the LLM label are recorded; second, a dynamic importance weight is derived for each sample according to each network's belief in the quality of the LLM label for that sample; finally, the two networks exchange importance weights with each other -- each network back-propagates all samples weighted with the importance weights coming from its peer network and updates its own parameters. By strategically utilizing LLM-generated guidance, our approach significantly outperforms conventional SSL methods, particularly in settings with abundant unlabeled data. Empirical results show that it achieves state-of-the-art performance on 4 out of 5 benchmark datasets and ranks first among 14 compared methods according to the Friedman test. Our results highlight a new direction in semi-supervised learning -- where LLMs serve as knowledge amplifiers, enabling backbone co-training models to achieve state-of-the-art performance efficiently.

  Reinforcement learning with verifiable reward (RLVR) has become a promising paradigm for post-training large language models (LLMs) to improve their reasoning capability. However, when the rollout accuracy is low on hard problems, the reward becomes sparse, limiting learning efficiency and causing exploration bottlenecks. Existing approaches either rely on teacher models for distillation or filter out difficult problems, which limits scalability or restricts reasoning improvement through exploration.We propose EvoCoT, a self-evolving curriculum learning framework based on two-stage chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning optimization. EvoCoT constrains the exploration space by self-generating and verifying CoT trajectories, then gradually shortens CoT steps to expand the space in a controlled way. The framework enables LLMs to stably learn from initially unsolved hard problems under sparse rewards. We apply EvoCoT to multiple LLM families, including Qwen, DeepSeek, and Llama. Experiments show that EvoCoT enables LLMs to solve previously unsolved problems, improves reasoning capability without external CoT supervision, and is compatible with various RL fine-tuning methods. We release the source code to support future research.

  Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being deployed on mobile devices, but the limited DRAM capacity constrains the deployable model size. This paper introduces ActiveFlow, the first LLM inference framework that can achieve adaptive DRAM usage for modern LLMs (not ReLU-based), enabling the scaling up of deployable model sizes. The framework is based on the novel concept of active weight DRAM-flash swapping and incorporates three novel techniques: (1) Cross-layer active weights preloading. It uses the activations from the current layer to predict the active weights of several subsequent layers, enabling computation and data loading to overlap, as well as facilitating large I/O transfers. (2) Sparsity-aware self-distillation. It adjusts the active weights to align with the dense-model output distribution, compensating for approximations introduced by contextual sparsity. (3) Active weight DRAM-flash swapping pipeline. It orchestrates the DRAM space allocation among the hot weight cache, preloaded active weights, and computation-involved weights based on available memory. Results show ActiveFlow achieves the performance-cost Pareto frontier compared to existing efficiency optimization methods.

  Arabic document OCR remains a challenging task due to the language's cursive script, diverse fonts, diacritics, and right-to-left orientation. While modern Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have advanced document understanding for high-resource languages, their performance on Arabic remains limited. In this work, we introduce Baseer, a vision-language model fine- tuned specifically for Arabic document OCR. Leveraging a large-scale dataset combining synthetic and real-world documents, Baseer is trained using a decoder-only fine-tuning strategy to adapt a pre-trained MLLM while preserving general visual features. We also present Misraj-DocOCR, a high-quality, expert-verified benchmark designed for rigorous evaluation of Arabic OCR systems. Our experiments show that Baseer significantly outperforms existing open-source and commercial solutions, achieving a WER of 0.25 and establishing a new state-of-the-art in the domain of Arabic document OCR. Our results highlight the benefits of domain-specific adaptation of general-purpose MLLMs and establish a strong baseline for high-accuracy OCR on morphologically rich languages like Arabic.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Speculative decoding is a widely adopted technique for accelerating inference in large language models (LLMs), yet its application to vision-language models (VLMs) remains underexplored, with existing methods achieving only modest speedups (<1.5x). This gap is increasingly significant as multimodal capabilities become central to large-scale models. We hypothesize that large VLMs can effectively filter redundant image information layer by layer without compromising textual comprehension, whereas smaller draft models struggle to do so. To address this, we introduce Vision-Aware Speculative Decoding (ViSpec), a novel framework tailored for VLMs. ViSpec employs a lightweight vision adaptor module to compress image tokens into a compact representation, which is seamlessly integrated into the draft model's attention mechanism while preserving original image positional information. Additionally, we extract a global feature vector for each input image and augment all subsequent text tokens with this feature to enhance multimodal coherence. To overcome the scarcity of multimodal datasets with long assistant responses, we curate a specialized training dataset by repurposing existing datasets and generating extended outputs using the target VLM with modified prompts. Our training strategy mitigates the risk of the draft model exploiting direct access to the target model's hidden states, which could otherwise lead to shortcut learning when training solely on target model outputs. Extensive experiments validate ViSpec, achieving, to our knowledge, the first substantial speedup in VLM speculative decoding. Code is available atthis https URL.

  While deep learning, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs), has significantly advanced classification performance, its typical reliance on extensive annotated datasets presents a major obstacle in many practical scenarios where such data is scarce. Vision-language models (VLMs) and transfer learning with pre-trained visual models appear as promising techniques to deal with this problem. This paper proposes a novel zero-shot image classification framework that combines a VLM and a pre-trained visual model within a self-learning cycle. Requiring only the set of class names and no labeled training data, our method utilizes a confidence-based pseudo-labeling strategy to train a lightweight classifier directly on the test data, enabling dynamic adaptation. The VLM identifies high-confidence samples, and the pre-trained visual model enhances their visual representations. These enhanced features then iteratively train the classifier, allowing the system to capture complementary semantic and visual cues without supervision. Notably, our approach avoids VLM fine-tuning and the use of large language models, relying on the visual-only model to reduce the dependence on semantic representation. Experimental evaluations on ten diverse datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms the baseline zero-shot method.

EMMA maximizes the utility of world knowledge from the pre-trained large language models, by representing all non-sensor inputs (e.g. navigation instructions and ego vehicle status) and outputs (e.g. trajectories and 3D locations) as natural language text. This approach allows EMMA to jointly process various driving tasks in a unified language space, and generate the outputs for each task using task-specific prompts. Empirically, we demonstrate EMMA's effectiveness by achieving state-of-the-art performance in motion planning on nuScenes as well as competitive results on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD). EMMA also yields competitive results for camera-primary 3D object detection on the Waymo Open Dataset (WOD). We show that co-training EMMA with planner trajectories, object detection, and road graph tasks yields improvements across all three domains, highlighting EMMA's potential as a generalist model for autonomous driving applications. We hope that our results will inspire research to further evolve the state of the art in autonomous driving model architectures.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have significantly enhanced video understanding capabilities, opening new possibilities for practical applications. Yet current video benchmarks focus largely on indoor scenes or short-range outdoor activities, leaving the challenges associated with long-distance travel largely unexplored. Mastering extended geospatial-temporal trajectories is critical for next-generation MLLMs, underpinning real-world tasks such as embodied-AI planning and navigation. To bridge this gap, we present VIR-Bench, a novel benchmark consisting of 200 travel videos that frames itinerary reconstruction as a challenging task designed to evaluate and push forward MLLMs' geospatial-temporal intelligence. Experimental results reveal that state-of-the-art MLLMs, including proprietary ones, struggle to achieve high scores, underscoring the difficulty of handling videos that span extended spatial and temporal scales. Moreover, we conduct an in-depth case study in which we develop a prototype travel-planning agent that leverages the insights gained from VIR-Bench. The agent's markedly improved itinerary recommendations verify that our evaluation protocol not only benchmarks models effectively but also translates into concrete performance gains in user-facing applications.

  _Junhao Su, Yuanliang Wan, Junwei Yang, Hengyu Shi, Tianyang Han, Junfeng Luo, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Tool-augmented large language models (LLMs) are usually trained with supervised imitation or coarse-grained reinforcement learning that optimizes single tool calls. Current self-reflection practices rely on heuristic prompts or one-way reasoning: the model is urged to 'think more' instead of learning error diagnosis and repair. This is fragile in multi-turn interactions; after a failure the model often repeats the same mistake. We propose structured reflection, which turns the path from error to repair into an explicit, controllable, and trainable action. The agent produces a short yet precise reflection: it diagnoses the failure using evidence from the previous step and then proposes a correct, executable follow-up call. For training we combine DAPO and GSPO objectives with a reward scheme tailored to tool use, optimizing the stepwise strategy Reflect, then Call, then Final. To evaluate, we introduce Tool-Reflection-Bench, a lightweight benchmark that programmatically checks structural validity, executability, parameter correctness, and result consistency. Tasks are built as mini trajectories of erroneous call, reflection, and corrected call, with disjoint train and test splits. Experiments on BFCL v3 and Tool-Reflection-Bench show large gains in multi-turn tool-call success and error recovery, and a reduction of redundant calls. These results indicate that making reflection explicit and optimizing it directly improves the reliability of tool interaction and offers a reproducible path for agents to learn from failure.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The success of Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly propelled the research of video understanding. To harvest the benefits of well-trained expert models (i.e., tools), video LLMs prioritize the exploration of tool usage capabilities. Existing methods either prompt closed-source LLMs or employ the instruction tuning paradigm for tool-use fine-tuning. These methods, however, assume an established repository of fixed tools and struggle to generalize to real-world environments where tool data is perpetually evolving and streaming in. To this end, we propose to enhance open-source video LLMs with COntinuaL Tool usage (termed COLT), which automatically acquires tool-use ability in a successive tool stream without suffering 'catastrophic forgetting' of the past learned tools. Specifically, our COLT incorporates a learnable tool codebook as a tool-specific memory system. Then relevant tools are dynamically selected based on the similarity between user instruction and tool features within the codebook. To unleash the tool usage potential of video LLMs, we collect a video-centric tool-use instruction tuning dataset VideoToolBench. Extensive experiments on both previous video LLM benchmarks and the tool-use-specific VideoToolBench dataset demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our proposed COLT.

  Checks remain a foundational instrument in the financial ecosystem, facilitating substantial transaction volumes across institutions. However, their continued use also renders them a persistent target for fraud, underscoring the importance of robust check fraud detection mechanisms. At the core of such systems lies the accurate identification and localization of critical fields, such as the signature, magnetic ink character recognition (MICR) line, courtesy amount, legal amount, payee, and payer, which are essential for subsequent verification against reference checks belonging to the same customer. This field-level detection is traditionally dependent on object detection models trained on large, diverse, and meticulously labeled datasets, a resource that is scarce due to proprietary and privacy concerns. In this paper, we introduce a novel, training-free framework for automated check field detection, leveraging the power of a vision language model (VLM) in conjunction with a multimodal large language model (MLLM). Our approach enables zero-shot detection of check components, significantly lowering the barrier to deployment in real-world financial settings. Quantitative evaluation of our model on a hand-curated dataset of 110 checks spanning multiple formats and layouts demonstrates strong performance and generalization capability. Furthermore, this framework can serve as a bootstrap mechanism for generating high-quality labeled datasets, enabling the development of specialized real-time object detection models tailored to institutional needs.

  We present Qianfan-VL, a series of multimodal large language models ranging from 3B to 70B parameters, achieving state-of-the-art performance through innovative domain enhancement techniques. Our approach employs multi-stage progressive training and high-precision data synthesis pipelines, which prove to be critical technologies for enhancing domain-specific capabilities while maintaining strong general performance. Qianfan-VL achieves comparable results to leading open-source models on general benchmarks, with state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks such as CCBench, SEEDBench IMG, ScienceQA, and MMStar. The domain enhancement strategy delivers significant advantages in OCR and document understanding, validated on both public benchmarks (OCRBench 873, DocVQA 94.75%) and in-house evaluations. Notably, Qianfan-VL-8B and 70B variants incorporate long chain-of-thought capabilities, demonstrating superior performance on mathematical reasoning (MathVista 78.6%) and logical inference tasks. All models are trained entirely on Baidu's Kunlun P800 chips, validating the capability of large-scale AI infrastructure to train SOTA-level multimodal models with over 90% scaling efficiency on 5000 chips for a single task. This work establishes an effective methodology for developing domain-enhanced multimodal models suitable for diverse enterprise deployment scenarios.

  Recent advances in Artificial Intelligence Generated Content have led to highly realistic synthetic videos, particularly in human-centric scenarios involving speech, gestures, and full-body motion, posing serious threats to information authenticity and public trust. Unlike DeepFake techniques that focus on localized facial manipulation, human-centric video generation methods can synthesize entire human bodies with controllable movements, enabling complex interactions with environments, objects, and even other people. However, existing detection methods largely overlook the growing risks posed by such full-body synthetic content. Meanwhile, a growing body of research has explored leveraging LLMs for interpretable fake detection, aiming to explain decisions in natural language. Yet these approaches heavily depend on supervised fine-tuning, which introduces limitations such as annotation bias, hallucinated supervision, and weakened generalization. To address these challenges, we propose AvatarShield, a novel multimodal human-centric synthetic video detection framework that eliminates the need for dense textual supervision by adopting Group Relative Policy Optimization, enabling LLMs to develop reasoning capabilities from simple binary labels. Our architecture combines a discrete vision tower for high-level semantic inconsistencies and a residual extractor for fine-grained artifact analysis. We further introduce FakeHumanVid, a large-scale benchmark containing 15K real and synthetic videos across nine state-of-the-art human generation methods driven by text, pose, or audio. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AvatarShield outperforms existing methods in both in-domain and cross-domain settings.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The event-based Vision-Language Model (VLM) recently has made good progress for practical vision tasks. However, most of these works just utilize CLIP for focusing on traditional perception tasks, which obstruct model understanding explicitly the sufficient semantics and context from event streams. To address the deficiency, we propose EventVL, the first generative event-based MLLM (Multimodal Large Language Model) framework for explicit semantic understanding. Specifically, to bridge the data gap for connecting different modalities semantics, we first annotate a large event-image/video-text dataset, containing almost 1.4 million high-quality pairs of data, which enables effective learning across various scenes, e.g., drive scene or human motion. After that, we design Event Spatiotemporal Representation to fully explore the comprehensive information by diversely aggregating and segmenting the event stream. To further promote a compact semantic space, Dynamic Semantic Alignment is introduced to improve and complete sparse semantic spaces of events. Extensive experiments show that our EventVL can significantly surpass existing MLLM baselines in event captioning and scene description generation tasks. We hope our research could contribute to the development of the event vision community.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Contrastively-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have become the standard approach for learning discriminative vision-language representations. However, these models often exhibit shallow language understanding, manifesting bag-of-words behaviour. These limitations are reinforced by their dual-encoder design, which induces a modality gap. Additionally, the reliance on vast web-collected data corpora for training makes the process computationally expensive and introduces significant privacy concerns. To address these limitations, in this work, we challenge the necessity of vision encoders for retrieval tasks by introducing a vision-free, single-encoder retrieval pipeline. Departing from the traditional text-to-image retrieval paradigm, we migrate to a text-to-text paradigm with the assistance of VLLM-generated structured image descriptions. We demonstrate that this paradigm shift has significant advantages, including a substantial reduction of the modality gap, improved compositionality, and better performance on short and long caption queries, all attainable with only a few hours of calibration on two GPUs. Additionally, substituting raw images with textual descriptions introduces a more privacy-friendly alternative for retrieval. To further assess generalisation and address some of the shortcomings of prior compositionality benchmarks, we release two benchmarks derived from Flickr30k and COCO, containing diverse compositional queries made of short captions, which we coin subFlickr and subCOCO. Our vision-free retriever matches and often surpasses traditional multimodal models. Importantly, our approach achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on multiple retrieval and compositionality benchmarks, with models as small as 0.3B parameters.

  Chain of thought reasoning has demonstrated remarkable success in large language models, yet its adaptation to vision-language reasoning remains an open challenge with unclear best practices. Existing attempts typically employ reasoning chains at a coarse-grained level, which struggles to perform fine-grained structured reasoning and, more importantly, are difficult to evaluate the reward and quality of intermediate reasoning. In this work, we delve into chain of step reasoning for vision-language models, enabling assessing reasoning step quality accurately and leading to effective reinforcement learning and inference-time scaling with fine-grained rewards. We present a simple, effective, and fully transparent framework, including the step-level reasoning data, process reward model (PRM), and reinforcement learning training. With the proposed approaches, our models set strong baselines with consistent improvements on challenging vision-language benchmarks. More importantly, we conduct a thorough empirical analysis and ablation study, unveiling the impact of each component and several intriguing properties of inference-time scaling. We believe this paper serves as a baseline for vision-language models and offers insights into more complex multimodal reasoning. Our dataset, PRM, and code will be available atthis https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This study evaluates the capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision Language Models (VLMs) in the task of single-label classification of Christian Iconography. The goal was to assess whether general-purpose VLMs (CLIP and SigLIP) and LLMs, such as GPT-4o and Gemini 2.5, can interpret the Iconography, typically addressed by supervised classifiers, and evaluate their performance. Two research questions guided the analysis: (RQ1) How do multimodal LLMs perform on image classification of Christian saints? And (RQ2), how does performance vary when enriching input with contextual information or few-shot exemplars? We conducted a benchmarking study using three datasets supporting Iconclass natively: ArtDL, ICONCLASS, and Wikidata, filtered to include the top 10 most frequent classes. Models were tested under three conditions: (1) classification using class labels, (2) classification with Iconclass descriptions, and (3) few-shot learning with five exemplars. Results were compared against ResNet50 baselines fine-tuned on the same datasets. The findings show that Gemini-2.5 Pro and GPT-4o outperformed the ResNet50 baselines. Accuracy dropped significantly on the Wikidata dataset, where Siglip reached the highest accuracy score, suggesting model sensitivity to image size and metadata alignment. Enriching prompts with class descriptions generally improved zero-shot performance, while few-shot learning produced lower results, with only occasional and minimal increments in accuracy. We conclude that general-purpose multimodal LLMs are capable of classification in visually complex cultural heritage domains. These results support the application of LLMs as metadata curation tools in digital humanities workflows, suggesting future research on prompt optimization and the expansion of the study to other classification strategies and models.

  Fusing cross-category objects to a single coherent object has gained increasing attention in text-to-image (T2I) generation due to its broad applications in virtual reality, digital media, film, and gaming. However, existing methods often produce biased, visually chaotic, or semantically inconsistent results due to overlapping artifacts and poor integration. Moreover, progress in this field has been limited by the absence of a comprehensive benchmark dataset. To address these problems, we propose \textbf{Adaptive Group Swapping (AGSwap)}, a simple yet highly effective approach comprising two key components: (1) Group-wise Embedding Swapping, which fuses semantic attributes from different concepts through feature manipulation, and (2) Adaptive Group Updating, a dynamic optimization mechanism guided by a balance evaluation score to ensure coherent synthesis. Additionally, we introduce \textbf{Cross-category Object Fusion (COF)}, a large-scale, hierarchically structured dataset built upon ImageNet-1K and WordNet. COF includes 95 superclasses, each with 10 subclasses, enabling 451,250 unique fusion pairs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AGSwap outperforms state-of-the-art compositional T2I methods, including GPT-Image-1 using simple and complex prompts.

  Open-set land-cover analysis in remote sensing requires the ability to achieve fine-grained spatial localization and semantically open categorization. This involves not only detecting and segmenting novel objects without categorical supervision but also assigning them interpretable semantic labels through multimodal reasoning. In this study, we introduce OSDA, an integrated three-stage framework for annotation-free open-set land-cover discovery, segmentation, and description. The pipeline consists of: (1) precise discovery and mask extraction with a promptable fine-tuned segmentation model (SAM), (2) semantic attribution and contextual description via a two-phase fine-tuned multimodal large language model (MLLM), and (3) LLM-as-judge and manual scoring of the MLLMs evaluation. By combining pixel-level accuracy with high-level semantic understanding, OSDA addresses key challenges in open-world remote sensing interpretation. Designed to be architecture-agnostic and label-free, the framework supports robust evaluation across diverse satellite imagery without requiring manual annotation. Our work provides a scalable and interpretable solution for dynamic land-cover monitoring, showing strong potential for automated cartographic updating and large-scale earth observation analysis.

  While editing directly from life, photographers have found it too difficult to see simultaneously both the blue and the sky. Photographer and curator, Szarkowski insightfully revealed one of the notable gaps between general and aesthetic visual understanding: while the former focuses on identifying the factual element in an image (sky), the latter transcends such object identification, viewing it instead as an aesthetic component--a pure color block (blue). Such fundamental distinctions between general (detection, localization, etc.) and aesthetic (color, lighting, composition, etc.) visual understanding present a significant challenge for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Although some recent works have made initial explorations, they are often limited to general and basic aesthetic commonsense. As a result, they frequently fall short in real-world scenarios (Fig. 1), which require extensive expertise--including photographic techniques, photo pre/post-processing knowledge, and more, to provide a detailed analysis and description. To fundamentally enhance the aesthetics understanding of MLLMs, we first introduce a novel dataset, PhotoCritique, derived from extensive discussions among professional photographers and enthusiasts, and characterized by the large scale, expertise, and diversity. Then, to better learn visual aesthetics from PhotoCritique, we furthur propose a novel model, PhotoEye, featuring a languageguided multi-view vision fusion mechanism to understand image aesthetics from multiple perspectives. Finally, we present a novel benchmark, PhotoBench, a comprehensive and professional benchmark for aesthetic visual understanding. On existing benchmarks and PhotoBench, our model demonstrates clear advantages over existing models.

  Real-time threat monitoring identifies threatening behaviors in video streams and provides reasoning and assessment of threat events through explanatory text. However, prevailing methodologies, whether based on supervised learning or generative models, struggle to concurrently satisfy the demanding requirements of real-time performance and decision explainability. To bridge this gap, we introduce Live-E2T, a novel framework that unifies these two objectives through three synergistic mechanisms. First, we deconstruct video frames into structured Human-Object-Interaction-Place semantic tuples. This approach creates a compact, semantically focused representation, circumventing the information degradation common in conventional feature compression. Second, an efficient online event deduplication and updating mechanism is proposed to filter spatio-temporal redundancies, ensuring the system's real time responsiveness. Finally, we fine-tune a Large Language Model using a Chain-of-Thought strategy, endow it with the capability for transparent and logical reasoning over event sequences to produce coherent threat assessment reports. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, including XD-Violence and UCF-Crime, demonstrate that Live-E2T significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of threat detection accuracy, real-time efficiency, and the crucial dimension of explainability.

  Vision language models (VLMs) show strong results on chart understanding, yet existing benchmarks assume clean figures and fact based queries. Real world charts often contain distortions and demand reasoning beyond simple matching. We evaluate ChatGPT 4o, Claude Sonnet 4, and Gemini 2.5 Pro, finding sharp performance drops under corruption or occlusion, with hallucinations such as value fabrication, trend misinterpretation, and entity confusion becoming more frequent. Models remain overconfident in degraded settings, generating plausible but unsupported explanations.To address this gap, we introduce CHART NOISe(Chart Hallucinations, Answers, and Reasoning Testing on Noisy and Occluded Input Selections), a dataset combining chart corruptions, occlusions, and exam style multiple choice questions inspired by Korea's CSAT English section. A key innovation is prompt reverse inconsistency, where models contradict themselves when asked to confirm versus deny the same statement. Our contributions are threefold: (1) benchmarking state of the art VLMs, exposing systematic vulnerabilities in chart reasoning; (2) releasing CHART NOISe, the first dataset unifying corruption, occlusion, and reverse inconsistency; and (3) proposing baseline mitigation strategies such as quality filtering and occlusion detection. Together, these efforts establish a rigorous testbed for advancing robustness and reliability in chart understanding.

  Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in generating program workflows for visual tasks. However, previous approaches often rely on closed-source models, lack systematic reasoning, and struggle with long-form video question answering (videoQA). To address these challenges, we introduce the FS-VisPR framework, an adaptive visual program reasoning approach that balances fast reasoning for simple queries with slow reasoning for difficult ones. First, we design efficient visual modules (e.g., key clip retrieval and subtitle retrieval) to support long-form video tasks. Then, we construct a diverse and high-quality fast-slow reasoning dataset with a strong LLM to align open-source language models' ability to generate visual program workflows as FS-LLM. Next, we design a fast-slow reasoning framework with FS-LLM: Simple queries are directly solved by VideoLLMs, while difficult ones invoke visual program reasoning, motivated by human-like reasoning processes. During this process, low-confidence fast-thinking answers will trigger a second-stage slow-reasoning process, and a fallback mechanism to fast reasoning is activated if the program execution fails. Moreover, we improve visual programs through parameter search during both training and inference. By adjusting the parameters of the visual modules within the program, multiple variants are generated: during training, programs that yield correct answers are selected, while during inference, the program with the highest confidence result is applied. Experiments show that FS-VisPR improves both efficiency and reliability in visual program workflows. It achieves 50.4% accuracy on LVBench, surpassing GPT-4o, matching the performance of Qwen2.5VL-72B on VideoMME.

  Referring Audio-Visual Segmentation (Ref-AVS) aims to segment specific objects in videos based on natural language expressions involving audio, vision, and text information. This task poses significant challenges in cross-modal reasoning and fine-grained object localization. In this paper, we propose a simple framework, SimToken, that integrates a multimodal large language model (MLLM) with the Segment Anything Model (SAM). The MLLM is guided to generate a special semantic token representing the referred object. This compact token, enriched with contextual information from all modalities, acts as a prompt to guide SAM to segment objectsacross video frames. To further improve semantic learning, we introduce a novel target-consistent semantic alignment loss that aligns token embeddings from different expressions but referring to the same object. Experiments on the Ref-AVS benchmark demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance compared to existing methods.

  As large vision language models (VLMs) advance, their capabilities in multilingual visual question answering (mVQA) have significantly improved. Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning has been proven to enhance interpretability and complex reasoning. However, most existing approaches rely primarily on textual CoT and provide limited support for multilingual multimodal reasoning, constraining their deployment in real-world applications. To address this gap, we introduce \textbf{LaV-CoT}, the first Language-aware Visual CoT framework with Multi-Aspect Reward Optimization. LaV-CoT incorporates an interpretable multi-stage reasoning pipeline consisting of Text Summary with Bounding Box (BBox), Language Identification, Spatial Object-level Captioning, and Step-by-step Logical Reasoning. Following this reasoning pipeline, we design an automated data curation method that generates multilingual CoT annotations through iterative generation, correction, and refinement, enabling scalable and high-quality training data. To improve reasoning and generalization, LaV-CoT adopts a two-stage training paradigm combining Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with Language-aware Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), guided by verifiable multi-aspect rewards including language consistency, structural accuracy, and semantic alignment. Extensive evaluations on public datasets including MMMB, Multilingual MMBench, and MTVQA show that LaV-CoT achieves up to ~9.5% accuracy improvements over open-source baselines of similar size and even surpasses models with 2$\times$ larger scales by ~2.6%. Moreover, LaV-CoT outperforms advanced proprietary models such as GPT-4o-0513 and Gemini-2.5-flash. We further conducted an online A/B test to validate our method on real-world data, highlighting its effectiveness for industrial deployment. Our code is available at this link: \href{this https URL}

  Recent advances in video-based multimodal large language models (Video-LLMs) have significantly improved video understanding by processing videos as sequences of image frames. However, many existing methods treat frames independently in the vision backbone, lacking explicit temporal modeling, which limits their ability to capture dynamic patterns and efficiently handle long videos. To address these limitations, we introduce STORM (Spatiotemporal TOken Reduction for Multimodal LLMs), a novel architecture incorporating a dedicated temporal encoder between the image encoder and the LLM. Our temporal encoder leverages the Mamba State Space Model to integrate temporal information into image tokens, generating enriched representations that preserve inter-frame dynamics across the entire video sequence. This enriched encoding not only enhances video reasoning capabilities but also enables effective token reduction strategies, including test-time sampling and training-based temporal and spatial pooling, substantially reducing computational demands on the LLM without sacrificing key temporal information. By integrating these techniques, our approach simultaneously reduces training and inference latency while improving performance, enabling efficient and robust video understanding over extended temporal contexts. Extensive evaluations show that STORM achieves state-of-the-art results across various long video understanding benchmarks (more than 5% improvement on MLVU and LongVideoBench) while reducing the computation costs by up to $8\times$ and the decoding latency by 2.4-2.9$\times$ for the fixed numbers of input frames.

However, prior APO methods typically focus only on user prompts, rely on unstructured feedback, and require large sample sizes and long iteration cycles-making them costly and brittle. We propose ZERA (Zero-init Instruction Evolving Refinement Agent), a novel framework that jointly optimizes both system and user prompts through principled, low-overhead refinement. ZERA scores prompts using eight generalizable criteria with automatically inferred weights, and revises prompts based on these structured critiques. This enables fast convergence to high-quality prompts using minimal examples and short iteration cycles. We evaluate ZERA across five LLMs and nine diverse datasets spanning reasoning, summarization, and code generation tasks. Experimental results demonstrate consistent improvements over strong baselines. Further ablation studies highlight the contribution of each component to more effective prompt construction. Our implementation including all prompts is publicly available atthis https URL.

  This study addresses the generalization limitations commonly observed in large language models under multi-task and cross-domain settings. Unlike prior methods such as SPoT, which depends on fixed prompt templates, our study introduces a unified multi-task learning framework with dynamic prompt scheduling mechanism. By introducing a prompt pool and a task-aware scheduling strategy, the method dynamically combines and aligns prompts for different tasks. This enhances the model's ability to capture semantic differences across tasks. During prompt fusion, the model uses task embeddings and a gating mechanism to finely control the prompt signals. This ensures alignment between prompt content and task-specific demands. At the same time, it builds flexible sharing pathways across tasks. In addition, the proposed optimization objective centers on joint multi-task learning. It incorporates an automatic learning strategy for scheduling weights, which effectively mitigates task interference and negative transfer. To evaluate the effectiveness of the method, a series of sensitivity experiments were conducted. These experiments examined the impact of prompt temperature parameters and task number variation. The results confirm the advantages of the proposed mechanism in maintaining model stability and enhancing transferability. Experimental findings show that the prompt scheduling method significantly improves performance on a range of language understanding and knowledge reasoning tasks. These results fully demonstrate its applicability and effectiveness in unified multi-task modeling and cross-domain adaptation.

  The growing disparity between the exponential scaling of computational resources and the finite growth of high-quality text data now constrains conventional scaling approaches for large language models (LLMs). To address this challenge, we introduce Reinforcement Learning on Pre-Training data (RLPT), a new training-time scaling paradigm for optimizing LLMs. In contrast to prior approaches that scale training primarily through supervised learning, RLPT enables the policy to autonomously explore meaningful trajectories to learn from pre-training data and improve its capability through reinforcement learning (RL). While existing RL strategies such as reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) and reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) rely on human annotation for reward construction, RLPT eliminates this dependency by deriving reward signals directly from pre-training data. Specifically, it adopts a next-segment reasoning objective, rewarding the policy for accurately predicting subsequent text segments conditioned on the preceding context. This formulation allows RL to be scaled on pre-training data, encouraging the exploration of richer trajectories across broader contexts and thereby fostering more generalizable reasoning skills. Extensive experiments on both general-domain and mathematical reasoning benchmarks across multiple models validate the effectiveness of RLPT. For example, when applied to Qwen3-4B-Base, RLPT yields absolute improvements of $3.0$, $5.1$, $8.1$, $6.0$, $6.6$, and $5.3$ on MMLU, MMLU-Pro, GPQA-Diamond, KOR-Bench, AIME24, and AIME25, respectively. The results further demonstrate favorable scaling behavior, suggesting strong potential for continued gains with more compute. In addition, RLPT provides a solid foundation, extending the reasoning boundaries of LLMs and enhancing RLVR performance.

  The use of continuous instead of discrete tokens during the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) phase of reasoning LLMs has garnered attention recently, based on the intuition that a continuous mixture of discrete tokens could simulate a superposition of several reasoning paths simultaneously. Theoretical results have formally proven that continuous tokens have much greater expressivity and can solve specific problems more efficiently. However, practical use of continuous tokens has been limited by strong training difficulties: previous works either just use continuous tokens at inference time on a pre-trained discrete-token model, or must distill the continuous CoT from ground-truth discrete CoTs and face computational costs that limit the CoT to very few tokens.This is the first work introducing a scalable method to learn continuous CoTs via reinforcement learning (RL), without distilling from reference discrete CoTs. We use "soft" tokens: mixtures of tokens together with noise on the input embedding to provide RL exploration. Computational overhead is minimal, enabling us to learn continuous CoTs with hundreds of tokens. On math reasoning benchmarks with Llama and Qwen models up to 8B, training with continuous CoTs match discrete-token CoTs for pass@1 and surpass them for pass@32, showing greater CoT diversity. In systematic comparisons, the best-performing scenario is to train with continuous CoT tokens then use discrete tokens for inference, meaning the "soft" models can be deployed in a standard way. Finally, we show continuous CoT RL training better preserves the predictions of the base model on out-of-domain tasks, thus providing a softer touch to the base model.

  Detecting AI-generated text is an increasing necessity to combat misuse of LLMs in education, business compliance, journalism, and social media, where synthetic fluency can mask misinformation or deception. While prior detectors often rely on token-level likelihoods or opaque black-box classifiers, these approaches struggle against high-quality generations and offer little interpretability. In this work, we propose DivEye, a novel detection framework that captures how unpredictability fluctuates across a text using surprisal-based features. Motivated by the observation that human-authored text exhibits richer variability in lexical and structural unpredictability than LLM outputs, DivEye captures this signal through a set of interpretable statistical features. Our method outperforms existing zero-shot detectors by up to 33.2% and achieves competitive performance with fine-tuned baselines across multiple benchmarks. DivEye is robust to paraphrasing and adversarial attacks, generalizes well across domains and models, and improves the performance of existing detectors by up to 18.7% when used as an auxiliary signal. Beyond detection, DivEye provides interpretable insights into why a text is flagged, pointing to rhythmic unpredictability as a powerful and underexplored signal for LLM detection.

  Large language models (LLMs), as a novel information technology, are seeing increasing adoption in the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) field. They have shown their potential to streamline processes throughout the building lifecycle. However, the robustness and reliability of LLMs in such a specialized and safety-critical domain remain to be evaluated. To address this challenge, this paper establishes AECBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to quantify the strengths and limitations of current LLMs in the AEC domain. The benchmark defines 23 representative tasks within a five-level cognition-oriented evaluation framework encompassing Knowledge Memorization, Understanding, Reasoning, Calculation, and Application. These tasks were derived from authentic AEC practice, with scope ranging from codes retrieval to specialized documents generation. Subsequently, a 4,800-question dataset encompassing diverse formats, including open-ended questions, was crafted primarily by engineers and validated through a two-round expert review. Furthermore, an LLM-as-a-Judge approach was introduced to provide a scalable and consistent methodology for evaluating complex, long-form responses leveraging expert-derived rubrics. Through the evaluation of nine LLMs, a clear performance decline across five cognitive levels was revealed. Despite demonstrating proficiency in foundational tasks at the Knowledge Memorization and Understanding levels, the models showed significant performance deficits, particularly in interpreting knowledge from tables in building codes, executing complex reasoning and calculation, and generating domain-specific documents. Consequently, this study lays the groundwork for future research and development aimed at the robust and reliable integration of LLMs into safety-critical engineering practices.

  Current benchmarks for long-context reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs) often blur critical factors like intrinsic task complexity, distractor interference, and task length. To enable more precise failure analysis, we introduce CogniLoad, a novel synthetic benchmark grounded in Cognitive Load Theory (CLT). CogniLoad generates natural-language logic puzzles with independently tunable parameters that reflect CLT's core dimensions: intrinsic difficulty ($d$) controls intrinsic load; distractor-to-signal ratio ($\rho$) regulates extraneous load; and task length ($N$) serves as an operational proxy for conditions demanding germane load. Evaluating 22 SotA reasoning LLMs, CogniLoad reveals distinct performance sensitivities, identifying task length as a dominant constraint and uncovering varied tolerances to intrinsic complexity and U-shaped responses to distractor ratios. By offering systematic, factorial control over these cognitive load dimensions, CogniLoad provides a reproducible, scalable, and diagnostically rich tool for dissecting LLM reasoning limitations and guiding future model development.

  Logic reasoning in natural language has been recognized as an important measure of human intelligence for Large Language Models (LLMs). Popular benchmarks may entangle multiple reasoning skills and thus provide unfaithful evaluations on the logic reasoning skill. Meanwhile, existing logic reasoning benchmarks are limited in language diversity and their distributions are deviated from the distribution of an ideal logic reasoning benchmark, which may lead to biased evaluation results. This paper thereby proposes a new classical logic benchmark DivLogicEval, consisting of natural sentences composed of diverse statements in a counterintuitive way. To ensure a more reliable evaluation, we also introduce a new evaluation metric that mitigates the influence of bias and randomness inherent in LLMs. Through experiments, we demonstrate the extent to which logical reasoning is required to answer the questions in DivLogicEval and compare the performance of different popular LLMs in conducting logical reasoning.

  Model merging has emerged as a key technique for enhancing the capabilities and efficiency of Large Language Models (LLMs). The open-source community has driven model evolution by iteratively merging existing models, yet a principled understanding of the gains and underlying factors in model merging remains limited. In this work, we study model evolution through iterative merging, drawing an analogy to biological evolution, and introduce the concept of model kinship, the degree of similarity or relatedness between LLMs. Through comprehensive empirical analysis, we show that model kinship is closely linked to the performance improvements achieved by merging, providing a useful criterion for selecting candidate models. Building on this insight, we propose a new model merging strategy: Top-k Greedy Merging with Model Kinship, which can improve benchmark performance. Specifically, we discover that incorporating model kinship as a guiding criterion enables continuous merging while mitigating performance degradation caused by local optima, thereby facilitating more effective model evolution.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Figure captions are crucial for helping readers understand and remember a figure's key message. Many models have been developed to generate these captions, helping authors compose better quality captions more easily. Yet, authors almost always need to revise generic AI-generated captions to match their writing style and the domain's style, highlighting the need for personalization. Despite language models' personalization (LaMP) advances, these technologies often focus on text-only settings and rarely address scenarios where both inputs and profiles are multimodal. This paper introduces LaMP-Cap, a dataset for personalized figure caption generation with multimodal figure profiles. For each target figure, LaMP-Cap provides not only the needed inputs, such as figure images, but also up to three other figures from the same document--each with its image, caption, and figure-mentioning paragraphs--as a profile to characterize the context. Experiments with four LLMs show that using profile information consistently helps generate captions closer to the original author-written ones. Ablation studies reveal that images in the profile are more helpful than figure-mentioning paragraphs, highlighting the advantage of using multimodal profiles over text-only ones.

  Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world applications, yet their ability to make context-aware safety decisions remains limited. Existing methods often fail to balance oversensitivity (unjustified refusals of benign queries) and undersensitivity (missed detection of visually grounded risks), leaving a persistent gap in safety alignment. To address this issue, we introduce Safety-aware Contrastive Decoding (SafeCoDe), a lightweight and model-agnostic decoding framework that dynamically adjusts token generation based on multimodal context. SafeCoDe operates in two stages: (1) a contrastive decoding mechanism that highlights tokens sensitive to visual context by contrasting real and Gaussian-noised images, and (2) a global-aware token modulation strategy that integrates scene-level reasoning with token-level adjustment to adapt refusals according to the predicted safety verdict. Extensive experiments across diverse MLLM architectures and safety benchmarks, covering undersensitivity, oversensitivity, and general safety evaluations, show that SafeCoDe consistently improves context-sensitive refusal behaviors while preserving model helpfulness.

  Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance across natural language processing (NLP) tasks. As real-world applications increasingly demand longer context windows, continued pretraining and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on long-context data has become a common approach. While the effects of data length in continued pretraining have been extensively studied, their implications for SFT remain unclear. In this work, we systematically investigate how SFT data length influences LLM behavior on short-context tasks. Counterintuitively, we find that long-context SFT improves short-context performance, contrary to the commonly observed degradation from long-context pretraining. To uncover the underlying mechanisms of this phenomenon, we first decouple and analyze two key components, Multi-Head Attention (MHA) and Feed-Forward Network (FFN), and show that both independently benefit from long-context SFT. We further study their interaction and reveal a knowledge preference bias: long-context SFT promotes contextual knowledge, while short-context SFT favors parametric knowledge, making exclusive reliance on long-context SFT suboptimal. Finally, we demonstrate that hybrid training mitigates this bias, offering explainable guidance for fine-tuning LLMs.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Model-based agents(LLM-based agents) are increasingly deployed in customer service, yet they often forget across sessions, repeat errors, and lack mechanisms for continual self-improvement. This makes them unreliable in dynamic settings where stability and consistency are critical. To better evaluate these properties, we emphasize two indicators: task success rate as a measure of overall effectiveness, and consistency metrics such as Pass$^k$ to capture reliability across multiple trials. To address the limitations of existing approaches, we propose MemOrb, a lightweight and plug-and-play verbal reinforcement memory layer that distills multi-turn interactions into compact strategy reflections. These reflections are stored in a shared memory bank and retrieved to guide decision-making, without requiring any fine-tuning. Experiments show that MemOrb significantly improves both success rate and stability, achieving up to a 63 percentage-point gain in multi-turn success rate and delivering more consistent performance across repeated trials. Our results demonstrate that structured reflection is a powerful mechanism for enhancing long-term reliability of frozen LLM agents in customer service scenarios.

  Recently, inference-time reasoning strategies have further improved the accuracy of large language models (LLMs), but their effectiveness on smaller models remains unclear. Based on the observation that conventional approaches often fail to improve performance in this context, we propose \textbf{C}ycle-\textbf{C}onsistency in \textbf{Q}uestion \textbf{A}nswering (CCQA), a novel reasoning method that can be effectively applied to SLMs. Inspired by cycle consistency, CCQA generates a question from each reasoning path and answer, evaluates each by its similarity to the original question, and then selects the candidate solution with the highest similarity score as the final response. Since conventional SLMs struggle to generate accurate questions from their own reasoning paths and answers, we employ a lightweight Flan-T5 model specialized for question generation to support this process efficiently. From the experimental results, it is verified that CCQA consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods across eight models on mathematical and commonsense reasoning benchmarks. Furthermore, our method establishes a new practical baseline for efficient reasoning in SLMs. Source code can be found atthis https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) show promise for diagnostic reasoning but often lack reliable, knowledge grounded inference. Knowledge graphs (KGs), such as the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS), offer structured biomedical knowledge that can support trustworthy reasoning. Prior approaches typically integrate KGs via retrieval augmented generation or fine tuning, inserting KG content into prompts rather than enabling structured reasoning. We explore an alternative paradigm: treating the LLM as a reward model of KG reasoning paths, where the model learns to judge whether a candidate path leads to correct diagnosis for a given patient input. This approach is inspired by recent work that leverages reward training to enhance model reasoning abilities, and grounded in computational theory, which suggests that verifying a solution is often easier than generating one from scratch. It also parallels physicians' diagnostic assessment, where they judge which sequences of findings and intermediate conditions most plausibly support a diagnosis. We first systematically evaluate five task formulation for knowledge path judging and eight training paradigm. Second, we test whether the path judging abilities generalize to downstream diagnostic tasks, including diagnosis summarization and medical question answering. Experiments with three open source instruct-tuned LLMs reveal both promise and brittleness: while specific reward optimization and distillation lead to strong path-judging performance, the transferability to downstream tasks remain weak. Our finding provides the first systematic assessment of "reward model style" reasoning over clinical KGs, offering insights into how structured, reward-based supervision influences diagnostic reasoning in GenAI systems for healthcare.

  Event causality identification (ECI), a process that extracts causal relations between events from text, is crucial for distinguishing causation from correlation. Traditional approaches to ECI have primarily utilized linguistic patterns and multi-hop relational inference, risking false causality identification due to informal usage of causality and specious graphical inference. In this paper, we adopt the Rubin Causal Model to identify event causality: given two temporally ordered events, we see the first event as the treatment and the second one as the observed outcome. Determining their causality involves manipulating the treatment and estimating the resultant change in the likelihood of the outcome. Given that it is only possible to implement manipulation conceptually in the text domain, as a work-around, we try to find a twin for the protagonist from existing corpora. This twin should have identical life experiences with the protagonist before the treatment but undergoes an intervention of treatment. However, the practical difficulty of locating such a match limits its feasibility. Addressing this issue, we use the synthetic control method to generate such a twin' from relevant historical data, leveraging text embedding synthesis and inversion techniques. This approach allows us to identify causal relations more robustly than previous methods, including GPT-4, which is demonstrated on a causality benchmark, COPES-hard.

  To mitigate the hallucination problem in large language models, DoLa exploits early exit logits from the same model as a contrastive prior. However, we found that these early exit logits tend to be flat, low in magnitude, and fail to reflect meaningful contrasts. To address this, we propose PruneCD, a novel contrastive decoding method that constructs the amateur model via layer pruning rather than early exit. This design leads to more informative and well-aligned logits, enabling more effective contrastive decoding. Through qualitative and quantitative analyses, we demonstrate that PruneCD consistently improves factuality with minimal inference overhead, offering a robust and practical approach to mitigating hallucinations in LLMs.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate exceptional capabilities across various tasks, but their deployment is constrained by high computational and memory costs. Model pruning provides an effective means to alleviate these demands. However, existing methods often ignore the characteristics of prefill-decode (PD) disaggregation in practice. In this paper, we propose a novel pruning method for PD disaggregation inference, enabling more precise and efficient block and KV Cache pruning. Our approach constructs pruning and distillation sets to perform iterative block removal independently for the prefill and decode stages, obtaining better pruning solutions. Moreover, we introduce a token-aware cache pruning mechanism that retains all KV Cache in the prefill stage but selectively reuses entries for the first and last token sequences in selected layers during decode, reducing communication costs with minimal overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach consistently achieves strong performance in both PD disaggregation and PD unified settings without disaggregation. Under the same (default) settings, our method achieves improved performance and faster inference, along with a 4.95$\times$ reduction in data transmission bandwidth consumption.

  The current Large Language Models (LLMs) face significant challenges in improving their performance on low-resource languages and urgently need data-efficient methods without costly fine-tuning. From the perspective of language-bridge, we propose a simple yet effective method, namely BridgeX-ICL, to improve the zero-shot Cross-lingual In-Context Learning (X-ICL) for low-resource languages. Unlike existing works focusing on language-specific neurons, BridgeX-ICL explores whether sharing neurons can improve cross-lingual performance in LLMs. We construct neuron probe data from the ground-truth MUSE bilingual dictionaries, and define a subset of language overlap neurons accordingly to ensure full activation of these anchored neurons. Subsequently, we propose an HSIC-based metric to quantify LLMs' internal linguistic spectrum based on overlapping neurons, guiding optimal bridge selection. The experiments conducted on 4 cross-lingual tasks and 15 language pairs from 7 diverse families, covering both high-low and moderate-low pairs, validate the effectiveness of BridgeX-ICL and offer empirical insights into the underlying multilingual mechanisms of LLMs. The code is publicly available atthis https URL.

  In machine translation (MT), health is a high-stakes domain characterised by widespread deployment and domain-specific vocabulary. However, there is a lack of MT evaluation datasets for low-resource languages in this domain. To address this gap, we introduce OpenWHO, a document-level parallel corpus of 2,978 documents and 26,824 sentences from the World Health Organization's e-learning platform. Sourced from expert-authored, professionally translated materials shielded from web-crawling, OpenWHO spans a diverse range of over 20 languages, of which nine are low-resource. Leveraging this new resource, we evaluate modern large language models (LLMs) against traditional MT models. Our findings reveal that LLMs consistently outperform traditional MT models, with Gemini 2.5 Flash achieving a +4.79 ChrF point improvement over NLLB-54B on our low-resource test set. Further, we investigate how LLM context utilisation affects accuracy, finding that the benefits of document-level translation are most pronounced in specialised domains like health. We release the OpenWHO corpus to encourage further research into low-resource MT in the health domain.

  Unified Structured Knowledge Reasoning (USKR) aims to answer natural language questions (NLQs) by using structured sources such as tables, databases, and knowledge graphs in a unified way. Existing USKR methods either rely on employing task-specific strategies or custom-defined representations, which struggle to leverage the knowledge transfer between different SKR tasks or align with the prior of LLMs, thereby limiting their performance. This paper proposes a novel USKR framework named \textsc{Pandora}, which takes advantage of \textsc{Python}'s \textsc{Pandas} API to construct a unified knowledge representation for alignment with LLM pre-training. It employs an LLM to generate textual reasoning steps and executable Python code for each question. Demonstrations are drawn from a memory of training examples that cover various SKR tasks, facilitating knowledge transfer. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks involving three SKR tasks demonstrate that \textsc{Pandora} outperforms existing unified frameworks and competes effectively with task-specific methods.

  Explanations are an important tool for gaining insights into the behavior of ML models, calibrating user trust and ensuring regulatory compliance. Past few years have seen a flurry of post-hoc methods for generating model explanations, many of which involve computing model gradients or solving specially designed optimization problems. However, owing to the remarkable reasoning abilities of Large Language Model (LLMs), self-explanation, that is, prompting the model to explain its outputs has recently emerged as a new paradigm. In this work, we study a specific type of self-explanations, self-generated counterfactual explanations (SCEs). We design tests for measuring the efficacy of LLMs in generating SCEs. Analysis over various LLM families, model sizes, temperature settings, and datasets reveals that LLMs sometimes struggle to generate SCEs. Even when they do, their prediction often does not agree with their own counterfactual reasoning.

  Programming languages possess rich semantic information - such as data flow - that is represented by graphs and not available from the surface form of source code. Recent code language models have scaled to billions of parameters, but model source code solely as text tokens while ignoring any other structural information. Conversely, models that do encode structural information of code make modifications to the Transformer architecture, limiting their scale and compatibility with pretrained LLMs. In this work, we take the best of both worlds with GALLa - Graph Aligned Large Language Models. GALLa utilizes graph neural networks and cross-modal alignment technologies to inject the structural information of code into LLMs as an auxiliary task during finetuning. This framework is both model-agnostic and task-agnostic, as it can be applied to any code LLM for any code downstream task, and requires the structural graph data only at training time from a corpus unrelated to the finetuning data, while incurring no cost at inference time over the baseline LLM. Experiments on five code tasks with seven different baseline LLMs ranging in size from 350M to 14B validate the effectiveness of GALLa, demonstrating consistent improvement over the baseline, even for powerful models such as LLaMA3 and Qwen2.5-Coder.

  Conceptual spaces represent entities and concepts using cognitively meaningful dimensions, typically referring to perceptual features. Such representations are widely used in cognitive science and have the potential to serve as a cornerstone for explainable AI. Unfortunately, they have proven notoriously difficult to learn, although recent LLMs appear to capture the required perceptual features to a remarkable extent. Nonetheless, practical methods for extracting the corresponding conceptual spaces are currently still lacking. While various methods exist for extracting embeddings from LLMs, extracting conceptual spaces also requires us to encode the underlying features. In this paper, we propose a strategy in which features (e.g. sweetness) are encoded by embedding the description of a corresponding prototype (e.g. a very sweet food). To improve this strategy, we fine-tune the LLM to align the prototype embeddings with the corresponding conceptual space dimensions. Our empirical analysis finds this approach to be highly effective.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) face significant computational challenges when processing long contexts due to the quadratic complexity of self-attention. While soft context compression methods, which map input text to smaller latent representations, have shown promise, their real-world adoption is limited. Existing techniques typically compress the context as a single unit, which leads to quadratic compression complexity and an inability to reuse computations across queries with overlapping contexts. In this work, we introduce CompLLM, a soft compression technique designed for practical deployment. Instead of processing the context holistically, CompLLM divides it into segments and compresses each one independently. This simple design choice yields three critical properties: efficiency, as the compression step scales linearly with the context length; scalability, enabling models trained on short sequences (e.g., 1k tokens) to generalize to contexts of 100k tokens; and reusability, allowing compressed segments to be cached and reused across different queries. Our experiments show that with a 2x compression rate, at high context lengths CompLLM speeds up Time To First Token (TTFT) by up to 4x and reduces the KV cache size by 50%. Furthermore, CompLLM achieves performance comparable to that obtained with the uncompressed context, and even surpasses it on very long sequences, demonstrating its effectiveness and practical utility.

  Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly trained with reinforcement learning (RL) as autonomous agents that reason and act over long horizons in interactive environments.However, sparse and sometimes unverifiable rewards make temporal credit assignment extremely challenging.Recent work attempts to integrate process supervision into agent learning but suffers from biased annotation, reward hacking, high-variance from overly fine-grained signals or failtures when state overlap is rare.We therefore introduce Online Process Reward Learning (OPRL), a general credit-assignment strategy for agentic RL that integrates seamlessly with standard on-policy algorithms without relying on additional rollouts or explicit step labels.In OPRL, we optimize an implicit process reward model (PRM) alternately with the agent's policy to transform trajectory preferences into implicit step rewards through a trajectory-based DPO objective.These step rewards are then used to compute step-level advantages, which are combined with episode-level advantages from outcome rewards for policy update, creating a self-reinforcing loop.Theoretical findings guarantee that the learned step rewards are consistent with trajectory preferences and act as potential-based shaping rewards, providing bounded gradients to stabilize training.Empirically, we evaluate OPRL on three distinct agent benmarks, including WebShop and VisualSokoban, as well as open-ended social interactions with unverfiable rewards in SOTOPIA.Crucially, OPRL shows superior performance over frontier LLMs and strong RL baselines across domains, achieving state-of-the-art results with higher sample-efficiency and lower variance during training.Further analysis also demonstrates the efficient exploration by OPRL using fewer actions, underscoring its potential for agentic learning in real-world scenarios.

  The rapid growth of scientific literature demands efficient methods to organize and synthesize research findings. Existing taxonomy construction methods, leveraging unsupervised clustering or direct prompting of large language models (LLMs), often lack coherence and granularity. We propose a novel context-aware hierarchical taxonomy generation framework that integrates LLM-guided multi-aspect encoding with dynamic clustering. Our method leverages LLMs to identify key aspects of each paper (e.g., methodology, dataset, evaluation) and generates aspect-specific paper summaries, which are then encoded and clustered along each aspect to form a coherent hierarchy. In addition, we introduce a new evaluation benchmark of 156 expert-crafted taxonomies encompassing 11.6k papers, providing the first naturally annotated dataset for this task. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms prior approaches, achieving state-of-the-art performance in taxonomy coherence, granularity, and interpretability.

  Over the past decade, Computational Linguistics (CL) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) have evolved rapidly, especially with the advent of Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs). This shift has transformed research goals and priorities, from Lexical and Semantic Resources to Language Modelling and Multimodality. In this study, we track the research trends of the Italian CL and NLP community through an analysis of the contributions to CLiC-it, arguably the leading Italian conference in the field. We compile the proceedings from the first 10 editions of the CLiC-it conference (from 2014 to 2024) into the CLiC-it Corpus, providing a comprehensive analysis of both its metadata, including author provenance, gender, affiliations, and more, as well as the content of the papers themselves, which address various topics. Our goal is to provide the Italian and international research communities with valuable insights into emerging trends and key developments over time, supporting informed decisions and future directions in the field.

  Recent works in Natural Language Inference (NLI) and related tasks, such as automated fact-checking, employ atomic fact decomposition to enhance interpretability and robustness. For this, existing methods rely on resource-intensive generative large language models (LLMs) to perform decomposition. We propose JEDI, an encoder-only architecture that jointly performs extractive atomic fact decomposition and interpretable inference without requiring generative models during inference. To facilitate training, we produce a large corpus of synthetic rationales covering multiple NLI benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that JEDI achieves competitive accuracy in distribution and significantly improves robustness out of distribution and in adversarial settings over models based solely on extractive rationale supervision. Our findings show that interpretability and robust generalization in NLI can be realized using encoder-only architectures and synthetic rationales. Code and data available atthis https URL

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  With the rapid advancement of large language model technology, there is growing interest in whether multi-feature approaches can significantly improve AI text detection beyond what single neural models achieve. While intuition suggests that combining semantic, syntactic, and statistical features should provide complementary signals, this assumption has not been rigorously tested with modern LLM-generated text. This paper provides a systematic empirical investigation of multi-hierarchical feature integration for AI text detection, specifically testing whether the computational overhead of combining multiple feature types is justified by performance gains. We implement MHFD (Multi-Hierarchical Feature Detection), integrating DeBERTa-based semantic analysis, syntactic parsing, and statistical probability features through adaptive fusion. Our investigation reveals important negative results: despite theoretical expectations, multi-feature integration provides minimal benefits (0.4-0.5% improvement) while incurring substantial computational costs (4.2x overhead), suggesting that modern neural language models may already capture most relevant detection signals efficiently. Experimental results on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that the MHFD method achieves 89.7% accuracy in in-domain detection and maintains 84.2% stable performance in cross-domain detection, showing modest improvements of 0.4-2.6% over existing methods.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Keyphrase extraction is a fundamental task in natural language processing. However, existing unsupervised prompt-based methods for Large Language Models (LLMs) often rely on single-stage inference pipelines with uniform prompting, regardless of document length or LLM backbone. Such one-size-fits-all designs hinder the full exploitation of LLMs' reasoning and generation capabilities, especially given the complexity of keyphrase extraction across diverse scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose MAPEX, the first framework that introduces multi-agent collaboration into keyphrase extraction. MAPEX coordinates LLM-based agents through modules for expert recruitment, candidate extraction, topic guidance, knowledge augmentation, and post-processing. A dual-path strategy dynamically adapts to document length: knowledge-driven extraction for short texts and topic-guided extraction for long texts. Extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets across three different LLMs demonstrate its strong generalization and universality, outperforming the state-of-the-art unsupervised method by 2.44\% and standard LLM baselines by 4.01\% in F1@5 on average.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As fine-tuning becomes the dominant paradigm for improving large language models (LLMs), understanding what changes during this process is increasingly important. Traditional benchmarking often fails to explain why one model outperforms another. In this work, we use model diffing, a mechanistic interpretability approach, to analyze the specific capability differences between Gemma-2-9b-it and a SimPO-enhanced variant. Using crosscoders, we identify and categorize latent representations that differentiate the two models. We find that SimPO acquired latent concepts predominantly enhance safety mechanisms (+32.8%), multilingual capabilities (+43.8%), and instruction-following (+151.7%), while its additional training also reduces emphasis on model self-reference (-44.1%) and hallucination management (-68.5%). Our analysis shows that model diffing can yield fine-grained insights beyond leaderboard metrics, attributing performance gaps to concrete mechanistic capabilities. This approach offers a transparent and targeted framework for comparing LLMs.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Dynamic Text-Attribute Graphs (DyTAGs), characterized by time-evolving graph interactions and associated text attributes, are prevalent in real-world applications. Existing methods, such as Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Large Language Models (LLMs), mostly focus on static TAGs. Extending these existing methods to DyTAGs is challenging as they largely neglect the recent-global temporal semantics: the recent semantic dependencies among interaction texts and the global semantic evolution of nodes over time. Furthermore, applying LLMs to the abundant and evolving text in DyTAGs faces efficiency issues. To tackle these challenges, we propose Dynamic Global-Recent Adaptive Semantic Processing (DyGRASP), a novel method that leverages LLMs and temporal GNNs to efficiently and effectively reason on DyTAGs. Specifically, we first design a node-centric implicit reasoning method together with a sliding window mechanism to efficiently capture recent temporal semantics. In addition, to capture global semantic dynamics of nodes, we leverage explicit reasoning with tailored prompts and an RNN-like chain structure to infer long-term semantics. Lastly, we intricately integrate the recent and global temporal semantics as well as the dynamic graph structural information using updating and merging layers. Extensive experiments on DyTAG benchmarks demonstrate DyGRASP's superiority, achieving up to 34% improvement in Hit@10 for destination node retrieval task. Besides, DyGRASP exhibits strong generalization across different temporal GNNs and LLMs.

  LLM-as-a-judge has become a promising paradigm for using large language models (LLMs) to evaluate natural language generation (NLG), but the uncertainty of its evaluation remains underexplored. This lack of reliability may limit its deployment in many applications. This work presents the first framework to analyze the uncertainty by offering a prediction interval of LLM-based scoring via conformal prediction. Conformal prediction constructs continuous prediction intervals from a single evaluation run, and we design an ordinal boundary adjustment for discrete rating tasks. We also suggest a midpoint-based score within the interval as a low-bias alternative to raw model score and weighted average. We perform extensive experiments and analysis, which show that conformal prediction can provide valid prediction interval with coverage guarantees. We also explore the usefulness of interval midpoint and judge reprompting for better judgment.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  To assist users in complex tasks, LLMs generate plans: step-by-step instructions towards a goal. While alignment methods aim to ensure LLM plans are helpful, they train (RLHF) or evaluate (ChatbotArena) on what users prefer, assuming this reflects what helps them. We test this with Planorama: an interface where 126 users answer 300 multi-step questions with LLM plans. We get 4388 plan executions and 5584 comparisons to measure plan helpfulness (QA success) and user preferences on plans, and recreate the setup in agents and reward models to see if they simulate or prefer what helps users. We expose: 1) user/model preferences and agent success do not accurately predict which plans help users, so common alignment feedback can misalign with helpfulness; 2) this gap is not due to user-specific preferences, as users are similarly successful when using plans they prefer/disprefer; 3) surface-level cues like brevity and question similarity strongly link to preferences, but such biases fail to predict helpfulness. In all, we argue aligning helpful LLMs needs feedback from real user interactions, not just preferences of what looks helpful, so we discuss the plan NLP researchers can execute to solve this problem.

  Recent unified models such as GPT-5 have achieved encouraging progress on vision-language tasks. However, these unified models typically fail to correctly understand ECG signals and provide accurate medical diagnoses, nor can they correctly generate ECG signals. To address these limitations, we propose UniECG, the first unified model for ECG capable of concurrently performing evidence-based ECG interpretation and text-conditioned ECG generation tasks. Through a decoupled two-stage training approach, the model first learns evidence-based interpretation skills (ECG-to-Text), and then injects ECG generation capabilities (Text-to-ECG) via latent space alignment. UniECG can autonomously choose to interpret or generate an ECG based on user input, significantly extending the capability boundaries of current ECG models. Our code and checkpoints will be made publicly available atthis https URLupon acceptance.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As large language models (LLMs) are pretrained on massive web corpora, careful selection of data becomes essential to ensure effective and efficient learning. While perplexity (PPL)-based filtering has shown strong performance, it suffers from drawbacks: substantial time costs and inherent unreliability of the model when handling noisy or out-of-distribution samples. In this work, we propose a simple yet powerful alternative: a prior-based data filtering method that estimates token priors using corpus-level term frequency statistics, inspired by linguistic insights on word roles and lexical density. Our approach filters documents based on the mean and standard deviation of token priors, serving as a fast proxy to PPL while requiring no model inference. Despite its simplicity, the prior-based filter achieves the highest average performance across 20 downstream benchmarks, while reducing time cost by over 1000x compared to PPL-based filtering. We further demonstrate its applicability to symbolic languages such as code and math, and its dynamic adaptability to multilingual corpora without supervision

  Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for text-rich graph machine learning tasks such as node classification in high-impact domains like fraud detection and recommendation systems. Yet, despite a surge of interest, the field lacks a principled understanding of the capabilities of LLMs in their interaction with graph data. In this work, we conduct a large-scale, controlled evaluation across several key axes of variability to systematically assess the strengths and weaknesses of LLM-based graph reasoning methods in text-based applications. The axes include the LLM-graph interaction mode, comparing prompting, tool-use, and code generation; dataset domains, spanning citation, web-link, e-commerce, and social networks; structural regimes contrasting homophilic and heterophilic graphs; feature characteristics involving both short- and long-text node attributes; and model configurations with varying LLM sizes and reasoning capabilities. We further analyze dependencies by methodically truncating features, deleting edges, and removing labels to quantify reliance on input types. Our findings provide practical and actionable guidance. (1) LLMs as code generators achieve the strongest overall performance on graph data, with especially large gains on long-text or high-degree graphs where prompting quickly exceeds the token budget. (2) All interaction strategies remain effective on heterophilic graphs, challenging the assumption that LLM-based methods collapse under low homophily. (3) Code generation is able to flexibly adapt its reliance between structure, features, or labels to leverage the most informative input type. Together, these findings provide a comprehensive view of the strengths and limitations of current LLM-graph interaction modes and highlight key design principles for future approaches.

  Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated notable creative abilities in generating literary texts, including poetry and short stories. However, prior research has primarily centered on English, with limited exploration of non-English literary traditions and without standardized methods for assessing creativity. In this paper, we evaluate the capacity of LLMs to generate Persian literary text enriched with culturally relevant expressions. We build a dataset of user-generated Persian literary spanning 20 diverse topics and assess model outputs along four creativity dimensions-originality, fluency, flexibility, and elaboration-by adapting the Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking. To reduce evaluation costs, we adopt an LLM as a judge for automated scoring and validate its reliability against human judgments using intraclass correlation coefficients, observing strong agreement. In addition, we analyze the models' ability to understand and employ four core literary devices: simile, metaphor, hyperbole, and antithesis. Our results highlight both the strengths and limitations of LLMs in Persian literary text generation, underscoring the need for further refinement.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Social norms govern culturally appropriate behavior in communication, enabling dialogue systems to produce responses that are not only coherent but also socially acceptable. We present NormGenesis, a multicultural framework for generating and annotating socially grounded dialogues across English, Chinese, and Korean. To model the dynamics of social interaction beyond static norm classification, we propose a novel dialogue type, Violation-to-Resolution (V2R), which models the progression of conversations following norm violations through recognition and socially appropriate repair. To improve pragmatic consistency in underrepresented languages, we implement an exemplar-based iterative refinement early in the dialogue synthesis process. This design introduces alignment with linguistic, emotional, and sociocultural expectations before full dialogue generation begins. Using this framework, we construct a dataset of 10,800 multi-turn dialogues annotated at the turn level for norm adherence, speaker intent, and emotional response. Human and LLM-based evaluations demonstrate that NormGenesis significantly outperforms existing datasets in refinement quality, dialogue naturalness, and generalization performance. We show that models trained on our V2R-augmented data exhibit improved pragmatic competence in ethically sensitive contexts. Our work establishes a new benchmark for culturally adaptive dialogue modeling and provides a scalable methodology for norm-aware generation across linguistically and culturally diverse languages.

  Most automatic speech processing systems operate in "open loop" mode without user feedback about who said what; yet, human-in-the-loop workflows can potentially enable higher accuracy. We propose an LLM-assisted speaker diarization correction system that lets users fix speaker attribution errors in real time. The pipeline performs streaming ASR and diarization, uses an LLM to deliver concise summaries to the users, and accepts brief verbal feedback that is immediately incorporated without disrupting interactions. Moreover, we develop techniques to make the workflow more effective: First, a split-when-merged (SWM) technique detects and splits multi-speaker segments that the ASR erroneously attributes to just a single speaker. Second, online speaker enrollments are collected based on users' diarization corrections, thus helping to prevent speaker diarization errors from occurring in the future. LLM-driven simulations on the AMI test set indicate that our system substantially reduces DER by 9.92% and speaker confusion error by 44.23%. We further analyze correction efficacy under different settings, including summary vs full transcript display, the number of online enrollments limitation, and correction frequency.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The immense model sizes of large language models (LLMs) challenge deployment on memory-limited consumer GPUs. Although model compression and parameter offloading are common strategies to address memory limitations, compression can degrade quality, and offloading maintains quality but suffers from slow inference. Speculative decoding presents a promising avenue to accelerate parameter offloading, utilizing a fast draft model to propose multiple draft tokens, which are then verified by the target LLM in parallel with a single forward pass. This method reduces the time-consuming data transfers in forward passes that involve offloaded weight transfers. Existing methods often rely on pretrained weights of the same family, but require additional training to align with custom-trained models. Moreover, approaches that involve draft model training usually yield only modest speedups. This limitation arises from insufficient alignment with the target model, preventing higher token acceptance lengths. To address these challenges and achieve greater speedups, we propose SubSpec, a plug-and-play method to accelerate parameter offloading that is lossless and training-free. SubSpec constructs a highly aligned draft model by generating low-bit quantized substitute layers from offloaded target LLM portions. Additionally, our method shares the remaining GPU-resident layers and the KV-Cache, further reducing memory overhead and enhance alignment. SubSpec achieves a high average acceptance length, delivering 9.1x speedup for Qwen2.5 7B on MT-Bench (8GB VRAM limit) and an average of 12.5x speedup for Qwen2.5 32B on popular generation benchmarks (24GB VRAM limit).

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reinforcement learning improves LLM reasoning, yet sparse delayed reward over long sequences makes token-level credit assignment the key bottleneck. We study the verifiable-reward setting, where the final answer is checkable and multiple responses can be drawn per prompt. Reasoning tasks in math and medical QA align with this setup, where only a few decision tokens significantly impact the outcome. PPO offers token-level advantages with a learned value model, but it is complex to train both the actor and critic models simultaneously, and it is not easily generalizable, as the token-level values from the critic model can make training prone to overfitting. GRPO is critic-free and supports verifiable rewards, but spreads a single sequence-level return across tokens and ignores branching. We introduce \textbf{Prefix-to-Tree (P2T)}, a simple procedure that converts a group of responses into a prefix tree and computes \emph{nonparametric} prefix values \(V(s)\) by aggregating descendant outcomes. Built on P2T, we propose \textbf{TEMPO} (\emph{\textbf{T}ree-\textbf{E}stimated \textbf{M}ean Prefix Value for \textbf{P}olicy \textbf{O}ptimization}), a critic-free algorithm that augments the group-relative outcome signal of GRPO with \emph{branch-gated} temporal-difference corrections derived from the tree. At non-branch tokens, the temporal-difference (TD) term is zero, so TEMPO reduces to GRPO; at branching tokens, it supplies precise token-level credit without a learned value network or extra judges/teachers. On Qwen3-1.7B/4B, TEMPO outperforms PPO and GRPO on in-distribution (MATH, MedQA) and out-of-distribution (GSM-HARD, AMC23, MedMCQA, MMLU-Medical) benchmarks, and reaches higher validation accuracy with roughly the same wall-clock time.

  Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enables large language models (LLMs) to access external knowledge sources, but the effectiveness of RAG relies on the coordination between the retriever and the generator. Since these components are developed independently, their interaction is often suboptimal: the retriever may return irrelevant or redundant documents, while the generator may fail to fully leverage retrieved evidence. In this work, we propose a process-supervised multi-agent framework to bridge the gap between retriever and generator. The framework introduces two lightweight agents: a Decision Maker, which determines when to continue retrieval or stop for answer generation, and a Knowledge Selector, which filters retrieved documents to retain only the most useful evidence. To provide fine-grained supervision, we employ an LLM-as-a-Judge that evaluates each intermediate action with process-level rewards, ensuring more accurate credit assignment than relying solely on final answer correctness. We further adopt a tree-structured rollout strategy to explore diverse reasoning paths, and train both agents with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) in an end-to-end manner. Experiments on single-hop and multi-hop question answering benchmarks show that our approach achieves higher accuracy, more stable convergence, and produces more interpretable reasoning trajectories compared with standard RAG baselines. Importantly, the proposed framework is modular and plug-and-play, requiring no modification to the retriever or generator, making it practical for real-world RAG applications.

  The capacity of Large Language Models (LLMs) to reason is fundamental to their application in complex, knowledge-intensive domains. In real-world scenarios, LLMs are often augmented with external information that can be helpful, irrelevant, or even misleading. This paper investigates the causal impact of such auxiliary information on the reasoning process of LLMs with explicit step-by-step thinking capabilities. We introduce SciAux, a new dataset derived from ScienceQA, to systematically test the robustness of the model against these types of information. Our findings reveal a critical vulnerability: the model's deliberative "thinking mode" is a double-edged sword. While helpful context improves accuracy, misleading information causes a catastrophic drop in performance, which is amplified by the thinking process. Instead of conferring robustness, thinking reinforces the degree of error when provided with misinformation. This highlights that the challenge is not merely to make models "think", but to endow them with the critical faculty to evaluate the information upon which their reasoning is based.

  We introduce \textbf{GAUSS} (\textbf{G}eneral \textbf{A}ssessment of \textbf{U}nderlying \textbf{S}tructured \textbf{S}kills in Mathematics), a benchmark that evaluates LLMs' mathematical abilities across twelve core skill dimensions, grouped into three domains: knowledge and understanding, problem solving and communication, and meta-skills and creativity. By categorizing problems according to cognitive skills and designing tasks that isolate specific abilities, GAUSS constructs comprehensive, fine-grained, and interpretable profiles of models' mathematical abilities. These profiles faithfully represent their underlying mathematical intelligence. To exemplify how to use the \textsc{GAUSS} benchmark, we have derived the skill profile of \textsc{GPT-5-thinking}, revealing its strengths and weaknesses as well as its differences relative to \textsc{o4-mini-high}, thereby underscoring the value of multidimensional, skill-based evaluation.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The demand for efficient deployment of large language models (LLMs) has driven interest in quantization, which reduces inference cost, and parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), which lowers training overhead. This motivated the development of quantization-aware PEFT to produce accurate yet efficient quantized models. In this setting, reducing quantization error prior to fine-tuning is crucial for achieving high model accuracy. However, existing methods that rely on low-rank adaptation suffer from limited representational capacity. Recent Fourier-related transform (FT)-based adapters offer greater representational power than low-rank adapters, but their direct integration into quantized models often results in ineffective error reduction and increased computational overhead. To overcome these limitations, we propose QWHA, a method that integrates FT-based adapters into quantized models by employing the Walsh-Hadamard Transform (WHT) as the transform kernel, together with a novel adapter initialization scheme incorporating adaptive parameter selection and value refinement. We demonstrate that QWHA effectively mitigates quantization errors while facilitating fine-tuning, and that its design substantially reduces computational cost. Experimental results show that QWHA consistently outperforms baselines in low-bit quantization accuracy and achieves significant training speedups over existing FT-based adapters.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Continual Structured Knowledge Reasoning (CSKR) focuses on training models to handle sequential tasks, where each task involves translating natural language questions into structured queries grounded in structured knowledge. Existing general continual learning approaches face significant challenges when applied to this task, including poor generalization to heterogeneous structured knowledge and inefficient reasoning due to parameter growth as tasks increase. To address these limitations, we propose a novel CSKR framework, \textsc{K-DeCore}, which operates with a fixed number of tunable parameters. Unlike prior methods, \textsc{K-DeCore} introduces a knowledge decoupling mechanism that disentangles the reasoning process into task-specific and task-agnostic stages, effectively bridging the gaps across diverse tasks. Building on this foundation, \textsc{K-DeCore} integrates a dual-perspective memory consolidation mechanism for distinct stages and introduces a structure-guided pseudo-data synthesis strategy to further enhance the model's generalization capabilities. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of \textsc{K-DeCore} over existing continual learning methods across multiple metrics, leveraging various backbone large language models.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Existing table understanding methods face challenges due to complex table structures and intricate logical reasoning. While supervised finetuning (SFT) dominates existing research, reinforcement learning (RL), such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), has shown promise but struggled with low initial policy accuracy and coarse rewards in tabular contexts. In this paper, we introduce Table-R1, a three-stage RL framework that enhances multimodal table understanding through: (1) Warm-up that prompts initial perception and reasoning capabilities, (2) Perception Alignment GRPO (PA-GRPO), which employs continuous Tree-Edit-Distance Similarity (TEDS) rewards for recognizing table structures and contents, and (3) Hint-Completion GRPO (HC-GRPO), which utilizes fine-grained rewards of residual steps based on the hint-guided question. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Table-R1 can boost the model's table reasoning performance obviously on both held-in and held-out datasets, outperforming SFT and GRPO largely. Notably, Qwen2-VL-7B with Table-R1 surpasses larger specific table understanding models (e.g., Table-LLaVA 13B), even achieving comparable performance to the closed-source model GPT-4o on held-in datasets, demonstrating the efficacy of each stage of Table-R1 in overcoming initialization bottlenecks and reward sparsity, thereby advancing robust multimodal table understanding.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models are increasingly used in applications requiring objective assessment, which could be compromised by political bias. Many studies found preferences for left-leaning positions in LLMs, but downstream effects on tasks like fact-checking remain underexplored. In this study, we systematically investigate political bias through exchanging words with euphemisms or dysphemisms in German claims. We construct minimal pairs of factually equivalent claims that differ in political connotation, to assess the consistency of LLMs in classifying them as true or false. We evaluate six LLMs and find that, more than political leaning, the presence of judgmental words significantly influences truthfulness assessment. While a few models show tendencies of political bias, this is not mitigated by explicitly calling for objectivism in prompts. Warning: This paper contains content that may be offensive or upsetting.

  The advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has transformed natural language processing; however, their safety mechanisms remain under-explored in low-resource, multilingual settings. Here, we aim to bridge this gap. In particular, we introduce \textsf{SGToxicGuard}, a novel dataset and evaluation framework for benchmarking LLM safety in Singapore's diverse linguistic context, including Singlish, Chinese, Malay, and Tamil. SGToxicGuard adopts a red-teaming approach to systematically probe LLM vulnerabilities in three real-world scenarios: \textit{conversation}, \textit{question-answering}, and \textit{content composition}. We conduct extensive experiments with state-of-the-art multilingual LLMs, and the results uncover critical gaps in their safety guardrails. By offering actionable insights into cultural sensitivity and toxicity mitigation, we lay the foundation for safer and more inclusive AI systems in linguistically diverse environments.\footnote{Link to the dataset:this https URL.} \textcolor{red}{Disclaimer: This paper contains sensitive content that may be disturbing to some readers.}

  With the rapid advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), they have demonstrated exceptional capabilities across a variety of vision-language tasks. However, current evaluation benchmarks predominantly focus on objective visual question answering or captioning, inadequately assessing the models' ability to understand complex and subjective human emotions. To bridge this gap, we introduce EmoBench-Reddit, a novel, hierarchical benchmark for multimodal emotion understanding. The dataset comprises 350 meticulously curated samples from the social media platform Reddit, each containing an image, associated user-provided text, and an emotion category (sad, humor, sarcasm, happy) confirmed by user flairs. We designed a hierarchical task framework that progresses from basic perception to advanced cognition, with each data point featuring six multiple-choice questions and one open-ended question of increasing difficulty. Perception tasks evaluate the model's ability to identify basic visual elements (e.g., colors, objects), while cognition tasks require scene reasoning, intent understanding, and deep empathy integrating textual context. We ensured annotation quality through a combination of AI assistance (Claude 4) and manualthis http URLconducted a comprehensive evaluation of nine leading MLLMs, including GPT-5, Gemini-2.5-pro, and GPT-4o, on EmoBench-Reddit.

  As large language models transition to agentic systems, current safety evaluation frameworks face critical gaps in assessing deployment-specific risks. We introduce AgentSeer, an observability-based evaluation framework that decomposes agentic executions into granular action and component graphs, enabling systematic agentic-situational assessment. Through cross-model validation on GPT-OSS-20B and Gemini-2.0-flash using HarmBench single turn and iterative refinement attacks, we demonstrate fundamental differences between model-level and agentic-level vulnerability profiles. Model-level evaluation reveals baseline differences: GPT-OSS-20B (39.47% ASR) versus Gemini-2.0-flash (50.00% ASR), with both models showing susceptibility to social engineering while maintaining logic-based attack resistance. However, agentic-level assessment exposes agent-specific risks invisible to traditional evaluation. We discover "agentic-only" vulnerabilities that emerge exclusively in agentic contexts, with tool-calling showing 24-60% higher ASR across both models. Cross-model analysis reveals universal agentic patterns, agent transfer operations as highest-risk tools, semantic rather than syntactic vulnerability mechanisms, and context-dependent attack effectiveness, alongside model-specific security profiles in absolute ASR levels and optimal injection strategies. Direct attack transfer from model-level to agentic contexts shows degraded performance (GPT-OSS-20B: 57% human injection ASR; Gemini-2.0-flash: 28%), while context-aware iterative attacks successfully compromise objectives that failed at model-level, confirming systematic evaluation gaps. These findings establish the urgent need for agentic-situation evaluation paradigms, with AgentSeer providing the standardized methodology and empirical validation.

  Extensive research has been conducted to explore the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in table reasoning. However, the essential task of transforming tables information into reports remains a significant challenge for industrial applications. This task is plagued by two critical issues: 1) the complexity and diversity of tables lead to suboptimal reasoning outcomes; and 2) existing table benchmarks lack the capacity to adequately assess the practical application of this task. To fill this gap, we propose the table-to-report task and construct a bilingual benchmark named T2R-bench, where the key information flow from the tables to the reports for this task. The benchmark comprises 457 industrial tables, all derived from real-world scenarios and encompassing 19 industry domains as well as 4 types of industrial tables. Furthermore, we propose an evaluation criteria to fairly measure the quality of report generation. The experiments on 25 widely-used LLMs reveal that even state-of-the-art models like Deepseek-R1 only achieves performance with 62.71 overall score, indicating that LLMs still have room for improvement on T2R-bench.

  People often ask questions with false assumptions, a type of question that does not have regular answers. Answering such questions requires first identifying the false assumptions. Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate misleading answers to these questions because of hallucinations. In this paper, we focus on identifying and answering questions with false assumptions in several domains. We first investigate whether the problem reduces to fact verification. Then, we present an approach leveraging external evidence to mitigate hallucinations. Experiments with five LLMs demonstrate that (1) incorporating retrieved evidence is beneficial and (2) generating and validating atomic assumptions yields more improvements and provides an interpretable answer by pinpointing the false assumptions.

  Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences has become a critical step in their development. Recent research has increasingly focused on test-time alignment, where additional compute is allocated during inference to enhance LLM safety and reasoning capabilities. However, these test-time alignment techniques often incur substantial inference costs, limiting their practical application. We are inspired by the speculative sampling acceleration, which leverages a small draft model to efficiently predict future tokens, to address the efficiency bottleneck of test-time alignment. We introduce the reward-shifted speculative sampling (SSS) algorithm, in which the draft model is aligned with human preferences, while the target model remains unchanged. We theoretically demonstrate that the distributional shift between the aligned draft model and the unaligned target model can be exploited to recover the RLHF optimal solution without actually obtaining it, by modifying the acceptance criterion and bonus token distribution. Our algorithm achieves superior gold reward scores at a significantly reduced inference cost in test-time weak-to-strong alignment experiments, thereby validating both its effectiveness and efficiency.

  Large language models (LLMs) have shown the capability to generate fluent and logical content, presenting significant challenges to machine-generated text detection, particularly text polished by adversarial perturbations such as paraphrasing. Current zero-shot detectors often employ Gaussian distributions as statistical measure for computing detection thresholds, which falters when confronted with the heavy-tailed statistical artifacts characteristic of adversarial or non-native English texts. In this paper, we introduce T-Detect, a novel detection method that fundamentally redesigns the curvature-based detectors. Our primary innovation is the replacement of standard Gaussian normalization with a heavy-tailed discrepancy score derived from the Student's t-distribution. This approach is theoretically grounded in the empirical observation that adversarial texts exhibit significant leptokurtosis, rendering traditional statistical assumptions inadequate. T-Detect computes a detection score by normalizing the log-likelihood of a passage against the expected moments of a t-distribution, providing superior resilience to statistical outliers. We validate our approach on the challenging RAID benchmark for adversarial text and the comprehensive HART dataset. Experiments show that T-Detect provides a consistent performance uplift over strong baselines, improving AUROC by up to 3.9\% in targeted domains. When integrated into a two-dimensional detection framework (CT), our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, with an AUROC of 0.926 on the Books domain of RAID. Our contributions are a new, theoretically-justified statistical foundation for text detection, an ablation-validated method that demonstrates superior robustness, and a comprehensive analysis of its performance under adversarial conditions.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong reasoning capabilities for many tasks, often by explicitly decomposing the task via Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. Recent work on LLM-based translation designs hand-crafted prompts to decompose translation, or trains models to incorporate intermediate steps. Translating Step-by-step (Briakou et al., 2024), for instance, introduces a multi-step prompt with decomposition and refinement of translation with LLMs, which achieved state-of-the-art results on WMT24 test data. In this work, we scrutinise this strategy's effectiveness. Empirically, we find no clear evidence that performance gains stem from explicitly decomposing the translation process via CoT, at least for the models on test; and we show prompting LLMs to 'translate again' and self-refine yields even better results than human-like step-by-step prompting. While the decomposition influences translation behaviour, faithfulness to the decomposition has both positive and negative effects on translation. Our analysis therefore suggests a divergence between the optimal translation strategies for humans and LLMs.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in reasoning, positioning them as promising tools for supporting human problem-solving. However, what happens when their performance is affected by misinformation, i.e., incorrect inputs introduced by users due to oversights or gaps in knowledge? Such misinformation is prevalent in real-world interactions with LLMs, yet how it propagates within LLMs' reasoning process remains underexplored. Focusing on mathematical reasoning, we present a comprehensive analysis of how misinformation affects intermediate reasoning steps and final answers. We also examine how effectively LLMs can correct misinformation when explicitly instructed to do so. Even with explicit instructions, LLMs succeed less than half the time in rectifying misinformation, despite possessing correct internal knowledge, leading to significant accuracy drops (10.02% - 72.20%), and the degradation holds with thinking models (4.30% - 19.97%). Further analysis shows that applying factual corrections early in the reasoning process most effectively reduces misinformation propagation, and fine-tuning on synthesized data with early-stage corrections significantly improves reasoning factuality. Our work offers a practical approach to mitigating misinformation propagation.

  Enhancing the linguistic capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to include low-resource languages is a critical research area. Current research directions predominantly rely on synthetic data generated by translating English corpora, which, while demonstrating promising linguistic understanding and translation abilities, often results in models aligned with source language culture. These models frequently fail to represent the cultural heritage and values of local communities. This work proposes a methodology to create both synthetic and retrieval-based pre-training data tailored to a specific community, considering its (i) language, (ii) cultural heritage, and (iii) cultural values. We demonstrate our methodology using Egyptian and Moroccan dialects as testbeds, chosen for their linguistic and cultural richness and current underrepresentation in LLMs. As a proof-of-concept, we develop NileChat, a 3B parameter Egyptian and Moroccan Arabic LLM adapted for Egyptian and Moroccan communities, incorporating their language, cultural heritage, and values. Our results on various understanding, translation, and cultural and values alignment benchmarks show that NileChat outperforms existing Arabic-aware LLMs of similar size and performs on par with larger models. This work addresses Arabic dialect in LLMs with a focus on cultural and values alignment via controlled synthetic data generation and retrieval-augmented pre-training for Moroccan Darija and Egyptian Arabic, including Arabizi variants, advancing Arabic NLP for low-resource communities. We share our methods, data, and models with the community to promote the inclusion and coverage of more diverse communities in cultural LLM development:this https URL.

  Multi-label classification is prevalent in real-world settings, but the behavior of Large Language Models (LLMs) in this setting is understudied. We investigate how autoregressive LLMs perform multi-label classification, focusing on subjective tasks, by analyzing the output distributions of the models at each label generation step. We find that the initial probability distribution for the first label often does not reflect the eventual final output, even in terms of relative order and find LLMs tend to suppress all but one label at each generation step. We further observe that as model scale increases, their token distributions exhibit lower entropy and higher single-label confidence, but the internal relative ranking of the labels improves. Finetuning methods such as supervised finetuning and reinforcement learning amplify this phenomenon. We introduce the task of distribution alignment for multi-label settings: aligning LLM-derived label distributions with empirical distributions estimated from annotator responses in subjective tasks. We propose both zero-shot and supervised methods which improve both alignment and predictive performance over existing approaches. We find one method -- taking the max probability over all label generation distributions instead of just using the initial probability distribution -- improves both distribution alignment and overall F1 classification without adding any additional computation.

  Idioms have long posed a challenge due to their unique linguistic properties, which set them apart from other common expressions. While recent studies have leveraged large language models (LLMs) to handle idioms across various tasks, e.g., idiom-containing sentence generation and idiomatic machine translation, little is known about the underlying mechanisms of idiom processing in LLMs, particularly in multilingual settings. To this end, we introduce MIDAS, a new large-scale dataset of idioms in six languages, each paired with its corresponding meaning. Leveraging this resource, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of LLMs' idiom processing ability, identifying key factors that influence their performance. Our findings suggest that LLMs rely not only on memorization, but also adopt a hybrid approach that integrates contextual cues and reasoning, especially when processing compositional idioms. This implies that idiom understanding in LLMs emerges from an interplay between internal knowledge retrieval and reasoning-based inference.

  Text-to-SQL, which maps natural language to SQL queries, has benefited greatly from recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs). While LLMs offer various paradigms for this task, including prompting and supervised fine-tuning (SFT), SFT approaches still face challenges such as complex multi-stage pipelines and poor robustness to noisy schema information. To address these limitations, we present JOLT-SQL, a streamlined single-stage SFT framework that jointly optimizes schema linking and SQL generation via a unified loss. JOLT-SQL employs discriminative schema linking, enhanced by local bidirectional attention, alongside a confusion-aware noisy schema sampling strategy with selective attention to improve robustness under noisy schema conditions. Experiments on the Spider and BIRD benchmarks demonstrate that JOLT-SQL achieves state-of-the-art execution accuracy among comparable-size open-source models, while significantly improving both training and inference efficiency.

  Ambiguity remains a fundamental challenge in Natural Language Processing (NLP) due to the inherent complexity and flexibility of human language. With the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs), addressing ambiguity has become even more critical due to their expanded capabilities and applications. In the context of Conversational Question Answering (CQA), this paper explores the definition, forms, and implications of ambiguity for language driven systems, particularly in the context of LLMs. We define key terms and concepts, categorize various disambiguation approaches enabled by LLMs, and provide a comparative analysis of their advantages and disadvantages. We also explore publicly available datasets for benchmarking ambiguity detection and resolution techniques and highlight their relevance for ongoing research. Finally, we identify open problems and future research directions, especially in agentic settings, proposing areas for further investigation. By offering a comprehensive review of current research on ambiguities and disambiguation with LLMs, we aim to contribute to the development of more robust and reliable LLM-based systems.

  The task of Critical Questions Generation (CQs-Gen) aims to foster critical thinking by enabling systems to generate questions that expose underlying assumptions and challenge the validity of argumentative reasoning structures. Despite growing interest in this area, progress has been hindered by the lack of suitable datasets and automatic evaluation standards. This paper presents a comprehensive approach to support the development and benchmarking of systems for this task. We construct the first large-scale dataset including ~5K manually annotated questions. We also investigate automatic evaluation methods and propose reference-based techniques as the strategy that best correlates with human judgments. Our zero-shot evaluation of 11 LLMs establishes a strong baseline while showcasing the difficulty of the task. Data and code plus a public leaderboard are provided to encourage further research, not only in terms of model performance, but also to explore the practical benefits of CQs-Gen for both automated reasoning and human critical thinking.

  Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) by encouraging step-by-step reasoning in natural language. However, leveraging a latent continuous space for reasoning may offer benefits in terms of both efficiency and robustness. Prior implicit CoT methods attempt to bypass language completely by reasoning in continuous space but have consistently underperformed compared to the standard explicit CoT approach. We introduce CODI (Continuous Chain-of-Thought via Self-Distillation), a novel training framework that effectively compresses natural language CoT into continuous space. CODI jointly trains a teacher task (Explicit CoT) and a student task (Implicit CoT), distilling the reasoning ability from language into continuous space by aligning the hidden states of a designated token. Our experiments show that CODI is the first implicit CoT approach to match the performance of explicit CoT on GSM8k at the GPT-2 scale, achieving a 3.1x compression rate and outperforming the previous state-of-the-art by 28.2% in accuracy. CODI also demonstrates robustness, generalizable to complex datasets, and interpretability. These results validate that LLMs can reason effectively not only in natural language, but also in a latent continuous space. Code is available atthis https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Do language models (LMs) offer insights into human language learning? A common argument against this idea is that because their architecture and training paradigm are so vastly different from humans, LMs can learn arbitrary inputs as easily as natural languages. We test this claim by training LMs to model impossible and typologically unattested languages. Unlike previous work, which has focused exclusively on English, we conduct experiments on 12 languages from 4 language families with two newly constructed parallel corpora. Our results show that while GPT-2 small can largely distinguish attested languages from their impossible counterparts, it does not achieve perfect separation between all the attested languages and all the impossible ones. We further test whether GPT-2 small distinguishes typologically attested from unattested languages with different NP orders by manipulating word order based on Greenberg's Universal 20. We find that the model's perplexity scores do not distinguish attested vs. unattested word orders, while its performance on the generalization test does. These findings suggest that LMs exhibit some human-like inductive biases, though these biases are weaker than those found in human learners.

  We examine three evaluation paradigms: standard benchmarks (e.g., MMLU and BBH), interactive games (e.g., Signalling Games or Taboo), and cognitive tests (e.g., for working memory or theory of mind). First, we investigate which of the former two-benchmarks or games-is most effective at discriminating LLMs of varying quality. Then, inspired by human cognitive assessments, we compile a suite of targeted tests that measure cognitive abilities deemed essential for effective language use, and we investigate their correlation with model performance in benchmarks and games. Our analyses reveal that interactive games are superior to standard benchmarks in discriminating models. Causal and logical reasoning correlate with both static and interactive tests, while differences emerge regarding core executive functions and social/emotional skills, which correlate more with games. We advocate for the development of new interactive benchmarks and targeted cognitive tasks inspired by assessing human abilities but designed specifically for LLMs.

  Detecting disinformation that blends manipulated text and images has become increasingly challenging, as AI tools make synthetic content easy to generate and disseminate. While most existing AI safety benchmarks focus on single modality misinformation (i.e., false content shared without intent to deceive), intentional multimodal disinformation, such as propaganda or conspiracy theories that imitate credible news, remains largely unaddressed. We introduce the Vision-Language Disinformation Detection Benchmark (VLDBench), the first large-scale resource supporting both unimodal (text-only) and multimodal (text + image) disinformation detection. VLDBench comprises approximately 62,000 labeled text-image pairs across 13 categories, curated from 58 news outlets. Using a semi-automated pipeline followed by expert review, 22 domain experts invested over 500 hours to produce high-quality annotations with substantial inter-annotator agreement. Evaluations of state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on VLDBench show that incorporating visual cues improves detection accuracy by 5 to 35 percentage points over text-only models. VLDBench provides data and code for evaluation, fine-tuning, and robustness testing to support disinformation analysis. Developed in alignment with AI governance frameworks (e.g., the MIT AI Risk Repository), VLDBench offers a principled foundation for advancing trustworthy disinformation detection in multimodal media.Project:this https URLDataset:this https URLCode:this https URL

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Sequence labeling remains a significant challenge in low-resource, domain-specific scenarios, particularly for character-dense languages like Chinese. Existing methods primarily focus on enhancing model comprehension and improving data diversity to boost performance. However, these approaches still struggle with inadequate model applicability and semantic distribution biases in domain-specific contexts. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel framework that combines an LLM-based knowledge enhancement workflow with a span-based Knowledge Fusion for Rich and Efficient Extraction (KnowFREE) model. Our workflow employs explanation prompts to generate precise contextual interpretations of target entities, effectively mitigating semantic biases and enriching the model's contextual understanding. The KnowFREE model further integrates extension label features, enabling efficient nested entity extraction without relying on external knowledge during inference. Experiments on multiple Chinese domain-specific sequence labeling datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, effectively addressing the challenges posed by low-resource settings.

  Recently, using large language models (LLMs) for data augmentation has led to considerable improvements in unsupervised sentence embedding models. However, existing methods encounter two primary challenges: limited data diversity and high data noise. Current approaches often neglect fine-grained knowledge, such as entities and quantities, leading to insufficient diversity. Besides, unsupervised data frequently lacks discriminative information, and the generated synthetic samples may introduce noise. In this paper, we propose a pipeline-based data augmentation method via LLMs and introduce the Gaussian-decayed gradient-assisted Contrastive Sentence Embedding (GCSE) model to enhance unsupervised sentence embeddings. To tackle the issue of low data diversity, our pipeline utilizes knowledge graphs (KGs) to extract entities and quantities, enabling LLMs to generate more diverse samples. To address high data noise, the GCSE model uses a Gaussian-decayed function to limit the impact of false hard negative samples, enhancing the model's discriminative capability. Experimental results show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in semantic textual similarity (STS) tasks, using fewer data samples and smaller LLMs, demonstrating its efficiency and robustness across various models.

  Health informatics research is characterized by diverse data modalities, rapid knowledge expansion, and the need to integrate insights across biomedical science, data analytics, and clinical practice. These characteristics make it particularly well-suited for agent-based approaches that can automate knowledge exploration, manage complex workflows, and generate clinically meaningful outputs. Recent progress in large language model (LLM)-based agents has demonstrated promising capabilities in literature synthesis, data analysis, and even end-to-end research execution. However, existing systems remain limited for health informatics because they lack mechanisms to interpret medical visualizations and often overlook domain-specific quality requirements. To address these gaps, we introduce OpenLens AI, a fully automated framework tailored to health informatics. OpenLens AI integrates specialized agents for literature review, data analysis, code generation, and manuscript preparation, enhanced by vision-language feedback for medical visualization and quality control for reproducibility. The framework automates the entire research pipeline, producing publication-ready LaTeX manuscripts with transparent and traceable workflows, thereby offering a domain-adapted solution for advancing health informatics research.

  Controlling desktop applications via software remains a fundamental yet under-served problem. Existing multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) ingest screenshots and task instructions to generate keystrokes and mouse events, but they suffer from prohibitive inference latency, poor sample efficiency on long-horizon sparse-reward tasks, and infeasible on-device deployment. We introduce a lightweight hierarchical reinforcement learning framework, ComputerAgent, that formulates OS control as a two-level option process (manager and subpolicy), employs a triple-modal state encoder (screenshot, task ID, numeric state) to handle visual and contextual diversity, integrates meta-actions with an early-stop mechanism to reduce wasted interactions, and uses a compact vision backbone plus small policy networks for on-device inference (15M parameters). On a suite of 135 real-world desktop tasks, ComputerAgent attains 92.1% success on simple tasks (<8 steps) and 58.8% on hard tasks (>=8 steps), matching or exceeding 200B-parameter MLLM baselines on simple scenarios while reducing model size by over four orders of magnitude and halving inference time. These results demonstrate that hierarchical RL offers a practical, scalable alternative to monolithic MLLM-based automation for computer control.

  With the rising global burden of chronic diseases and the multimodal and heterogeneous clinical data (medical imaging, free-text recordings, wearable sensor streams, etc.), there is an urgent need for a unified multimodal AI framework that can proactively predict individual health risks. We propose VL-RiskFormer, a hierarchical stacked visual-language multimodal Transformer with a large language model (LLM) inference head embedded in its top layer. The system builds on the dual-stream architecture of existing visual-linguistic models (e.g., PaLM-E, LLaVA) with four key innovations: (i) pre-training with cross-modal comparison and fine-grained alignment of radiological images, fundus maps, and wearable device photos with corresponding clinical narratives using momentum update encoders and debiased InfoNCE losses; (ii) a time fusion block that integrates irregular visit sequences into the causal Transformer decoder through adaptive time interval position coding; (iii) a disease ontology map adapter that injects ICD-10 codes into visual and textual channels in layers and infers comorbid patterns with the help of a graph attention mechanism. On the MIMIC-IV longitudinal cohort, VL-RiskFormer achieved an average AUROC of 0.90 with an expected calibration error of 2.7 percent.

  _Mustafa Sameen, Xiaojian Zhang, Xilei Zhao_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Accurate modeling of ridesourcing mode choices is essential for designing and implementing effective traffic management policies for reducing congestion, improving mobility, and allocating resources more efficiently. Existing models for predicting ridesourcing mode choices often suffer from limited predictive accuracy due to their inability to capture key psychological factors, and are further challenged by severe class imbalance, as ridesourcing trips comprise only a small fraction of individuals' daily travel. To address these limitations, this paper introduces the Synthesizing Attitudes, Predicting Actions (SAPA) framework, a hierarchical approach that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to synthesize theory-grounded latent attitudes to predict ridesourcing choices. SAPA first uses an LLM to generate qualitative traveler personas from raw travel survey data and then trains a propensity-score model on demographic and behavioral features, enriched by those personas, to produce an individual-level score. Next, the LLM assigns quantitative scores to theory-driven latent variables (e.g., time and cost sensitivity), and a final classifier integrates the propensity score, latent-variable scores (with their interaction terms), and observable trip attributes to predict ridesourcing mode choice. Experiments on a large-scale, multi-year travel survey show that SAPA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, improving ridesourcing choice predictions by up to 75.9% in terms of PR-AUC on a held-out test set. This study provides a powerful tool for accurately predicting ridesourcing mode choices, and provides a methodology that is readily transferable to various applications.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Accurate interpretation of soil moisture patterns is critical for irrigation scheduling and crop management, yet existing approaches for soil moisture time-series analysis either rely on threshold-based rules or data-hungry machine learning or deep learning models that are limited in adaptability and interpretability. In this study, we introduce SPADE (Soil moisture Pattern and Anomaly DEtection), an integrated framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to jointly detect irrigation patterns and anomalies in soil moisture time-series data. SPADE utilizes ChatGPT-4.1 for its advanced reasoning and instruction-following capabilities, enabling zero-shot analysis without requiring task-specific annotation or fine-tuning. By converting time-series data into a textual representation and designing domain-informed prompt templates, SPADE identifies irrigation events, estimates net irrigation gains, detects, classifies anomalies, and produces structured, interpretable reports. Experiments were conducted on real-world soil moisture sensor data from commercial and experimental farms cultivating multiple crops across the United States. Results demonstrate that SPADE outperforms the existing method in anomaly detection, achieving higher recall and F1 scores and accurately classifying anomaly types. Furthermore, SPADE achieved high precision and recall in detecting irrigation events, indicating its strong capability to capture irrigation patterns accurately. SPADE's reports provide interpretability and usability of soil moisture analytics. This study highlights the potential of LLMs as scalable, adaptable tools for precision agriculture, which is capable of integrating qualitative knowledge and data-driven reasoning to produce actionable insights for accurate soil moisture monitoring and improved irrigation scheduling from soil moisture time-series data.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) are becoming increasingly widespread. Organizations that want to use AI for productivity now face an important decision. They can subscribe to commercial LLM services or deploy models on their own infrastructure. Cloud services from providers such as OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google are attractive because they provide easy access to state-of-the-art models and are easy to scale. However, concerns about data privacy, the difficulty of switching service providers, and long-term operating costs have driven interest in local deployment of open-source models. This paper presents a cost-benefit analysis framework to help organizations determine when on-premise LLM deployment becomes economically viable compared to commercial subscription services. We consider the hardware requirements, operational expenses, and performance benchmarks of the latest open-source models, including Qwen, Llama, Mistral, and etc. Then we compare the total cost of deploying these models locally with the major cloud providers subscription fee. Our findings provide an estimated breakeven point based on usage levels and performance needs. These results give organizations a practical framework for planning their LLM strategies.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The proliferation of large models has intensified the need for efficient data valuation methods to quantify the contribution of individual data providers. Traditional approaches, such as game-theory-based Shapley value and influence-function-based techniques, face prohibitive computational costs or require access to full data and model training details, making them hardly achieve partial data valuation. To address this, we propose Unlearning Shapley, a novel framework that leverages machine unlearning to estimate data values efficiently. By unlearning target data from a pretrained model and measuring performance shifts on a reachable test set, our method computes Shapley values via Monte Carlo sampling, avoiding retraining and eliminating dependence on full data. Crucially, Unlearning Shapley supports both full and partial data valuation, making it scalable for large models (e.g., LLMs) and practical for data markets. Experiments on benchmark datasets and large-scale text corpora demonstrate that our approach matches the accuracy of state-of-the-art methods while reducing computational overhead by orders of magnitude. Further analysis confirms a strong correlation between estimated values and the true impact of data subsets, validating its reliability in real-world scenarios. This work bridges the gap between data valuation theory and practical deployment, offering a scalable, privacy-compliant solution for modern AI ecosystems.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) can amplify misinformation, undermining societal goals like the UN SDGs. We study three documented drivers of misinformation (valence framing, information overload, and oversimplification) which are often shaped by one's default beliefs. Building on evidence that LLMs encode such defaults (e.g., "joy is positive," "math is complex") and can act as "bags of heuristics," we ask: can general belief-driven heuristics behind misinformative behaviour be recovered from LLMs as clear rules? A key obstacle is that global rule-extraction methods in explainable AI (XAI) are built for numerical inputs/outputs, not text. We address this by eliciting global LLM beliefs and mapping them to numerical scores via statistically reliable abstractions, thereby enabling off-the-shelf global XAI to detect belief-related heuristics in LLMs. To obtain ground truth, we hard-code bias-inducing nonlinear heuristics of increasing complexity (univariate, conjunctive, nonconvex) into popular LLMs (ChatGPT and Llama) via system instructions. This way, we find that RuleFit under-detects non-univariate biases, while global SHAP better approximates conjunctive ones but does not yield actionable rules. To bridge this gap, we propose RuleSHAP, a rule-extraction algorithm that couples global SHAP-value aggregations with rule induction to better capture non-univariate bias, improving heuristics detection over RuleFit by +94% (MRR@1) on average. Our results provide a practical pathway for revealing belief-driven biases in LLMs.

  Large frontier models like GPT-5 now achieve top scores on medical benchmarks. But our stress tests tell a different story. Leading systems often guess correctly even when key inputs like images are removed, flip answers under trivial prompt changes, and fabricate convincing yet flawed reasoning. These aren't glitches; they expose how today's benchmarks reward test-taking tricks over medical understanding. We evaluate six flagship models across six widely used benchmarks and find that high leaderboard scores hide brittleness and shortcut learning. Through clinician-guided rubric evaluation, we show that benchmarks vary widely in what they truly measure yet are treated interchangeably, masking failure modes. We caution that medical benchmark scores do not directly reflect real-world readiness. If we want AI to earn trust in healthcare, we must demand more than leaderboard wins and must hold systems accountable for robustness, sound reasoning, and alignment with real medical demands.

  Large language models (LLMs) often reflect Western-centric biases, limiting their effectiveness in diverse cultural contexts. Although some work has explored cultural alignment, the potential for cross-cultural transfer, using alignment in one culture to improve performance in others, remains underexplored. This paper investigates cross-cultural transfer of commonsense reasoning in the Arab world, where linguistic and historical similarities coexist with local cultural differences. Using a culturally grounded commonsense reasoning dataset covering 13 Arab countries, we evaluate lightweight alignment methods such as in-context learning and demonstration-based reinforcement (DITTO), alongside baselines like supervised fine-tuning and direct preference optimization. Our results show that merely 12 culture-specific examples from one country can improve performance in others by 10\% on average, within multilingual models. In addition, we demonstrate that out-of-culture demonstrations from Indonesia and US contexts can match or surpass in-culture alignment for MCQ reasoning, highlighting cultural commonsense transferability beyond the Arab world. These findings demonstrate that efficient cross-cultural alignment is possible and offer a promising approach to adapt LLMs to low-resource cultural settings.

  We introduce transductive program synthesis, a new formulation of the program synthesis task that explicitly leverages test inputs during synthesis. While prior approaches to program synthesis--whether based on natural language descriptions or input-output examples--typically aim to generalize from training examples, they often struggle with robustness, especially in real-world settings where training examples are limited and test inputs involve various edge cases. To address this, we propose a novel framework that improves robustness by treating synthesis as an active learning over a finite hypothesis class defined by programs' outputs. We use an LLM to predict outputs for selected test inputs and eliminate inconsistent hypotheses, where the inputs are chosen via a greedy maximin algorithm to minimize the number of LLM queries required. We evaluate our approach on four benchmarks: Playgol, MBPP+, 1D-ARC, and programmatic world modeling on MiniGrid. We demonstrate that our method significantly improves program synthesis in both accuracy and efficiency. We release our code atthis https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Failure attribution in multi-agent systems -- pinpointing the exact step where a decisive error occurs -- is a critical yet unsolved challenge. Current methods treat this as a pattern recognition task over long conversation logs, leading to critically low step-level accuracy (below 17\%), which renders them impractical for debugging complex systems. Their core weakness is a fundamental inability to perform robust counterfactual reasoning: to determine if correcting a single action would have actually averted the task failure. To bridge this \emph{counterfactual inference gap}, we introduce Abduct-Act-Predict (A2P) Scaffolding, a novel agent framework that transforms failure attribution from pattern recognition into a structured causal inference task. A2P explicitly guides a large language model through a formal three-step reasoning process within a single inference pass: (1) Abduction, to infer the hidden root causes behind an agent's actions; (2) Action, to define a minimal corrective intervention; and (3) Prediction, to simulate the subsequent trajectory and verify if the intervention resolves the failure. This structured approach leverages the holistic context of the entire conversation while imposing a rigorous causal logic on the model's analysis. Our extensive experiments on the Who\&When benchmark demonstrate its efficacy. On the Algorithm-Generated dataset, A2P achieves 47.46\% step-level accuracy, a 2.85$\times$ improvement over the 16.67\% of the baseline. On the more complex Hand-Crafted dataset, it achieves 29.31\% step accuracy, a 2.43$\times$ improvement over the baseline's 12.07\%. By reframing the problem through a causal lens, A2P Scaffolding provides a robust, verifiable, and significantly more accurate solution for automated failure attribution.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The integration of external knowledge through Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become foundational in enhancing large language models (LLMs) for knowledge-intensive tasks. However, existing RAG paradigms often overlook the cognitive step of applying knowledge, leaving a gap between retrieved facts and task-specific reasoning. In this work, we introduce RAG+, a principled and modular extension that explicitly incorporates application-aware reasoning into the RAG pipeline. RAG+ constructs a dual corpus consisting of knowledge and aligned application examples, created either manually or automatically, and retrieves both jointly during inference. This design enables LLMs not only to access relevant information but also to apply it within structured, goal-oriented reasoning processes. Experiments across mathematical, legal, and medical domains, conducted on multiple models, demonstrate that RAG+ consistently outperforms standard RAG variants, achieving average improvements of 3-5%, and peak gains up to 13.5% in complex scenarios. By bridging retrieval with actionable application, RAG+ advances a more cognitively grounded framework for knowledge integration, representing a step toward more interpretable and capable LLMs.

  Reward modeling is a key step in building safe foundation models when applying reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) to align Large Language Models (LLMs). However, reward modeling based on the Bradley-Terry (BT) model assumes a global reward function, failing to capture the inherently diverse and heterogeneous human preferences. Hence, such oversimplification limits LLMs from supporting personalization and pluralistic alignment. Theoretically, we show that when human preferences follow a mixture distribution of diverse subgroups, a single BT model has an irreducible error. While existing solutions, such as multi-objective learning with fine-grained annotations, help address this issue, they are costly and constrained by predefined attributes, failing to fully capture the richness of human values. In this work, we introduce MiCRo, a two-stage framework that enhances personalized preference learning by leveraging large-scale binary preference datasets without requiring explicit fine-grained annotations. In the first stage, MiCRo introduces context-aware mixture modeling approach to capture diverse human preferences. In the second stage, MiCRo integrates an online routing strategy that dynamically adapts mixture weights based on specific context to resolve ambiguity, allowing for efficient and scalable preference adaptation with minimal additional supervision. Experiments on multiple preference datasets demonstrate that MiCRo effectively captures diverse human preferences and significantly improves downstream personalization.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in reasoning, exemplified by the success of OpenAI-o1 and DeepSeek-R1. However, integrating reasoning with external search processes remains challenging, especially for complex multi-hop questions requiring multiple retrieval steps. We propose ReSearch, a novel framework that trains LLMs to Reason with Search via reinforcement learning without using any supervised data on reasoning steps. Our approach treats search operations as integral components of the reasoning chain, where when and how to perform searches is guided by text-based thinking, and search results subsequently influence further reasoning. We train ReSearch on Qwen2.5-7B(-Instruct) and Qwen2.5-32B(-Instruct) models and conduct extensive experiments. Despite being trained on only one dataset, our models demonstrate strong generalizability across various benchmarks. Analysis reveals that ReSearch naturally elicits advanced reasoning capabilities such as reflection and self-correction during the reinforcement learning process.

  Proper initialization is crucial for any system, particularly in multi-agent systems (MAS), where it plays a pivotal role in determining both the system's efficiency and effectiveness. However, existing MAS initialization methods do not fully account for the collaborative needs of the generated agents in subsequent stages. Inspired by the principles of effective team composition, we propose AgentInit, which aims to optimize the structure of agent teams. Specifically, in addition to multi-round interactions and reflections between agents during agent generation, AgentInit incorporates a Natural Language to Format mechanism to ensure consistency and standardization. Balanced team selection strategies using Pareto principles are subsequently applied to jointly consider agent team diversity and task relevance to promote effective and efficient collaboration and enhance overall system performance. Experiments show that AgentInit consistently outperforms state-of-the-art initialization methods and pre-defined strategies across various frameworks and tasks, achieving an overall performance improvement of up to 1.2 and 1.6, respectively, while also significantly reducing token consumption. Further analysis confirms its strong transferability to similar tasks and verifies the effectiveness of its key components, demonstrating its capability and adaptability as a reliable MAS initialization method.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) have been widely adopted as task planners for AI agents in sequential decision-making problems, leveraging their extensive world knowledge. However, the gap between their general knowledge and environment-specific requirements often leads to inaccurate plans. To address this, existing approaches rely on frequent LLM queries to iteratively refine plans based on immediate environmental feedback, which incurs substantial query costs. However, this refinement is typically guided by short-term environmental feedback, limiting LLMs from developing plans aligned with long-term rewards. We propose Code Driven Planning with Domain-Adaptive Critic (CoPiC). Instead of relying on frequent queries, CoPiC employs LLMs to generate a diverse set of high-level planning programs, which iteratively produce and refine candidate plans. A trained domain-adaptive critic then evaluates these candidates and selects the one most aligned with long-term rewards for execution. Using high-level planning programs as planner and domain-adaptive critic as estimator, CoPiC improves planning while significantly reducing query costs. Results in ALFWorld, NetHack, and StarCraft II Unit Building show that CoPiC outperforms advanced LLM-based baselines, AdaPlanner and Reflexion, achieving an average (1) 23.33% improvement in success rate and (2) 91.27% reduction in query costs.

  Driven by the rapid advancements of Large Language Models (LLMs), LLM-based agents have emerged as powerful intelligent systems capable of human-like cognition, reasoning, and interaction. These agents are increasingly being deployed across diverse real-world applications, including student education, scientific research, and financial analysis. However, despite their remarkable potential, LLM-based agents remain vulnerable to hallucination issues, which can result in erroneous task execution and undermine the reliability of the overall system design. Addressing this critical challenge requires a deep understanding and a systematic consolidation of recent advances on LLM-based agents. To this end, we present the first comprehensive survey of hallucinations in LLM-based agents. By carefully analyzing the complete workflow of agents, we propose a new taxonomy that identifies different types of agent hallucinations occurring at different stages. Furthermore, we conduct an in-depth examination of eighteen triggering causes underlying the emergence of agent hallucinations. Through a detailed review of a large number of existing studies, we summarize approaches for hallucination mitigation and detection, and highlight promising directions for future research. We hope this survey will inspire further efforts toward addressing hallucinations in LLM-based agents, ultimately contributing to the development of more robust and reliable agent systems.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have emphasized the critical role of fine-tuning (FT) techniques in adapting LLMs to specific tasks, especially when retraining from scratch is computationally infeasible. Fine-tuning enables LLMs to leverage task- or domain-specific data, producing models that more effectively meet the requirements of targeted applications. However, con- ventional FT approaches often suffer from catastrophic forgetting and suboptimal data efficiency, limiting their real-world applicability. To address these challenges, this paper proposes DEAL, a novel framework that integrates Low-Rank Adapta- tion (LoRA) with a continuous fine-tuning strategy. By incorporating knowledge retention and adaptive parameter update modules, the framework mitigates the lim- itations of existing FT methods while maintaining efficiency in privacy-preserving settings. Experiments on 15 diverse datasets show that DEAL consistently outper- forms baseline methods, yielding substantial gains in task accuracy and resource efficiency. These findings demonstrate the potential of our approach to advance continual adaptation in LLMs by enhancing task performance while improving resource efficiency.

  Under a unified operational definition, we define LLM memory as a persistent state written during pretraining, finetuning, or inference that can later be addressed and that stably influences outputs. We propose a four-part taxonomy (parametric, contextual, external, procedural/episodic) and a memory quadruple (location, persistence, write/access path, controllability). We link mechanism, evaluation, and governance via the chain write -> read -> inhibit/update. To avoid distorted comparisons across heterogeneous setups, we adopt a three-setting protocol (parametric only, offline retrieval, online retrieval) that decouples capability from information availability on the same data and timeline. On this basis we build a layered evaluation: parametric (closed-book recall, edit differential, memorization/privacy), contextual (position curves and the mid-sequence drop), external (answer correctness vs snippet attribution/faithfulness), and procedural/episodic (cross-session consistency and timeline replay, E MARS+). The framework integrates temporal governance and leakage auditing (freshness hits, outdated answers, refusal slices) and uncertainty reporting via inter-rater agreement plus paired tests with multiple-comparison correction. For updating and forgetting, we present DMM Gov: coordinating DAPT/TAPT, PEFT, model editing (ROME, MEND, MEMIT, SERAC), and RAG to form an auditable loop covering admission thresholds, rollout, monitoring, rollback, and change audits, with specs for timeliness, conflict handling, and long-horizon consistency. Finally, we give four testable propositions: minimum identifiability; a minimal evaluation card; causally constrained editing with verifiable forgetting; and when retrieval with small-window replay outperforms ultra-long-context reading. This yields a reproducible, comparable, and governable coordinate system for research and deployment.

  User profiling, as a core technique for user understanding, aims to infer structural attributes from user information. Large Language Models (LLMs) provide a promising avenue for user profiling, yet the progress is hindered by the lack of comprehensive benchmarks. To bridge this gap, we propose ProfileBench, an industrial benchmark derived from a real-world video platform, encompassing heterogeneous user data and a well-structured profiling taxonomy. However, the profiling task remains challenging due to the difficulty of collecting large-scale ground-truth labels, and the heterogeneous and noisy user information can compromise the reliability of LLMs. To approach label-free and reliable user profiling, we propose a Confidence-driven Profile reasoning framework Conf-Profile, featuring a two-stage paradigm. We first synthesize high-quality labels by leveraging advanced LLMs with confidence hints, followed by confidence-weighted voting for accuracy improvement and confidence calibration for a balanced distribution. The multiple profile results, rationales, and confidence scores are aggregated and distilled into a lightweight LLM. We further enhance the reasoning ability via confidence-guided unsupervised reinforcement learning, which exploits confidence for difficulty filtering, quasi-ground truth voting, and reward weighting. Experimental results demonstrate that Conf-Profile delivers substantial performance through the two-stage training, improving F1 by 13.97 on Qwen3-8B.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Accurate International Classification of Diseases (ICD) coding is critical for clinical documentation, billing, and healthcare analytics, yet it remains a labour-intensive and error-prone task. Although large language models (LLMs) show promise in automating ICD coding, their challenges in base model selection, input contextualization, and training data redundancy limit their effectiveness. We propose a modular framework for ICD-10 Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) code prediction that addresses these challenges through principled model selection, redundancy-aware data sampling, and structured input design. The framework integrates an LLM-as-judge evaluation protocol with Plackett-Luce aggregation to assess and rank open-source LLMs based on their intrinsic comprehension of ICD-10-CM code definitions. We introduced embedding-based similarity measures, a redundancy-aware sampling strategy to remove semantically duplicated discharge summaries. We leverage structured discharge summaries from Taiwanese hospitals to evaluate contextual effects and examine section-wise content inclusion under universal and section-specific modelling paradigms. Experiments across two institutional datasets demonstrate that the selected base model after fine-tuning consistently outperforms baseline LLMs in internal and external evaluations. Incorporating more clinical sections consistently improves prediction performance. This study uses open-source LLMs to establish a practical and principled approach to ICD-10-CM code prediction. The proposed framework provides a scalable, institution-ready solution for real-world deployment of automated medical coding systems by combining informed model selection, efficient data refinement, and context-aware prompting.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this paper, we introduce LLMCHECKER, a model-checking-based verification method to verify the probabilistic computation tree logic (PCTL) properties of an LLM text generation process. We empirically show that only a limited number of tokens are typically chosen during text generation, which are not always the same. This insight drives the creation of $\alpha$-$k$-bounded text generation, narrowing the focus to the $\alpha$ maximal cumulative probability on the top-$k$ tokens at every step of the text generation process. Our verification method considers an initial string and the subsequent top-$k$ tokens while accommodating diverse text quantification methods, such as evaluating text quality and biases. The threshold $\alpha$ further reduces the selected tokens, only choosing those that exceed or meet it in cumulative probability. LLMCHECKER then allows us to formally verify the PCTL properties of $\alpha$-$k$-bounded LLMs. We demonstrate the applicability of our method in several LLMs, including Llama, Gemma, Mistral, Genstruct, and BERT. To our knowledge, this is the first time PCTL-based model checking has been used to check the consistency of the LLM text generation process.

  The Agent Directory Service (ADS) is a distributed directory for the discovery of AI agent capabilities, metadata, and provenance. It leverages content-addressed storage, hierarchical taxonomies, and cryptographic signing to enable efficient, verifiable, and multi-dimensional discovery across heterogeneous Multi-Agent Systems (MAS). Built on the Open Agentic Schema Framework (OASF), ADS decouples capability indexing from content location through a two-level mapping realized over a Kademlia-based Distributed Hash Table (DHT). It reuses mature OCI / ORAS infrastructure for artifact distribution, integrates Sigstore for provenance, and supports schema-driven extensibility for emerging agent modalities (LLM prompt agents, MCP servers, A2A-enabled components). This paper formalizes the architectural model, describes storage and discovery layers, explains security and performance properties, and positions ADS within the broader landscape of emerging agent registry and interoperability initiatives.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Scaling model size, training data, and compute power have driven advances in large language models (LLMs), but these approaches are reaching saturation as human-generated text is exhausted and further gains diminish. We propose experience scaling, a framework for continuous post-deployment evolution for LLMs through autonomous interaction with the environment and collaborative sharing of accumulated experience. The framework captures raw interactions, distills them into compact, reusable knowledge, and periodically refines stored content to preserve relevance and efficiency. We validate the framework in simulated real-world scenarios involving generalization to previously unseen but related tasks, repetitive queries, and over-saturated knowledge stores. Across all settings, experience scaling improves accuracy, sustains performance over time, and maintains gains when applied to novel situations. These results demonstrate that structured post-deployment learning can extend LLM capabilities beyond the limits of static human-generated data, offering a scalable path for continued intelligence progress.

  As data continues to grow in scale and complexity, preparing, transforming, and analyzing it remains labor-intensive, repetitive, and difficult to scale. Since data contains knowledge and AI learns knowledge from it, the alignment between AI and data is essential. However, data is often not structured in ways that are optimal for AI utilization. Moreover, an important question arises: how much knowledge can we pack into data through intensive data operations? Autonomous data agents (DataAgents), which integrate LLM reasoning with task decomposition, action reasoning and grounding, and tool calling, can autonomously interpret data task descriptions, decompose tasks into subtasks, reason over actions, ground actions into python code or tool calling, and execute operations. Unlike traditional data management and engineering tools, DataAgents dynamically plan workflows, call powerful tools, and adapt to diverse data tasks at scale. This report argues that DataAgents represent a paradigm shift toward autonomous data-to-knowledge systems. DataAgents are capable of handling collection, integration, preprocessing, selection, transformation, reweighing, augmentation, reprogramming, repairs, and retrieval. Through these capabilities, DataAgents transform complex and unstructured data into coherent and actionable knowledge. We first examine why the convergence of agentic AI and data-to-knowledge systems has emerged as a critical trend. We then define the concept of DataAgents and discuss their architectural design, training strategies, as well as the new skills and capabilities they enable. Finally, we call for concerted efforts to advance action workflow optimization, establish open datasets and benchmark ecosystems, safeguard privacy, balance efficiency with scalability, and develop trustworthy DataAgent guardrails to prevent malicious actions.

  Graph-based Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has become a widely studied approach for improving the reasoning, accuracy, and factuality of Large Language Models. However, many existing graph-based RAG systems overlook the high cost associated with LLM token usage during graph construction, hindering large-scale adoption. To address this, we propose TERAG, a simple yet effective framework designed to build informative graphs at a significantly lower cost. Inspired by HippoRAG, we incorporate Personalized PageRank (PPR) during the retrieval phase, and we achieve at least 80% of the accuracy of widely used graph-based RAG methods while consuming only 3%-11% of the output tokens.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at various tasks, including problem-solving and question-answering. However, LLMs often find Math Word Problems (MWPs) challenging because solving them requires a range of reasoning and mathematical abilities with which LLMs seem to struggle. Recent efforts have helped LLMs solve more complex MWPs with improved prompts. This study proposes a novel method that initially prompts an LLM to create equations from a decomposition of the question, followed by using an external symbolic equation solver to produce an answer. To ensure the accuracy of the obtained answer, inspired by an established recommendation of math teachers, the LLM is instructed to solve the MWP a second time, but this time with the objective of estimating the correct answer instead of solving it exactly. The estimation is then compared to the generated answer to verify. If verification fails, an iterative rectification process is employed to ensure the correct answer is eventually found. This approach achieves new state-of-the-art results on datasets used by prior published research on numeric and algebraic MWPs, improving the previous best results by nearly two percent on average. In addition, the approach obtains satisfactory results on trigonometric MWPs, a task not previously attempted to the authors' best knowledge. This study also introduces two new datasets, SVAMPClean and Trig300, to further advance the testing of LLMs' reasoning abilities.

  Compared to traditional models, agentic AI represents a highly valuable target for potential attackers as they possess privileged access to data sources and API tools, which are traditionally not incorporated into classical agents. Unlike a typical software application residing in a Demilitarized Zone (DMZ), agentic LLMs consciously rely on nondeterministic behavior of the AI (only defining a final goal, leaving the path selection to LLM). This characteristic introduces substantial security risk to both operational security and information security. Most common existing defense mechanism rely on detection of malicious intent and preventing it from reaching the LLM agent, thus protecting against jailbreak attacks such as prompt injection. In this paper, we present an alternative approach, LLMZ+, which moves beyond traditional detection-based approaches by implementing prompt whitelisting. Through this method, only contextually appropriate and safe messages are permitted to interact with the agentic LLM. By leveraging the specificity of context, LLMZ+ guarantees that all exchanges between external users and the LLM conform to predefined use cases and operational boundaries. Our approach streamlines the security framework, enhances its long-term resilience, and reduces the resources required for sustaining LLM information security. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that LLMZ+ provides strong resilience against the most common jailbreak prompts. At the same time, legitimate business communications are not disrupted, and authorized traffic flows seamlessly between users and the agentic LLM. We measure the effectiveness of approach using false positive and false negative rates, both of which can be reduced to 0 in our experimental setting.

  Function calling is a core capability of large language models, essential for AI agents. Existing benchmarks such as the Berkeley Function Calling Leaderboard (BFCL), tau^2-Bench (arXiv:2506.07982), and ACEBench (arXiv:2501.12851) evaluate argument correctness but do not test adherence to format instructions embedded in parameter descriptions, such as enclosing values in double quotes or using ISO date formats.We introduce IFEval-FC, a benchmark inspired by IFEval (arXiv:2311.07911) that assesses precise instruction following in function calling. IFEval-FC encodes verifiable formats directly within JSON schema descriptions, for example specifying that a value must not contain punctuation. It includes 750 test cases, each consisting of a function with an embedded format for one of its input parameters and a corresponding user query. Evaluation is fully algorithmic, ensuring objectivity, reproducibility, and scalability.Our results show that even state-of-the-art proprietary models, including GPT-5 and Claude 4.1 Opus, frequently fail to follow basic formatting rules, highlighting a practical limitation for real-world agent systems.

  Accurate classification of products under the Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) is a critical bottleneck in global trade, yet it has received little attention from the machine learning community. Misclassification can halt shipments entirely, with major postal operators suspending deliveries to the U.S. due to incomplete customs documentation. We introduce the first benchmark for HTS code classification, derived from the U.S. Customs Rulings Online Search System (CROSS). Evaluating leading LLMs, we find that our fine-tuned Atlas model (LLaMA-3.3-70B) achieves 40 percent fully correct 10-digit classifications and 57.5 percent correct 6-digit classifications, improvements of 15 points over GPT-5-Thinking and 27.5 points over Gemini-2.5-Pro-Thinking. Beyond accuracy, Atlas is roughly five times cheaper than GPT-5-Thinking and eight times cheaper than Gemini-2.5-Pro-Thinking, and can be self-hosted to guarantee data privacy in high-stakes trade and compliance workflows. While Atlas sets a strong baseline, the benchmark remains highly challenging, with only 40 percent 10-digit accuracy. By releasing both dataset and model, we aim to position HTS classification as a new community benchmark task and invite future work in retrieval, reasoning, and alignment.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Generative AI, and specifically GPT, can produce a remarkable solution to a mechanical engineering analysis problem - but also, on occasion, a flawed solution. For example, an elementary mechanics problem is solved flawlessly in one GPT instance and incorrectly in a subsequent GPT instance, with a success probability of only 85%. This unreliability renders "out-of-the-box" GPT unsuitable for deployment in education or engineering practice. We introduce an "N-Plus-1" GPT Agency for Initial (Low-Cost) Analysis of mechanical engineering Problem Statements. Agency first launches N instantiations of Agent Solve to yield N independent Proposed Problem Solution Realizations; Agency then invokes Agent Compare to summarize and compare the N Proposed Problem Solution Realizations and to provide a Recommended Problem Solution. We argue from Condorcet's Jury Theorem that, for a Problem Statement characterized by per-Solve success probability greater than 1/2 (and N sufficiently large), the Predominant (Agent Compare) Proposed Problem Solution will, with high probability, correspond to a Correct Proposed Problem Solution. Furthermore, Agent Compare can also incorporate aspects of Secondary (Agent Compare) Proposed Problem Solutions, in particular when the latter represent alternative Problem Statement interpretations - different Mathematical Models - or alternative Mathematical Solution Procedures. Comparisons to Grok Heavy, a commercial multi-agent model, show similarities in design and performance, but also important differences in emphasis: our Agency focuses on transparency and pedagogical value.

  Personalized recipe recommendation faces challenges in handling fuzzy user intent, ensuring semantic accuracy, and providing sufficient detail coverage. We propose ChefMind, a hybrid architecture combining Chain of Exploration (CoE), Knowledge Graph (KG), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and a Large Language Model (LLM). CoE refines ambiguous queries into structured conditions, KG offers semantic reasoning and interpretability, RAG supplements contextual culinary details, and LLM integrates outputs into coherent recommendations. We evaluate ChefMind on the Xiachufang dataset and manually annotated queries, comparing it with LLM-only, KG-only, and RAG-only baselines. Results show that ChefMind achieves superior performance in accuracy, relevance, completeness, and clarity, with an average score of 8.7 versus 6.4-6.7 for ablation models. Moreover, it reduces unprocessed queries to 1.6%, demonstrating robustness in handling fuzzy demands.

  We posit that persisting and transforming similarity relations form the structural basis of any comprehensible dynamic system. This paper introduces Similarity Field Theory, a mathematical framework that formalizes the principles governing similarity values among entities and their evolution. We define: (1) a similarity field $S: U \times U \to [0,1]$ over a universe of entities $U$, satisfying reflexivity $S(E,E)=1$ and treated as a directed relational field (asymmetry and non-transitivity are allowed); (2) the evolution of a system through a sequence $Z_p = (X_p, S^{(p)})$ indexed by $p=0,1,2,\ldots$; (3) concepts $K$ as entities that induce fibers $F_{\alpha}(K) = { E \in U \mid S(E,K) \ge \alpha }$, i.e., superlevel sets of the unary map $S_K(E) := S(E,K)$; and (4) a generative operator $G$ that produces new entities. Within this framework, we formalize a generative definition of intelligence: an operator $G$ is intelligent with respect to a concept $K$ if, given a system containing entities belonging to the fiber of $K$, it generates new entities that also belong to that fiber. Similarity Field Theory thus offers a foundational language for characterizing, comparing, and constructing intelligent systems. We prove two theorems: (i) asymmetry blocks mutual inclusion; and (ii) stability requires either an anchor coordinate or eventual confinement within a level set of $f$. These results ensure that the evolution of similarity fields is both constrained and interpretable, culminating in an exploration of how the framework allows us to interpret large language models and use them as experimental probes into societal cognition.

  Operations research (OR) provides fundamental methodologies for complex system decision-making, with established applications in transportation, supply chain management, and production scheduling. Traditional approaches, which depend on expert-based modeling and manual parameter adjustment, often face challenges in handling large-scale, dynamic, and multi-constraint problems. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown potential to address these limitations through semantic understanding, structured generation, and reasoning control. LLMs can translate natural language descriptions into mathematical models or executable code, generate heuristics, evolve algorithms, and directly tackle optimization tasks. This paper surveys recent progress on the integration of LLMs into OR, organizing methods into three main directions: automatic modeling, auxiliary optimization, and direct solving. It further reviews evaluation benchmarks and domain-specific applications, and summarizes key open issues such as unstable semantic-to-structure mapping, fragmented research progress, limited generalization, and insufficient evaluation systems. Finally, the survey outlines possible research avenues for advancing the role of LLMs in OR.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Test-time scaling (TTS) has been shown to improve the performance of large language models (LLMs) by sampling and aggregating diverse reasoning paths. However, existing research has overlooked a critical issue: selection bias of reasoning strategies during scaling. Specifically, when generating reasoning processes, LLMs tend to follow certain strategies (e.g., algebraic solutions for math problems) while neglecting other valid alternatives (e.g., geometric solutions), resulting in insufficient exploration of the solution space. To further understand the impact of this bias, we present a theoretical analysis that reveals when it undermines the effectiveness of test-time scaling. Motivated by this theoretical insight, we introduce TTS-Uniform, a framework designed to mitigate the selection bias of reasoning strategies. It (i) identifies potential strategies, (ii) uniformly allocates the sampling budget across them, and (iii) filters out unstable strategies prior to aggregation. Experimental results show that TTS-Uniform significantly enhances scaling effectiveness across multiple mainstream LLMs and benchmark datasets.

  The increasing availability of open Earth Observation (EO) and agricultural datasets holds great potential for supporting sustainable land management. However, their high technical entry barrier limits accessibility for non-expert users. This study presents an open-source conversational assistant that integrates multimodal retrieval and large language models (LLMs) to enable natural language interaction with heterogeneous agricultural and geospatial data. The proposed architecture combines orthophotos, Sentinel-2 vegetation indices, and user-provided documents through retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), allowing the system to flexibly determine whether to rely on multimodal evidence, textual knowledge, or both in formulating an answer. To assess response quality, we adopt an LLM-as-a-judge methodology using Qwen3-32B in a zero-shot, unsupervised setting, applying direct scoring in a multi-dimensional quantitative evaluation framework. Preliminary results show that the system is capable of generating clear, relevant, and context-aware responses to agricultural queries, while remaining reproducible and scalable across geographic regions. The primary contributions of this work include an architecture for fusing multimodal EO and textual knowledge sources, a demonstration of lowering the barrier to access specialized agricultural information through natural language interaction, and an open and reproducible design.

  Large Language Model (LLM)-based agentic systems have shown strong capabilities across various tasks. However, existing multi-agent frameworks often rely on static or task-level workflows, which either over-process simple queries or underperform on complex ones, while also neglecting the efficiency-performance trade-offs across heterogeneous LLMs. To address these limitations, we propose Difficulty-Aware Agentic Orchestration (DAAO), a dynamic framework that adapts workflow depth, operator selection, and LLM assignment based on the difficulty of each input query. DAAO comprises three interdependent modules: a variational autoencoder (VAE) for difficulty estimation, a modular operator allocator, and a cost- and performance-aware LLM router. By leveraging heterogeneous LLMs and dynamically tailoring workflows, DAAO enables fine-grained, query-specific reasoning strategies. DAAO outperforms prior multi-agent systems in both accuracy and inference efficiency across six benchmarks. We will release our code and implementation details upon publication.

  Table reasoning is crucial for leveraging structured data in domains such as finance, healthcare, and scientific research. While large language models (LLMs) show promise in multi-step reasoning, purely text-based methods often struggle with the complex numerical computations and fine-grained operations inherently required in this task. Tool-integrated reasoning improves computational accuracy via explicit code execution, yet existing systems frequently rely on rigid patterns, supervised imitation, and lack true autonomous adaptability. In this paper, we present TableMind, an LLM-driven table reasoning agent that (i) autonomously performs multi-turn tool invocation, (ii) writes and executes data-analyzing code in a secure sandbox environment for data analysis and precise numerical reasoning, and (iii) exhibits high-level capabilities such as planning and self-reflection to adapt strategies. To realize these capabilities, we adopt a two-stage fine-tuning paradigm built on top of a powerful pre-trained language model: supervised fine-tuning on high-quality reasoning trajectories to establish effective tool usage patterns, followed by reinforcement fine-tuning to optimize multi-objective strategies. In particular, we propose Rank-Aware Policy Optimization (RAPO), which increases the update weight of high-quality trajectories when their output probabilities are lower than those of low-quality ones, thereby guiding the model more consistently toward better and more accurate answers. Extensive experiments on several mainstream benchmarks demonstrate that TableMind achieves superior performance compared to competitive baselines, yielding substantial gains in both reasoning accuracy and computational precision.

  Multi-agent systems (MAS) have emerged as a powerful paradigm for orchestrating large language models (LLMs) and specialized tools to collaboratively address complex tasks. However, existing MAS frameworks often require manual workflow configuration and lack native support for dynamic evolution and performance optimization. In addition, many MAS optimization algorithms are not integrated into a unified framework. In this paper, we present EvoAgentX, an open-source platform that automates the generation, execution, and evolutionary optimization of multi-agent workflows. EvoAgentX employs a modular architecture consisting of five core layers: the basic components, agent, workflow, evolving, and evaluation layers. Specifically, within the evolving layer, EvoAgentX integrates three MAS optimization algorithms, TextGrad, AFlow, and MIPRO, to iteratively refine agent prompts, tool configurations, and workflow topologies. We evaluate EvoAgentX on HotPotQA, MBPP, and MATH for multi-hop reasoning, code generation, and mathematical problem solving, respectively, and further assess it on real-world tasks using GAIA. Experimental results show that EvoAgentX consistently achieves significant performance improvements, including a 7.44% increase in HotPotQA F1, a 10.00% improvement in MBPP pass@1, a 10.00% gain in MATH solve accuracy, and an overall accuracy improvement of up to 20.00% on GAIA.

  Foundation models update slowly due to resource-intensive training, whereas domain-specific models evolve rapidly between releases. Model merging seeks to combine multiple expert models into a single, more capable model, reducing storage and serving costs while supporting decentralized development. Despite its potential, previous studies have primarily focused on merging visual classification models or Large Language Models (LLMs) for code and math tasks. Recently, Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) that extend LLMs through large-scale multimodal training have gained traction. However, there lacks a benchmark for model merging research that clearly divides the tasks for MLLM training and evaluation. In this paper, $\textbf{(i)}$ we introduce a model merging benchmark for MLLMs, which includes multiple tasks such as VQA, Geometry, Chart, OCR, and Grounding, studying both LoRA and full fine-tuning models. Moreover, we explore how model merging can combine different modalities (e.g., vision-language, audio-language, and video-language models), moving toward the Omni-language model. $\textbf{(ii)}$ We implement 10 model merging algorithms on the benchmark. Furthermore, we propose a novel method that removes noise from task vectors and robustly optimizes the merged vector based on a loss defined over task vector interactions, achieving an average performance gain of 2.48%. $\textbf{(iii)}$ We find that model merging offers a promising way for building improved MLLMs without requiring training data. Our results also demonstrate that the complementarity among multiple modalities outperforms individual modalities.

- **[A Multi-Agent Framework with Automated Decision Rule Optimization for Cross-Domain Misinformation Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23329)**  `arXiv:2503.23329`  `cs.AI`

  Misinformation spans various domains, but detection methods trained on specific domains often perform poorly when applied to others. With the rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs), researchers have begun to utilize LLMs for cross-domain misinformation detection. However, existing LLM-based methods often fail to adequately analyze news in the target domain, limiting their detection capabilities. More importantly, these methods typically rely on manually designed decision rules, which are limited by domain knowledge and expert experience, thus limiting the generalizability of decision rules to different domains. To address these issues, we propose a MultiAgent Framework for cross-domain misinformation detection with Automated Decision Rule Optimization (MARO). Under this framework, we first employs multiple expert agents to analyze target-domain news. Subsequently, we introduce a question-reflection mechanism that guides expert agents to facilitate higherquality analysis. Furthermore, we propose a decision rule optimization approach based on carefully-designed cross-domain validation tasks to iteratively enhance the effectiveness of decision rules in different domains. Experimental results and in-depth analysis on commonlyused datasets demonstrate that MARO achieves significant improvements over existing methods.
