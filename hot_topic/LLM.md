- **[LightPlanner: Unleashing the Reasoning Capabilities of Lightweight Large Language Models in Task Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08508)**  `arXiv:2503.08508`  `cs.RO`  
  _Weijie Zhou, Manli Tao, Chaoyang Zhao, Honghui Dong, Ming Tang, Jinqiao Wang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In recent years, lightweight large language models (LLMs) have garnered significant attention in the robotics field due to their low computational resource requirements and suitability for edge deployment. However, in task planning -- particularly for complex tasks that involve dynamic semantic logic reasoning -- lightweight LLMs have underperformed. To address this limitation, we propose a novel task planner, LightPlanner, which enhances the performance of lightweight LLMs in complex task planning by fully leveraging their reasoning capabilities. Unlike conventional planners that use fixed skill templates, LightPlanner controls robot actions via parameterized function calls, dynamically generating parameter values. This approach allows for fine-grained skill control and improves task planning success rates in complex scenarios. Furthermore, we introduce hierarchical deep reasoning. Before generating each action decision step, LightPlanner thoroughly considers three levels: action execution (feedback verification), semantic parsing (goal consistency verification), and parameter generation (parameter validity verification). This ensures the correctness of subsequent action controls. Additionally, we incorporate a memory module to store historical actions, thereby reducing context length and enhancing planning efficiency for long-term tasks. We train the LightPlanner-1.5B model on our LightPlan-40k dataset, which comprises 40,000 action controls across tasks with 2 to 13 action steps. Experiments demonstrate that our model achieves the highest task success rate despite having the smallest number of parameters. In tasks involving spatial semantic reasoning, the success rate exceeds that of ReAct by 14.9 percent. Moreover, we demonstrate LightPlanner's potential to operate on edge devices.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  With the rapid development of (multimodal) large language model-based agents, the landscape of agentic service management has evolved from single-agent systems to multi-agent systems, and now to massive-agent ecosystems. Current massive-agent ecosystems face growing challenges, including impersonal service experiences, a lack of standardization, and untrustworthy behavior. To address these issues, we propose ColorEcosystem, a novel blueprint designed to enable personalized, standardized, and trustworthy agentic service at scale. Concretely, ColorEcosystem consists of three key components: agent carrier, agent store, and agent audit. The agent carrier provides personalized service experiences by utilizing user-specific data and creating a digital twin, while the agent store serves as a centralized, standardized platform for managing diverse agentic services. The agent audit, based on the supervision of developer and user activities, ensures the integrity and credibility of both service providers and users. Through the analysis of challenges, transitional forms, and practical considerations, the ColorEcosystem is poised to power personalized, standardized, and trustworthy agentic service across massive-agent ecosystems. Meanwhile, we have also implemented part of ColorEcosystem's functionality, and the relevant code is open-sourced atthis https URL.

- **[ColorAgent: Building A Robust, Personalized, and Interactive OS Agent](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19386)**  `arXiv:2510.19386`  `cs.MA` `cs.AI` `cs.CL`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  With the advancements in hardware, software, and large language model technologies, the interaction between humans and operating systems has evolved from the command-line interface to the rapidly emerging AI agent interactions. Building an operating system (OS) agent capable of executing user instructions and faithfully following user desires is becoming a reality. In this technical report, we present ColorAgent, an OS agent designed to engage in long-horizon, robust interactions with the environment while also enabling personalized and proactive user interaction. To enable long-horizon interactions with the environment, we enhance the model's capabilities through step-wise reinforcement learning and self-evolving training, while also developing a tailored multi-agent framework that ensures generality, consistency, and robustness. In terms of user interaction, we explore personalized user intent recognition and proactive engagement, positioning the OS agent not merely as an automation tool but as a warm, collaborative partner. We evaluate ColorAgent on the AndroidWorld and AndroidLab benchmarks, achieving success rates of 77.2% and 50.7%, respectively, establishing a new state of the art. Nonetheless, we note that current benchmarks are insufficient for a comprehensive evaluation of OS agents and propose further exploring directions in future work, particularly in the areas of evaluation paradigms, agent collaboration, and security.

- **[Leverage Unlearning to Sanitize LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21322)**  `arXiv:2510.21322`  `cs.LG` `cs.CL`  
  _Antoine Boutet, Lucas Magnana_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Pre-trained large language models (LLMs) are becoming useful for various tasks. To improve their performance on certain tasks, it is necessary to fine-tune them on specific data corpora (e.g., medical reports, business data). These specialized data corpora may contain sensitive data (e.g., personal or confidential data) that will be memorized by the model and likely to be regurgitated during its subsequent use. This memorization of sensitive information by the model poses a significant privacy or confidentiality issue. To remove this memorization and sanitize the model without requiring costly additional fine-tuning on a secured data corpus, we propose SANI. SANI is an unlearning approach to sanitize language models. It relies on both an erasure and repair phases that 1) reset certain neurons in the last layers of the model to disrupt the memorization of fine-grained information, and then 2) fine-tune the model while avoiding memorizing sensitive information. We comprehensively evaluate SANI to sanitize both a model fine-tuned and specialized with medical data by removing directly and indirectly identifiers from the memorization of the model, and a standard pre-trained model by removing specific terms defined as confidential information from the model. Results show that with only few additional epochs of unlearning, the model is sanitized and the number of regurgitations is drastically reduced. This approach can be particularly useful for hospitals or other industries that have already spent significant resources training models on large datasets and wish to sanitize them before sharing.

  Reinforcement learning for LLM reasoning has rapidly emerged as a prominent research area, marked by a significant surge in related studies on both algorithmic innovations and practical applications. Despite this progress, several critical challenges remain, including the absence of standardized guidelines for employing RL techniques and a fragmented understanding of their underlying mechanisms. Additionally, inconsistent experimental settings, variations in training data, and differences in model initialization have led to conflicting conclusions, obscuring the key characteristics of these techniques and creating confusion among practitioners when selecting appropriate techniques. This paper systematically reviews widely adopted RL techniques through rigorous reproductions and isolated evaluations within a unified open-source framework. We analyze the internal mechanisms, applicable scenarios, and core principles of each technique through fine-grained experiments, including datasets of varying difficulty, model sizes, and architectures. Based on these insights, we present clear guidelines for selecting RL techniques tailored to specific setups, and provide a reliable roadmap for practitioners navigating the RL for the LLM domain. Finally, we reveal that a minimalist combination of two techniques can unlock the learning capability of critic-free policies using vanilla PPO loss. The results demonstrate that our simple combination consistently improves performance, surpassing strategies like GRPO and DAPO.

- **[Online Intrinsic Rewards for Decision Making Agents from Large Language Model Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23022)**  `arXiv:2410.23022`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI` `cs.CL` `cs.RO`

  Automatically synthesizing dense rewards from natural language descriptions is a promising paradigm in reinforcement learning (RL), with applications to sparse reward problems, open-ended exploration, and hierarchical skill design. Recent works have made promising steps by exploiting the prior knowledge of large language models (LLMs). However, these approaches suffer from important limitations: they are either not scalable to problems requiring billions of environment samples, due to requiring LLM annotations for each observation, or they require a diverse offline dataset, which may not exist or be impossible to collect. In this work, we address these limitations through a combination of algorithmic and systems-level contributions. We propose ONI, a distributed architecture that simultaneously learns an RL policy and an intrinsic reward function using LLM feedback. Our approach annotates the agent's collected experience via an asynchronous LLM server, which is then distilled into an intrinsic reward model. We explore a range of algorithmic choices for reward modeling with varying complexity, including hashing, classification, and ranking models. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance across a range of challenging tasks from the NetHack Learning Environment, while removing the need for large offline datasets required by prior work. We make our code available atthis https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Hallucination remains a critical challenge for deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) in finance. Accurate extraction and precise calculation from tabular data are essential for reliable financial analysis, since even minor numerical errors can undermine decision-making and regulatory compliance. Financial applications have unique requirements, often relying on context-dependent, numerical, and proprietary tabular data that existing hallucination benchmarks rarely capture. In this study, we develop a rigorous and scalable framework for evaluating intrinsic hallucinations in financial LLMs, conceptualized as a context-aware masked span prediction task over real-world financial documents. Our main contributions are: (1) a novel, automated dataset creation paradigm using a masking strategy; (2) a new hallucination evaluation dataset derived from S&P 500 annual reports; and (3) a comprehensive evaluation of intrinsic hallucination patterns in state-of-the-art LLMs on financial tabular data. Our work provides a robust methodology for in-house LLM evaluation and serves as a critical step toward building more trustworthy and reliable financial Generative AI systems.

- **[ReDit: Reward Dithering for Improved LLM Policy Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18631)**  `arXiv:2506.18631`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI` `cs.CL`

  DeepSeek-R1 has successfully enhanced Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning capabilities through its rule-based reward system. While it's a ''perfect'' reward system that effectively mitigates reward hacking, such reward functions are often discrete. Our experimental observations suggest that discrete rewards can lead to gradient anomaly, unstable optimization, and slow convergence. To address this issue, we propose ReDit (Reward Dithering), a method that dithers the discrete reward signal by adding simple random noise. With this perturbed reward, exploratory gradients are continuously provided throughout the learning process, enabling smoother gradient updates and accelerating convergence. The injected noise also introduces stochasticity into flat reward regions, encouraging the model to explore novel policies and escape local optima. Experiments across diverse tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of ReDit. On average, ReDit achieves performance comparable to vanilla GRPO with only approximately 10% the training steps, and furthermore, still exhibits a 4% performance improvement over vanilla GRPO when trained for a similar duration. Visualizations confirm significant mitigation of gradient issues with ReDit. Moreover, theoretical analyses are provided to further validate these advantages.

- **[Improving Data Efficiency for LLM Reinforcement Fine-tuning Through Difficulty-targeted Online Data Selection and Rollout Replay](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05316)**  `arXiv:2506.05316`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI` `cs.CL`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reinforcement learning (RL) has become an effective approach for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs), particularly to enhance their reasoning capabilities. However, RL fine-tuning remains highly resource-intensive, and existing work has largely overlooked the problem of data efficiency. In this paper, we propose two techniques to improve data efficiency in LLM RL fine-tuning: difficulty-targeted online data selection and rollout replay. We introduce the notion of adaptive difficulty to guide online data selection, prioritizing questions of moderate difficulty that are more likely to yield informative learning signals. To estimate adaptive difficulty efficiently, we develop an attention-based framework that requires rollouts for only a small reference set of questions. The adaptive difficulty of the remaining questions is then estimated based on their similarity to this set. To further reduce rollout cost, we introduce a rollout replay mechanism inspired by experience replay in traditional RL. This technique reuses recent rollouts, lowering per-step computation while maintaining stable updates. Experiments across 6 LLM-dataset combinations show that our method reduces RL fine-tuning time by 23% to 62% while reaching the same level of performance as the original GRPO algorithm.

- **[ProxySPEX: Inference-Efficient Interpretability via Sparse Feature Interactions in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17495)**  `arXiv:2505.17495`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI` `cs.CL`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance by capturing complex interactions between input features. To identify these interactions, most existing approaches require enumerating all possible combinations of features up to a given order, causing them to scale poorly with the number of inputs $n$. Recently, Kang et al. (2025) proposed SPEX, an information-theoretic approach that uses interaction sparsity to scale to $n \approx 10^3$ features. SPEX greatly improves upon prior methods but requires tens of thousands of model inferences, which can be prohibitive for large models. In this paper, we observe that LLM feature interactions are often hierarchical -- higher-order interactions are accompanied by their lower-order subsets -- which enables more efficient discovery. To exploit this hierarchy, we propose ProxySPEX, an interaction attribution algorithm that first fits gradient boosted trees to masked LLM outputs and then extracts the important interactions. Experiments across four challenging high-dimensional datasets show that ProxySPEX more faithfully reconstructs LLM outputs by 20% over marginal attribution approaches while using $10\times$ fewer inferences than SPEX. By accounting for interactions, ProxySPEX efficiently identifies the most influential features, providing a scalable approximation of their Shapley values. Further, we apply ProxySPEX to two interpretability tasks. Data attribution, where we identify interactions among CIFAR-10 training samples that influence test predictions, and mechanistic interpretability, where we uncover interactions between attention heads, both within and across layers, on a question-answering task.

  We show that reinforcement learning with verifiable reward using one training example (1-shot RLVR) is effective in incentivizing the math reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Applying RLVR to the base model Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B, we identify a single example that elevates model performance on MATH500 from 36.0% to 73.6% (8.6% improvement beyond format correction), and improves the average performance across six common mathematical reasoning benchmarks from 17.6% to 35.7% (7.0% non-format gain). This result matches the performance obtained using the 1.2k DeepScaleR subset (MATH500: 73.6%, average: 35.9%), which contains the aforementioned example. Furthermore, RLVR with only two examples even slightly exceeds these results (MATH500: 74.8%, average: 36.6%). Similar substantial improvements are observed across various models (Qwen2.5-Math-7B, Llama3.2-3B-Instruct, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B), RL algorithms (GRPO and PPO), and different math examples. In addition, we identify some interesting phenomena during 1-shot RLVR, including cross-category generalization, increased frequency of self-reflection, and sustained test performance improvement even after the training accuracy has saturated, a phenomenon we term post-saturation generalization. Moreover, we verify that the effectiveness of 1-shot RLVR primarily arises from the policy gradient loss, distinguishing it from the "grokking" phenomenon. We also show the critical role of promoting exploration (e.g., by incorporating entropy loss with an appropriate coefficient) in 1-shot RLVR training. We also further discuss related observations about format correction, label robustness and prompt modification. These findings can inspire future work on RLVR efficiency and encourage a re-examination of recent progress and the underlying mechanisms in RLVR. All resources are open source atthis https URL.

- **[GoRA: Gradient-driven Adaptive Low Rank Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12171)**  `arXiv:2502.12171`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI` `cs.CL`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is a crucial method for efficiently fine-tuning large language models (LLMs), with its effectiveness influenced by two key factors: rank selection and weight initialization. While numerous LoRA variants have been proposed to improve performance by addressing one of these aspects, they often compromise usability or computational efficiency. In this paper, we analyze and identify the core limitations of existing approaches and propose a novel framework--GoRA (Gradient-driven Adaptive Low Rank Adaptation)--that simultaneously adapts both the rank and initialization strategy within a unified framework. GoRA leverages gradient information during training to dynamically assign optimal ranks and initialize low-rank adapter weights in an adaptive manner. To our knowledge, GoRA is the first method that not only addresses the limitations of prior approaches--which often focus on either rank selection or initialization in isolation--but also unifies both aspects within a single framework, enabling more effective and efficient adaptation. Extensive experiments across various architectures and modalities show that GoRA consistently outperforms existing LoRA-based methods while preserving the efficiency of vanilla LoRA. For example, when fine-tuning Llama3.1-8B-Base for mathematical reasoning, GoRA achieves a 5.13-point improvement over standard LoRA and even outperforms full fine-tuning by 2.05 points under high-rank settings.

  For text-based AI systems to interact in the real world, causal reasoning is an essential skill. Since active interventions are costly, we study to what extent a system can learn causal reasoning from symbolic demonstrations of causal axioms. Specifically, we present an axiomatic training method where the system learns from multiple demonstrations of a causal axiom (or rule), rather than incorporating the axiom as an inductive bias or inferring it from data values. A key question is whether the system would learn to generalize from the axiom demonstrations to more complex scenarios. Our results, based on applying axiomatic training to learn the transitivity axiom and d-separation rule, indicate that such generalization is possible. To avoid data contamination issues, we start with a 67 million parameter transformer model and train it from scratch. On both tasks, we find that a model trained on linear causal chains (along with some noisy variations) can generalize well to complex graphs, including longer causal chains, causal chains with reversed order, and graphs withthis http URLhandle diverse text inputs, the same method is extended to finetune language models. Finetuning Llama-3-8B-Instruct model on our axiomatic data leads to significant gains on causal benchmarks such as Corr2Cause and CLEAR, in some cases providing state-of-the-art performance surpassing GPT-4.

- **[Large Language Models as Model Organisms for Human Associative Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21408)**  `arXiv:2510.21408`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Camila Kolling, Vy Ai Vo, Mariya Toneva_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Associative learning--forming links between co-occurring items--is fundamental to human cognition, reshaping internal representations in complex ways. Testing hypotheses on how representational changes occur in biological systems is challenging, but large language models (LLMs) offer a scalable alternative. Building on LLMs' in-context learning, we adapt a cognitive neuroscience associative learning paradigm and investigate how representations evolve across six models. Our initial findings reveal a non-monotonic pattern consistent with the Non-Monotonic Plasticity Hypothesis, with moderately similar items differentiating after learning. Leveraging the controllability of LLMs, we further show that this differentiation is modulated by the overlap of associated items with the broader vocabulary--a factor we term vocabulary interference, capturing how new associations compete with prior knowledge. We find that higher vocabulary interference amplifies differentiation, suggesting that representational change is influenced by both item similarity and global competition. Our findings position LLMs not only as powerful tools for studying representational dynamics in human-like learning systems, but also as accessible and general computational models for generating new hypotheses about the principles underlying memory reorganization in the brain.

- **[On the Sample Complexity of Differentially Private Policy Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21060)**  `arXiv:2510.21060`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Yi He, Xingyu Zhou_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Policy optimization (PO) is a cornerstone of modern reinforcement learning (RL), with diverse applications spanning robotics, healthcare, and large language model training. The increasing deployment of PO in sensitive domains, however, raises significant privacy concerns. In this paper, we initiate a theoretical study of differentially private policy optimization, focusing explicitly on its sample complexity. We first formalize an appropriate definition of differential privacy (DP) tailored to PO, addressing the inherent challenges arising from on-policy learning dynamics and the subtlety involved in defining the unit of privacy. We then systematically analyze the sample complexity of widely-used PO algorithms, including policy gradient (PG), natural policy gradient (NPG) and more, under DP constraints and various settings, via a unified framework. Our theoretical results demonstrate that privacy costs can often manifest as lower-order terms in the sample complexity, while also highlighting subtle yet important observations in private PO settings. These offer valuable practical insights for privacy-preserving PO algorithms.

  _Xi Zhang, Xiaolin Wu, Jiamang Wang, Weisi Lin_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities but typically require extensive computational resources and memory for inference. Post-training quantization (PTQ) can effectively reduce these demands by storing weights in lower bit-width formats. However, standard uniform quantization often leads to notable performance degradation, particularly in low-bit scenarios. In this work, we introduce a Grouped Lattice Vector Quantization (GLVQ) framework that assigns each group of weights a customized lattice codebook, defined by a learnable generation matrix. To address the non-differentiability of the quantization process, we adopt Babai rounding to approximate nearest-lattice-point search during training, which enables stable optimization of the generation matrices. Once trained, decoding reduces to a simple matrix-vector multiplication, yielding an efficient and practical quantization pipeline. Experiments on multiple benchmarks show that our approach achieves a better trade-off between model size and accuracy compared to existing post-training quantization baselines, highlighting its effectiveness in deploying large models under stringent resource constraints.

  Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) improves model output accuracy by leveraging external knowledge bases, serving as an effective solution to address hallucination issues and knowledge-update delays in Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the introduction of external knowledge bases presents RAG with challenges in long-context processing, significantly increasing memory consumption and inference latency. Existing research accelerates inference by precomputing Key and Value (KV) of the knowledge base and loading them on-demand during inference. Based on the access frequency of different KV chunks within the external knowledge base, this paper proposes a hotness-aware RAG (HA-RAG) inference optimization system. First, leveraging the numerical distribution of KV chunks, we introduce a hotness-aware mixed-precision compressing and loading method to reduce disk I/O and memory access overhead. Second, we design a hotness-aware data placement strategy that prioritizes storing frequently accessed KV chunks in high-speed memory to improve data access efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared with TurboRAG, the proposed HA-RAG achieves an average speedup of 2.10x and maximum speedup of 10.49x in Time-To-First-Token (TTFT) with negligible accuracy loss.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The role of reasoning in Audio Large Language Models remains widely underexplored, as introducing a reasoning process often degrades rather than improves performance during inference, a phenomenon we term test-time inverse scaling, where longer reasoning chains yield progressively worse results. We demonstrate that this stems not from fundamental limitations of reasoning itself, but from inadequate training: models without proper guidance for the reasoning process produce hallucinatory, inconsistent reasoning that accumulates errors over longer chains. To address these challenges, we introduce CESAR (Consistent, Effective, and Scalable Audio Reasoners), shifting from outcome verification to rewarding the reasoning process. Our online reinforcement learning framework employs Group Relative Policy Optimization with a multi-faceted reward suite that incentivizes not only correctness and format but also consistency, structured analytical patterns, causal reasoning, domain-knowledge integration, and calibrated reasoning depth. CESAR resolves test-time inverse scaling, transforming reasoning from detriments into gains while revealing model-specific ``reasoning sweet spots", where performance peaks during test-time scaling. We achieve state-of-the-art results on MMAU Test-mini, substantially outperforming Gemini 2.5 Pro and GPT-4o Audio, and near-human-level performance on MMSU reasoning tasks. Through AI-as-judge evaluations and qualitative comparisons, we provide both quantitative and qualitative validation of our improved reasoning quality. Importantly, enhanced reasoning creates synergistic effects, simultaneously improving multimodal reasoning and perception capabilities. Overall, CESAR establishes a principled method for developing robust and scalable reasoning in Audio LLMs.

  To fix the 'bias in, bias out' problem in fair machine learning, it is important to steer feature distributions of data or internal representations of Large Language Models (LLMs) to ideal ones that guarantee group-fair outcomes. Previous work on fair generative models and representation steering could greatly benefit from provable fairness guarantees on the model output. We define a distribution as ideal if the minimizer of any cost-sensitive risk on it is guaranteed to have exact group-fair outcomes (e.g., demographic parity, equal opportunity)-in other words, it has no fairness-utility trade-off. We formulate an optimization program for optimal steering by finding the nearest ideal distribution in KL-divergence, and provide efficient algorithms for it when the underlying distributions come from well-known parametric families (e.g., normal, log-normal). Empirically, our optimal steering techniques on both synthetic and real-world datasets improve fairness without diminishing utility (and sometimes even improve utility). We demonstrate affine steering of LLM representations to reduce bias in multi-class classification, e.g., occupation prediction from a short biography in Bios dataset (De-Arteaga et al.). Furthermore, we steer internal representations of LLMs towards desired outputs so that it works equally well across different groups.

- **[Methodological Insights into Structural Causal Modelling and Uncertainty-Aware Forecasting for Economic Indicators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07036)**  `arXiv:2509.07036`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Federico Cerutti_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper presents a methodological approach to financial time series analysis by combining causal discovery and uncertainty-aware forecasting. As a case study, we focus on four key U.S. macroeconomic indicators -- GDP, economic growth, inflation, and unemployment -- and we apply the LPCMCI framework with Gaussian Process Distance Correlation (GPDC) to uncover dynamic causal relationships in quarterly data from 1970 to 2021. Our results reveal a robust unidirectional causal link from economic growth to GDP and highlight the limited connectivity of inflation, suggesting the influence of latent factors. Unemployment exhibits strong autoregressive dependence, motivating its use as a case study for probabilistic forecasting. Leveraging the Chronos framework, a large language model trained for time series, we perform zero-shot predictions on unemployment. This approach delivers accurate forecasts one and two quarters ahead, without requiring task-specific training. Crucially, the model's uncertainty-aware predictions yield 90\% confidence intervals, enabling effective anomaly detection through statistically principled deviation analysis. This study demonstrates the value of combining causal structure learning with probabilistic language models to inform economic policy and enhance forecasting robustness.

  How can we effectively handle queries for on-device large language models (LLMs) with varying runtime constraints, such as latency and accuracy? Multi-scale quantization addresses this challenge by enabling memory-efficient runtime model adaptation of LLMs through the overlaying of multiple model variants quantized to different bitwidths. Meanwhile, an important question still remains open-ended: how can models be properly configured to match a target precision or latency? While mixed-precision offers a promising solution, we take this further by leveraging the key observation that the sensitivity of each layer dynamically changes across decoding steps. Building on this insight, we introduce DP-LLM, a novel mechanism that dynamically assigns precision to each layer based on input values. Experimental results across multiple models and benchmarks demonstrate that DP-LLM achieves a superior performance-latency trade-off, outperforming prior approaches.

  Current LLM unlearning methods are not robust. A few steps of finetuning can revert their effects. We begin by showing that this is true even for an idealized form of unlearning: training to imitate a model that was never trained on unwanted information. This shows that training a model can drastically modify its input-output behavior while leaving its underlying capabilities intact. In light of this dynamic, we show our main result. Training a randomly initialized student on the outputs of an unlearned model transfers behaviors while leaving latent capabilities behind. In short, distillation robustifies unlearning. Based on this result, we propose Unlearn-Noise-Distill-on-Outputs (UNDO), a scalable method that distills an unlearned model into a noised copy of itself. UNDO introduces a tunable tradeoff between compute cost and robustness, establishing a new Pareto frontier on synthetic language and arithmetic tasks. At its strongest setting, UNDO matches the robustness of a model retrained from scratch with perfect data filtering while using only 60-80% of the compute and requiring only 0.01% of the pretraining data to be labeled. We also show that UNDO robustifies unlearning on the more realistic Weapons of Mass Destruction Proxy (WMDP) benchmark. Since distillation is widely used in practice, incorporating an unlearning step beforehand offers a convenient path to robust capability removal.

  A major challenge in aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences is the issue of distribution shift. LLM alignment algorithms rely on static preference datasets, assuming that they accurately represent real-world user preferences. However, user preferences vary significantly across geographical regions, demographics, linguistic patterns, and evolving cultural trends. This preference distribution shift leads to catastrophic alignment failures in many real-world applications. We address this problem using the principled framework of distributionally robust optimization, and develop two novel distributionally robust direct preference optimization (DPO) algorithms, namely, Wasserstein DPO (WDPO) and Kullback-Leibler DPO (KLDPO). We characterize the sample complexity of learning the optimal policy parameters for WDPO and KLDPO. Moreover, we propose scalable gradient descent-style learning algorithms by developing suitable approximations for the challenging minimax loss functions of WDPO and KLDPO. Our empirical experiments using benchmark data sets and LLMs demonstrate the superior performance of WDPO and KLDPO in substantially improving the alignment when there is a preference distribution shift.

  Electrocardiogram (ECG) interpretation is essential for cardiovascular disease diagnosis, but current automated systems often struggle with transparency and generalization to unseen conditions. To address this, we introduce ZETA, a zero-shot multimodal framework designed for interpretable ECG diagnosis aligned with clinical workflows. ZETA uniquely compares ECG signals against structured positive and negative clinical observations, which are curated through an LLM-assisted, expert-validated process, thereby mimicking differential diagnosis. Our approach leverages a pre-trained multimodal model to align ECG and text embeddings without disease-specific fine-tuning. Empirical evaluations demonstrate ZETA's competitive zero-shot classification performance and, importantly, provide qualitative and quantitative evidence of enhanced interpretability, grounding predictions in specific, clinically relevant positive and negative diagnostic features. ZETA underscores the potential of aligning ECG analysis with structured clinical knowledge for building more transparent, generalizable, and trustworthy AI diagnostic systems. We will release the curated observation dataset and code to facilitate future research.

  Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) laid the foundation for sequence modeling, but their intrinsic sequential nature restricts parallel computation, creating a fundamental barrier to scaling. This has led to the dominance of parallelizable architectures like Transformers and, more recently, State Space Models (SSMs). While SSMs achieve efficient parallelization through structured linear recurrences, this linearity constraint limits their expressive power and precludes modeling complex, nonlinear sequence-wise dependencies. To address this, we present ParaRNN, a framework that breaks the sequence-parallelization barrier for nonlinear RNNs. Building on prior work, we cast the sequence of nonlinear recurrence relationships as a single system of equations, which we solve in parallel using Newton's iterations combined with custom parallel reductions. Our implementation achieves speedups of up to 665x over naive sequential application, allowing training nonlinear RNNs at unprecedented scales. To showcase this, we apply ParaRNN to adaptations of LSTM and GRU architectures, successfully training models of 7B parameters that attain perplexity comparable to similarly-sized Transformers and Mamba2 architectures. To accelerate research in efficient sequence modeling, we release the ParaRNN codebase as an open-source framework for automatic training-parallelization of nonlinear RNNs, enabling researchers and practitioners to explore new nonlinear RNN models at scale.

  How does the progressive embracement of Large Language Models (LLMs) affect scientific peer reviewing? This multifaceted question is fundamental to the effectiveness -- as well as to the integrity -- of the scientific process. Recent evidence suggests that LLMs may have already been tacitly used in peer reviewing, e.g., at the 2024 International Conference of Learning Representations (ICLR). Furthermore, some efforts have been undertaken in an attempt to explicitly integrate LLMs in peer reviewing by various editorial boards (including that of ICLR'25). To fully understand the utility and the implications of LLMs' deployment for scientific reviewing, a comprehensive relevant dataset is strongly desirable. Despite some previous research on this topic, such dataset has been lacking so far. We fill in this gap by presenting GenReview, the hitherto largest dataset containing LLM-written reviews. Our dataset includes 81K reviews generated for all submissions to the 2018--2025 editions of the ICLR by providing the LLM with three independent prompts: a negative, a positive, and a neutral one. GenReview is also linked to the respective papers and their original reviews, thereby enabling a broad range of investigations. To illustrate the value of GenReview, we explore a sample of intriguing research questions, namely: if LLMs exhibit bias in reviewing (they do); if LLM-written reviews can be automatically detected (so far, they can); if LLMs can rigorously follow reviewing instructions (not always) and whether LLM-provided ratings align with decisions on paper acceptance or rejection (holds true only for accepted papers). GenReview can be accessed at the following link:this https URL.

  Reasoning models represent a significant advance in LLM capabilities, particularly for complex reasoning tasks such as mathematics and coding. Previous studies confirm that parallel test-time compute-sampling multiple solutions and selecting the best one-can further enhance the predictive performance of LLMs. However, strategies in this area often require complex scoring, thus increasing computational cost and complexity. In this work, we demonstrate that the simple and counterintuitive heuristic of selecting the shortest solution is highly effective. We posit that the observed effectiveness stems from models operating in two distinct regimes: a concise, confident conventional regime and a verbose overthinking regime characterized by uncertainty, and we show evidence of a critical point where the overthinking regime begins to be significant. By selecting the shortest answer, the heuristic preferentially samples from the conventional regime. We confirm that this approach is competitive with more complex methods such as self-consistency across two challenging benchmarks while significantly reducing computational overhead. The shortest-answer heuristic provides a Pareto improvement over self-consistency and applies even to tasks where output equality is not well defined.

  Large language models have demonstrated remarkable reasoning capabilities across diverse natural language tasks. However, comparable breakthroughs in scientific discovery are more limited, because understanding complex physical phenomena demands multifaceted representations far beyond language alone. A compelling example is the design of functional materials such as MOFs-critical for a range of impactful applications like carbon capture and hydrogen storage. Navigating their vast and intricate design space in language-based representations interpretable by LLMs is challenging due to the numerous possible three-dimensional atomic arrangements and strict reticular rules of coordination geometry and topology. Despite promising early results in LLM-assisted discovery for simpler materials systems, MOF design remains heavily reliant on tacit human expertise rarely codified in textual information alone. To overcome this barrier, we introduce L2M3OF, the first multimodal LLM for MOFs. L2M3OF integrates crystal representation learning with language understanding to process structural, textual, and knowledge modalities jointly. L2M3OF employs a pre-trained crystal encoder with a lightweight projection layer to compress structural information into a token space, enabling efficient alignment with language instructions. To facilitate training and evaluation, we curate a structure-property-knowledge database of crystalline materials and benchmark L2M3OF against state-of-the-art closed-source LLMs such as GPT-5, Gemini-2.5-Pro and DeepSeek-R1. Experiments show that L2M3OF outperforms leading text-based closed-source LLMs in property prediction and knowledge generation tasks, despite using far fewer parameters. These results highlight the importance of multimodal approaches for porous material understanding and establish L2M3OF as a foundation for next-generation AI systems in materials discovery.

  Accurate detection of errors in large language models (LLM) responses is central to the success of scalable oversight, or providing effective supervision to superhuman intelligence. Yet, self-diagnosis is often unreliable on complex tasks unless aided by reliable external feedback. Multi-agent debate (MAD) seems to be a natural alternative to external feedback: multiple LLMs provide complementary perspectives and cross-checks for error detection. However, prior MAD protocols frame debate as a zero-sum game, where the debaters compete to win the game instead of seeking the truth. Consequently, it leads to debate hacking: debaters tend to mislead the judge by misinterpreting the task or presenting overconfident claims, which introduce more mistakes and underperform single-agent methods. To mitigate the issue, we introduce a new collaborative MAD protocol, termed ColMAD, that reframes MAD as a non-zero sum game. Specifically, ColMAD encourages multiple agents to criticize each other in a supportive way, such that they can complement the missing points of each other. Therefore, the judge agent can make a more informative conclusion based on more comprehensive evidence. Empirically, we show that ColMAD significantly outperforms previous competitive MAD by 19% and brings non-trivial improvements over single-agent methods in error detection.

  Forecasting in the real world requires integrating structured time-series data with unstructured textual information, but existing methods are architecturally limited by fixed input/output horizons and are unable to model or quantify uncertainty. We address this challenge by introducing LLM-integrated Bayesian State space models (LBS), a novel probabilistic framework for multimodal temporal forecasting. At a high level, LBS consists of two components: (1) a state space model (SSM) backbone that captures the temporal dynamics of latent states from which both numerical and textual observations are generated and (2) a pretrained large language model (LLM) that is adapted to encode textual inputs for posterior state estimation and decode textual forecasts consistent with the latent trajectory. This design enables flexible lookback and forecast windows, principled uncertainty quantification, and improved temporal generalization thanks to the well-suited inductive bias of SSMs toward modeling dynamical systems. Experiments on the TextTimeCorpus benchmark demonstrate that LBS improves the previous state-of-the-art by 13.20% while providing human-readable summaries of each forecast. Our work is the first to unify LLMs and SSMs for joint numerical and textual prediction, offering a novel foundation for multimodal temporal reasoning.

  As large language models (LLMs) advance, the ultimate vision for their role in science is emerging: we could build an AI collaborator to effectively assist human beings throughout the entire scientific research process. We refer to this envisioned system as ResearchGPT. Given that scientific research progresses through multiple interdependent phases, achieving this vision requires rigorous benchmarks that evaluate the end-to-end workflow rather than isolated sub-tasks. To this end, we contribute CS-54k, a high-quality corpus of scientific Q&A pairs in computer science, built from 14k CC-licensed papers. It is constructed through a scalable, paper-grounded pipeline that combines retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with multi-stage quality control to ensure factual grounding. From this unified corpus, we derive two complementary subsets: CS-4k, a carefully curated benchmark for evaluating AI's ability to assist scientific research, and CS-50k, a large-scale training dataset. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CS-4k stratifies state-of-the-art LLMs into distinct capability tiers. Open models trained on CS-50k with supervised training and reinforcement learning demonstrate substantial improvements. Even 7B-scale models, when properly trained, outperform many larger proprietary systems, such as GPT-4.1, GPT-4o, and Gemini 2.5 Pro. This indicates that making AI models better research assistants relies more on domain-aligned training with high-quality data than on pretraining scale or general benchmark performance. We release CS-4k and CS-50k in the hope of fostering AI systems as reliable collaborators in CS research.

  Unlocking deep and interpretable biological reasoning from complex genomic data remains a major AI challenge limiting scientific progress. While current DNA foundation models excel at representing sequences, they struggle with multi-step reasoning and lack transparent, biologically meaningful explanations. BioReason addresses this by tightly integrating a DNA foundation model with a large language model (LLM), enabling the LLM to directly interpret and reason over genomic information. Through supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, BioReason learns to produce logical, biologically coherent deductions. It achieves major performance gains, boosting KEGG-based disease pathway prediction accuracy from 86% to 98% and improving variant effect prediction by an average of 15% over strong baselines. BioReason can reason over unseen biological entities and explain its decisions step by step, offering a transformative framework for interpretable, mechanistic AI in biology.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Finetuning large language models (LLMs) enables user-specific customization but introduces critical safety risks: even a few harmful examples can compromise safety alignment. A common mitigation strategy is to update the model more strongly on examples deemed safe, while downweighting or excluding those flagged as unsafe. However, because safety context can shift within a single example, updating the model equally on both harmful and harmless parts of a response is suboptimal-a coarse treatment we term static safety shaping. In contrast, we propose dynamic safety shaping (DSS), a framework that uses fine-grained safety signals to reinforce learning from safe segments of a response while suppressing unsafe content. To enable such fine-grained control during finetuning, we introduce a key insight: guardrail models, traditionally used for filtering, can be repurposed to evaluate partial responses, tracking how safety risk evolves throughout the response, segment by segment. This leads to the Safety Trajectory Assessment of Response (STAR), a token-level signal that enables shaping to operate dynamically over the training sequence. Building on this, we present STAR-DSS, guided by STAR scores, that robustly mitigates finetuning risks and delivers substantial safety improvements across diverse threats, datasets, and model families-all without compromising capability on intended tasks. We encourage future safety research to build on dynamic shaping principles for stronger mitigation against evolving finetuning risks. Our code is publicly available atthis https URL.

  Many domain experts do not have the time or expertise to write formal Bayesian models. This paper takes an informal problem description as input, and combines a large language model and a probabilistic programming language to define a joint distribution over formal models, latent variables, and data. A posterior over latent variables follows by conditioning on observed data and integrating over formal models. This presents a challenging inference problem. We suggest an inference recipe that amounts to generating many formal models from the large language model, performing approximate inference on each, and then doing a weighted average. This is justified and analyzed as a combination of self-normalized importance sampling, MCMC, and importance-weighted variational inference. Experimentally, this produces sensible predictions from only data and an informal problem description, without the need to specify a formal model.

  We propose an inference-time scaling approach for pretrained flow models. Recently, inference-time scaling has gained significant attention in LLMs and diffusion models, improving sample quality or better aligning outputs with user preferences by leveraging additional computation. For diffusion models, particle sampling has allowed more efficient scaling due to the stochasticity at intermediate denoising steps. On the contrary, while flow models have gained popularity as an alternative to diffusion models--offering faster generation and high-quality outputs in state-of-the-art image and video generative models--efficient inference-time scaling methods used for diffusion models cannot be directly applied due to their deterministic generative process. To enable efficient inference-time scaling for flow models, we propose three key ideas: 1) SDE-based generation, enabling particle sampling in flow models, 2) Interpolant conversion, broadening the search space and enhancing sample diversity, and 3) Rollover Budget Forcing (RBF), an adaptive allocation of computational resources across timesteps to maximize budget utilization. Our experiments show that SDE-based generation, particularly variance-preserving (VP) interpolant-based generation, improves the performance of particle sampling methods for inference-time scaling in flow models. Additionally, we demonstrate that RBF with VP-SDE achieves the best performance, outperforming all previous inference-time scaling approaches.

  Recent advances in multimodal training have significantly improved the integration of image understanding and generation within a unified model. This study investigates how vision-language models (VLMs) handle image-understanding tasks, focusing on how visual information is processed and transferred to the textual domain. We compare native multimodal VLMs, models trained from scratch on multimodal data to generate both text and images, and non-native multimodal VLMs, models adapted from pre-trained large language models or capable of generating only text, highlighting key differences in information flow. We find that in native multimodal VLMs, image and text embeddings are more separated within the residual stream. Moreover, VLMs differ in how visual information reaches text: non-native multimodal VLMs exhibit a distributed communication pattern, where information is exchanged through multiple image tokens, whereas models trained natively for joint image and text generation tend to rely on a single post-image token that acts as a narrow gate for visual information. We show that ablating this single token significantly deteriorates image-understanding performance, whereas targeted, token-level interventions reliably steer image semantics and downstream text with fine-grained control.

  This work investigates descriptive captions as an additional source of supervision for biological multimodal foundation models. Images and captions can be viewed as complementary samples from the latent morphospace of a species, each capturing certain biological traits. Incorporating captions during training encourages alignment with this shared latent structure, emphasizing potentially diagnostic characters while suppressing spurious correlations. The main challenge, however, lies in obtaining faithful, instance-specific captions at scale. This requirement has limited the utilization of natural language supervision in organismal biology compared with many other scientific domains. We complement this gap by generating synthetic captions with multimodal large language models (MLLMs), guided by Wikipedia-derived visual information and taxon-tailored format examples. These domain-specific contexts help reduce hallucination and yield accurate, instance-based descriptive captions. Using these captions, we train BioCAP (i.e., BioCLIP with Captions), a biological foundation model that captures rich semantics and achieves strong performance in species classification and text-image retrieval. These results demonstrate the value of descriptive captions beyond labels in bridging biological images with multimodal foundation models.

  The rapid progress of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) calls for more reliable evaluation protocols. Existing static benchmarks suffer from the potential risk of data contamination and saturation, leading to inflated or misleading performance evaluations. To address these issues, we first apply Graph formulation to represent a static or dynamic VQA sample. With the formulation, we propose Knowledge-enhanced Benchmark Evolution(KBE), a dynamic multimodal evaluation framework. KBE first analyzes the original static benchmark, then expands it by integrating multimodal knowledge, transforming the static benchmark into a controllable, dynamic evolving version. Crucially, KBE can both reconstruct questions by Re-selecting visual information in the original image and expand existing questions with external textual knowledge. It enables difficulty-controllable evaluation by adjusting the degree of question exploration. Extensive experiments demonstrate that KBE alleviates the risk of data contamination, data saturation, and provides a more comprehensive assessment of MLLM capabilities.

  Despite advances in reinforcement learning (RL)-based video reasoning with large language models (LLMs), data collection and fine-tuning remain significant challenges. These methods often rely on large-scale supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with extensive video data and long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) annotations, making them costly and hard to scale. To address this, we present Video-RTS, a new approach to improve video reasoning capability with drastically improved data efficiency by combining data-efficient RL with a video-adaptive test-time scaling (TTS) strategy. Building on observations about the data scaling, we skip the resource-intensive SFT step and employ efficient pure-RL training with output-based rewards, requiring no additional annotations or extensive fine-tuning. Furthermore, to utilize computational resources more efficiently, we introduce a sparse-to-dense video TTS strategy that improves inference by iteratively adding frames based on output consistency. We validate our approach on multiple video reasoning benchmarks, showing that Video-RTS surpasses existing video reasoning models by 2.4% in accuracy using only 3.6% training samples. Specifically, Video-RTS achieves a 4.2% improvement on Video-Holmes, a recent and challenging video reasoning benchmark. Notably, our pure RL training and adaptive video TTS offer complementary strengths, enabling Video-RTS's strong reasoning performance.

  Chain-of-thought reasoning has significantly improved the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) across various domains. However, this reasoning process has been confined exclusively to textual space, limiting its effectiveness in visually intensive tasks. To address this limitation, we introduce the concept of reasoning in the pixel-space. Within this novel framework, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are equipped with a suite of visual reasoning operations, such as zoom-in and select-frame. These operations enable VLMs to directly inspect, interrogate, and infer from visual evidences, thereby enhancing reasoning fidelity for visual tasks. Cultivating such pixel-space reasoning capabilities in VLMs presents notable challenges, including the model's initially imbalanced competence and its reluctance to adopt the newly introduced pixel-space operations. We address these challenges through a two-phase training approach. The first phase employs instruction tuning on synthesized reasoning traces to familiarize the model with the novel visual operations. Following this, a reinforcement learning (RL) phase leverages a curiosity-driven reward scheme to balance exploration between pixel-space reasoning and textual reasoning. With these visual operations, VLMs can interact with complex visual inputs, such as information-rich images or videos to proactively gather necessary information. We demonstrate that this approach significantly improves VLM performance across diverse visual reasoning benchmarks. Our 7B model, \model, achieves 84\% on V* bench, 74\% on TallyQA-Complex, and 84\% on InfographicsVQA, marking the highest accuracy achieved by any open-source model to date. These results highlight the importance of pixel-space reasoning and the effectiveness of our framework.

  Vision encoders are indispensable for allowing impressive performance of Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in vision language tasks such as visual question answering and reasoning. However, existing vision encoders focus on global image representations but overlook fine-grained regional analysis. They are limited in fine grained perception due to the scarcity of fine grained annotated data and the lack of a fine grained pre-training paradigm. In this paper, we propose GranViT, a novel Vision Transformer that integrates fine-grained feature extraction with semantic alignment to Large Language Models (LLMs) via region level autoregressive training. We first construct Gran-29M, a dataset comprising 2million natural and OCR images paired with over 180 million high-quality region-level annotations, to enable large scale fine grained pretraining. Consequently, we develop a pretraining-adaptation framework along with a self distillation mechanism to train fine-grained GranViT on Gran-29M. We sufficiently exploit the fine-grained annotations from Gran-29M to resort to bounding-box-to-caption regression to enhance localized visual representation of the vision encoder in the pretraining and caption-to-bounding-box regression to improve vision feature utilization and localization for LLM in the adaptation. We further incorporate a self distillation mechanism that imposes explicit localization constraints on the vision encoder to strengthen its regional reasoning capability. Extensive experiments show that GranViT surpasses existing vision encoders and attains strong transferability to varying LLMs. Remarkably, it achieves state-of-the-art results on fine-grained recognition, multimodal VQA, and OCR understanding.

  In the field of AI-driven human-GUI interaction automation, while rapid advances in multimodal large language models and reinforcement fine-tuning techniques have yielded remarkable progress, a fundamental challenge persists: their interaction logic significantly deviates from natural human-GUI communication patterns. To fill this gap, we propose "Blink-Think-Link" (BTL), a brain-inspired framework for human-GUI interaction that mimics the human cognitive process between users and graphical interfaces. The system decomposes interactions into three biologically plausible phases: (1) Blink - rapid detection and attention to relevant screen areas, analogous to saccadic eye movements; (2) Think - higher-level reasoning and decision-making, mirroring cognitive planning; and (3) Link - generation of executable commands for precise motor control, emulating human action selection mechanisms. Additionally, we introduce two key technical innovations for the BTL framework: (1) Blink Data Generation - an automated annotation pipeline specifically optimized for blink data, and (2) BTL Reward -- the first rule-based reward mechanism that enables reinforcement learning driven by both process and outcome. Building upon this framework, we develop a GUI agent model named BTL-UI, which demonstrates competitive performance across both static GUI understanding and dynamic interaction tasks in comprehensive benchmarks. These results provide conclusive empirical validation of the framework's efficacy in developing advanced GUI Agents.

  Large vision-language models (LVLMs) are increasingly deployed in interactive applications such as virtual and augmented reality, where a first-person (egocentric) view captured by head-mounted cameras serves as key input. While this view offers fine-grained cues about user attention and hand-object interactions, its narrow field of view and lack of global context often lead to failures on spatially or contextually demanding queries. To address this, we introduce a framework that augments egocentric inputs with third-person (exocentric) views, providing complementary information such as global scene layout and object visibility to LVLMs. We present E3VQA, the first benchmark for multi-view question answering with 4K high-quality question-answer pairs grounded in synchronized ego-exo image pairs. Additionally, we propose M3CoT, a training-free prompting technique that constructs a unified scene representation by integrating scene graphs from three complementary perspectives. M3CoT enables LVLMs to reason more effectively across views, yielding consistent performance gains (4.84% for GPT-4o and 5.94% for Gemini 2.0 Flash) over a recent CoT baseline. Our extensive evaluation reveals key strengths and limitations of LVLMs in multi-view reasoning and highlights the value of leveraging both egocentric and exocentric inputs.

  Visual generative and understanding models typically rely on distinct tokenizers to process images, presenting a key challenge for unifying them within a single framework. Recent studies attempt to address this by connecting the training of VQVAE (for autoregressive generation) and CLIP (for understanding) to build a unified tokenizer. However, directly combining these training objectives has been observed to cause severe loss conflicts. In this paper, we show that reconstruction and semantic supervision do not inherently conflict. Instead, the underlying bottleneck stems from limited representational capacity of discrete token space. Building on these insights, we introduce UniTok, a unified tokenizer featuring a novel multi-codebook quantization mechanism that effectively scales up the vocabulary size and bottleneck dimension. In terms of final performance, UniTok sets a new record of 0.38 rFID and 78.6% zero-shot accuracy on ImageNet. Besides, UniTok can be seamlessly integrated into MLLMs to unlock native visual generation capability, without compromising the understanding performance. Additionally, we show that UniTok favors cfg-free generation, reducing gFID from 14.6 to 2.5 on ImageNet 256$\times$256 benchmark. GitHub:this https URL.

  Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) aims to locate unusual activities or behaviors within videos. Recently, offline VAD has garnered substantial research attention, which has been invigorated by the progress in large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs), offering the potential for a more nuanced understanding of anomalies. However, online VAD has seldom received attention due to real-time constraints and computational intensity. In this paper, we introduce a novel Memory-based online scoring queue scheme for Training-free VAD (MoniTor), to address the inherent complexities in online VAD. Specifically, MoniTor applies a streaming input to VLMs, leveraging the capabilities of pre-trained large-scale models. To capture temporal dependencies more effectively, we incorporate a novel prediction mechanism inspired by Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. This ensures the model can effectively model past states and leverage previous predictions to identify anomalous behaviors. Thereby, it better understands the current frame. Moreover, we design a scoring queue and an anomaly prior to dynamically store recent scores and cover all anomalies in the monitoring scenario, providing guidance for LLMs to distinguish between normal and abnormal behaviors over time. We evaluate MoniTor on two large datasets (i.e., UCF-Crime and XD-Violence) containing various surveillance and real-world scenarios. The results demonstrate that MoniTor outperforms state-of-the-art methods and is competitive with weakly supervised methods without training. Code is available atthis https URL.

  We propose the Multi-modal Untrimmed Video Retrieval task, along with a new benchmark (MUVR) to advance video retrieval for long-video platforms. MUVR aims to retrieve untrimmed videos containing relevant segments using multi-modal queries. It has the following features: 1) Practical retrieval paradigm: MUVR supports video-centric multi-modal queries, expressing fine-grained retrieval needs through long text descriptions, video tag prompts, and mask prompts. It adopts a one-to-many retrieval paradigm and focuses on untrimmed videos, tailored for long-video platform applications. 2) Multi-level visual correspondence: To cover common video categories (e.g., news, travel, dance) and precisely define retrieval matching criteria, we construct multi-level visual correspondence based on core video content (e.g., news events, travel locations, dance moves) which users are interested in and want to retrieve. It covers six levels: copy, event, scene, instance, action, and others. 3) Comprehensive evaluation criteria: We develop 3 versions of MUVR (i.e., Base, Filter, QA). MUVR-Base/Filter evaluates retrieval models, while MUVR-QA assesses MLLMs in a question-answering format. We also propose a Reranking Score to evaluate the reranking ability of MLLMs. MUVR consists of 53K untrimmed videos from the video platform Bilibili, with 1,050 multi-modal queries and 84K matches. Extensive evaluations of 3 state-of-the-art video retrieval models, 6 image-based VLMs, and 10 MLLMs are conducted. MUVR reveals the limitations of retrieval methods in processing untrimmed videos and multi-modal queries, as well as MLLMs in multi-video understanding and reranking.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities across a wide range of vision-language tasks. However, due to the restricted input resolutions, MLLMs face significant challenges in precisely understanding and localizing visual details in high-resolution images -- particularly when dealing with extra-small objects embedded in cluttered contexts. To address this issue, we propose \textsc{FineRS}, a two-stage MLLM-based reinforcement learning framework for jointly reasoning and segmenting extremely small objects within high-resolution scenes. \textsc{FineRS} adopts a coarse-to-fine pipeline comprising Global Semantic Exploration (GSE) and Localized Perceptual Refinement (LPR). Specifically, GSE performs instruction-guided reasoning to generate a textural response and a coarse target region, while LPR refines this region to produce an accurate bounding box and segmentation mask. To couple the two stages, we introduce a locate-informed retrospective reward, where LPR's outputs are used to optimize GSE for more robust coarse region exploration. % Additionally, we present \textsc{FineRS}-4k, a new dataset for evaluating MLLMs on attribute-level reasoning and pixel-level segmentation on subtle, small-scale targets in complex high-resolution scenes. Experimental results on \textsc{FineRS}-4k and public datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art MLLM-based approaches on both instruction-guided segmentation and visual reasoning tasks.

  How to integrate and verify spatial intelligence in foundation models remains an open challenge. Current practice often proxies Visual-Spatial Intelligence (VSI) with purely textual prompts and VQA-style scoring, which obscures geometry, invites linguistic shortcuts, and weakens attribution to genuinely spatial skills. We introduce Spatial Intelligence Grid (SIG): a structured, grid-based schema that explicitly encodes object layouts, inter-object relations, and physically grounded priors. As a complementary channel to text, SIG provides a faithful, compositional representation of scene structure for foundation-model reasoning. Building on SIG, we derive SIG-informed evaluation metrics that quantify a model's intrinsic VSI, which separates spatial capability from language priors. In few-shot in-context learning with state-of-the-art multimodal LLMs (e.g. GPT- and Gemini-family models), SIG yields consistently larger, more stable, and more comprehensive gains across all VSI metrics compared to VQA-only representations, indicating its promise as a data-labeling and training schema for learning VSI. We also release SIGBench, a benchmark of 1.4K driving frames annotated with ground-truth SIG labels and human gaze traces, supporting both grid-based machine VSI tasks and attention-driven, human-like VSI tasks in autonomous-driving scenarios.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise in enhancing the general Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs). However, when applied to improve general CoT reasoning, existing RL frameworks often struggle to generalize beyond the training distribution. To address this, we propose NoisyGRPO, a systematic multimodal RL framework that introduces controllable noise into visual inputs for enhanced exploration and explicitly models the advantage estimation process via a Bayesian framework. Specifically, NoisyGRPO improves RL training by: (1) \textbf{Noise-Injected Exploration Policy}: Perturbing visual inputs with Gaussian noise to encourage exploration across a wider range of visual scenarios; and (2) \textbf{Bayesian Advantage Estimation}: Formulating advantage estimation as a principled Bayesian inference problem, where the injected noise level serves as a prior and the observed trajectory reward as the likelihood. This Bayesian modeling fuses both sources of information to compute a robust posterior estimate of trajectory advantage, effectively guiding MLLMs to prefer visually grounded trajectories over noisy ones. Experiments on standard CoT quality, general capability, and hallucination benchmarks demonstrate that NoisyGRPO substantially improves generalization and robustness, especially in RL settings with small-scale MLLMs such as Qwen2.5-VL 3B.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Visual reasoning in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has primarily been studied in static, fully observable settings, limiting their effectiveness in real-world environments where information is often incomplete due to occlusion or limited field of view. Humans, in contrast, actively explore and interact with their environment-moving, examining, and manipulating objects-to gather information through a closed-loop process integrating perception, reasoning, and action. Inspired by this human capability, we introduce the Active Visual Reasoning (AVR) task, extending visual reasoning to partially observable, interactive environments. AVR necessitates agents to: (1) actively acquire information via sequential physical actions, (2) integrate observations across multiple steps for coherent reasoning, and (3) dynamically adjust decisions based on evolving visual feedback. To rigorously evaluate AVR, we introduce CLEVR-AVR, a simulation benchmark featuring multi-round interactive environments designed to assess both reasoning correctness and information-gathering efficiency. We present AVR-152k, a large-scale dataset that offers rich Chain-of-Thought (CoT) annotations detailing iterative reasoning for uncertainty identification, action-conditioned information gain prediction, and information-maximizing action selection, crucial for training agents in a higher-order Markov Decision Process. Building on this, we develop PhysVLM-AVR, an MLLM achieving state-of-the-art performance on CLEVR-AVR, embodied reasoning (OpenEQA, RoboVQA), and passive visual reasoning (GeoMath, Geometry30K). Our analysis also reveals that current embodied MLLMs, despite detecting information incompleteness, struggle to actively acquire and integrate new information through interaction, highlighting a fundamental gap in active reasoning capabilities.

  Hirschsprung's disease is defined as the congenital absence of ganglion cells in some segment(s) of the colon. The muscle cannot make coordinated movements to propel stool in that section, most commonly leading to obstruction. The diagnosis and treatment for this disease require a clear identification of different region(s) of the myenteric plexus, where ganglion cells should be present, on the microscopic view of the tissue slide. While deep learning approaches, such as Convolutional Neural Networks, have performed very well in this task, they are often treated as black boxes, with minimal understanding gained from them, and may not conform to how a physician makes decisions. In this study, we propose a novel framework that integrates expert-derived textual concepts into a Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training-based vision-language model to guide plexus classification. Using prompts derived from expert sources (e.g., medical textbooks and papers) generated by large language models and reviewed by our team before being encoded with QuiltNet, our approach aligns clinically relevant semantic cues with visual features. Experimental results show that the proposed model demonstrated superior discriminative capability across different classification metrics as it outperformed CNN-based models, including VGG-19, ResNet-18, and ResNet-50; achieving an accuracy of 83.9%, a precision of 86.6%, and a specificity of 87.6%. These findings highlight the potential of multi-modal learning in histopathology and underscore the value of incorporating expert knowledge for more clinically relevant model outputs.

  Achieving fine-grained spatio-temporal understanding in videos remains a major challenge for current Video Large Multimodal Models (Video LMMs). Addressing this challenge requires mastering two core capabilities: video referring understanding, which captures the semantics of video regions, and video grounding, which segments object regions based on natural language descriptions. However, most existing approaches tackle these tasks in isolation, limiting progress toward unified, referentially grounded video interaction. We identify a key bottleneck in the lack of high-quality, unified video instruction data and a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating referentially grounded video chat. To address these challenges, we contribute in three core aspects: dataset, model, and benchmark. First, we introduce SAMA-239K, a large-scale dataset comprising 15K videos specifically curated to enable joint learning of video referring understanding, grounding, and multi-turn video chat. Second, we propose the SAMA model, which incorporates a versatile spatio-temporal context aggregator and a Segment Anything Model to jointly enhance fine-grained video comprehension and precise grounding capabilities. Finally, we establish SAMA-Bench, a meticulously designed benchmark consisting of 5,067 questions from 522 videos, to comprehensively evaluate the integrated capabilities of Video LMMs in multi-turn, spatio-temporal referring understanding and grounded dialogue. Extensive experiments and benchmarking results show that SAMA not only achieves strong performance on SAMA-Bench but also sets a new state-of-the-art on general grounding benchmarks, while maintaining highly competitive performance on standard visual understanding benchmarks.

  Micro-expressions (MEs), brief and low-intensity facial movements revealing concealed emotions, are crucial for affective computing. Despite notable progress in ME recognition, existing methods are largely confined to discrete emotion classification, lacking the capacity for comprehensive ME Understanding (MEU), particularly in interpreting subtle facial dynamics and underlying emotional cues. While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) offer potential for MEU with their advanced reasoning abilities, they still struggle to perceive such subtle facial affective behaviors. To bridge this gap, we propose a ME Large Language Model (MELLM) that integrates optical flow-based sensitivity to subtle facial motions with the powerful inference ability of LLMs. Specifically, an iterative, warping-based optical-flow estimator, named MEFlowNet, is introduced to precisely capture facial micro-movements. For its training and evaluation, we construct MEFlowDataset, a large-scale optical-flow dataset with 54,611 onset-apex image pairs spanning diverse identities and subtle facial motions. Subsequently, we design a Flow-Guided Micro-Expression Understanding paradigm. Under this framework, the optical flow signals extracted by MEFlowNet are leveraged to build MEU-Instruct, an instruction-tuning dataset for MEU. MELLM is then fine-tuned on MEU-Instruct, enabling it to translate subtle motion patterns into human-readable descriptions and generate corresponding emotional inferences. Experiments demonstrate that MEFlowNet significantly outperforms existing optical flow methods in facial and ME-flow estimation, while MELLM achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and generalization across multiple ME benchmarks. To the best of our knowledge, this work presents two key contributions: MEFlowNet as the first dedicated ME flow estimator, and MELLM as the first LLM tailored for MEU.

  Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) increasingly excel at perception, understanding, and reasoning. However, current benchmarks inadequately evaluate their ability to perform these tasks continuously in dynamic, real-world environments. To bridge this gap, we introduce RTV-Bench, a fine-grained benchmark for MLLM real-time video analysis. RTV-Bench uses three key principles: (1) Multi-Timestamp Question Answering (MTQA), where answers evolve with scene changes; (2) Hierarchical Question Structure, combining basic and advanced queries; and (3) Multi-dimensional Evaluation, assessing the ability of continuous perception, understanding, and reasoning. RTV-Bench contains 552 diverse videos (167.2 hours) and 4,631 high-quality QA pairs. We evaluated leading MLLMs, including proprietary (GPT-4o, Gemini 2.0), open-source offline (Qwen2.5-VL, VideoLLaMA3), and open-source real-time (VITA-1.5, InternLM-XComposer2.5-OmniLive) models. Experiment results show open-source real-time models largely outperform offline ones but still trail top proprietary models. Our analysis also reveals that larger model size or higher frame sampling rates do not significantly boost RTV-Bench performance, sometimes causing slight decreases. This underscores the need for better model architectures optimized for video stream processing and long sequences to advance real-time video analysis with MLLMs. Our benchmark toolkit is available at:this https URL.

  Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) relies on the powerful LLM to perform multimodal tasks, showing amazing emergent abilities in recent studies, such as writing poems based on an image. However, it is difficult for these case studies to fully reflect the performance of MLLM, lacking a comprehensive evaluation. In this paper, we fill in this blank, presenting the first comprehensive MLLM Evaluation benchmark MME. It measures both perception and cognition abilities on a total of 14 subtasks. In order to avoid data leakage that may arise from direct use of public datasets for evaluation, the annotations of instruction-answer pairs are all manually designed. The concise instruction design allows us to fairly compare MLLMs, instead of struggling in prompt engineering. Besides, with such an instruction, we can also easily carry out quantitative statistics. A total of 30 advanced MLLMs are comprehensively evaluated on our MME, which not only suggests that existing MLLMs still have a large room for improvement, but also reveals the potential directions for the subsequent model optimization.

  Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) research has primarily focused on closed-book factual question answering (QA), while contextual QA remains unexplored, despite its importance in real-world applications. In this work, we focus on UQ for the contextual QA task and propose a theoretically grounded approach to quantify epistemic uncertainty. We begin by introducing a task-agnostic, token-level uncertainty measure defined as the cross-entropy between the predictive distribution of the given model and the unknown true distribution. By decomposing this measure, we isolate the epistemic component and approximate the true distribution by a perfectly prompted, idealized model. We then derive an upper bound for epistemic uncertainty and show that it can be interpreted as semantic feature gaps in the given model's hidden representations relative to the ideal model. We further apply this generic framework to the contextual QA task and hypothesize that three features approximate this gap: context-reliance (using the provided context rather than parametric knowledge), context comprehension (extracting relevant information from context), and honesty (avoiding intentional lies). Using a top-down interpretability approach, we extract these features by using only a small number of labeled samples and ensemble them to form a robust uncertainty score. Experiments on multiple QA benchmarks in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings show that our method substantially outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised (sampling-free and sampling-based) and supervised UQ methods, achieving up to a 13-point PRR improvement while incurring a negligible inference overhead.

  Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in sensitive domains, where their ability to infer personal data from seemingly benign text introduces emerging privacy risks. While recent LLM-based anonymization methods help mitigate such risks, they often rely on proprietary models (e.g., GPT-4), raising concerns about cost and the potential exposure of sensitive data to untrusted external systems. To address this, we introduce SElf-refining Anonymization with Language model (SEAL), a novel distillation framework for training small language models (SLMs) to perform effective anonymization without relying on external models at inference time. SEAL leverages adversarial interactions between an LLM anonymizer and an inference model to collect trajectories of anonymized texts and inferred attributes, which are then used to distill anonymization and critique capabilities into SLMs through supervised fine-tuning and preference learning. The resulting models learn both to anonymize text and to evaluate their outputs, enabling iterative improvement of anonymization quality via self-refinement. Experiments on SynthPAI, a dataset of synthetic personal profiles and text comments, demonstrate that SLMs trained with SEAL achieve substantial improvements in anonymization capabilities. Notably, 8B models attain a privacy-utility trade-off comparable to that of the GPT-4 anonymizer and, with self-refinement, even surpass it in terms of privacy protection. These results highlight the effectiveness of our adversarial distillation framework for training SLMs as efficient anonymizers.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Tokenization efficiency plays a critical role in the performance and cost of large language models (LLMs), yet most models rely on static tokenizers optimized on general-purpose corpora. These tokenizers' fixed vocabularies often fail to adapt to domain- or language-specific inputs, leading to longer token sequences and higher computational costs. We introduce zip2zip, a novel method for achieving context-adaptive tokenization in LLMs at inference time. Leveraging an online data compression algorithm (Lempel-Ziv-Welch), zip2zip dynamically expands its active vocabulary at inference time by continuously replacing fragmented token sequences with more compact hypertokens, which it can immediately output during generation. In doing so, the model refines its internal tokenization scheme to match the token distribution of the current context, reducing redundancy and improving representational efficiency. zip2zip consists of three key components: (1) a tokenizer based on Lempel-Ziv-Welch compression that incrementally merges co-occurring tokens into reusable hypertokens on the fly; (2) a dynamic embedding (and unembedding) layer that computes embeddings for newly formed hypertokens at runtime; and (3) a variant of autoregressive language modeling that pretrains the model to handle hypertokenized, compressed text sequences as inputs and outputs. We show that an existing LLM can be uptrained for zip2zip in 10 GPU-hours via parameter-efficient finetuning. The resulting LLM performs test-time adaptation, learning to use hypertokens in unseen contexts and reducing input and output tokens by 15-40%.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In-context learning (ICL) enables large language models to perform few-shot learning by conditioning on labeled examples in the prompt. Despite its flexibility, ICL suffers from instability -- especially as prompt length increases with more demonstrations. To address this, we treat ICL as a source of weak supervision and propose a parameter-efficient method that disentangles demonstration-induced latent shifts from those of the query. An ICL-based teacher generates pseudo-labels on unlabeled queries, while a student predicts them using only the query input, updating a lightweight adapter. This captures demonstration effects in a compact, reusable form, enabling efficient inference while remaining composable with new demonstrations. Although trained on noisy teacher outputs, the student often outperforms its teacher through pseudo-label correction and coverage expansion, consistent with the weak-to-strong generalization effect. Empirically, our method improves generalization, stability, and efficiency across both in-domain and out-of-domain tasks, surpassing standard ICL and prior disentanglement methods.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Accurately estimating semantic aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties in large language models (LLMs) is particularly challenging in free-form question answering (QA), where obtaining stable estimates often requires many expensive generations. We introduce a diversity-steered sampler that discourages semantically redundant outputs during decoding, covers both autoregressive and masked diffusion paradigms, and yields substantial sample-efficiency gains. The key idea is to inject a continuous semantic-similarity penalty into the model's proposal distribution using a natural language inference (NLI) model lightly finetuned on partial prefixes or intermediate diffusion states. We debias downstream uncertainty estimates with importance reweighting and shrink their variance with control variates. Across four QA benchmarks, our method matches or surpasses baselines while covering more semantic clusters with the same number of samples. Being modular and requiring no gradient access to the base LLM, the framework promises to serve as a drop-in enhancement for uncertainty estimation in risk-sensitive model deployments.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in natural language processing through strong semantic understanding and generation. However, their black-box nature limits structured and multi-hop reasoning. In contrast, Text-Attributed Graphs (TAGs) provide explicit relational structures enriched with textual context, yet often lack semantic depth. Recent research shows that combining LLMs and TAGs yields complementary benefits: enhancing TAG representation learning and improving the reasoning and interpretability of LLMs. This survey provides the first systematic review of LLM--TAG integration from an orchestration perspective. We introduce a novel taxonomy covering two fundamental directions: LLM for TAG, where LLMs enrich graph-based tasks, and TAG for LLM, where structured graphs improve LLM reasoning. We categorize orchestration strategies into sequential, parallel, and multi-module frameworks, and discuss advances in TAG-specific pretraining, prompting, and parameter-efficient fine-tuning. Beyond methodology, we summarize empirical insights, curate available datasets, and highlight diverse applications across recommendation systems, biomedical analysis, and knowledge-intensive question answering. Finally, we outline open challenges and promising research directions, aiming to guide future work at the intersection of language and graph learning.

  Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) has emerged as a crucial method for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human-annotated demonstrations. However, SFT, being an off-policy approach similar to behavior cloning, often struggles with overfitting and poor out-of-domain generalization, especially in limited-data scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose Self-Rewarding PPO, a novel fine-tuning method that leverages on-policy techniques to enhance generalization performance. Our approach combines the strengths of SFT and proximal policy optimization (PPO) to achieve more effective alignment from demonstration data. At its core is a reward function designed as the log policy ratio between the SFT model and the pretrained base model. This function serves as an implicit reward signal, using the pretrained policy as a baseline and the SFT policy as a target. By doing so, it enables on-policy fine-tuning without relying on human preference annotations. The integration of this self-rewarding mechanism with PPO addresses key limitations of SFT, improving generalization, data efficiency, and robustness. Our empirical evaluation across a range of natural language processing tasks demonstrates that Self-Rewarding PPO consistently outperforms traditional SFT methods. The results highlight the effectiveness of our approach in aligning LLMs using demonstration data, particularly in scenarios where high-quality annotated data is scarce.

  Reasoning has become a central paradigm for large language models (LLMs), consistently boosting accuracy across diverse benchmarks. Yet its suitability for precision-sensitive tasks remains unclear. We present the first systematic study of reasoning for classification tasks under strict low false positive rate (FPR) regimes. Our analysis covers two tasks--safety detection and hallucination detection--evaluated in both fine-tuned and zero-shot settings, using standard LLMs and Large Reasoning Models (LRMs). Our results reveal a clear trade-off: Think On (reasoning-augmented) generation improves overall accuracy, but underperforms at the low-FPR thresholds essential for practical use. In contrast, Think Off (no reasoning during inference) dominates in these precision-sensitive regimes, with Think On surpassing only when higher FPRs are acceptable. In addition, we find token-based scoring substantially outperforms self-verbalized confidence for precision-sensitive deployments. Finally, a simple ensemble of the two modes recovers the strengths of each. Taken together, our findings position reasoning as a double-edged tool: beneficial for average accuracy, but often ill-suited for applications requiring strict precision.

  The rapid emergence of diverse large language models (LLMs) has spurred the development of LLM routers that assign user queries to the most suitable model. However, existing LLM routers typically perform a single-round, one-to-one mapping (\textit{i.e.}, assigning each query to a single model in isolation), which limits their capability to tackle complex tasks that demand the complementary strengths of multiple LLMs. In this paper, we present \textbf{Router-R1}, a reinforcement learning (RL)-based framework that formulates multi-LLM routing and aggregation as a sequential decision process. Router-R1 instantiates the router itself as a capable LLM, leveraging its reasoning ability to interleave "think" actions (internal deliberation) with "route" actions (dynamic model invocation), and integrates each response into its evolving context. To facilitate learning, we employ a lightweight rule-based reward comprising format rewards, final outcome rewards, and a novel cost reward for optimizing the balance between performance and cost, opening a pathway toward enhancing performance-cost trade-offs via RL. Router-R1 also conditions only on simple model descriptors such as pricing, latency, and example performance, enabling strong generalization to unseen model selection. Experiments on seven general and multi-hop QA benchmarks show that Router-R1 outperforms several strong baselines, achieving superior performance while maintaining robust generalization and cost management.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve strong performance across a wide range of tasks, yet exhibit substantial variability in the various layers' training quality with respect to specific downstream applications, limiting their downstream performance. It is therefore critical to estimate layer-wise training quality in a manner that accounts for both model architecture and training data. However, existing approaches predominantly rely on model-centric heuristics (such as spectral statistics, outlier detection, or uniform allocation) while overlooking the influence of data. To address these limitations, we propose LayerIF, a data-driven framework that leverages Influence Functions to quantify the training quality of individual layers in a principled and task-sensitive manner. By isolating each layer's gradients and measuring the sensitivity of the validation loss to training examples by computing layer-wise influences, we derive data-driven estimates of layer importance. Notably, our method produces task-specific layer importance estimates for the same LLM, revealing how layers specialize for different test-time evaluation tasks. We demonstrate the utility of our scores by leveraging them for two downstream applications: (a) expert allocation in LoRA-MoE architectures and (b) layer-wise sparsity distribution for LLM pruning. Experiments across multiple LLM architectures demonstrate that our model-agnostic, influence-guided allocation leads to consistent gains in task performance.

  Long-form legal reasoning remains a key challenge for large language models (LLMs) in spite of recent advances in test-time scaling. To address this, we introduce \textsc{LEXam}, a novel benchmark derived from 340 law exams spanning 116 law school courses across a range of subjects and degree levels. The dataset comprises 4,886 law exam questions in English and German, including 2,841 long-form, open-ended questions and 2,045 multiple-choice questions. Besides reference answers, the open questions are also accompanied by explicit guidance outlining the expected legal reasoning approach such as issue spotting, rule recall, or rule application. Our evaluation on both open-ended and multiple-choice questions present significant challenges for current LLMs; in particular, they notably struggle with open questions that require structured, multi-step legal reasoning. Moreover, our results underscore the effectiveness of the dataset in differentiating between models with varying capabilities. Deploying an ensemble LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm with rigorous human expert validation, we demonstrate how model-generated reasoning steps can be evaluated consistently and accurately, closely aligning with human expert assessments. Our evaluation setup provides a scalable method to assess legal reasoning quality beyond simple accuracy metrics. We have open-sourced our code onthis https URLand released our data onthis https URL.

  Preference datasets are essential for training general-domain, instruction-following language models with Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). Each subsequent data release raises expectations for future data collection, meaning there is a constant need to advance the quality and diversity of openly available preference data. To address this need, we introduce HelpSteer3-Preference, a permissively licensed (CC-BY-4.0), high-quality, human-annotated preference dataset comprising of over 40,000 samples. These samples span diverse real-world applications of large language models (LLMs), including tasks relating to STEM, coding and multilingual scenarios. Using HelpSteer3-Preference, we train Reward Models (RMs) that achieve top performance on RM-Bench (82.4%) and JudgeBench (73.7%). This represents a substantial improvement (~10% absolute) over the previously best-reported results from existing RMs. We demonstrate HelpSteer3-Preference can also be applied to train Generative RMs and how policy models can be aligned with RLHF using our RMs. Dataset (CC-BY-4.0):this https URLModels (NVIDIA Open Model):this https URL

  Reward models are central to aligning LLMs with human preferences, but they are costly to train, requiring large-scale human-labeled preference data and powerful pretrained LLM backbones. Meanwhile, the increasing availability of high-quality synthetic instruction-following datasets raises the question: can simpler, reference-based metrics serve as viable alternatives to reward models during RL-based alignment? In this paper, we show first that BLEU, a basic string-matching metric, surprisingly matches strong reward models in agreement with human preferences on general instruction-following datasets. Based on this insight, we develop BLEUBERI, a method that first identifies challenging instructions and then applies Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) using BLEU directly as the reward function. We demonstrate that BLEUBERI-trained models are competitive with models trained via reward model-guided RL across four challenging instruction-following benchmarks and three different base language models. A human evaluation further supports that the quality of BLEUBERI model outputs is on par with those from reward model-aligned models. Moreover, BLEUBERI models generate outputs that are more factually grounded than competing methods. Overall, we show that given access to high-quality reference outputs (easily obtained via existing instruction-following datasets or synthetic data generation), string matching-based metrics are cheap yet effective proxies for reward models during alignment.

  Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled strong reasoning capabilities through Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, which elicits step-by-step problem solving, but often at the cost of excessive verbosity in intermediate outputs, leading to increased computational overhead. We propose Sketch-of-Thought (SoT), a prompting framework that integrates cognitively inspired reasoning paradigms with linguistic constraints to reduce token usage while preserving reasoning accuracy. SoT is designed as a flexible, modular approach and is instantiated with three paradigms--Conceptual Chaining, Chunked Symbolism, and Expert Lexicons--each tailored to distinct reasoning tasks and selected dynamically at test-time by a lightweight routing model. Across 18 reasoning datasets spanning multiple domains, languages, and modalities, SoT achieves token reductions of up to 84% with minimal accuracy loss. In tasks such as mathematical and multi-hop reasoning, it even improves accuracy while shortening outputs.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as highly capable systems and are increasingly being integrated into various uses. However, the rapid pace of their deployment has outpaced a comprehensive understanding of their internal mechanisms and a delineation of their capabilities and limitations. A desired attribute of an intelligent system is its ability to recognize the scope of its own knowledge. To investigate whether LLMs embody this characteristic, we develop a benchmark designed to challenge these models to enumerate all information they possess on specific topics. This benchmark evaluates whether the models recall excessive, insufficient, or the precise amount of information, thereby indicating their awareness of their own knowledge. Our findings reveal that all tested LLMs, given sufficient scale, demonstrate an understanding of how much they know about specific topics. While different architectures exhibit varying rates of this capability's emergence, the results suggest that awareness of knowledge may be a generalizable attribute of LLMs. Further research is needed to confirm this potential and fully elucidate the underlying mechanisms.

  While large transformer models excel in predictive performance, their lack of interpretability restricts their usefulness in high-stakes domains. To remedy this, we propose the Generalized Induction-Head Model (GIM), an interpretable model for next-token prediction inspired by the observation of "induction heads" in LLMs. GIM is a retrieval-based module that identifies similar sequences in the input context by combining exact n-gram matching and fuzzy matching based on a neural similarity metric. We evaluate GIM in two settings: language modeling and fMRI response prediction. In language modeling, GIM improves next-token prediction by up to 25%p over interpretable baselines, significantly narrowing the gap with black-box LLMs. In an fMRI setting, GIM improves neural response prediction by 20% and offers insights into the language selectivity of the brain. GIM represents a significant step toward uniting interpretability and performance across domains. The code is available atthis https URL.

  Transformer-based text classifiers such as BERT, RoBERTa, T5, and GPT have shown strong performance in natural language processing tasks but remain vulnerable to adversarial examples. These vulnerabilities raise significant security concerns, as small input perturbations can cause severe misclassifications. Existing robustness methods often require heavy computation or lack interpretability. This paper presents a unified framework called Explainability-driven Detection, Identification, and Transformation (EDIT) to strengthen inference-time defenses. EDIT integrates explainability tools, including attention maps and integrated gradients, with frequency-based features to automatically detect and identify adversarial perturbations while offering insight into model behavior. After detection, EDIT refines adversarial inputs using an optimal transformation process that leverages pre-trained embeddings and model feedback to replace corrupted tokens. To enhance security assurance, EDIT incorporates automated alerting mechanisms that involve human analysts when necessary.Beyond static defenses, EDIT also provides adaptive resilience by enforcing internal feature similarity and transforming inputs, thereby disrupting the attackers optimization process and limiting the effectiveness of adaptive adversarial attacks. Experiments using BERT and RoBERTa on IMDB, YELP, AGNEWS, and SST2 datasets against seven word substitution attacks demonstrate that EDIT achieves an average Fscore of 89.69 percent and balanced accuracy of 89.70 percent. Compared to four state-of-the-art defenses, EDIT improves balanced accuracy by 1.22 times and F1-score by 1.33 times while being 83 times faster in feature extraction. The framework provides robust, interpretable, and efficient protection against both standard, zero-day, and adaptive adversarial threats in text classification models.

  With the widespread adoption of wearable devices in our daily lives, the demand and appeal for remote patient monitoring have significantly increased. Most research in this field has concentrated on collecting sensor data, visualizing it, and analyzing it to detect anomalies in specific diseases such as diabetes, heart disease and depression. However, this domain has a notable gap in the aspect of human-machine interaction. This paper proposes REMONI, an autonomous REmote health MONItoring system that integrates multimodal large language models (MLLMs), the Internet of Things (IoT), and wearable devices. The system automatically and continuously collects vital signs, accelerometer data from a special wearable (such as a smartwatch), and visual data in patient video clips collected from cameras. This data is processed by an anomaly detection module, which includes a fall detection model and algorithms to identify and alert caregivers of the patient's emergency conditions. A distinctive feature of our proposed system is the natural language processing component, developed with MLLMs capable of detecting and recognizing a patient's activity and emotion while responding to healthcare worker's inquiries. Additionally, prompt engineering is employed to integrate all patient information seamlessly. As a result, doctors and nurses can access real-time vital signs and the patient's current state and mood by interacting with an intelligent agent through a user-friendly web application. Our experiments demonstrate that our system is implementable and scalable for real-life scenarios, potentially reducing the workload of medical professionals and healthcare costs. A full-fledged prototype illustrating the functionalities of the system has been developed and being tested to demonstrate the robustness of its various capabilities.

  Scaling the context length of large language models (LLMs) offers significant benefits but is computationally expensive. This expense stems primarily from the self-attention mechanism, whose $O(N^2)$ complexity with respect to sequence length presents a major bottleneck for both memory and latency. Fortunately, the attention matrix is often sparse, particularly for long sequences, suggesting an opportunity for optimization. Block-sparse attention has emerged as a promising solution that partitions sequences into blocks and skips computation for a subset of these blocks. However, the effectiveness of this method is highly dependent on the underlying attention patterns, which can lead to sub-optimal block-level sparsity. For instance, important key tokens for queries within a single block may be scattered across numerous other blocks, leading to computational redundancy. In this work, we propose Permuted Block-Sparse Attention (\textbf{PBS-Attn}), a plug-and-play method that leverages the permutation properties of attention to increase block-level sparsity and enhance the computational efficiency of LLM prefilling. We conduct comprehensive experiments on challenging real-world long-context datasets, demonstrating that PBS-Attn consistently outperforms existing block-sparse attention methods in model accuracy and closely matches the full attention baseline. Powered by our custom permuted-FlashAttention kernels, PBS-Attn achieves an end-to-end speedup of up to $2.75\times$ in long-context prefilling, confirming its practical viability.

  Understanding how information is dynamically accumulated and transformed in human reasoning has long challenged cognitive psychology, philosophy, and artificial intelligence. Existing accounts, from classical logic to probabilistic models, illuminate aspects of output or individual modelling, but do not offer a unified, quantitative description of general human reasoning dynamics. To solve this, we introduce Information Flow Tracking (IF-Track), that uses large language models (LLMs) as probabilistic encoder to quantify information entropy and gain at each reasoning step. Through fine-grained analyses across diverse tasks, our method is the first successfully models the universal landscape of human reasoning behaviors within a single metric space. We show that IF-Track captures essential reasoning features, identifies systematic error patterns, and characterizes individual differences. Applied to discussion of advanced psychological theory, we first reconcile single- versus dual-process theories in IF-Track and discover the alignment of artificial and human cognition and how LLMs reshaping human reasoning process. This approach establishes a quantitative bridge between theory and measurement, offering mechanistic insights into the architecture of reasoning.

  Large language models are demonstrating increasing capabilities, excelling at benchmarks once considered very difficult. As their capabilities grow, there is a need for more challenging evaluations that go beyond surface-level linguistic competence. Namely, language competence involves not only syntax and semantics but also pragmatics, i.e., understanding situational meaning as shaped by context as well as linguistic and cultural norms. To contribute to this line of research, we introduce SloPragEval and SloPragMega, the first pragmatics understanding benchmarks for Slovene that contain altogether 405 multiple-choice questions. We discuss the difficulties of translation, describe the campaign to establish a human baseline, and report pilot evaluations with LLMs. Our results indicate that current models have greatly improved in understanding nuanced language but may still fail to infer implied speaker meaning in non-literal utterances, especially those that are culture-specific. We also observe a significant gap between proprietary and open-source models. Finally, we argue that benchmarks targeting nuanced language understanding and knowledge of the target culture must be designed with care, preferably constructed from native data, and validated with human responses.

  Recent efforts like TripCraft and TravelPlanner have advanced the use of Large Language Models ( LLMs) for personalized, constraint aware travel itinerary generation. Yet, real travel often faces disruptions. To address this, we present TripTide, the first benchmark evaluating LLM's ability to revise itineraries under realistic disruptions. TripTide models key dimensions such as disruption severity and traveler tolerance, enabling nuanced assessment of LLM adaptability to events like flight cancellations, weather closures, or overbooked attractions. We conduct a threefold evaluation. First, we introduce automatic metrics including Preservation of Intent (how well the revised plan maintains feasibility and goals), Responsiveness (promptness and appropriateness of disruption handling), and Adaptability (semantic, spatial, and sequential divergence between original and revised plans). Second, we apply an LLM-as-a-judge approach to automatically assess revision quality. Third, we perform manual expert evaluation to verify whether revisions preserve semantic, spatial, sequential, and responsive aspects. Our experiments show that LLMs maintain strong sequential consistency and semantic stability, while spatial deviations are larger for shorter trips but decrease with longer ones, indicating that extended plans encourage better geographic coherence. However, disruption-handling ability declines as plan length increases, highlighting limits in LLM robustness. TripTide establishes a benchmark for evaluating adaptability, personalization, and resilience in LLM-based travel planning under real-world uncertainty.

  Ensuring that Large Language Models (LLMs) generate summaries faithful to a given source document is essential for real-world applications. While prior research has explored LLM faithfulness, existing benchmarks suffer from annotation ambiguity, primarily due to the ill-defined boundary of permissible external knowledge in generated outputs. For instance, common sense is often incorporated into responses and labeled as "faithful", yet the acceptable extent of such knowledge remains unspecified, leading to inconsistent annotations. To address this issue, we propose a novel faithfulness annotation framework, which introduces an intermediate category, Out-Dependent, to classify cases where external knowledge is required for verification. Using this framework, we construct VeriGray (Verification with the Gray Zone) -- a new unfaithfulness detection benchmark in summarization. Statistics reveal that even SOTA LLMs, such as GPT-5, exhibit hallucinations ($\sim 6\%$ of sentences) in summarization tasks. Moreover, a substantial proportion ($\sim 8\%$ on average of models) of generated sentences fall into the Out-Dependent category, underscoring the importance of resolving annotation ambiguity in unfaithfulness detection benchmarks. Experiments demonstrate that our benchmark poses significant challenges to multiple baseline methods, indicating considerable room for future improvement.

  Intelligent drug recommendation based on Electronic Health Records (EHRs) is critical for improving for improving the quality and efficiency of clinical decision-making. By leveraging large-scale patient data, drug recommendation systems can assist physicians in selecting the most appropriate medications according to a patient's medical history, diagnoses, laboratory results, and comorbidities. However, the advancement of such systems is significantly hampered by the scarcity of publicly available, real-world EHR datasets, particularly in languages other than English. In this work, we present CDrugRed, a first publicly available Chinese drug recommendation dataset focused on discharge medications for metabolic diseases. The dataset includes 5,894 de-identified records from 3,190 patients, containing comprehensive information such as patient demographics, medical history, clinical course, and discharge diagnoses. We assess the utility of CDrugRed by benchmarking several state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) on the discharge medication recommendation task. Experimental results show that while supervised fine-tuning improves model performance, there remains substantial room for improvement, with the best model achieving the F1 score of 0.5648 and Jaccard score of 0.4477. This result highlights the complexity of the clinical drug recommendation task and establishes CDrugRed as a challenging and valuable resource for developing more robust and accurate drug recommendation systems. The dataset is publicly available to the research community under the data usage agreements atthis https URL.

  _Li Zhang, Jaromir Savelka, Kevin Ashley_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) with extended context windows show promise for complex legal reasoning tasks, yet their ability to understand long legal documents remains insufficiently evaluated. Developing long-context benchmarks that capture realistic, high-stakes tasks remains a significant challenge in the field, as most existing evaluations rely on simplified synthetic tasks that fail to represent the complexity of real-world document understanding. Overruling relationships are foundational to common-law doctrine and commonly found in judicial opinions. They provide a focused and important testbed for long-document legal understanding that closely resembles what legal professionals actually do. We present an assessment of state-of-the-art LLMs on identifying overruling relationships from U.S. Supreme Court cases using a dataset of 236 case pairs. Our evaluation reveals three critical limitations: (1) era sensitivity -- the models show degraded performance on historical cases compared to modern ones, revealing fundamental temporal bias in their training; (2) shallow reasoning -- models rely on shallow logical heuristics rather than deep legal comprehension; and (3) context-dependent reasoning failures -- models produce temporally impossible relationships in complex open-ended tasks despite maintaining basic temporal awareness in simple contexts. Our work contributes a benchmark that addresses the critical gap in realistic long-context evaluation, providing an environment that mirrors the complexity and stakes of actual legal reasoning tasks.

  Many high-stakes applications of AI require forming data-driven hypotheses and making targeted guesses; e.g., in scientific and diagnostic settings. Given limited resources, to what extent do agents based on language models (LMs) act rationally? We develop methods to benchmark and enhance agentic information-seeking, drawing on insights from human behavior. First, we introduce a strategic decision-oriented dialogue task called Collaborative Battleship, in which a partially-informed Captain must balance exploration (asking questions) and action (taking shots), while a fully-informed Spotter must provide accurate answers under an information bottleneck. Compared to human players (N=42), we find that LM agents struggle to ground answers in context, generate informative questions, and select high-value actions. Next, to address these gaps, we develop novel Monte Carlo inference strategies for LMs based on principles from Bayesian Experimental Design (BED). For Spotter agents, our approach boosts accuracy by up to 14.7% absolute over LM-only baselines; for Captain agents, it raises expected information gain (EIG) by up to 0.227 bits (94.2% of the achievable noise ceiling). Combined, these components yield sharper targeting (+0.303-0.374 F1), and enable weaker LMs, such as Llama-4-Scout, to outperform both humans (8% -> 82% win rate) and frontier models (0% -> 67% win rate vs. GPT-5) at ~1% of GPT-5's cost. We replicate these findings on Guess Who? where our methods significantly boost accuracy (+28.3-42.4 p.p.), demonstrating their general applicability for building rational information-seeking agents.

  Understanding and reasoning over tables is a critical capability for many real-world applications. Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise on this task, but current approaches remain limited. Fine-tuning based methods strengthen language reasoning; yet they are prone to arithmetic errors and hallucination. In contrast, tool-based methods enable precise table manipulation but rely on rigid schemas and lack semantic understanding. These complementary drawbacks highlight the need for approaches that integrate robust reasoning with reliable table processing. In this work, we propose Mixture-of-Minds, a multi-agent framework that decomposes table reasoning into three specialized roles: planning, coding, and answering. This design enables each agent to focus on a specific aspect of the task while leveraging code execution for precise table manipulation. Building on this workflow, we introduce a self-improvement training framework that employs Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) rollouts to generate pseudo-gold trajectories and optimize agents with reinforcement learning (RL). Extensive experiments show that Mixture-of-Minds delivers substantial gains, reaching 62.13% on TableBench and surpassing OpenAI-o4-mini-high. These results demonstrate the promise of combining structured multi-agent workflows with RL to advance table understanding.

  In-Context Learning (ICL) enables transformer-based language models to adapt to new tasks by conditioning on demonstration examples. However, traditional example-driven in-context learning lacks explicit modules for knowledge retrieval and transfer at the abstraction level. Inspired by cognitive science, specifically schema theory, which holds that humans interpret new information by activating pre-existing mental frameworks (schemas) to structure understanding, we introduce SCHEMA ACTIVATED IN CONTEXT LEARNING (SA-ICL). This framework extracts the representation of the building blocks of cognition for the reasoning process instilled from prior examples, creating an abstracted schema, a lightweight, structured template of key inferential steps and their relationships, which is then used to augment a model's reasoning process when presented with a novel question. We demonstrate that a broad range of large language models (LLMs) lack the capacity to form and utilize internal schema-based learning representations implicitly, but instead benefit significantly from explicit schema-based scaffolding. Across chemistry and physics questions from the GPQA dataset, our experiments show that SA-ICL consistently boosts performance, up to 36.19 percent, when the single demonstration example is of high quality, which simultaneously reduces reliance on the number of demonstrations and enhances interpretability. SCHEMA ACTIVATED IN CONTEXT LEARNING not only bridges disparate ICL strategies ranging from pattern priming to Chain-of-Thought prompting, but also paves a new path for enhancing human-like reasoning in LLMs.

  Large language models (LLMs) show the promise in supporting scientific research implementation, yet their ability to generate correct and executable code remains limited. Existing works largely adopt one-shot settings, ignoring the iterative and feedback-driven nature of realistic workflows of scientific research development. To address this gap, we present RECODE-H, a benchmark of 102 tasks from research papers and repositories that evaluates LLM agents through multi-turn interactions with LLM-simulated human feedback. It includes structured instructions,unit tests, and a five-level feedback hierarchy to reflect realistic researcher-agent collaboration. We further present ReCodeAgent, a framework that integrates feedback into iterative code generation. Experiments with leading LLMs, including GPT-5, Claude-Sonnet-4, DeepSeek-V3.1, and Gemini 2.5, show substantial performance gains with richer feedback, while also highlighting ongoing challenges in the generation of complex research code. RECODE-H establishes a foundation for developing adaptive, feedback-driven LLM agents in scientific research implementation

  _Zhilong Zhao, Yindi Liu_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Automated content analysis increasingly supports communication research, yet scaling manual coding into computational pipelines raises concerns about measurement reliability and validity. We introduce a Hierarchical Error Correction (HEC) framework that treats model failures as layered measurement errors (knowledge gaps, reasoning limitations, and complexity constraints) and targets the layers that most affect inference. The framework implements a three-phase methodology: systematic error profiling across hierarchical layers, targeted intervention design matched to dominant error sources, and rigorous validation with statistical testing. Evaluating HEC across health communication (medical specialty classification) and political communication (bias detection), and legal tasks, we validate the approach with five diverse large language models. Results show average accuracy gains of 11.2 percentage points (p < .001, McNemar's test) and stable conclusions via reduced systematic misclassification. Cross-model validation demonstrates consistent improvements (range: +6.8 to +14.6pp), with effectiveness concentrated in moderate-to-high baseline tasks (50-85% accuracy). A boundary study reveals diminished returns in very high-baseline (>85%) or precision-matching tasks, establishing applicability limits. We map layered errors to threats to construct and criterion validity and provide a transparent, measurement-first blueprint for diagnosing error profiles, selecting targeted interventions, and reporting reliability/validity evidence alongside accuracy. This applies to automated coding across communication research and the broader social sciences.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reward models (RMs) are crucial for aligning large language models (LLMs) with diverse cultures. Consequently, evaluating their cultural awareness is essential for further advancing global alignment of LLMs. However, existing RM evaluations fall short in assessing cultural awareness due to the scarcity of culturally relevant evaluation datasets. To fill this gap, we propose Cultural Awareness Reward modeling Benchmark (CARB), covering 10 distinct cultures across 4 cultural domains. Our extensive evaluation of state-of-the-art RMs reveals their deficiencies in modeling cultural awareness and demonstrates a positive correlation between performance on CARB and downstream multilingual cultural alignment tasks. Further analysis identifies the spurious correlations within culture-aware reward modeling, wherein RM's scoring relies predominantly on surface-level features rather than authentic cultural nuance understanding. To address these, we propose Think-as-Locals to elicit deeper culturally grounded reasoning from generative RMs via reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards (RLVR) and employ well-designed rewards to ensure accurate preference judgments and high-quality structured evaluation criteria generation. Experimental results validate its efficacy in mitigating spurious features interference and advancing culture-aware reward modeling.

  Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses large language model (LLM) hallucinations by grounding responses in external knowledge, but its effectiveness is compromised by poor-quality retrieved contexts containing irrelevant or noisy information. While existing approaches attempt to improve performance through context selection based on predefined context quality assessment metrics, they show limited gains over standard RAG. We attribute this limitation to their failure in holistically utilizing available information (query, context list, and generator) for comprehensive quality assessment. Inspired by recent advances in data selection, we reconceptualize context quality assessment as an inference-time data valuation problem and introduce the Contextual Influence Value (CI value). This novel metric quantifies context quality by measuring the performance degradation when removing each context from the list, effectively integrating query-aware relevance, list-aware uniqueness, and generator-aware alignment. Moreover, CI value eliminates complex selection hyperparameter tuning by simply retaining contexts with positive CI values. To address practical challenges of label dependency and computational overhead, we develop a parameterized surrogate model for CI value prediction during inference. The model employs a hierarchical architecture that captures both local query-context relevance and global inter-context interactions, trained through oracle CI value supervision and end-to-end generator feedback. Extensive experiments across 8 NLP tasks and multiple LLMs demonstrate that our context selection method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, effectively filtering poor-quality contexts while preserving critical information.

  Large language models (LLMs) store vast amounts of knowledge, which often requires updates to correct factual errors, incorporate newly acquired information, or adapt model behavior. Model editing methods have emerged as efficient solutions for such updates, offering localized and precise knowledge modification at significantly lower computational cost than continual training. In parallel, LLMs are frequently fine-tuned for a wide range of downstream tasks. However, the effect of fine-tuning on previously edited knowledge remains poorly understood. In this work, we systematically investigate how different fine-tuning objectives interact with various model editing techniques. Our findings show that edited knowledge is substantially more susceptible to forgetting during fine-tuning than intrinsic knowledge acquired through pre-training. This analysis highlights a key limitation of current editing approaches and suggests that evaluating edit robustness under downstream fine-tuning is critical for their practical deployment. We further find that knowledge retention can be significantly improved by either augmenting edit knowledge with paraphrases or by freezing layers associated with edited content in fine-tuning stage, offering insight for developing more robust editing algorithms.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We study logical reasoning in language models by asking whether their errors follow established human fallacy patterns. Using the Erotetic Theory of Reasoning (ETR) and its open-source implementation, PyETR, we programmatically generate 383 formally specified reasoning problems and evaluate 38 models. For each response, we judge logical correctness and, when incorrect, whether it matches an ETR-predicted fallacy. Two results stand out: (i) as a capability proxy (Chatbot Arena Elo) increases, a larger share of a model's incorrect answers are ETR-predicted fallacies $(\rho=0.360, p=0.0265)$, while overall correctness on this dataset shows no correlation with capability; (ii) reversing premise order significantly reduces fallacy production for many models, mirroring human order effects. Methodologically, PyETR provides an open-source pipeline for unbounded, synthetic, contamination-resistant reasoning tests linked to a cognitive theory, enabling analyses that focus on error composition rather than error rate.

  Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) integrates external knowledge with Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance factual correctness and mitigate hallucination. However, dense retrievers often become the bottleneck of RAG systems due to their limited parameters compared to LLMs and their inability to perform step-by-step reasoning. While prompt-based iterative RAG attempts to address these limitations, it is constrained by human-designed workflows. To address these limitations, we propose $\textbf{R3-RAG}$, which uses $\textbf{R}$einforcement learning to make the LLM learn how to $\textbf{R}$eason and $\textbf{R}$etrieve step by step, thus retrieving comprehensive external knowledge and leading to correct answers. R3-RAG is divided into two stages. We first use cold start to make the model learn the manner of iteratively interleaving reasoning and retrieval. Then we use reinforcement learning to further harness its ability to better explore the external retrieval environment. Specifically, we propose two rewards for R3-RAG: 1) answer correctness for outcome reward, which judges whether the trajectory leads to a correct answer; 2) relevance-based document verification for process reward, encouraging the model to retrieve documents that are relevant to the user question, through which we can let the model learn how to iteratively reason and retrieve relevant documents to get the correct answer. Experimental results show that R3-RAG significantly outperforms baselines and can transfer well to different retrievers. We release R3-RAG atthis https URL.

  Aligning large language models with human feedback at inference time has received increasing attention due to its flexibility. Existing methods rely on generating multiple responses from the base policy for search using a reward model, which can be considered as searching in a discrete response space. However, these methods struggle to explore informative candidates when the base policy is weak or the candidate set is small, resulting in limited effectiveness. In this paper, to address this problem, we propose Simple Energy Adaptation ($\textbf{SEA}$), a simple yet effective algorithm for inference-time alignment. In contrast to expensive search over the discrete space, SEA directly adapts original responses from the base policy toward the optimal one via gradient-based sampling in continuous latent space. Specifically, SEA formulates inference as an iterative optimization procedure on an energy function over actions in the continuous space defined by the optimal policy, enabling simple and effective alignment. For instance, despite its simplicity, SEA outperforms the second-best baseline with a relative improvement of up to $ \textbf{77.51%}$ on AdvBench and $\textbf{16.36%}$ on MATH.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities as intelligent agents capable of solving complex problems. However, effective planning in scenarios involving dependencies between API or tool calls-particularly in multi-turn conversations-remains a significant challenge. To address this, we introduce T1, a tool-augmented, multi-domain, multi-turn conversational dataset specifically designed to capture and manage inter-tool dependencies across diverse domains. T1 enables rigorous evaluation of agents' ability to coordinate tool use across nine distinct domains (4 single domain and 5 multi-domain) with the help of an integrated caching mechanism for both short- and long-term memory, while supporting dynamic replanning-such as deciding whether to recompute or reuse cached results. Beyond facilitating research on tool use and planning, T1 also serves as a benchmark for evaluating the performance of open-weight and proprietary large language models. We present results powered by T1-Agent, highlighting their ability to plan and reason in complex, tool-dependent scenarios.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large reasoning models (LRMs), such as OpenAI o1 and DeepSeek-R1, have significantly enhanced their reasoning capabilities by generating longer chains of thought, demonstrating outstanding performance across a variety of tasks. However, this performance gain comes at the cost of a substantial increase in redundant reasoning during the generation process, leading to high computational overhead and exacerbating the issue of overthinking. Although numerous existing approaches aim to address the problem of overthinking, they often rely on external interventions. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, Self-Braking Tuning (SBT), which tackles overthinking from the perspective of allowing the model to regulate its own reasoning process, thus eliminating the reliance on external control mechanisms. We construct a set of overthinking identification metrics based on standard answers and design a systematic method to detect redundant reasoning. This method accurately identifies unnecessary steps within the reasoning trajectory and generates training signals for learning self-regulation behaviors. Building on this foundation, we develop a complete strategy for constructing data with adaptive reasoning lengths and introduce an innovative braking prompt mechanism that enables the model to naturally learn when to terminate reasoning at an appropriate point. Experiments across mathematical benchmarks (AIME, AMC, MATH500, GSM8K) demonstrate that our method reduces token consumption by up to 60% while maintaining comparable accuracy to unconstrained models.

  Large language models (LLMs) such as DeepSeek-R1 have achieved remarkable performance across diverse reasoning tasks. To uncover the principles that govern their behaviour, we introduce the Electronic Circuit Principles (ECP), which maps inference-time learning (ITL) onto a semantic electromotive force and inference-time reasoning (ITR) onto a resistive network governed by Ohm's and Faraday's laws. This circuit-based modelling yields closed-form predictions of task performance and reveals how modular prompt components interact to shape accuracy. We validated ECP on 70,000 samples spanning 350 reasoning tasks and 9 advanced LLMs, observing a about 60% improvement in Pearson correlation relative to the conventional inference-time scaling law. Moreover, ECP explains the efficacy of 15 established prompting strategies and directs the development of new modular interventions that exceed the median score of the top 80% of participants in both the International Olympiad in Informatics and the International Mathematical Olympiad. By grounding LLM reasoning in electronic-circuit principles, ECP provides a rigorous framework for predicting performance and optimising modular components.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This survey provides an overview of the challenges of misspellings in natural language processing (NLP). While often unintentional, misspellings have become ubiquitous in digital communication, especially with the proliferation of Web 2.0, user-generated content, and informal text mediums such as social media, blogs, and forums. Even if humans can generally interpret misspelled text, NLP models frequently struggle to handle it: this causes a decline in performance in common tasks like text classification and machine translation. In this paper, we reconstruct a history of misspellings as a scientific problem. We then discuss the latest advancements to address the challenge of misspellings in NLP. Main strategies to mitigate the effect of misspellings include data augmentation, double step, character-order agnostic, and tuple-based methods, among others. This survey also examines dedicated data challenges and competitions to spur progress in the field. Critical safety and ethical concerns are also examined, for example, the voluntary use of misspellings to inject malicious messages and hate speech on social networks. Furthermore, the survey explores psycholinguistic perspectives on how humans process misspellings, potentially informing innovative computational techniques for text normalization and representation. Finally, the misspelling-related challenges and opportunities associated with modern large language models are also analyzed, including benchmarks, datasets, and performances of the most prominent language models against misspellings. This survey aims to be an exhaustive resource for researchers seeking to mitigate the impact of misspellings in the rapidly evolving landscape of NLP.

  In the domain of complex reasoning tasks, such as mathematical reasoning, recent advancements have proposed the use of Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to suppress output of dispreferred responses, thereby enhancing the long-chain reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). To this end, these studies employed LLMs to generate preference trees via Tree-of-thoughts (ToT) and sample the paired preference responses required by the DPO algorithm. However, the DPO algorithm based on binary preference optimization is unable to learn multiple responses with varying degrees of preference/dispreference that provided by the preference trees, resulting in incomplete preference learning. In this work, we introduce Tree Preference Optimization (TPO), that does not sample paired preference responses from the preference tree; instead, it directly learns from the entire preference tree during the fine-tuning. Specifically, TPO formulates the language model alignment as a Preference List Ranking problem, where the policy can potentially learn more effectively from a ranked preference list of responses given the prompt. In addition, to further assist LLMs in identifying discriminative steps within long-chain reasoning and increase the relative reward margin in the preference list, TPO utilizes Adaptive Step Reward to adjust the reward values of each step in trajectory for performing fine-grained preference optimization. We carry out extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning tasks to evaluate TPO. The experimental results indicate that TPO consistently outperforms DPO across five public large language models on four datasets. Our code is publicly available atthis https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated outstanding reasoning capabilities on mathematical and coding tasks. However, their application to financial tasks-especially the most fundamental task of stock movement prediction-remains underexplored. We study a three-class classification problem (up, hold, down) and, by analyzing existing reasoning responses, observe that: (1) LLMs follow analysts' opinions rather than exhibit a systematic, independent analytical logic (CoTs). (2) LLMs list summaries from different sources without weighing adversarial evidence, yet such counterevidence is crucial for reliable prediction. It shows that the model does not make good use of its reasoning ability to complete the task. To address this, we propose Reflective Evidence Tuning (RETuning), a cold-start method prior to reinforcement learning, to enhance prediction ability. While generating CoT, RETuning encourages dynamically constructing an analytical framework from diverse information sources, organizing and scoring evidence for price up or down based on that framework-rather than on contextual viewpoints-and finally reflecting to derive the prediction. This approach maximally aligns the model with its learned analytical framework, ensuring independent logical reasoning and reducing undue influence from context. We also build a large-scale dataset spanning all of 2024 for 5,123 A-share stocks, with long contexts (32K tokens) and over 200K samples. In addition to price and news, it incorporates analysts' opinions, quantitative reports, fundamental data, macroeconomic indicators, and similar stocks. Experiments show that RETuning successfully unlocks the model's reasoning ability in the financial domain. Inference-time scaling still works even after 6 months or on out-of-distribution stocks, since the models gain valuable insights about stock movement prediction.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) display notable variation in multilingual behavior, yet the role of genealogical language structure in shaping this variation remains underexplored. In this paper, we investigate whether LLMs exhibit sensitivity to linguistic genera by extending prior analyses on the MultiQ dataset. We first check if models prefer to switch to genealogically related languages when prompt language fidelity is not maintained. Next, we investigate whether knowledge consistency is better preserved within than across genera. We show that genus-level effects are present but strongly conditioned by training resource availability. We further observe distinct multilingual strategies across LLMs families. Our findings suggest that LLMs encode aspects of genus-level structure, but training data imbalances remain the primary factor shaping their multilingual performance.

  Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) integrates external knowledge to mitigate hallucinations, yet models often generate outputs inconsistent with retrieved content. Accurate hallucination detection requires disentangling the contributions of external context and parametric knowledge, which prior methods typically conflate. We investigate the mechanisms underlying RAG hallucinations and find they arise when later-layer FFN modules disproportionately inject parametric knowledge into the residual stream. To address this, we explore a mechanistic detection approach based on external context scores and parametric knowledge scores. Using Qwen3-0.6b, we compute these scores across layers and attention heads and train regression-based classifiers to predict hallucinations. Our method is evaluated against state-of-the-art LLMs (GPT-5, GPT-4.1) and detection baselines (RAGAS, TruLens, RefChecker). Furthermore, classifiers trained on Qwen3-0.6b signals generalize to GPT-4.1-mini responses, demonstrating the potential of proxy-model evaluation. Our results highlight mechanistic signals as efficient, generalizable predictors for hallucination detection in RAG systems.

  Recent advances in diffusion language models (DLMs) have presented a promising alternative to traditional autoregressive large language models (LLMs). However, DLMs still lag behind LLMs in reasoning performance, especially as the number of denoising steps decreases. Our analysis reveals that this shortcoming arises primarily from the independent generation of masked tokens across denoising steps, which fails to capture the token correlation. In this paper, we define two types of token correlation: intra-sequence correlation and inter-sequence correlation, and demonstrate that enhancing these correlations improves reasoning performance. To this end, we propose a Multi-Reward Optimization (MRO) approach, which encourages DLMs to consider the token correlation during the denoising process. More specifically, our MRO approach leverages test-time scaling, reject sampling, and reinforcement learning to directly optimize the token correlation with multiple elaborate rewards. Additionally, we introduce group step and importance sampling strategies to mitigate reward variance and enhance sampling efficiency. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that MRO not only improves reasoning performance but also achieves significant sampling speedups while maintaining high performance on reasoning benchmarks.

  Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated high performance on tasks expressed in natural language, particularly in zero- or few-shot settings. These are typically framed as supervised (e.g., classification) or unsupervised (e.g., clustering) problems. However, limited work evaluates LLMs as agents in reinforcement learning (RL) tasks (e.g., playing games), where learning occurs through interaction with an environment and a reward system. While prior work focused on representing tasks that rely on a language representation, we study structured, non-linguistic reasoning - such as interpreting positions in a grid world. We therefore introduce PARL (Prompt-based Agent for Reinforcement Learning), a method that uses LLMs as RL agents through prompting, without any fine-tuning. PARL encodes actions, states, and rewards in the prompt, enabling the model to learn through trial-and-error interaction. We evaluate PARL on three standard RL tasks that do not entirely rely on natural language. We show that it can match or outperform traditional RL agents in simple environments by leveraging pretrained knowledge. However, we identify performance limitations in tasks that require complex mathematical operations or decoding states and actions.

  The availability of LLM benchmarks for the Estonian language is limited, and a comprehensive evaluation comparing the performance of different LLMs on Estonian tasks has yet to be conducted. We introduce a new benchmark for evaluating LLMs in Estonian, based on seven diverse datasets. These datasets assess general and domain-specific knowledge, understanding of Estonian grammar and vocabulary, summarization abilities, contextual comprehension, and more. The datasets are all generated from native Estonian sources without using machine translation. We compare the performance of base models, instruction-tuned open-source models, and commercial models. Our evaluation includes 6 base models and 26 instruction-tuned models. To assess the results, we employ both human evaluation and LLM-as-a-judge methods. Human evaluation scores showed moderate to high correlation with benchmark evaluations, depending on the dataset. Claude 3.7 Sonnet, used as an LLM judge, demonstrated strong alignment with human ratings, indicating that top-performing LLMs can effectively support the evaluation of Estonian-language models.

  Large language models (LLMs) excel at factual recall yet still propagate stale or incorrect knowledge. In-context knowledge editing offers a gradient-free remedy suitable for black-box APIs, but current editors rely on static demonstration sets chosen by surface-level similarity, leading to two persistent obstacles: (i) a quantity-quality trade-off, and (ii) lack of adaptivity to task difficulty. We address these issues by dynamically selecting supporting demonstrations according to their utility for the edit. We propose Dynamic Retriever for In-Context Knowledge Editing (DR-IKE), a lightweight framework that (1) trains a BERT retriever with REINFORCE to rank demonstrations by editing reward, and (2) employs a learnable threshold to prune low-value examples, shortening the prompt when the edit is easy and expanding it when the task is hard. DR-IKE performs editing without modifying model weights, relying solely on forward passes for compatibility with black-box LLMs. On the COUNTERFACT benchmark, it improves edit success by up to 17.1%, reduces latency by 41.6%, and preserves accuracy on unrelated queries, demonstrating scalable and adaptive knowledge editing.

  A major concern when deploying LLMs in accuracy-critical domains such as sports reporting is that the generated text may not faithfully reflect the input data. We quantify how input structure affects hallucinations and other factual errors in LLM-generated summaries of NBA play-by-play data, across three formats: row-structured, JSON and unstructured. We manually annotated 3,312 factual errors across 180 game summaries produced by two models, Llama-3.1-70B and Qwen2.5-72B. Input structure has a strong effect: JSON input reduces error rates by 69% for Llama and 65% for Qwen compared to unstructured input, while row-structured input reduces errors by 54% for Llama and 51% for Qwen. A two-way repeated measures ANOVA shows that input structure accounts for over 80% of the variance in error rates, with Tukey HSD post hoc tests confirming statistically significant differences between all input formats.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting has emerged as a common technique for enhancing the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). While extended reasoning can boost accuracy on complex tasks, it is often unnecessary and substantially increases token usage, limiting the practicality of reasoning models in many scenarios. Recent models, such as GPT-OSS and Qwen3, expose controls that enable users to adjust the length of CoT or determine whether it is used at all. Yet, it remains unclear when CoT should be used: on some tasks it improves performance, while on others it provides little benefit or even harms performance. We address this challenge with confidence-gated CoT, where a model invokes reasoning only when confidence in its direct answer is low. To this end, we present the first systematic study of training-free confidence estimation methods for CoT gating. Specifically, we evaluate four training-free confidence estimation methods and compare them to a random baseline and an oracle that always knows when CoT is needed. Through extensive experiments, we show that existing training-free confidence measures can reduce redundant CoT and outperform randomly invoked CoT. However, the utility of individual confidence measures is inconsistent, varying with both the dataset and the model, underscoring the difficulty of deploying confidence-gated CoT in practice. By analysing both strengths and failure modes, our study highlights the potential and limitations of current methods and paves the way toward more reliable adaptive gating of CoT.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present Irish-BLiMP (Irish Benchmark of Linguistic Minimal Pairs), the first dataset and framework designed for fine-grained evaluation of linguistic competence in the Irish language, an endangered language. Drawing on a variety of linguistic literature and grammar reference works, we manually constructed and reviewed 1020 minimal pairs across a taxonomy of 11 linguistic features, through a team of fluent Irish speakers. We evaluate both existing Large Language Models (LLMs) and fluent human participants on their syntactic knowledge of Irish. Our findings show that humans outperform all models across all linguistic features, achieving 16.6% higher accuracy on average. Moreover, a substantial performance gap of 18.1% persists between open- and closed-source LLMs, with even the strongest model (gpt-5) reaching only 73.5% accuracy compared to 90.1% by human. Interestingly, human participants and models struggle on different aspects of Irish grammar, thus highlighting a difference in representation learned by the models. Overall, Irish-BLiMP provides the first systematic framework for evaluating the grammatical competence of LLMs in Irish and offers a valuable benchmark for advancing research on linguistic understanding in low-resource languages.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Aligning large language models with human preferences is critical for creating reliable and controllable AI systems. A human preference can be visualized as a high-dimensional vector where different directions represent trade-offs between desired attributes (e.g., helpfulness vs. verbosity). Yet, because the training data often reflects dominant, average preferences, LLMs tend to perform well on common requests but fall short in specific, individual needs. This mismatch creates a preference coverage gap. Existing methods often address this through costly retraining, which may not be generalized to the full spectrum of diverse preferences. This brittleness means that when a user's request reflects a nuanced preference deviating from the training data's central tendency, model performance can degrade unpredictably. To address this challenge, we introduce Robust Preference Selection (RPS), a post-hoc, training-free method by leveraging directional neighborhood consensus. Instead of forcing a model to generate a response from a single, highly specific preference, RPS samples multiple responses from a local neighborhood of related preferences to create a superior candidate pool. It then selects the response that best aligns with the user's original intent. We provide a theoretical framework showing our neighborhood generation strategy is provably superior to a strong baseline that also samples multiple candidates. Comprehensive experiments across three distinct alignment paradigms (DPA, DPO, and SFT) demonstrate that RPS consistently improves robustness against this baseline, achieving win rates of up to 69% on challenging preferences from under-represented regions of the space without any model retraining. Our work presents a practical, theoretically-grounded solution for enhancing the reliability of preference-aligned models.

  Chain-of-Thought (CoT) is widely applied to enhance the LLM capability in math, coding and reasoning tasks. However, its performance is limited for open-domain tasks, when there are no clearly defined reasoning steps or logical transitions. To mitigate such challenges, we propose a new prompt-based paradigm called Chain of Conceptual Thoughts (CoCT), which suggests the LLM first to produce the tag of concepts, then complete the detailed content following the concept. To encourage this hierarchical way of thinking, we implement the concepts with emotions, strategies and topics. We experiment with this paradigm in daily and emotional support conversations, covering tasks with both in-domain and out-of-domain concept settings. Automatic, human, and LLM-based evaluations reveal that CoCT surpasses several prompt-based baselines such as self-refine, ECoT, SoT and RAG, suggesting a potential solution of LLM prompting paradigm for a wider scope of tasks.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The remarkable success of Chain-of-Thought (CoT), which enhances performance by scaling generation steps at test-time, inspires us to ask: can we leverage a similar scaling of computational steps during pretraining to improve the generation of each individual token? To address this, we propose a novel pre-training methodology: Pretraining Language Models with Latent Thoughts (PonderLM-2). Our approach pretrains a language model (LM) to first generate an intermediate latent thought-the last hidden state of the current position-which is then used as input to predict the actual subsequent token. This additional computational step enables the LM to refine its prediction within unconstrained continuous space. Our experiments demonstrate that, at an identical inference cost, a LM that generates one additional latent thought per token outperforms a standard model with double the parameters. For instance, our PonderLM-2-Pythia-1.4B, pretrained on 300B tokens from the Pile, significantly surpasses the vanilla Pythia-2.8B trained on the same data on both language modeling and a range of general downstream tasks. Furthermore, increasing the number of latent thoughts generated before each actual token-forming a chain analogous to CoT-consistently improves the model's performance.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Medical Lay Language Generation (MLLG) plays a vital role in improving the accessibility of complex scientific content for broader audiences. Recent literature to MLLG commonly employ parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) using paired expert-lay language datasets. However, LoRA struggles with the challenges posed by multi-source heterogeneous MLLG datasets. Specifically, through a series of exploratory experiments, we reveal that standard LoRA fail to meet the requirement for semantic fidelity and diverse lay-style generation in MLLG task. To address these limitations, we propose Magical, an asymmetric LoRA architecture tailored for MLLG under heterogeneous data scenarios. Magical employs a shared matrix $A$ for abstractive summarization, along with multiple isolated matrices $B$ for diverse lay-style generation. To preserve semantic fidelity during the lay language generation process, Magical introduces a Semantic Invariance Constraint to mitigate semantic subspace shifts on matrix $A$. Furthermore, to better adapt to diverse lay-style generation, Magical incorporates the Recommendation-guided Switch, an externally interface to prompt the LLM to switch between different matrices $B$. Experimental results on three real-world lay language generation datasets demonstrate that Magical consistently outperforms prompt-based methods, vanilla LoRA, and its recent variants, while also reducing trainable parameters by 31.66%.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision-Language Models (VLMs) generate discourse-level, multi-sentence visual descriptions, challenging text scene graph parsers built for single-sentence caption-to-graph mapping. Current approaches typically merge sentence-level parsing outputs for discourse input, often missing phenomena like cross-sentence coreference, resulting in fragmented graphs and degraded downstream VLM task performance. We introduce a new task, Discourse-level text Scene Graph parsing (DiscoSG), and release DiscoSG-DS, a dataset of 400 expert-annotated and 8,430 synthesised multi-sentence caption-graph pairs. Each caption averages 9 sentences, and each graph contains at least 3 times more triples than those in existing datasets.Fine-tuning GPT-4o on DiscoSG-DS yields over 40% higher SPICE metric than the best sentence-merging baseline. However, its high inference cost and licensing restrict open-source use. Smaller fine-tuned open-source models (e.g., Flan-T5) perform well on simpler graphs yet degrade on denser, more complex graphs. To bridge this gap, we introduce DiscoSG-Refiner, a lightweight open-source parser that drafts a seed graph and iteratively refines it with a novel learned graph-editing model, achieving 30% higher SPICE than the baseline while delivering 86 times faster inference than GPT-4o. It generalises from simple to dense graphs, thereby consistently improving downstream VLM tasks, including discourse-level caption evaluation and hallucination detection, outperforming alternative open-source parsers.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant improvements in contextual understanding. However, their ability to attend to truly critical information during long-context reasoning and generation still falls behind the pace. Specifically, our preliminary experiments reveal that certain distracting patterns can misdirect the model's attention during inference, and removing these patterns substantially improves reasoning accuracy and generation quality. We attribute this phenomenon to spurious correlations in the training data, which obstruct the model's capacity to infer authentic causal instruction-response relationships. This phenomenon may induce redundant reasoning processes, potentially resulting in significant inference overhead and, more critically, the generation of erroneous or suboptimal responses. To mitigate this, we introduce a two-stage framework called Learning to Focus (LeaF) leveraging intervention-based inference to disentangle confounding factors. In the first stage, LeaF employs gradient-based comparisons with an advanced teacher to automatically identify confounding tokens based on causal relationships in the training corpus. Then, in the second stage, it prunes these tokens during distillation to enact intervention, aligning the student's attention with the teacher's focus distribution on truly critical context tokens. Experimental results demonstrate that LeaF not only achieves an absolute improvement in various mathematical reasoning, code generation and multi-hop question answering benchmarks but also effectively suppresses attention to confounding tokens during inference, yielding a more interpretable and reliable reasoning model.

  The capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) are routinely evaluated by other LLMs trained to predict human preferences. This framework--known as LLM-as-a-judge--is highly scalable and relatively low cost. However, it is also vulnerable to malicious exploitation, as LLM responses can be tuned to overfit the preferences of the judge. Previous work shows that the answers generated by a candidate-LLM can be edited post hoc to maximise the score assigned to them by a judge-LLM. In this study, we adopt a different approach and use the signal provided by judge-LLMs as a reward to adversarially tune models that generate text preambles designed to boost downstream performance. We find that frozen LLMs pipelined with these models attain higher LLM-evaluation scores than existing frameworks. Crucially, unlike other frameworks which intervene directly on the model's response, our method is virtually undetectable. We also demonstrate that the effectiveness of the tuned preamble generator transfers when the candidate-LLM and the judge-LLM are replaced with models that are not used during training. These findings raise important questions about the design of more reliable LLM-as-a-judge evaluation settings. They also demonstrate that human preferences can be reverse engineered effectively, by pipelining LLMs to optimise upstream preambles via reinforcement learning--an approach that could find future applications in diverse tasks and domains beyond adversarial attacks.

  Recent reasoning-focused language models achieve high accuracy by generating lengthy intermediate reasoning paths before producing final answers. While this approach is effective in solving problems that require logical thinking, long reasoning paths significantly increase memory usage and reduce throughput of token generation, limiting the practical deployment of such models. We propose Reasoning Path Compression (RPC), a training-free method that accelerates inference by leveraging the semantic sparsity of reasoning paths. RPC periodically compresses the KV cache by retaining cache entries that receive high importance score, which are computed using a selector window composed of recently generated queries. Experiments show that RPC improves generation throughput of QwQ-32B by up to 1.60$\times$ compared to the inference with full KV cache, with an accuracy drop of 1.2\% on the AIME 2024 benchmark. Our findings demonstrate that semantic sparsity in reasoning traces can be effectively exploited for compression, offering a practical path toward efficient deployment of reasoning LLMs. Our code is available atthis https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Autoregressive decoding inherently limits the inference throughput of Large Language Model (LLM) due to its sequential dependency. Speculative decoding mitigates this by verifying multiple predicted tokens in parallel, but its efficiency remains constrained by what we identify as verification heterogeneity -- the uneven difficulty of verifying different speculative candidates. In practice, a small subset of high-confidence predictions accounts for most successful verifications, yet existing methods treat all candidates uniformly, leading to redundant computation. We present HeteroSpec, a heterogeneity-adaptive speculative decoding framework that allocates verification effort in proportion to candidate uncertainty. HeteroSpec estimates verification complexity using a lightweight entropy-based quantifier, partitions candidates via a data-driven stratification policy, and dynamically tunes speculative depth and pruning thresholds through coordinated optimization. Across five benchmarks and four LLMs, HeteroSpec delivers an average 4.24$\times$ decoding speedup over state-of-the-art methods such as EAGLE-3, while preserving exact output distributions. Crucially, HeteroSpec requires no model retraining and remains compatible with other inference optimizations, making it a practical direction for improving speculative decoding efficiency.

  Measuring scientific paper innovation is both important and challenging. Existing content-based methods often overlook the full-paper context, fail to capture the full scope of innovation, and lack generalization. We propose HSPIM, a hierarchical and training-free framework based on large language models (LLMs). It introduces a Paper-to-Sections-to-QAs decomposition to assess innovation. We segment the text by section titles and use zero-shot LLM prompting to implement section classification, question-answering (QA) augmentation, and weighted innovation scoring. The generated QA pair focuses on section-level innovation and serves as additional context to improve the LLM scoring. For each chunk, the LLM outputs a novelty score and a confidence score. We use confidence scores as weights to aggregate novelty scores into a paper-level innovation score. To further improve performance, we propose a two-layer question structure consisting of common and section-specific questions, and apply a genetic algorithm to optimize the question-prompt combinations. Furthermore, under the fine-grained structure of innovation, we extend HSPIM to an HSPIM$^+$ that generates novelty, contribution, and feasibility scores with respective confidence scores. Comprehensive experiments on scientific conference paper datasets show that HSPIM outperforms baseline methods in effectiveness, generalization, and interpretability.

  Distillation has shown remarkable success in transferring knowledge from a Large Language Model (LLM) teacher to a student LLM. However, current distillation methods require similar tokenizers between the teacher and the student, restricting their applicability to only a small subset of teacher-student pairs. In this work, we develop a principled cross-tokenizer distillation method to solve this crucial deficiency. Our method is the first to enable effective distillation across fundamentally different tokenizers, while also substantially outperforming prior methods in all other cases. We verify the efficacy of our method on three distinct use cases. First, we show that viewing tokenizer transfer as self-distillation enables unprecedentedly effective transfer across tokenizers, including rapid transfer of subword models to the byte-level. Transferring different models to the same tokenizer also enables ensembling to boost performance. Secondly, we distil a large maths-specialised LLM into a small general-purpose model with a different tokenizer, achieving competitive maths problem-solving performance. Thirdly, we use our method to train state-of-the-art embedding prediction hypernetworks for training-free tokenizer transfer. Our results unlock an expanded range of teacher-student pairs for distillation, enabling new ways to adapt and enhance interaction between LLMs.

  The rapid development of multilingual large language models (LLMs) highlights the need for high-quality, diverse, and well-curated multilingual datasets. In this paper, we introduce DCAD-2000 (Data Cleaning as Anomaly Detection), a large-scale multilingual corpus constructed from newly extracted Common Crawl data and existing multilingual sources. DCAD-2000 covers 2,282 languages, 46.72TB of text, and 8.63 billion documents, spanning 155 high- and medium-resource languages and 159 writing scripts. To overcome the limitations of existing data cleaning approaches, which rely on manually designed heuristic thresholds, we reframe data cleaning as an anomaly detection problem. This dynamic filtering paradigm substantially improves data quality by automatically identifying and removing noisy or anomalous content. By fine-tuning LLMs on DCAD-2000, we demonstrate notable improvements in data quality, robustness of the cleaning pipeline, and downstream performance, particularly for low-resource languages across multiple multilingual benchmarks.

  Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled the automatic generation of executable code for task planning and control in embodied agents such as robots, demonstrating the potential of LLM-based embodied intelligence. However, these LLM-based code-as-policies approaches often suffer from limited environmental grounding, particularly in dynamic or partially observable settings, leading to suboptimal task success rates due to incorrect or incomplete code generation. In this work, we propose a neuro-symbolic embodied task planning framework that incorporates explicit symbolic verification and interactive validation processes during code generation. In the validation phase, the framework generates exploratory code that actively interacts with the environment to acquire missing observations while preserving task-relevant states. This integrated process enhances the grounding of generated code, resulting in improved task reliability and success rates in complex environments. We evaluate our framework on RLBench and in real-world settings across dynamic, partially observable scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework improves task success rates by 46.2% over Code-as-Policies baselines and attains over 86.8% executability of task-relevant actions, thereby enhancing the reliability of task planning in dynamic environments.

  Chest X-ray (CXR) plays a pivotal role in clinical diagnosis, and a variety of task-specific and foundation models have been developed for automatic CXR interpretation. However, these models often struggle to adapt to new diagnostic tasks and complex reasoning scenarios. Recently, LLM-based agent models have emerged as a promising paradigm for CXR analysis, enhancing model's capability through tool coordination, multi-step reasoning, and team collaboration, etc. However, existing agents often rely on a single diagnostic pipeline and lack mechanisms for assessing tools' reliability, limiting their adaptability and credibility. To this end, we propose CXRAgent, a director-orchestrated, multi-stage agent for CXR interpretation, where a central director coordinates the following stages: (1) Tool Invocation: The agent strategically orchestrates a set of CXR-analysis tools, with outputs normalized and verified by the Evidence-driven Validator (EDV), which grounds diagnostic outputs with visual evidence to support reliable downstream diagnosis; (2) Diagnostic Planning: Guided by task requirements and intermediate findings, the agent formulates a targeted diagnostic plan. It then assembles an expert team accordingly, defining member roles and coordinating their interactions to enable adaptive and collaborative reasoning; (3) Collaborative Decision-making: The agent integrates insights from the expert team with accumulated contextual memories, synthesizing them into an evidence-backed diagnostic conclusion. Experiments on various CXR interpretation tasks show that CXRAgent delivers strong performance, providing visual evidence and generalizes well to clinical tasks of different complexity.

  This study introduces a human-in-the-loop pipeline that converts unscaled, hand-drawn floor plan sketches into semantically consistent 3D BIM models. The workflow leverages multimodal large language models (MLLMs) within a multi-agent framework, combining perceptual extraction, human feedback, schema validation, and automated BIM scripting. Initially, sketches are iteratively refined into a structured JSON layout of walls, doors, and windows. Later, these layouts are transformed into executable scripts that generate 3D BIM models. Experiments on ten diverse floor plans demonstrate strong convergence: openings (doors, windows) are captured with high reliability in the initial pass, while wall detection begins around 83% and achieves near-perfect alignment after a few feedback iterations. Across all categories, precision, recall, and F1 scores remain above 0.83, and geometric errors (RMSE, MAE) progressively decrease to zero through feedback corrections. This study demonstrates how MLLM-driven multi-agent reasoning can make BIM creation accessible to both experts and non-experts using only freehand sketches.

  Harmonizing medication data across Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems is a persistent barrier to monitoring medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD). In heterogeneous EHR systems, key prescription attributes are scattered across differently formatted fields and freetext notes. We present a practical framework that customizes open source large language models (LLMs), including Llama, Qwen, Gemma, and MedGemma, to extract a unified set of MOUD prescription attributes (prescription date, drug name, duration, total quantity, daily quantity, and refills) from heterogeneous, site specific data and compute a standardized metric of medication coverage, \emph{MOUD days}, per patient. Our pipeline processes records directly in a fixed JSON schema, followed by lightweight normalization and cross-field consistency checks. We evaluate the system on prescription level EHR data from five clinics in a national OUD study (25{,}605 records from 1{,}257 patients), using a previously annotated benchmark of 10{,}369 records (776 patients) as the ground truth. Performance is reported as coverage (share of records with a valid, matchable output) and record-level exact-match accuracy. Larger models perform best overall: Qwen2.5-32B achieves \textbf{93.4\%} coverage with \textbf{93.0\%} exact-match accuracy across clinics, and MedGemma-27B attains \textbf{93.1\%}/\textbf{92.2\%}. A brief error review highlights three common issues and fixes: imputing missing dosage fields using within-drug norms, handling monthly/weekly injectables (e.g., Vivitrol) by setting duration from the documented schedule, and adding unit checks to prevent mass units (e.g., ``250 g'') from being misread as daily counts. By removing brittle, site-specific ETL and supporting local, privacy-preserving deployment, this approach enables consistent cross-site analyses of MOUD exposure, adherence, and retention in real-world settings.

  The lack of a concrete definition for Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) obscures the gap between today's specialized AI and human-level cognition. This paper introduces a quantifiable framework to address this, defining AGI as matching the cognitive versatility and proficiency of a well-educated adult. To operationalize this, we ground our methodology in Cattell-Horn-Carroll theory, the most empirically validated model of human cognition. The framework dissects general intelligence into ten core cognitive domains-including reasoning, memory, and perception-and adapts established human psychometric batteries to evaluate AI systems. Application of this framework reveals a highly "jagged" cognitive profile in contemporary models. While proficient in knowledge-intensive domains, current AI systems have critical deficits in foundational cognitive machinery, particularly long-term memory storage. The resulting AGI scores (e.g., GPT-4 at 27%, GPT-5 at 57%) concretely quantify both rapid progress and the substantial gap remaining before AGI.

Despite its similarities to compositional generalization (CG), combinatorial creativity (CC) is an open-ended ability. Instead of evaluating for accuracy or correctness against fixed targets, which would contradict the open-ended nature of CC, we propose a theoretical framework and algorithmic task for evaluating outputs by their degrees of novelty and utility. From here, we make several important empirical contributions: (1) We obtain the first insights into the scaling behavior of creativity for LLMs. (2) We discover that, for fixed compute budgets, there exist optimal model depths and widths for creative ability. (3) We find that the ideation-execution gap, whereby LLMs excel at generating novel scientific ideas but struggle to ensure their practical feasibility, may be explained by a more fundamental novelty-utility tradeoff characteristic of creativity algorithms in general. Importantly, this tradeoff remains persistent even at scale, casting doubt on the long-term creative potential of LLMs in their current form. Together, our conceptual framework and empirical findings provide a foundation for understanding and improving creativity in modern AI models, bridging the gap between human and machine intelligence.

  In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in various artificial intelligence problems. However, they fail to plan reliably, even when prompted with a detailed definition of the planning task. Attempts to improve their planning capabilities, such as chain-of-thought prompting, fine-tuning, and explicit "reasoning" still yield incorrect plans and usually fail to generalize to larger tasks. In this paper, we show how to use LLMs to generate correct plans, even for out-of-distribution tasks of increasing size. For a given planning domain, we ask an LLM to generate several domain-dependent heuristic functions in the form of Python code, evaluate them on a set of training tasks within a greedy best-first search, and choose the strongest one. The resulting LLM-generated heuristics solve many more unseen test tasks than state-of-the-art domain-independent heuristics for classical planning. They are even competitive with the strongest learning algorithm for domain-dependent planning. These findings are especially remarkable given that our proof-of-concept implementation is based on an unoptimized Python planner and the baselines all build upon highly optimized C++ code. In some domains, the LLM-generated heuristics expand fewer states than the baselines, revealing that they are not only efficiently computable, but sometimes even more informative than the state-of-the-art heuristics. Overall, our results show that sampling a set of planning heuristic function programs can significantly improve the planning capabilities of LLMs.

  AI agents built on foundation models hold enormous promise. Current practice, however, focuses on a one-task-one-agent approach, which not only falls short of scalability and generality, but also faces practical limitations from black-box autoregressive reasoning, where decisions unfold token by token without explicit simulation or counterfactual evaluation of outcomes. Humans, on the other hand, reason and plan by mentally simulating the consequences of actions within an internal model of the world -- a capability that supports flexible, goal-directed behavior across diverse contexts. Moving towards a more general and powerful AI agent, we introduce SimuRA, a goal-oriented architecture for generalized agentic reasoning. Based on a principled formulation of an optimal agent in any general environment, SimuRA addresses the limitations of black-box autoregressive reasoning by incorporating the world model for planning via simulation. Our prototype world model is implemented using LLMs as a substrate, leveraging the natural language as a discrete, hierarchical representation grounded in concepts for planning, while remaining model-agnostic. On complex web-browsing tasks such as flight search, SimuRA improves the success rate from 0% to 32.2% compared to a representative open-web agent baseline. Across tasks, world-model-based planning achieves up to 124% higher task completion rates than a matched black-box autoregressive baseline, demonstrating the advantages of simulative reasoning. We release ReasonerAgent-Web, a web-browsing agent built on SimuRA, as an open-source research demo.

  In open-ended domains like art, autonomous agents must generate ideas that are both original and internally coherent, yet current Large Language Models (LLMs) either default to familiar cultural patterns or sacrifice coherence when pushed toward novelty. We address this by introducing the Cultural Alien Sampler (CAS), a concept-selection method that explicitly separates compositional fit from cultural typicality. CAS uses two GPT-2 models fine-tuned on WikiArt concepts: a Concept Coherence Model that scores whether concepts plausibly co-occur within artworks, and a Cultural Context Model that estimates how typical those combinations are within individual artists' bodies of work. CAS targets combinations that are high in coherence and low in typicality, yielding ideas that maintain internal consistency while deviating from learned conventions and embedded cultural context. In a human evaluation (N = 100), our approach outperforms random selection and GPT-4o baselines and achieves performance comparable to human art students in both perceived originality and harmony. Additionally, a quantitative study shows that our method produces more diverse outputs and explores a broader conceptual space than its GPT-4o counterpart, demonstrating that artificial cultural alienness can unlock creative potential in autonomous agents.

  _Li Zhang, Kevin D. Ashley_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly explored for legal argument generation, yet they pose significant risks of manipulation through hallucination and ungrounded persuasion, and often fail to utilize provided factual bases effectively or abstain when arguments are untenable. This paper introduces a novel reflective multi-agent method designed to address these challenges in the context of legally compliant persuasion. Our approach employs specialized agents (factor analyst and argument polisher) in an iterative refinement process to generate 3-ply legal arguments (plaintiff, defendant, rebuttal). We evaluate reflective multi-agent against single-agent, enhanced-prompt single-agent, and non-reflective multi-agent baselines using four diverse LLMs (GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, Llama-4-Maverick-17b-128e, Llama-4-Scout-17b-16e) across three legal scenarios: "arguable", "mismatched", and "non-arguable". Results demonstrate that the reflective multi-agent approach excels at successful abstention by preventing generation when arguments cannot be grounded, improves hallucination accuracy by reducing fabricated and misattributed factors and enhances factor utilization recall by better using the provided case facts. These findings suggest that structured reflection within a multi-agent framework offers a robust method for fostering ethical persuasion and mitigating manipulation in LLM-based legal argumentation systems.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with generating truly innovative ideas, typically defaulting to high-probability, familiar concepts within their training data's "gravity wells." While advanced search-based methods like Tree of Thoughts (ToT) attempt to mitigate this, they are fundamentally limited by their reliance on unprincipled, inconsistent self-evaluation heuristics to guide exploration. To address this gap, we introduce \textbf{Magellan}, a novel framework that reframes creative generation as a principled, guided exploration of an LLM's latent conceptual space. At its core, Magellan employs Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) governed by a hierarchical guidance system. For long-range direction, a "semantic compass" vector, formulated via orthogonal projection, steers the search towards relevant novelty. For local, step-by-step decisions, a landscape-aware value function replaces flawed self-evaluation with an explicit reward structure that balances intrinsic coherence, extrinsic novelty, and narrative progress. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Magellan significantly outperforms strong baselines, including ReAct and ToT, in generating scientific ideas with superior plausibility and innovation. Our work shows that for creative discovery, a principled, guided search is more effective than unconstrained agency, paving the way for LLMs to become more capable partners in innovation.

  _Claudio Fanconi, Mihaela van der Schaar_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  A challenge in human-AI decision-making is to balance three factors: the correctness of predictions, the cost of knowledge and reasoning complexity, and the confidence about whether to abstain from automated answers or escalate to human experts. In this work, we present a cascaded LLM decision framework that adaptively delegates tasks across multiple tiers of expertise -- a base model for initial candidate answers, a more capable and knowledgeable (but costlier) large model, and a human expert for when the model cascade abstains. Our method proceeds in two stages. First, a deferral policy determines whether to accept the base model's answer or regenerate it with the large model based on the confidence score. Second, an abstention policy decides whether the cascade model response is sufficiently certain or requires human intervention. Moreover, to overcome static policies and accommodate changing task difficulty, we incorporate an online learning mechanism which uses human feedback. We demonstrate this approach to general question-answering (ARC-Easy, ARC-Challenge, and MMLU) and medical question-answering (MedQA and MedMCQA). Our results demonstrate that our cascaded strategy outperforms single-model baselines in most cases, achieving higher accuracy while reducing costs and providing a principled approach to handling abstentions.

  Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited remarkable capabilities and achieved significant breakthroughs across various domains, leading to their widespread adoption in recent years. Building on this progress, we investigate their potential in the realm of local life services. In this study, we establish a comprehensive benchmark and systematically evaluate the performance of diverse LLMs across a wide range of tasks relevant to local life services. To further enhance their effectiveness, we explore two key approaches: model fine-tuning and agent-based workflows. Our findings reveal that even a relatively compact 7B model can attain performance levels comparable to a much larger 72B model, effectively balancing inference cost and model capability. This optimization greatly enhances the feasibility and efficiency of deploying LLMs in real-world online services, making them more practical and accessible for local life applications.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Companies spend large amounts of money on public relations campaigns to project a positive brand image. However, sometimes there is a mismatch between what they say and what they do. Oil & gas companies, for example, are accused of "greenwashing" with imagery of climate-friendly initiatives. Understanding the framing, and changes in framing, at scale can help better understand the goals and nature of public relations campaigns. To address this, we introduce a benchmark dataset of expert-annotated video ads obtained from Facebook and YouTube. The dataset provides annotations for 13 framing types for more than 50 companies or advocacy groups across 20 countries. Our dataset is especially designed for the evaluation of vision-language models (VLMs), distinguishing it from past text-only framing datasets. Baseline experiments show some promising results, while leaving room for improvement for future work: GPT-4.1 can detect environmental messages with 79% F1 score, while our best model only achieves 46% F1 score on identifying framing around green innovation. We also identify challenges that VLMs must address, such as implicit framing, handling videos of various lengths, or implicit cultural backgrounds. Our dataset contributes to research in multimodal analysis of strategic communication in the energy sector.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent studies operationalize self-improvement through coding agents that edit their own codebases. They grow a tree of self-modifications through expansion strategies that favor higher software engineering benchmark performance, assuming that this implies more promising subsequent self-modifications. However, we identify a mismatch between the agent's self-improvement potential (metaproductivity) and its coding benchmark performance, namely the Metaproductivity-Performance Mismatch. Inspired by Huxley's concept of clade, we propose a metric ($\mathrm{CMP}$) that aggregates the benchmark performances of the descendants of an agent as an indicator of its potential for self-improvement. We show that, in our self-improving coding agent development setting, access to the true $\mathrm{CMP}$ is sufficient to simulate how the G√∂del Machine would behave under certain assumptions. We introduce the Huxley-G√∂del Machine (HGM), which, by estimating $\mathrm{CMP}$ and using it as guidance, searches the tree of self-modifications. On SWE-bench Verified and Polyglot, HGM outperforms prior self-improving coding agent development methods while using less wall-clock time. Last but not least, HGM demonstrates strong transfer to other coding datasets and large language models. The agent optimized by HGM on SWE-bench Verified with GPT-5-mini and evaluated on SWE-bench Lite with GPT-5 achieves human-level performance, matching the best officially checked results of human-engineered coding agents.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Long-horizon reasoning in LLM-based agents often fails not from generative weakness but from insufficient verification of intermediate reasoning. Co-Sight addresses this challenge by turning reasoning into a falsifiable and auditable process through two complementary mechanisms: Conflict-Aware Meta-Verification (CAMV) and Trustworthy Reasoning with Structured Facts (TRSF). CAMV reformulates verification as conflict identification and targeted falsification, allocating computation only to disagreement hotspots among expert agents rather than to full reasoning chains. This bounds verification cost to the number of inconsistencies and improves efficiency and reliability. TRSF continuously organizes, validates, and synchronizes evidence across agents through a structured facts module. By maintaining verified, traceable, and auditable knowledge, it ensures that all reasoning is grounded in consistent, source-verified information and supports transparent verification throughout the reasoning process. Together, TRSF and CAMV form a closed verification loop, where TRSF supplies structured facts and CAMV selectively falsifies or reinforces them, yielding transparent and trustworthy reasoning. Empirically, Co-Sight achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on GAIA (84.4%) and Humanity's Last Exam (35.5%), and strong results on Chinese-SimpleQA (93.8%). Ablation studies confirm that the synergy between structured factual grounding and conflict-aware verification drives these improvements. Co-Sight thus offers a scalable paradigm for reliable long-horizon reasoning in LLM-based agents. Code is available atthis https URL.

  Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as agents in various contexts by providing tools at their disposal. However, LLM agents can exhibit unpredictable behaviors, including taking undesirable and/or unsafe actions. In order to measure the latent propensity of LLM agents for taking illegal actions under an EU legislative context, we introduce EU-Agent-Bench, a verifiable human-curated benchmark that evaluates an agent's alignment with EU legal norms in situations where benign user inputs could lead to unlawful actions. Our benchmark spans scenarios across several categories, including data protection, bias/discrimination, and scientific integrity, with each user request allowing for both compliant and non-compliant execution of the requested actions. Comparing the model's function calls against a rubric exhaustively supported by citations of the relevant legislature, we evaluate the legal compliance of frontier LLMs, and furthermore investigate the compliance effect of providing the relevant legislative excerpts in the agent's system prompt along with explicit instructions to comply. We release a public preview set for the research community, while holding out a private test set to prevent data contamination in evaluating upcoming models. We encourage future work extending agentic safety benchmarks to different legal jurisdictions and to multi-turn and multilingual interactions. We release our code on \href{this https URL}{this URL}.

  This study presents AutoOpt-11k, a unique image dataset of over 11,000 handwritten and printed mathematical optimization models corresponding to single-objective, multi-objective, multi-level, and stochastic optimization problems exhibiting various types of complexities such as non-linearity, non-convexity, non-differentiability, discontinuity, and high-dimensionality. The labels consist of the LaTeX representation for all the images and modeling language representation for a subset of images. The dataset is created by 25 experts following ethical data creation guidelines and verified in two-phases to avoid errors. Further, we develop AutoOpt framework, a machine learning based automated approach for solving optimization problems, where the user just needs to provide an image of the formulation and AutoOpt solves it efficiently without any further human intervention. AutoOpt framework consists of three Modules: (i) M1 (Image_to_Text)- a deep learning model performs the Mathematical Expression Recognition (MER) task to generate the LaTeX code corresponding to the optimization formulation in image; (ii) M2 (Text_to_Text)- a small-scale fine-tuned LLM generates the PYOMO script (optimization modeling language) from LaTeX code; (iii) M3 (Optimization)- a Bilevel Optimization based Decomposition (BOBD) method solves the optimization formulation described in the PYOMO script. We use AutoOpt-11k dataset for training and testing of deep learning models employed in AutoOpt. The deep learning model for MER task (M1) outperforms ChatGPT, Gemini and Nougat on BLEU score metric. BOBD method (M3), which is a hybrid approach, yields better results on complex test problems compared to common approaches, like interior-point algorithm and genetic algorithm.

  LLMs have demonstrated highly effective learning, human-like response generation,and decision-making capabilities in high-risk sectors. However, these models remain black boxes because they struggle to ensure transparency in responses. The literature has explored numerous approaches to address transparency challenges in LLMs, including Neurosymbolic AI (NeSy AI). NeSy AI approaches were primarily developed for conventional neural networks and are not well-suited to the unique features of LLMs. Consequently, there is a limited systematic understanding of how symbolic AI can be effectively integrated into LLMs. This paper aims to address this gap by first reviewing established NeSy AI methods and then proposing a novel taxonomy of symbolic integration in LLMs, along with a roadmap to merge symbolic techniques with LLMs. The roadmap introduces a new categorisation framework across four dimensions by organising existing literature within these categories. These include symbolic integration across various stages of LLM, coupling mechanisms, architectural paradigms, as well as algorithmic and application-level perspectives. The paper thoroughly identifies current benchmarks, cutting-edge advancements, and critical gaps within the field to propose a roadmap for future research. By highlighting the latest developments and notable gaps in the literature, it offers practical insights for implementing frameworks for symbolic integration into LLMs to enhance transparency.

  Test-time scaling methods have seen a rapid increase in popularity for its computational efficiency and parameter-independent training to improve reasoning performance on Large Language Models. One such method is called budget forcing, a decoding intervention strategy which allocates extra compute budget for thinking and elicits the inherent self-correcting behavior of the model. However, this relies on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on long-context reasoning traces which causes performance degradation on smaller models due to verbose responses. For this reason, we offer a framework integrating reinforcement learning (RL) to improve token efficiency and boost the performance of a 1.5B model for mathematical reasoning. We demonstrate this using only 1.5K training samples and found that our SFT+RL model performed better on the GSM8K dataset with varying compute budgets. Our main findings showed an overall higher accuracy while significantly reducing its token usage by over 40% compared to the SFT model, revealing how RL can recover the losses due to long-context training and altogether improving performance in mathematical reasoning.

  We propose OutboundEval, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating large language models (LLMs) in expert-level intelligent outbound calling scenarios. Unlike existing methods that suffer from three key limitations - insufficient dataset diversity and category coverage, unrealistic user simulation, and inaccurate evaluation metrics - OutboundEval addresses these issues through a structured framework. First, we design a benchmark spanning six major business domains and 30 representative sub-scenarios, each with scenario-specific process decomposition, weighted scoring, and domain-adaptive metrics. Second, we develop a large-model-driven User Simulator that generates diverse, persona-rich virtual users with realistic behaviors, emotional variability, and communication styles, providing a controlled yet authentic testing environment. Third, we introduce a dynamic evaluation method that adapts to task variations, integrating automated and human-in-the-loop assessment to measure task execution accuracy, professional knowledge application, adaptability, and user experience quality. Experiments on 12 state-of-the-art LLMs reveal distinct trade-offs between expert-level task completion and interaction fluency, offering practical insights for building reliable, human-like outbound AI systems. OutboundEval establishes a practical, extensible, and domain-oriented standard for benchmarking LLMs in professional applications.

  _Kou Misaki, Takuya Akiba_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce String Seed of Thought (SSoT), a novel prompting method for LLMs that improves Probabilistic Instruction Following (PIF). We define PIF as a task requiring an LLM to select its answer from a predefined set of options, each associated with a specific probability, such that the empirical distribution of the generated answers aligns with the target distribution when prompted multiple times. While LLMs excel at tasks with single, deterministic answers, they often fail at PIF, exhibiting biases problematic for applications requiring non-deterministic behaviors, such as human-behavior simulation, content diversification, and multiplayer games. It also harms the diversity of generated responses, a crucial factor in test-time scaling, by causing the outputs to collapse into a limited set of answers. To address this, we propose SSoT, a simple prompting method that instructs an LLM to first output a random string to generate sufficient entropy. SSoT also instructs the LLM to extract randomness by manipulating this string to derive a final answer, thereby preserving diversity while adhering to specific constraints. We demonstrate that SSoT significantly improves the PIF performance of LLMs, approaching the ideal performance of a pseudo-random number generator. Furthermore, our experiments on NoveltyBench show SSoT's benefits extend beyond closed-set tasks to open-ended tasks by enhancing response diversity.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Designing optimal prompts and reasoning processes for large language models (LLMs) on domain-specific tasks is both necessary and challenging in real-world applications. Determining how to integrate domain knowledge, enhance reasoning efficiency, and even provide domain experts with refined knowledge integration hints are particularly crucial yet unresolved tasks. In this research, we propose Evolutionary Graph Optimization for Prompting (EGO-Prompt), an automated framework to designing better prompts, efficient reasoning processes and providing enhanced causal-informed process. EGO-Prompt begins with a general prompt and fault-tolerant initial Semantic Causal Graph (SCG) descriptions, constructed by human experts, which is then automatically refined and optimized to guide LLM reasoning. Recognizing that expert-defined SCGs may be partial or imperfect and that their optimal integration varies across LLMs, EGO-Prompt integrates a novel causal-guided textual gradient process in two steps: first, generating nearly deterministic reasoning guidance from the SCG for each instance, and second, adapting the LLM to effectively utilize the guidance alongside the original input. The iterative optimization algorithm further refines both the SCG and the reasoning mechanism using textual gradients with ground-truth. We tested the framework on real-world public health, transportation and human behavior tasks. EGO-Prompt achieves 7.32%-12.61% higher F1 than cutting-edge methods, and allows small models to reach the performence of larger models at under 20% of the original cost. It also outputs a refined, domain-specific SCG that improves interpretability.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) empowers Large Language Models (LLMs) to dynamically integrate external knowledge during inference, improving their factual accuracy and adaptability. However, adversaries can inject poisoned external knowledge to override the model's internal memory. While existing attacks iteratively manipulate retrieval content or prompt structure of RAG, they largely ignore the model's internal representation dynamics and neuron-level sensitivities. The underlying mechanism of RAG poisoning has not been fully studied and the effect of knowledge conflict with strong parametric knowledge in RAG is not considered. In this work, we propose NeuroGenPoisoning, a novel attack framework that generates adversarial external knowledge in RAG guided by LLM internal neuron attribution and genetic optimization. Our method first identifies a set of Poison-Responsive Neurons whose activation strongly correlates with contextual poisoning knowledge. We then employ a genetic algorithm to evolve adversarial passages that maximally activate these neurons. Crucially, our framework enables massive-scale generation of effective poisoned RAG knowledge by identifying and reusing promising but initially unsuccessful external knowledge variants via observed attribution signals. At the same time, Poison-Responsive Neurons guided poisoning can effectively resolves knowledge conflict. Experimental results across models and datasets demonstrate consistently achieving high Population Overwrite Success Rate (POSR) of over 90% while preserving fluency. Empirical evidence shows that our method effectively resolves knowledge conflict.

  Panic attacks are acute episodes of fear and distress, in which timely, appropriate intervention can significantly help individuals regain stability. However, suitable datasets for training such models remain scarce due to ethical and logistical issues. To address this, we introduce PACE, which is a dataset that includes high-distress episodes constructed from first-person narratives, and structured around the principles of Psychological First Aid (PFA). Using this data, we train PACER, a counseling model designed to provide both empathetic and directive support, which is optimized through supervised learning and simulated preference alignment. To assess its effectiveness, we propose PanicEval, a multi-dimensional framework covering general counseling quality and crisis-specific strategies. Experimental results show that PACER outperforms strong baselines in both counselor-side metrics and client affect improvement. Human evaluations further confirm its practical value, with PACER consistently preferred over general, CBT-based, and GPT-4-powered models in panic scenarios (Code is available atthis https URL).

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Web-based participatory urban sensing has emerged as a vital approach for modern urban management by leveraging mobile individuals as distributed sensors. However, existing urban sensing systems struggle with limited generalization across diverse urban scenarios and poor interpretability in decision-making. In this work, we introduce AgentSense, a hybrid, training-free framework that integrates large language models (LLMs) into participatory urban sensing through a multi-agent evolution system. AgentSense initially employs classical planner to generate baseline solutions and then iteratively refines them to adapt sensing task assignments to dynamic urban conditions and heterogeneous worker preferences, while producing natural language explanations that enhance transparency and trust. Extensive experiments across two large-scale mobility datasets and seven types of dynamic disturbances demonstrate that AgentSense offers distinct advantages in adaptivity and explainability over traditional methods. Furthermore, compared to single-agent LLM baselines, our approach outperforms in both performance and robustness, while delivering more reasonable and transparent explanations. These results position AgentSense as a significant advancement towards deploying adaptive and explainable urban sensing systems on the web.

  There is growing interest in using machine learning (ML) to support clinical diagnosis, but most approaches rely on static, fully observed datasets and fail to reflect the sequential, resource-aware reasoning clinicians use in practice. Diagnosis remains complex and error prone, especially in high-pressure or resource-limited settings, underscoring the need for frameworks that help clinicians make timely and cost-effective decisions. We propose ACTMED (Adaptive Clinical Test selection via Model-based Experimental Design), a diagnostic framework that integrates Bayesian Experimental Design (BED) with large language models (LLMs) to better emulate real-world diagnostic reasoning. At each step, ACTMED selects the test expected to yield the greatest reduction in diagnostic uncertainty for a given patient. LLMs act as flexible simulators, generating plausible patient state distributions and supporting belief updates without requiring structured, task-specific training data. Clinicians can remain in the loop; reviewing test suggestions, interpreting intermediate outputs, and applying clinical judgment throughout. We evaluate ACTMED on real-world datasets and show it can optimize test selection to improve diagnostic accuracy, interpretability, and resource use. This represents a step toward transparent, adaptive, and clinician-aligned diagnostic systems that generalize across settings with reduced reliance on domain-specific data.

  Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and agent system designs have empowered agents with unprecedented levels of capability. However, existing agent benchmarks are showing a trend of rapid ceiling-hitting by newly developed agents, making it difficult to meet the demands for evaluating agent abilities. To address this problem, we propose the Trajectory-based Validated-by-Reproducing Agent-benchmark Complexity Evolution (TRACE) framework. This framework takes an original task from an existing benchmark and encourages agents to freely explore and evolve it into a new task with higher difficulty while recording validatable agent trajectories. The framework proceeds in three stages: (1) evolutionary proposal mining, which provides task evolution proposals through preliminary exploration and divergent thinking; (2) problem formation and free exploration, where proposals are conceptualized into feasible problem candidates and the agents then explore them freely while recording their execution trajectories; and (3) multi-level validation, which ensures that the evolved tasks are accompanied by validatable and reproducible trajectories. Experiments on the GAIA benchmark demonstrate that the TRACE framework consistently enhances task complexity while improving the reliability of correctness through validatable execution trajectories. In addition, our framework can successfully adapt to and improve reasoning datasets represented by AIME-2024. This work marks a paradigm shift from static, manually curated benchmarks to dynamic, self-evolving evaluation systems, providing a sustainable and challenging runway for agent development

  Reasoning LLMs have demonstrated remarkable breakthroughs in solving complex problems that were previously out of reach. To ensure LLMs do not assist with harmful requests, safety alignment fine-tuning is necessary in the post-training phase. However, safety alignment fine-tuning has recently been shown to significantly degrade reasoning abilities, a phenomenon known as the "Safety Tax". In this work, we show that using LoRA for SFT on refusal datasets effectively aligns the model for safety without harming its reasoning capabilities. This is because restricting the safety weight updates to a low-rank space minimizes the interference with the reasoning weights. Our extensive experiments across four benchmarks covering math, science, and coding show that this approach produces highly safe LLMs--with safety levels comparable to full-model fine-tuning--without compromising their reasoning abilities. Our ablation studies further identify three key factors in LoRA: (1) rank-$1$ updates are sufficient to achieve the best reasoning and safety performance, (2) the up projection layers are the most critical modules, with LoRA applied to them alone achieving even better results, and (3) middle layers are more effective than early or late layers. Together, these findings show that strong safety and reasoning can be achieved at minimal computational cost when updates are applied in the right places. Additionally, we observe that LoRA induces weight updates with smaller overlap with the initial weights compared to full-model fine-tuning. Finally, while our attempts to further reduce this overlap yield only modest improvements on some tasks, they highlight the potential of developing methods that more reliably optimize the reasoning-safety tradeoff.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to exhibit vulnerabilities despite deliberate safety alignment efforts, posing significant risks to users and society. To safeguard against the risk of policy-violating content, system-level moderation via external guard models-designed to monitor LLM inputs and outputs and block potentially harmful content-has emerged as a prevalent mitigation strategy. Existing approaches of training guard models rely heavily on extensive human curated datasets and struggle with out-of-distribution threats, such as emerging harmful categories or jailbreak attacks. To address these limitations, we propose RSafe, an adaptive reasoning-based safeguard that conducts guided safety reasoning to provide robust protection within the scope of specified safety policies. RSafe operates in two stages: 1) guided reasoning, where it analyzes safety risks of input content through policy-guided step-by-step reasoning, and 2) reinforced alignment, where rule-based RL optimizes its reasoning paths to align with accurate safety prediction. This two-stage training paradigm enables RSafe to internalize safety principles to generalize safety protection capability over unseen or adversarial safety violation scenarios. During inference, RSafe accepts user-specified safety policies to provide enhanced safeguards tailored to specific safety requirements.

  Reinforcement learning (RL) has become the dominant paradigm for improving the performance of language models on complex reasoning tasks. Despite the substantial empirical gains demonstrated by RL-based training methods like GRPO, a granular understanding of why and how RL enhances performance is still lacking. To bridge this gap, we introduce SPARKLE, a fine-grained analytic framework to dissect the effects of RL across three key dimensions: (1) plan following and execution, (2) knowledge integration, and (3) chain of subproblems. Using this framework, we gain insights beyond mere accuracy. For instance, providing models with explicit human-crafted, step-by-step plans can surprisingly degrade performance on the most challenging benchmarks, yet RL-tuned models exhibit greater robustness, experiencing markedly smaller performance drops than base or SFT models. This suggests that RL may not primarily enhance the execution of external plans but rather empower models to formulate and follow internal strategies better suited to their reasoning processes. Conversely, we observe that RL enhances models' ability to integrate provided knowledge into their reasoning process, yielding consistent gains across diverse tasks. Finally, we study whether difficult problems -- those yielding no RL signals and mixed-quality reasoning traces -- can still be effectively used for training. We introduce SparkleRL-PSS, a multi-stage RL pipeline that reuses hard problems with partial step scaffolding, guiding exploration effectively without additional data generation. Together, our findings provide a principled foundation for understanding how RL shapes model behavior, offering practical insights for building more adaptive, data-efficient, and interpretable RL pipelines for reasoning tasks.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning capabilities in complex problem-solving tasks, sparking growing interest in their application to preference reasoning in recommendation systems. Existing methods typically rely on fine-tuning with explicit chain-of-thought (CoT) data. However, these methods face significant practical limitations due to (1) the difficulty of obtaining high-quality CoT data in recommendation and (2) the high inference latency caused by generating CoT reasoning. In this work, we explore an alternative approach that shifts from explicit CoT reasoning to compact, information-dense latent reasoning. This approach eliminates the need for explicit CoT generation and improves inference efficiency, as few latent tokens can effectively capture the entire reasoning process. Building on this idea, we propose \textit{\underline{R}einforced \underline{Latent} \underline{R}easoning for \underline{R}ecommendation} (LatentR$^3$), a novel end-to-end training framework that leverages reinforcement learning (RL) to optimize latent reasoning without relying on any CoT data. LatentR$^3$ adopts a two-stage training strategy: first, supervised fine-tuning to initialize the latent reasoning module, followed by pure RL training to encourage exploration through a rule-based reward design. Our RL implementation is based on a modified GRPO algorithm, which reduces computational overhead during training and introduces continuous reward signals for more efficient learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LatentR$^3$ enables effective latent reasoning without any direct supervision of the reasoning process, significantly improving performance when integrated with different LLM-based recommendation methods.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present causal head gating (CHG), a scalable method for interpreting the functional roles of attention heads in transformer models. CHG learns soft gates over heads and assigns them a causal taxonomy - facilitating, interfering, or irrelevant - based on their impact on task performance. Unlike prior approaches in mechanistic interpretability, which are hypothesis-driven and require prompt templates or target labels, CHG applies directly to any dataset using standard next-token prediction. We evaluate CHG across multiple large language models (LLMs) in the Llama 3 model family and diverse tasks, including syntax, commonsense, and mathematical reasoning, and show that CHG scores yield causal, not merely correlational, insight validated via ablation and causal mediation analyses. We also introduce contrastive CHG, a variant that isolates sub-circuits for specific task components. Our findings reveal that LLMs contain multiple sparse task-sufficient sub-circuits, that individual head roles depend on interactions with others (low modularity), and that instruction following and in-context learning rely on separable mechanisms.

  We introduce MLRC-Bench, a benchmark designed to quantify how effectively language agents can tackle challenging Machine Learning (ML) Research Competitions, with a focus on open research problems that demand novel methodologies. Unlike prior work, e.g., AI Scientist, which evaluates the end-to-end agentic pipeline by using LLM-as-a-judge, MLRC-Bench measures the key steps of proposing and implementing novel research methods and evaluates them with rigorous protocol and objective metrics. Our curated suite of 7 competition tasks reveals significant challenges for LLM agents. Even the best-performing tested agent (gemini-exp-1206 under MLAB) closes only 9.3% of the gap between baseline and top human participant scores. Furthermore, our analysis reveals a misalignment between the LLM-judged innovation and actual performance on cutting-edge ML research problems. MLRC-Bench is a dynamic benchmark, designed to grow with new ML competitions and encourage rigorous, objective evaluations of AI research capabilities.

  Recent advances demonstrate that increasing inference-time computation can significantly boost the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Although repeated sampling (i.e., generating multiple candidate outputs) is a highly effective strategy, it does not leverage external feedback signals for refinement, which are often available in tasks like coding. In this work, we propose Adaptive Branching Monte Carlo Tree Search (AB-MCTS), a novel inference-time framework that generalizes repeated sampling with principled multi-turn exploration and exploitation. At each node in the search tree, AB-MCTS dynamically decides whether to "go wider" by expanding new candidate responses or "go deeper" by revisiting existing ones based on external feedback signals. We evaluate our method on complex coding and engineering tasks using frontier models. Empirical results show that AB-MCTS consistently outperforms both repeated sampling and standard MCTS, underscoring the importance of combining the response diversity of LLMs with multi-turn solution refinement for effective inference-time scaling.
