- **[Plan-R1: Safe and Feasible Trajectory Planning as Language Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17659)**  `arXiv:2505.17659`  `cs.RO` `cs.CV`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Safe and feasible trajectory planning is critical for real-world autonomous driving systems. However, existing learning-based planners rely heavily on expert demonstrations, which not only lack explicit safety awareness but also risk inheriting undesirable behaviors such as speeding from suboptimal human driving data. Inspired by the success of large language models, we propose Plan-R1, a two-stage trajectory planning framework that decouples principle alignment from behavior learning. In the first stage, a general trajectory predictor is pre-trained on expert data to capture diverse, human-like driving behaviors. In the second stage, the model is fine-tuned with rule-based rewards using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), explicitly aligning ego planning with principles such as safety, comfort, and traffic rule compliance. This two-stage paradigm retains human-like behaviors while enhancing safety awareness and discarding undesirable patterns from demonstrations. Furthermore, we identify a key limitation of directly applying GRPO to planning: group-wise normalization erases cross-group scale differences, causing rare, high-variance safety-violation groups to have similar advantages as abundant low-variance safe groups, thereby suppressing optimization for safety-critical objectives. To address this, we propose Variance-Decoupled GRPO (VD-GRPO), which replaces normalization with centering and fixed scaling to preserve absolute reward magnitudes, ensuring that safety-critical objectives remain dominant throughout training. Experiments on the nuPlan benchmark demonstrate that Plan-R1 significantly improves planning safety and feasibility, achieving state-of-the-art performance, particularly in realistic reactive settings.

  Recent Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) advancements are promising, but their idealized assumptions about robot movement and control fail to reflect physically embodied deployment challenges. To bridge this gap, we introduce VLN-PE, a physically realistic VLN platform supporting humanoid, quadruped, and wheeled robots. For the first time, we systematically evaluate several ego-centric VLN methods in physical robotic settings across different technical pipelines, including classification models for single-step discrete action prediction, a diffusion model for dense waypoint prediction, and a train-free, map-based large language model (LLM) integrated with path planning. Our results reveal significant performance degradation due to limited robot observation space, environmental lighting variations, and physical challenges like collisions and falls. This also exposes locomotion constraints for legged robots in complex environments. VLN-PE is highly extensible, allowing seamless integration of new scenes beyond MP3D, thereby enabling more comprehensive VLN evaluation. Despite the weak generalization of current models in physical deployment, VLN-PE provides a new pathway for improving cross-embodiment's overall adaptability. We hope our findings and tools inspire the community to rethink VLN limitations and advance robust, practical VLN models. The code is available atthis https URL.

- **[SAGE: Scene Graph-Aware Guidance and Execution for Long-Horizon Manipulation Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21928)**  `arXiv:2509.21928`  `cs.RO` `cs.AI`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Successfully solving long-horizon manipulation tasks remains a fundamental challenge. These tasks involve extended action sequences and complex object interactions, presenting a critical gap between high-level symbolic planning and low-level continuous control. To bridge this gap, two essential capabilities are required: robust long-horizon task planning and effective goal-conditioned manipulation. Existing task planning methods, including traditional and LLM-based approaches, often exhibit limited generalization or sparse semantic reasoning. Meanwhile, image-conditioned control methods struggle to adapt to unseen tasks. To tackle these problems, we propose SAGE, a novel framework for Scene Graph-Aware Guidance and Execution in Long-Horizon Manipulation Tasks. SAGE utilizes semantic scene graphs as a structural representation for scene states. A structural scene graph enables bridging task-level semantic reasoning and pixel-level visuo-motor control. This also facilitates the controllable synthesis of accurate, novel sub-goal images. SAGE consists of two key components: (1) a scene graph-based task planner that uses VLMs and LLMs to parse the environment and reason about physically-grounded scene state transition sequences, and (2) a decoupled structural image editing pipeline that controllably converts each target sub-goal graph into a corresponding image through image inpainting and composition. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that SAGE achieves state-of-the-art performance on distinct long-horizon tasks.

- **[Learning Hierarchical Domain Models Through Environment-Grounded Interaction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13497)**  `arXiv:2505.13497`  `cs.RO` `cs.AI`  
  _Claudius Kienle, Benjamin Alt, Oleg Arenz, Jan Peters_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Domain models enable autonomous agents to solve long-horizon tasks by producing interpretable plans. However, in open-world environments, a single general domain model cannot capture the variety of tasks, so agents must generate suitable task-specific models on the fly. Large Language Models (LLMs), with their implicit common knowledge, can generate such domains, but suffer from high error rates that limit their applicability. Hence, related work relies on extensive human feed-back or prior knowledge, which undermines autonomous, open-world deployment. In this work, we propose LODGE, a framework for autonomous domain learning from LLMs and environment grounding. LODGE builds on hierarchical abstractions and automated simulations to identify and correct inconsistencies between abstraction layers and between the model and environment. Our framework is task-agnostic, as it generates predicates, operators, and their preconditions and effects, while only assuming access to a simulator and a set of generic, executable low-level skills. Experiments on two International Planning Competition ( IPC) domains and a robotic assembly domain show that LODGE yields more accurate domain models and higher task success than existing methods, requiring remarkably few environment interactions and no human feedback or demonstrations.

- **[Real-Time Indoor Object SLAM with LLM-Enhanced Priors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21602)**  `arXiv:2509.21602`  `cs.RO`  
  _Yang Jiao, Yiding Qiu, Henrik I. Christensen_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Object-level Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM), which incorporates semantic information for high-level scene understanding, faces challenges of under-constrained optimization due to sparse observations. Prior work has introduced additional constraints using commonsense knowledge, but obtaining such priors has traditionally been labor-intensive and lacks generalizability across diverse object categories. We address this limitation by leveraging large language models (LLMs) to provide commonsense knowledge of object geometric attributes, specifically size and orientation, as prior factors in a graph-based SLAM framework. These priors are particularly beneficial during the initial phase when object observations are limited. We implement a complete pipeline integrating these priors, achieving robust data association on sparse object-level features and enabling real-time object SLAM. Our system, evaluated on the TUM RGB-D and 3RScan datasets, improves mapping accuracy by 36.8\% over the latest baseline. Additionally, we present real-world experiments in the supplementary video, demonstrating its real-time performance.

- **[Plan2Evolve: LLM Self-Evolution for Improved Planning Capability via Automated Domain Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21543)**  `arXiv:2509.21543`  `cs.RO`  
  _Jinbang Huang, Zhiyuan Li, Zhanguang Zhang, Xingyue Quan, Jianye Hao, Yingxue Zhang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently shown strong potential in robotic task planning, particularly through automatic planning domain generation that integrates symbolic search. Prior approaches, however, have largely treated these domains as search utilities, with limited attention to their potential as scalable sources of reasoning data. At the same time, progress in reasoning LLMs has been driven by chain-of-thought (CoT) supervision, whose application in robotics remains dependent on costly, human-curated datasets. We propose Plan2Evolve, an LLM self-evolving framework in which the base model generates planning domains that serve as engines for producing symbolic problem-plan pairs as reasoning traces. These pairs are then transformed into extended CoT trajectories by the same model through natural-language explanations, thereby explicitly aligning symbolic planning structures with natural language reasoning. The resulting data extend beyond the model's intrinsic planning capacity, enabling model fine-tuning that yields a planning-enhanced LLM with improved planning success, stronger cross-task generalization, and reduced inference costs.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Pre-trained large language models (LLMs) show promise for robotic task planning but often struggle to guarantee correctness in long-horizon problems. Task and motion planning (TAMP) addresses this by grounding symbolic plans in low-level execution, yet it relies heavily on manually engineered planning domains. To improve long-horizon planning reliability and reduce human intervention, we present Planning Domain Derivation with LLMs (PDDLLM), a framework that automatically induces symbolic predicates and actions directly from demonstration trajectories by combining LLM reasoning with physical simulation roll-outs. Unlike prior domain-inference methods that rely on partially predefined or language descriptions of planning domains, PDDLLM constructs domains without manual domain initialization and automatically integrates them with motion planners to produce executable plans, enhancing long-horizon planning automation. Across 1,200 tasks in nine environments, PDDLLM outperforms six LLM-based planning baselines, achieving at least 20\% higher success rates, reduced token costs, and successful deployment on multiple physical robot platforms.

- **[Multi-Agent Path Finding via Offline RL and LLM Collaboration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22130)**  `arXiv:2509.22130`  `cs.MA` `cs.AI` `cs.LG`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) poses a significant and challenging problem critical for applications in robotics and logistics, particularly due to its combinatorial complexity and the partial observability inherent in realistic environments. Decentralized reinforcement learning methods commonly encounter two substantial difficulties: first, they often yield self-centered behaviors among agents, resulting in frequent collisions, and second, their reliance on complex communication modules leads to prolonged training times, sometimes spanning weeks. To address these challenges, we propose an efficient decentralized planning framework based on the Decision Transformer (DT), uniquely leveraging offline reinforcement learning to substantially reduce training durations from weeks to mere hours. Crucially, our approach effectively handles long-horizon credit assignment and significantly improves performance in scenarios with sparse and delayed rewards. Furthermore, to overcome adaptability limitations inherent in standard RL methods under dynamic environmental changes, we integrate a large language model (GPT-4o) to dynamically guide agent policies. Extensive experiments in both static and dynamically changing environments demonstrate that our DT-based approach, augmented briefly by GPT-4o, significantly enhances adaptability and performance.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The automated generation of agentic workflows is a promising frontier for enabling large language models (LLMs) to solve complex tasks. However, our investigation reveals that the robustness of agentic workflow remains a critical, unaddressed challenge. Current methods often generate wildly inconsistent workflows when provided with instructions that are semantically identical but differently phrased. This brittleness severely undermines their reliability and trustworthiness for real-world applications. To quantitatively diagnose this instability, we propose metrics based on nodal and topological similarity to evaluate workflow consistency against common semantic variations such as paraphrasing and noise injection. Subsequently, we further propose a novel training framework, RobustFlow, that leverages preference optimization to teach models invariance to instruction variations. By training on sets of synonymous task descriptions, RobustFlow boosts workflow robustness scores to 70\% - 90\%, which is a substantial improvement over existing approaches. The code is publicly available atthis https URL.

- **[Preference-Guided Learning for Sparse-Reward Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21828)**  `arXiv:2509.21828`  `cs.LG` `cs.MA`  
  _Viet Bui, Tien Mai, Hong Thanh Nguyen_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We study the problem of online multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) in environments with sparse rewards, where reward feedback is not provided at each interaction but only revealed at the end of a trajectory. This setting, though realistic, presents a fundamental challenge: the lack of intermediate rewards hinders standard MARL algorithms from effectively guiding policy learning. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework that integrates online inverse preference learning with multi-agent on-policy optimization into a unified architecture. At its core, our approach introduces an implicit multi-agent reward learning model, built upon a preference-based value-decomposition network, which produces both global and local reward signals. These signals are further used to construct dual advantage streams, enabling differentiated learning targets for the centralized critic and decentralized actors. In addition, we demonstrate how large language models (LLMs) can be leveraged to provide preference labels that enhance the quality of the learned reward model. Empirical evaluations on state-of-the-art benchmarks, including MAMuJoCo and SMACv2, show that our method achieves superior performance compared to existing baselines, highlighting its effectiveness in addressing sparse-reward challenges in online MARL.

- **[EPO: Entropy-regularized Policy Optimization for LLM Agents Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22576)**  `arXiv:2509.22576`  `cs.LG` `cs.CL`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Training LLM agents in multi-turn environments with sparse rewards, where completing a single task requires 30+ turns of interaction within an episode, presents a fundamental challenge for reinforcement learning. We identify a critical failure mode unique to this setting: the exploration-exploitation cascade failure. This cascade begins with early-stage policy premature convergence, where sparse feedback causes agents to commit to flawed, low-entropy strategies. Subsequently, agents enter late-stage policy collapse, where conventional entropy regularization becomes counterproductive, promoting chaotic exploration that destabilizes training. We propose Entropy-regularized Policy Optimization (EPO), a general framework that breaks this failure cycle through three synergistic mechanisms: (1) adopting entropy regularization in multi-turn settings to enhance exploration, (2) an entropy smoothing regularizer that bounds policy entropy within historical averages to prevent abrupt fluctuations, and (3) adaptive phase-based weighting that balances exploration and exploitation across training. Our analysis justifies that EPO guarantees monotonically decreasing entropy variance while maintaining convergence. EPO achieves up to 152% performance improvement on ScienceWorld and up to 19.8% on ALFWorld. Our work demonstrates that multi-turn sparse-reward settings require fundamentally different entropy control than traditional RL, with broad implications for LLM agent training.

  Large language models (LLMs) have recently been proposed as general-purpose agents for experimental design, with claims that they can perform in-context experimental design. We evaluate this hypothesis using both open- and closed-source instruction-tuned LLMs applied to genetic perturbation and molecular property discovery tasks. We find that LLM-based agents show no sensitivity to experimental feedback: replacing true outcomes with randomly permuted labels has no impact on performance. Across benchmarks, classical methods such as linear bandits and Gaussian process optimization consistently outperform LLM agents. We further propose a simple hybrid method, LLM-guided Nearest Neighbour (LLMNN) sampling, that combines LLM prior knowledge with nearest-neighbor sampling to guide the design of experiments. LLMNN achieves competitive or superior performance across domains without requiring significant in-context adaptation. These results suggest that current open- and closed-source LLMs do not perform in-context experimental design in practice and highlight the need for hybrid frameworks that decouple prior-based reasoning from batch acquisition with updated posteriors.

  Cancer screening, leading to early detection, saves lives. Unfortunately, existing screening techniques require expensive and intrusive medical procedures, not globally available, resulting in too many lost would-be-saved lives. We present CATCH-FM, CATch Cancer early with Healthcare Foundation Models, a cancer pre-screening methodology that identifies high-risk patients for further screening solely based on their historical medical records. With millions of electronic healthcare records (EHR), we establish the scaling law of EHR foundation models pretrained on medical code sequences, pretrain compute-optimal foundation models of up to 2.4 billion parameters, and finetune them on clinician-curated cancer risk prediction cohorts. In our retrospective evaluation comprising of thirty thousand patients, CATCH-FM achieves strong efficacy, with 50% sensitivity in predicting first cancer risks at 99% specificity cutoff, and outperforming feature-based tree models and both general and medical LLMs by up to 20% AUPRC. Despite significant demographic, healthcare system, and EHR coding differences, CATCH-FM achieves state-of-the-art pancreatic cancer risk prediction on the EHRSHOT few-shot leaderboard, outperforming EHR foundation models pretrained using on-site patient data. Our analysis demonstrates the robustness of CATCH-FM in various patient distributions, the benefits of operating in the ICD code space, and its ability to capture non-trivial cancer risk factors. Our code will be open-sourced.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Tensor networks (TNs) provide efficient representations of high-dimensional data, yet identification of the optimal TN structures, the so called tensor network structure search (TN-SS) problem, remains a challenge. Current state-of-the-art (SOTA) algorithms solve TN-SS as a purely numerical optimization problem and require extensive function evaluations, which is prohibitive for real-world applications. In addition, existing methods ignore the valuable domain information inherent in real-world tensor data and lack transparency in their identified TN structures. To this end, we propose a novel TN-SS framework, termed the tnLLM, which incorporates domain information about the data and harnesses the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to directly predict suitable TN structures. The proposed framework involves a domain-aware prompting pipeline which instructs the LLM to infer suitable TN structures based on the real-world relationships between tensor modes. In this way, our approach is capable of not only iteratively optimizing the objective function, but also generating domain-aware explanations for the identified structures. Experimental results demonstrate that tnLLM achieves comparable TN-SS objective function values with much fewer function evaluations compared to SOTA algorithms. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the LLM-enabled domain information can be used to find good initializations in the search space for sampling-based SOTA methods to accelerate their convergence while preserving theoretical performance guarantees.

  Representation Engineering (RepE) is a novel paradigm for controlling the behavior of LLMs. Unlike traditional approaches that modify inputs or fine-tune the model, RepE directly manipulates the model's internal representations. As a result, it may offer more effective, interpretable, data-efficient, and flexible control over models' behavior. We present the first comprehensive survey of RepE for LLMs, reviewing the rapidly growing literature to address key questions: What RepE methods exist and how do they differ? For what concepts and problems has RepE been applied? What are the strengths and weaknesses of RepE compared to other methods? To answer these, we propose a unified framework describing RepE as a pipeline comprising representation identification, operationalization, and control. We posit that while RepE methods offer significant potential, challenges remain, including managing multiple concepts, ensuring reliability, and preserving models' performance. Towards improving RepE, we identify opportunities for experimental and methodological improvements and construct a guide for best practices.

  Large language models (LLMs) can be improved by aligning with human preferences through fine-tuning -- the so-called reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). However, the cost of fine-tuning an LLM is prohibitive for many users. Due to their ability to bypass LLM fine-tuning, prediction-time tokenwise reward-guided text generation (RGTG) methods have recently been proposed. They use a reward model trained on full sequences to score partial sequences during decoding in a bid to steer the generation towards sequences with high rewards. However, these methods have so far been only heuristically motivated and poorly analyzed. In this work, we show that reward models trained on full sequences are not compatible with scoring partial sequences. To alleviate this, we propose to train a Bradley-Terry reward model on partial sequences explicitly, and autoregressively sample from the implied tokenwise policy during decoding. We study the properties of this reward model and the resulting policy: we show that this policy is proportional to the ratio of two distinct RLHF policies. Our simple approach outperforms previous RGTG methods and performs similarly to strong offline baselines without large-scale LLM fine-tuning.Code for our work is available atthis https URL

  Reinforcement learning (RL) is the dominant paradigm for sharpening strategic tool use capabilities of LLMs on long-horizon, sparsely-rewarded agent tasks, yet it faces a fundamental challenge of exploration-exploitation trade-off. Existing studies stimulate exploration through the lens of policy entropy, but such mechanical entropy maximization is prone to RL training instability due to the multi-turn distribution shifting. In this paper, we target the progressive exploration-exploitation balance under the guidance of the agent own experiences without succumbing to either entropy collapsing or runaway divergence. We propose SPEAR, a curriculum-based self-imitation learning (SIL) recipe for training agentic LLMs. It extends the vanilla SIL framework, where a replay buffer stores self-generated promising trajectories for off-policy update, by gradually steering the policy evolution within a well-balanced range of entropy across stages. Specifically, our approach incorporates a curriculum to manage the exploration process, utilizing intrinsic rewards to foster skill-level exploration and facilitating action-level exploration through SIL. At first, the auxiliary tool call reward plays a critical role in the accumulation of tool-use skills, enabling broad exposure to the unfamiliar distributions of the environment feedback with an upward entropy trend. As training progresses, self-imitation gets strengthened to exploit existing successful patterns from replayed experiences for comparative action-level exploration, accelerating solution iteration without unbounded entropy growth. To further stabilize training, we recalibrate the advantages of experiences in the replay buffer to address the potential policy drift. Reugularizations such as the clipping of tokens with high covariance between probability and advantage are introduced to the trajectory-level entropy control to curb over-confidence.

  State-of-the-art text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models often struggle to generate rare compositions of concepts, e.g., objects with unusual attributes. In this paper, we show that the compositional generation power of diffusion models on such rare concepts can be significantly enhanced by the Large Language Model (LLM) guidance. We start with empirical and theoretical analysis, demonstrating that exposing frequent concepts relevant to the target rare concepts during the diffusion sampling process yields more accurate concept composition. Based on this, we propose a training-free approach, R2F, that plans and executes the overall rare-to-frequent concept guidance throughout the diffusion inference by leveraging the abundant semantic knowledge in LLMs. Our framework is flexible across any pre-trained diffusion models and LLMs, and can be seamlessly integrated with the region-guided diffusion approaches. Extensive experiments on three datasets, including our newly proposed benchmark, RareBench, containing various prompts with rare compositions of concepts, R2F significantly surpasses existing models including SD3.0 and FLUX by up to 28.1%p in T2I alignment.

  _David Chanin, Adri√† Garriga-Alonso_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) extract features from LLM internal activations, meant to correspond to interpretable concepts. A core SAE training hyperparameter is L0: how many SAE features should fire per token on average. Existing work compares SAE algorithms using sparsity-reconstruction tradeoff plots, implying L0 is a free parameter with no single correct value aside from its effect on reconstruction. In this work we study the effect of L0 on SAEs, and show that if L0 is not set correctly, the SAE fails to disentangle the underlying features of the LLM. If L0 is too low, the SAE will mix correlated features to improve reconstruction. If L0 is too high, the SAE finds degenerate solutions that also mix features. Further, we present a proxy metric that can help guide the search for the correct L0 for an SAE on a given training distribution. We show that our method finds the correct L0 in toy models and coincides with peak sparse probing performance in LLM SAEs. We find that most commonly used SAEs have an L0 that is too low. Our work shows that L0 must be set correctly to train SAEs with correct features.

  Chain-of-thought (CoT) enhances the problem-solving ability of large language models (LLMs) but incurs substantial inference cost due to long autoregressive trajectories. Existing acceleration strategies either shorten traces via early stopping or compression, or adopt speculative decoding with a smaller model. However, speculative decoding provides limited gains when model agreement is low and rigidly enforces token-level consistency, overlooking the observation that some smaller models, when correct, produce significantly more concise reasoning traces that could reduce inference length. We introduce R-Stitch, a training-free hybrid decoding framework that leverages token-level entropy as an uncertainty proxy to delegate computation between a small language model (SLM) and an LLM. Our analysis shows that high-entropy tokens are more likely to induce errors, motivating an entropy-guided routing strategy that lets the SLM efficiently handle low-entropy tokens while delegating uncertain ones to the LLM, thereby avoiding full rollbacks and preserving answer quality. We further extend this design with R-Stitch$^{+}$, which learns an adaptive routing policy to adjust the token budget dynamically beyond fixed thresholds. By jointly reducing per-token decoding complexity and the number of generated tokens, our method achieves substantial acceleration with negligible accuracy loss. Concretely, it attains peak speedups of 3.00$\times$ on DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B, 3.85$\times$ on 14B, and 4.10$\times$ on QWQ-32B while maintaining accuracy comparable to full LLM decoding. Moreover, it naturally enables adaptive efficiency--accuracy trade-offs that can be tailored to diverse computational budgets without retraining.

  Recent advances in LLMs highlight RLVR as a promising method for enhancing AI's capabilities, particularly in solving complex logical tasks. However, it remains unclear whether the current practice of RLVR truly expands a model's reasoning boundary or mainly amplifies high-reward outputs that the base model already knows for improved precision. This study presents an empirical investigation that provides fresh insights into the potential limits of the common practice of RLVR. We examine how, under current training conditions, RLVR can operate as a support-constrained optimization mechanism that may restrict the discovery of entirely original solutions, remaining constrained by the base model's initial distribution. We also identify an entropy-reward trade-off: while the current RLVR recipe reliably enhances precision, it may progressively narrow exploration and potentially overlook correct yet underrepresented solutions. Extensive empirical experiments validate that while the current RLVR recipe consistently improves pass@1, the shrinkage of empirical support generally outweighs the expansion of empirical support under larger sampling budgets, failing to recover correct answers that were previously accessible to the base model. Interestingly, we also observe that while RLVR sometimes increases token-level entropy - resulting in greater uncertainty at each generation step - answer-level entropy declines, indicating that these seemingly more uncertain paths ultimately converge onto a smaller set of distinct answers. Taken together, these findings reveal potential limits of the current RLVR recipe in extending reasoning horizons. Breaking this invisible leash may require future algorithmic innovations such as explicit exploration mechanisms or hybrid strategies that seed probability mass into underrepresented solution regions.

  When large language models (LLMs) use in-context learning (ICL) to solve a new task, they must infer latent concepts from demonstration examples. This raises the question of whether and how transformers represent latent structures as part of their computation. Our work experiments with several controlled tasks, studying this question using mechanistic interpretability. First, we show that in transitive reasoning tasks with a latent, discrete concept, the model successfully identifies the latent concept and does step-by-step concept composition. This builds upon prior work that analyzes single-step reasoning. Then, we consider tasks parameterized by a latent numerical concept. We discover low-dimensional subspaces in the model's representation space, where the geometry cleanly reflects the underlying parameterization. Overall, we show that small and large models can indeed disentangle and utilize latent concepts that they learn in-context from a handful of abbreviated demonstrations.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  It is assumed that sparse autoencoders (SAEs) decompose polysemantic activations into interpretable linear directions, as long as the activations are composed of sparse linear combinations of underlying features. However, we find that if an SAE is more narrow than the number of underlying "true features" on which it is trained, and there is correlation between features, the SAE will merge components of correlated features together, thus destroying monosemanticity. In LLM SAEs, these two conditions are almost certainly true. This phenomenon, which we call feature hedging, is caused by SAE reconstruction loss, and is more severe the narrower the SAE. In this work, we introduce the problem of feature hedging and study it both theoretically in toy models and empirically in SAEs trained on LLMs. We suspect that feature hedging may be one of the core reasons that SAEs consistently underperform supervised baselines. Finally, we use our understanding of feature hedging to propose an improved variant of matryoshka SAEs. Importantly, our work shows that SAE width is not a neutral hyperparameter: narrower SAEs suffer more from hedging than wider SAEs.

  While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities, their output quality remains inconsistent across various application scenarios, making it difficult to identify trustworthy responses, especially in complex tasks requiring multi-step reasoning. In this paper, we propose a Token-level Uncertainty estimation framework for Reasoning (TokUR) that enables LLMs to self-assess and self-improve their responses in mathematical reasoning. Specifically, we introduce low-rank random weight perturbation during LLM decoding to generate predictive distributions for token-level uncertainty estimation, and we aggregate these uncertainty quantities to capture the semantic uncertainty of generated responses. Experiments on mathematical reasoning datasets of varying difficulty demonstrate that TokUR exhibits a strong correlation with answer correctness and model robustness, and the uncertainty signals produced by TokUR can be leveraged to enhance the model's reasoning performance at test time. These results highlight the effectiveness of TokUR as a principled and scalable approach for improving the reliability and interpretability of LLMs in challenging reasoning tasks.

  Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in the creation of online content, creating feedback loops as subsequent generations of models will be trained on this synthetic data. Such loops were shown to lead to distribution shifts - models misrepresenting the true underlying distributions of human data (also called model collapse). However, how human data properties affect such shifts remains poorly understood. In this paper, we provide the first empirical examination of the effect of such properties on the outcome of recursive training. We first confirm that using different human datasets leads to distribution shifts of different magnitudes. Through exhaustive manipulation of dataset properties combined with regression analyses, we then identify a set of properties predicting distribution shift magnitudes. Lexical diversity is found to amplify these shifts, while semantic diversity and data quality mitigate them. Furthermore, we find that these influences are highly modular: data scrapped from a given internet domain has little influence on the content generated for another domain. Finally, experiments on political bias reveal that human data properties affect whether the initial bias will be amplified or reduced. Overall, our results portray a novel view, where different parts of internet may undergo different types of distribution shift.

  Dense process rewards have proven a more effective alternative to the sparse outcome-level rewards in the inference-time scaling of large language models (LLMs), particularly in tasks requiring complex multi-step reasoning. While dense rewards also offer an appealing choice for the reinforcement learning (RL) of LLMs since their fine-grained rewards have the potential to address some inherent issues of outcome rewards, such as training efficiency and credit assignment, this potential remains largely unrealized. This can be primarily attributed to the challenges of training process reward models (PRMs) online, where collecting high-quality process labels is prohibitively expensive, making them particularly vulnerable to reward hacking. To address these challenges, we propose PRIME (Process Reinforcement through IMplicit rEwards), which enables online PRM updates using only policy rollouts and outcome labels through implict process rewards. PRIME combines well with various advantage functions and forgoes the dedicated reward model training phrase that existing approaches require, substantially reducing the development overhead. We demonstrate PRIME's effectiveness on competitional math and coding. Starting from Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Base, PRIME achieves a 15.1% average improvement across several key reasoning benchmarks over the SFT model. Notably, our resulting model, Eurus-2-7B-PRIME, surpasses Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Instruct on seven reasoning benchmarks with 10% of its training data.

  This study compared the performance of classical feature-based machine learning models (CMLs) and large language models (LLMs) in predicting COVID-19 mortality using high-dimensional tabular data from 9,134 patients across four hospitals. Seven CML models, including XGBoost and random forest (RF), were evaluated alongside eight LLMs, such as GPT-4 and Mistral-7b, which performed zero-shot classification on text-converted structured data. Additionally, Mistral- 7b was fine-tuned using the QLoRA approach. XGBoost and RF demonstrated superior performance among CMLs, achieving F1 scores of 0.87 and 0.83 for internal and external validation, respectively. GPT-4 led the LLM category with an F1 score of 0.43, while fine-tuning Mistral-7b significantly improved its recall from 1% to 79%, yielding a stable F1 score of 0.74 during external validation. Although LLMs showed moderate performance in zero-shot classification, fine-tuning substantially enhanced their effectiveness, potentially bridging the gap with CML models. However, CMLs still outperformed LLMs in handling high-dimensional tabular data tasks. This study highlights the potential of both CMLs and fine-tuned LLMs in medical predictive modeling, while emphasizing the current superiority of CMLs for structured data analysis.

  Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) strengthens LLM reasoning, but training often oscillates between {entropy collapse} and {entropy explosion}. We trace both hazards to the mean baseline used in value-free RL (e.g., GRPO and DAPO), which improperly penalizes negative-advantage samples under reward outliers. We propose {Quantile Advantage Estimation} (QAE), replacing the mean with a group-wise K-quantile baseline. QAE induces a response-level, two-regime gate: on hard queries (p <= 1 - K) it reinforces rare successes, while on easy queries (p > 1 - K) it targets remaining failures. Under first-order softmax updates, we prove {two-sided entropy safety}, giving lower and upper bounds on one-step entropy change that curb explosion and prevent collapse. Empirically, this minimal modification stabilizes entropy, sparsifies credit assignment (with tuned K, roughly 80% of responses receive zero advantage), and yields sustained pass@1 gains on Qwen3-8B/14B-Base across AIME 2024/2025 and AMC 2023. These results identify {baseline design} -- rather than token-level heuristics -- as the primary mechanism for scaling RLVR.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models deployed in sensitive applications increasingly require the ability to unlearn specific knowledge, such as user requests, copyrighted materials, or outdated information, without retraining from scratch to ensure regulatory compliance, user privacy, and safety. This task, known as machine unlearning, aims to remove the influence of targeted data (forgetting) while maintaining performance on the remaining data (retention). A common approach is to formulate this as a multi-objective problem and reduce it to a single-objective problem via scalarization, where forgetting and retention losses are combined using a weighted sum. However, this often results in unstable training dynamics and degraded model utility due to conflicting gradient directions. To address these challenges, we propose OFMU, a penalty-based bi-level optimization framework that explicitly prioritizes forgetting while preserving retention through a hierarchical structure. Our method enforces forgetting via an inner maximization step that incorporates a similarity-aware penalty to decorrelate the gradients of the forget and retention objectives, and restores utility through an outer minimization step. To ensure scalability, we develop a two-loop algorithm with provable convergence guarantees under both convex and non-convex regimes. We further provide a rigorous theoretical analysis of convergence rates and show that our approach achieves better trade-offs between forgetting efficacy and model utility compared to prior methods. Extensive experiments across vision and language benchmarks demonstrate that OFMU consistently outperforms existing unlearning methods in both forgetting efficacy and retained utility.

  We introduce stochastic activations. This novel strategy randomly selects between several non-linear functions in the feed-forward layer of a large language model. In particular, we choose between SILU or RELU depending on a Bernoulli draw. This strategy circumvents the optimization problem associated with RELU, namely, the constant shape for negative inputs that prevents the gradient flow. We leverage this strategy in two ways:(1) We use stochastic activations during pre-training and fine-tune the model with RELU, which is used at inference time to provide sparse latent vectors. This reduces the inference FLOPs and translates into a significant speedup in the CPU. Interestingly, this leads to much better results than training from scratch with the RELU activation function.(2) We evaluate stochastic activations for generation. This strategy performs reasonably well: it is only slightly inferior to the best deterministic non-linearity, namely SILU combined with temperature scaling. This offers an alternative to existing strategies by providing a controlled way to increase the diversity of the generated text.

  Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures in large language models (LLMs) deliver exceptional performance and reduced inference costs compared to dense LLMs. However, their large parameter counts result in prohibitive memory requirements, limiting practical deployment. While existing pruning methods primarily focus on expert-level pruning, this coarse granularity often leads to substantial accuracy degradation. In this work, we introduce HEAPr, a novel pruning algorithm that decomposes experts into smaller, indivisible atomic experts, enabling more precise and flexible atomic expert pruning. To measure the importance of each atomic expert, we leverage second-order information based on principles similar to Optimal Brain Surgeon (OBS) theory. To address the computational and storage challenges posed by second-order information, HEAPr exploits the inherent properties of atomic experts to transform the second-order information from expert parameters into that of atomic expert parameters, and further simplifies it to the second-order information of atomic expert outputs. This approach reduces the space complexity from $O(d^4)$, where d is the model's dimensionality, to $O(d^2)$. HEAPr requires only two forward passes and one backward pass on a small calibration set to compute the importance of atomic experts. Extensive experiments on MoE models, including DeepSeek MoE and Qwen MoE family, demonstrate that HEAPr outperforms existing expert-level pruning methods across a wide range of compression ratios and benchmarks. Specifically, HEAPr achieves nearly lossless compression at compression ratios of 20% ~ 25% in most models, while also reducing FLOPs nearly by 20%.

  We introduce WIRE: Wavelet-Induced Rotary Encodings. WIRE extends Rotary Position Encodings (RoPE), a popular algorithm in LLMs and ViTs, to graph-structured data. We demonstrate that WIRE is more general than RoPE, recovering the latter in the special case of grid graphs. WIRE also enjoys a host of desirable theoretical properties, including equivariance under node ordering permutation, compatibility with linear attention, and (under select assumptions) asymptotic dependence on graph resistive distance. We test WIRE on a range of synthetic and real-world tasks, including identifying monochromatic subgraphs, semantic segmentation of point clouds, and more standard graph benchmarks. We find it to be effective in settings where the underlying graph structure is important.

  The demand for efficient large language model (LLM) inference has intensified the focus on sparsification techniques. While semi-structured (N:M) pruning is well-established for weights, its application to activation pruning remains underexplored despite its potential for dynamic, input-adaptive compression and reductions in I/O overhead. This work presents a comprehensive analysis of methods for post-training N:M activation pruning in LLMs. Across multiple LLMs, we demonstrate that pruning activations enables superior preservation of generative capabilities compared to weight pruning at equivalent sparsity levels. We evaluate lightweight, plug-and-play error mitigation techniques and pruning criteria, establishing strong hardware-friendly baselines that require minimal calibration. Furthermore, we explore sparsity patterns beyond NVIDIA's standard 2:4, showing that the 16:32 pattern achieves performance nearly on par with unstructured sparsity. However, considering the trade-off between flexibility and hardware implementation complexity, we focus on the 8:16 pattern as a superior candidate. Our findings provide both effective practical methods for activation pruning and a motivation for future hardware to support more flexible sparsity patterns. Our code is availablethis https URL.

  Activation steering is a promising technique for controlling LLM behavior by adding semantically meaningful vectors directly into a model's hidden states during inference. It is often framed as a precise, interpretable, and potentially safer alternative to fine-tuning. We demonstrate the opposite: steering systematically breaks model alignment safeguards, making it comply with harmful requests. Through extensive experiments on different model families, we show that even steering in a random direction can increase the probability of harmful compliance from 0% to 2-27%. Alarmingly, steering benign features from a sparse autoencoder (SAE), a common source of interpretable directions, increases these rates by a further 2-4%. Finally, we show that combining 20 randomly sampled vectors that jailbreak a single prompt creates a universal attack, significantly increasing harmful compliance on unseen requests. These results challenge the paradigm of safety through interpretability, showing that precise control over model internals does not guarantee precise control over model behavior.

  We address the challenge of generating diverse attack prompts for large language models (LLMs) that elicit harmful behaviors (e.g., insults, sexual content) and are used for safety fine-tuning. Rather than relying on manual prompt engineering, attacker LLMs can be trained with reinforcement learning (RL) to automatically generate such prompts using only a toxicity classifier as a reward. However, capturing a wide range of harmful behaviors is a significant challenge that requires explicit diversity objectives. Existing diversity-seeking RL methods often collapse to limited modes: once high-reward prompts are found, exploration of new regions is discouraged. Inspired by the active learning paradigm that encourages adaptive exploration, we introduce \textit{Active Attacks}, a novel RL-based red-teaming algorithm that adapts its attacks as the victim evolves. By periodically safety fine-tuning the victim LLM with collected attack prompts, rewards in exploited regions diminish, which forces the attacker to seek unexplored vulnerabilities. This process naturally induces an easy-to-hard exploration curriculum, where the attacker progresses beyond easy modes toward increasingly difficult ones. As a result, Active Attacks uncovers a wide range of local attack modes step by step, and their combination achieves wide coverage of the multi-mode distribution. Active Attacks, a simple plug-and-play module that seamlessly integrates into existing RL objectives, unexpectedly outperformed prior RL-based methods -- including GFlowNets, PPO, and REINFORCE -- by improving cross-attack success rates against GFlowNets, the previous state-of-the-art, from 0.07% to 31.28% (a relative gain greater than $400\ \times$) with only a 6% increase in computation.

  Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) is a practical and scalable approach to enhancing large language models in areas such as math, code, and other structured tasks. Two questions motivate this paper: how much of the reported gains survive under strictly parity-controlled evaluation, and whether RLVR is cost-free or exacts a measurable tax. We argue that progress is real, but gains are often overstated due to three forces - an RLVR tax, evaluation pitfalls, and data contamination. Using a partial-prompt contamination audit and matched-budget reproductions across base and RL models, we show that several headline gaps shrink or vanish under clean, parity-controlled evaluation. We then propose a tax-aware training and evaluation protocol that co-optimizes accuracy, grounding, and calibrated abstention and standardizes budgeting and provenance checks. Applied to recent RLVR setups, this protocol yields more reliable estimates of reasoning gains and, in several cases, revises prior conclusions. Our position is constructive: RLVR is valuable and industry-ready; we advocate keeping its practical benefits while prioritizing reliability, safety, and measurement.

  As a model-agnostic approach to long context modeling, multi-agent systems can process inputs longer than a large language model's context window without retraining or architectural modifications. However, their performance often heavily relies on hand-crafted multi-agent collaboration strategies and prompt engineering, which limit generalizability. In this work, we introduce a principled framework that formalizes the model-agnostic long context modeling problem as a compression problem, yielding an information-theoretic compression objective. Building on this framework, we propose Graph of Agents (GoA), which dynamically constructs an input-dependent collaboration structure that maximizes this objective. For Llama 3.1 8B and Qwen3 8B across six document question answering benchmarks, GoA improves the average $F_1$ score of retrieval-augmented generation by 5.7\% and a strong multi-agent baseline using a fixed collaboration structure by 16.35\%, respectively. Even with only a 2K context window, GoA surpasses the 128K context window Llama 3.1 8B on LongBench, showing a dramatic increase in effective context length.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Group relative policy optimization (GRPO) has demonstrated significant potential in improving the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) via reinforcement learning. However, its practical deployment is impeded by an excessively slow training process, primarily attributed to the computationally intensive autoregressive generation of multiple responses per query, which makes the generation phase the primary performance bottleneck. Although speculative decoding presents a promising direction for acceleration, its direct application in GRPO achieves limited speedup under high-concurrency training conditions. To overcome this limitation, we propose a concurrency-aware speculative decoding framework that dynamically adjusts the drafting and verification strategy according to real-time concurrency levels, thereby maximizing the acceleration of the generation process. Furthermore, to address performance degradation arising from distributional drift between the evolving target model and the fixed draft model during training, we introduce an online draft learning mechanism that enables the draft model to continuously adapt using feedback signals from the target model. Experimental results across multiple mathematical reasoning datasets and models demonstrate that the proposed method achieves end-to-end speedups of 2.35x to 2.72x, significantly surpassing baseline approaches in efficiency.

  Lead optimization in drug discovery requires efficiently navigating vast chemical space through iterative cycles to enhance molecular properties while preserving structural similarity to the original lead compound. Despite recent advances, traditional optimization methods struggle with sample efficiency-achieving good optimization performance with limited oracle evaluations. Large Language Models (LLMs) provide a promising approach through their in-context learning and instruction following capabilities, which align naturally with these iterative processes. However, existing LLM-based methods fail to leverage this strength, treating each optimization step independently. To address this, we present POLO (Preference-guided multi-turn Optimization for Lead Optimization), which enables LLMs to learn from complete optimization trajectories rather than isolated steps. At its core, POLO introduces Preference-Guided Policy Optimization (PGPO), a novel reinforcement learning algorithm that extracts learning signals at two complementary levels: trajectory-level optimization reinforces successful strategies, while turn-level preference learning provides dense comparative feedback by ranking intermediate molecules within each trajectory. Through this dual-level learning from intermediate evaluation, POLO achieves superior sample efficiency by fully exploiting each costly oracle call. Extensive experiments demonstrate that POLO achieves 84% average success rate on single-property tasks (2.3x better than baselines) and 50% on multi-property tasks using only 500 oracle evaluations, significantly advancing the state-of-the-art in sample-efficient molecular optimization.

  Large language models (LLMs) are now ubiquitous in everyday tools, raising urgent safety concerns about their tendency to generate harmful content. The dominant safety approach -- reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) -- effectively shapes model behavior during training but offers no safeguards at inference time, where unsafe continuations may still arise. We propose BRT-Align, a reachability-based framework that brings control-theoretic safety tools to LLM inference. BRT-Align models autoregressive generation as a dynamical system in latent space and learn a safety value function via backward reachability, estimating the worst-case evolution of a trajectory. This enables two complementary mechanisms: (1) a runtime monitor that forecasts unsafe completions several tokens in advance, and (2) a least-restrictive steering filter that minimally perturbs latent states to redirect generation away from unsafe regions. Experiments across multiple LLMs and toxicity benchmarks demonstrate that BRT-Align provides more accurate and earlier detection of unsafe continuations than baselines. Moreover, for LLM safety alignment, BRT-Align substantially reduces unsafe generations while preserving sentence diversity and coherence. Qualitative results further highlight emergent alignment properties: BRT-Align consistently produces responses that are less violent, less profane, less offensive, and less politically biased. Together, these findings demonstrate that reachability analysis provides a principled and practical foundation for inference-time LLM safety.

  Reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) often suffers from \emph{reward over-optimization}, where a policy model hacks the reward signals to achieve high scores while producing low-quality outputs. Our theoretical analysis shows that the key lies in reward misspecification at the high-reward tail: the inability to reliably distinguish Excellent responses from merely Great ones. This motivate us to focus on the high-reward region. However, such tail examples are scarce under the base LLM. While off-policy exemplars (e.g. from stronger models or rewrites) are easier to obtain, naively training on them yields a misspecified reward for the policy we aim to align. To address this, we study rubric-based rewards. By design, rubrics can leverage off-policy examples while remaining insensitive to their artifacts. To elicit rubrics that capture the high-reward tail, we highlight the importance of distinguishing among great and diverse responses, and introduce a workflow to implement this idea. We empirically demonstrate that rubric-based rewards substantially mitigate reward over-optimization and deliver effective LLM post-training improvements. Our code can be accessed atthis https URL.

  Training large language models typically demands extensive GPU memory and substantial financial investment, which poses a barrier for many small- to medium-sized teams. In this paper, we propose a full-parameter pre-training and fine-tuning framework based on block coordinate descent (BCD), enhanced with engineering optimizations, to enable efficient training of large-scale models on cost-effective RTX 4090, A100 and A800 GPU clusters. Under identical hardware configurations, we reduce the training cost of a 7B model to 33% on A100/A800 and only 2.6% on RTX 4090, compared to standard full-parameter training. It also enables large models previously restricted to A100 clusters to be trained on RTX 4090 without degrading performance. BCD achieves comparable or better accuracy than full-parameter and fine-tuning methods at most cases, with lower GPU consumption and improved hardware utilization.

  The goal of quantization is to produce a compressed model whose output distribution is as close to the original model's as possible. To do this tractably, most quantization algorithms minimize the immediate activation error of each layer as a proxy for the end-to-end error. However, this ignores the effect of future layers, making it a poor proxy. In this work, we introduce Yet Another Quantization Algorithm (YAQA), an adaptive rounding algorithm that directly considers the error at the network's output. YAQA introduces a series of theoretical results that culminate in the first end-to-end error bounds for quantization algorithms. First, we characterize the convergence time of adaptive rounding algorithms via the structure of their Hessian approximations. We then show that the end-to-end error can be bounded by the approximation's cosine similarity to the true Hessian. This admits a natural Kronecker-factored approximation with corresponding near-optimal Hessian sketches. YAQA is provably better than GPTQ/LDLQ and empirically reduces the error by $\approx 30\%$ over these methods. YAQA even achieves a lower error than quantization aware training. This translates to state of the art performance on downstream tasks, all while adding no inference overhead.

  Existing parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods for large language models (LLMs), such as LoRA and PiSSA, constrain model updates to low-rank subspaces, limiting their expressiveness and leading to suboptimal performance on complex tasks. To address this, we introduce High-rank Distributed PiSSA (HD-PiSSA), a distributed PEFT approach that initializes orthogonal adapters across different devices and aggregates their delta updates collectively on W for fine-tuning. Unlike Data Parallel LoRA or PiSSA, which maintain identical adapters across all devices, HD-PiSSA assigns different principal components of the pre-trained weights to each GPU, significantly expanding the range of update directions. This results in over 16x higher effective updated ranks than data-parallel LoRA or PiSSA when fine-tuning on 8 GPUs with the same per-device adapter rank. Empirically, we evaluate HD-PiSSA across various challenging downstream tasks, including mathematics, code generation, and multi-task learning. In the multi-task setting, HD-PiSSA achieves average gains of 10.0 absolute points (14.63%) over LoRA and 4.98 points (6.60%) over PiSSA across 12 benchmarks, demonstrating its benefits from the extra optimization flexibility.

  Nowadays, real-world data, including graph-structure data, often arrives in a streaming manner, which means that learning systems need to continuously acquire new knowledge without forgetting previously learned information. Although substantial existing works attempt to address catastrophic forgetting in graph machine learning, they are all based on training from scratch with streaming data. With the rise of pretrained models, an increasing number of studies have leveraged their strong generalization ability for continual learning. Therefore, in this work, we attempt to answer whether large language models (LLMs) can mitigate catastrophic forgetting in Graph Continual Learning (GCL). We first point out that current experimental setups for GCL have significant flaws, as the evaluation stage may lead to task ID leakage. Then, we evaluate the performance of LLMs in more realistic scenarios and find that even minor modifications can lead to outstanding results. Finally, based on extensive experiments, we propose a simple-yet-effective method, Simple Graph Continual Learning (SimGCL), that surpasses the previous state-of-the-art GNN-based baseline by around 20% under the rehearsal-free constraint. To facilitate reproducibility, we have developed an easy-to-use benchmark LLM4GCL for training and evaluating existing GCL methods. The code is available at:this https URL.

  Low-rank optimization has emerged as a promising direction in training large language models (LLMs) to improve running time and reduce the memory usage of adaptive optimizers by constraining learning to a lower-dimensional space. Prior work typically projects gradients of linear layers using approaches based on Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) or QR-decomposition. Applying these techniques individually to each layer in large models is computationally expensive and incurs additional memory costs due to storing the projection matrices. In this work, we propose a computationally efficient and conceptually simple, two-step procedure to approximate SVD/QR-based gradient projections into lower-dimensional spaces by using a predefined orthogonal matrix of the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT). We dynamically select columns from the DCT matrix based on their alignment with the gradient of each layer. The effective projection matrices are obtained via a simple matmul with the DCT matrix in $O(n^3)$ time, followed by a lightweight sorting step to identify the most relevant basis vectors. For large layers, DCT can be computed via Makhoul's $N$-point algorithm based on Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) in $O(n^2 \log(n))$ time. Due to the predefined nature of the orthogonal bases, they are computed once at the start of training. Our numerical experiments on both pre-training and fine-tuning tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our dual strategy in approximating optimal low-rank projections, obtaining an approach with rank-independent running time that matches the performance of costly SVD/QR-based methods while achieving faster runtime and reduced memory usage by up to $25\%$ across different model sizes.

  Low-bit post-training quantization (PTQ) is a practical route to deploy reasoning-capable LLMs under tight memory and latency budgets, yet it can markedly impair mathematical reasoning (drops up to 69.81% in our harder settings). We address two deployment-critical questions with process-level precision: Where along a step-structured solution does degradation first arise? How to mitigate it while staying in the low-bit regime? Across widely used PTQ methods (AWQ, GPTQ, SmoothQuant), open-source model families (Qwen, LLaMA; 0.5--7B), and math reasoning benchmarks (GSM8K, MATH, AIME), we perform format-aligned chain-of-thought with step-aligned attribution and uncover two robust regularities: (i) PTQ disproportionately elevates method and execution errors relative to high-level conceptual mistakes; and (ii) failures emerge early, with the first vulnerable step flipping and cascading to the final answer. These regularities suggest a general intervention principle: restore local token-level margins exactly at the earliest failure frontier. We instantiate this principle as a lightweight measure$\rightarrow$locate$\rightarrow$restore loop that operates directly on the quantized model: detect the first faulty step, construct our "Silver Bullet" datasets, and apply small-scale supervised/preference tuning. In our settings, as few as 332 curated examples and 3--5 minutes of compute on a single GPU recover 4-bit weight math reasoning toward the full-precision baseline while preserving PTQ efficiency. Our framework is quantizer- and architecture-agnostic within the evaluated regimes, and turns low-bit degradation from a global accuracy problem into a local, reproducible process intervention.

  When ML algorithms are deployed to automate human-related decisions, human agents may learn the underlying decision policies and adapt their behavior. Strategic Classification (SC) has emerged as a framework for studying this interaction between agents and decision-makers to design more trustworthy ML systems. Prior theoretical models in SC assume that agents are perfectly or approximately rational and respond to decision policies by optimizing their utility. However, the growing prevalence of LLMs raises the possibility that real-world agents may instead rely on these tools for strategic advice. This shift prompts two questions: (i) Can LLMs generate effective and socially responsible strategies in SC settings? (ii) Can existing SC theoretical models accurately capture agent behavior when agents follow LLM-generated advice? To investigate these questions, we examine five critical SC scenarios: hiring, loan applications, school admissions, personal income, and public assistance programs. We simulate agents with diverse profiles who interact with three commercial LLMs (GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, and GPT-5), following their suggestions on effort allocations on features. We compare the resulting agent behaviors with the best responses in existing SC models. Our findings show that: (i) Even without access to the decision policy, LLMs can generate effective strategies that improve both agents' scores and qualification; (ii) At the population level, LLM-guided effort allocation strategies yield similar or even higher score improvements, qualification rates, and fairness metrics as those predicted by the SC theoretical model, suggesting that the theoretical model may still serve as a reasonable proxy for LLM-influenced behavior; and (iii) At the individual level, LLMs tend to produce more diverse and balanced effort allocations than theoretical models.

  Mobility Foundation Models (MFMs) have advanced the modeling of human movement patterns, yet they face a ceiling due to limitations in data scale and semantic understanding. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer powerful semantic reasoning, they lack the innate understanding of spatio-temporal statistics required for generating physically plausible mobility trajectories. To address these gaps, we propose MoveFM-R, a novel framework that unlocks the full potential of mobility foundation models by leveraging language-driven semantic reasoning capabilities. It tackles two key challenges: the vocabulary mismatch between continuous geographic coordinates and discrete language tokens, and the representation gap between the latent vectors of MFMs and the semantic world of LLMs. MoveFM-R is built on three core innovations: a semantically enhanced location encoding to bridge the geography-language gap, a progressive curriculum to align the LLM's reasoning with mobility patterns, and an interactive self-reflection mechanism for conditional trajectory generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MoveFM-R significantly outperforms existing MFM-based and LLM-based baselines. It also shows robust generalization in zero-shot settings and excels at generating realistic trajectories from natural language instructions. By synthesizing the statistical power of MFMs with the deep semantic understanding of LLMs, MoveFM-R pioneers a new paradigm that enables a more comprehensive, interpretable, and powerful modeling of human mobility. The implementation of MoveFM-R is available online atthis https URL.

  As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated in diverse applications, obtaining reliable measures of their predictive uncertainty has become critically important. A precise distinction between aleatoric uncertainty, arising from inherent ambiguities within input data, and epistemic uncertainty, originating exclusively from model limitations, is essential to effectively address each uncertainty source. In this paper, we introduce Spectral Uncertainty, a novel approach to quantifying and decomposing uncertainties in LLMs. Leveraging the Von Neumann entropy from quantum information theory, Spectral Uncertainty provides a rigorous theoretical foundation for separating total uncertainty into distinct aleatoric and epistemic components. Unlike existing baseline methods, our approach incorporates a fine-grained representation of semantic similarity, enabling nuanced differentiation among various semantic interpretations in model responses. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that Spectral Uncertainty outperforms state-of-the-art methods in estimating both aleatoric and total uncertainty across diverse models and benchmark datasets.

  Large language models trained on web-scale data can memorize private or sensitive knowledge, raising significant privacy risks. Although some unlearning methods mitigate these risks, they remain vulnerable to "relearning" during subsequent training, allowing a substantial portion of forgotten knowledge to resurface. In this paper, we show that widely used unlearning methods cause shallow alignment: instead of faithfully erasing target knowledge, they generate spurious unlearning neurons that amplify negative influence to hide it. To overcome this limitation, we introduce Ssiuu, a new class of unlearning methods that employs attribution-guided regularization to prevent spurious negative influence and faithfully remove target knowledge. Experimental results confirm that our method reliably erases target knowledge and outperforms strong baselines across two practical retraining scenarios: (1) adversarial injection of private data, and (2) benign attack using an instruction-following benchmark. Our findings highlight the necessity of robust and faithful unlearning methods for safe deployment of language models.

  Irregular sampling and high missingness are intrinsic challenges in modeling time series derived from electronic health records (EHRs),where clinical variables are measured at uneven intervals depending on workflow and intervention timing. To address this, we propose VITAL, a variable-aware, large language model (LLM) based framework tailored for learning from irregularly sampled physiological time series. VITAL differentiates between two distinct types of clinical variables: vital signs, which are frequently recorded and exhibit temporal patterns, and laboratory tests, which are measured sporadically and lack temporal structure. It reprograms vital signs into the language space, enabling the LLM to capture temporal context and reason over missing values through explicit encoding. In contrast, laboratory variables are embedded either using representative summary values or a learnable [Not measured] token, depending on their availability. Extensive evaluations on the benchmark datasets from the PhysioNet demonstrate that VITAL outperforms state of the art methods designed for irregular time series. Furthermore, it maintains robust performance under high levels of missingness, which is prevalent in real world clinical scenarios where key variables are often unavailable.

  Despite their proficiency in various language tasks, Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle with combinatorial problems like Satisfiability, Traveling Salesman Problem, or even basic arithmetic. We address this gap through a novel approach for solving problems in the class NP. We focus on the paradigmatic task of Sudoku and achieve state-of-the-art accuracy (99\%) compared to prior neuro-symbolic approaches. Unlike prior work that used custom architectures, our method employs a vanilla decoder-only Transformer (GPT-2) without external tools or function calling. Our method integrates imitation learning of simple Sudoku rules with an explicit Depth-First Search (DFS) exploration strategy involving informed guessing and backtracking. Moving beyond imitation learning, we seek to minimize the number of guesses until reaching a solution. We provide a rigorous analysis of this setup formalizing its connection to a contextual variant of Min-Sum Set Cover, a well-studied problem in algorithms and stochastic optimization.

  Real-world decision-making tasks typically occur in complex and open environments, posing significant challenges to reinforcement learning (RL) agents' exploration efficiency and long-horizon planning capabilities. A promising approach is LLM-enhanced RL, which leverages the rich prior knowledge and strong planning capabilities of LLMs to guide RL agents in efficient exploration. However, existing methods mostly rely on frequent and costly LLM invocations and suffer from limited performance due to the semantic mismatch. In this paper, we introduce a Structured Goal-guided Reinforcement Learning (SGRL) method that integrates a structured goal planner and a goal-conditioned action pruner to guide RL agents toward efficient exploration. Specifically, the structured goal planner utilizes LLMs to generate a reusable, structured function for goal generation, in which goals are prioritized. Furthermore, by utilizing LLMs to determine goals' priority weights, it dynamically generates forward-looking goals to guide the agent's policy toward more promising decision-making trajectories. The goal-conditioned action pruner employs an action masking mechanism that filters out actions misaligned with the current goal, thereby constraining the RL agent to select goal-consistent policies. We evaluate the proposed method on Crafter and Craftax-Classic, and experimental results demonstrate that SGRL achieves superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.

  We propose ILP-CoT, a method that bridges Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for abductive logical rule induction. The task involves both discovering logical facts and inducing logical rules from a small number of unstructured textual or visual inputs, which still remain challenging when solely relying on ILP, due to the requirement of specified background knowledge and high computational cost, or MLLMs, due to the appearance of perceptual hallucinations. Based on the key observation that MLLMs could propose structure-correct rules even under hallucinations, our approach automatically builds ILP tasks with pruned search spaces based on the rule structure proposals from MLLMs, and utilizes ILP system to output rules built upon rectified logical facts and formal inductive reasoning. Its effectiveness is verified through challenging logical induction benchmarks, as well as a potential application of our approach, namely text-to-image customized generation with rule induction. Our code and data are released atthis https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a framework for grounding Large Language Models (LLMs) in external, up-to-date information. However, recent advancements in context window size allow LLMs to process inputs of up to 128K tokens or more, offering an alternative strategy: supplying the full document context directly to the model, rather than relying on RAG to retrieve a subset of contexts. Nevertheless, this emerging alternative strategy has notable limitations: (i) it is token-inefficient to handle large and potentially redundant contexts; (ii) it exacerbates the `lost in the middle' phenomenon; and (iii) under limited model capacity, it amplifies distraction, ultimately degrading LLM output quality. In this paper, we propose LDAR (Learning Distraction-Aware Retrieval), an adaptive retriever that learns to retrieve contexts in a way that mitigates interference from distracting passages, thereby achieving significantly higher performance with reduced token usage compared to long-context approaches. Extensive experiments across diverse LLM architectures and six knowledge-intensive benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our approach, highlighting the importance of balancing the trade-off between information coverage and distraction.

  Recent advances in molecular foundation models have shown impressive performance in molecular property prediction and de novo molecular design, with promising applications in areas such as drug discovery and reaction prediction. Nevertheless, most existing approaches rely exclusively on SMILES representations and overlook both experimental spectra and 3D structural information-two indispensable sources for capturing molecular behavior in real-world scenarios. This limitation reduces their effectiveness in tasks where stereochemistry, spatial conformation, and experimental validation are critical. To overcome these challenges, we propose MolSpectLLM, a molecular foundation model pretrained on Qwen2.5-7B that unifies experimental spectroscopy with molecular 3D structure. By explicitly modeling molecular spectra, MolSpectLLM achieves state-of-the-art performance on spectrum-related tasks, with an average accuracy of 0.53 across NMR, IR, and MS benchmarks. MolSpectLLM also shows strong performance on the spectra analysis task, obtaining 15.5% sequence accuracy and 41.7% token accuracy on Spectra-to-SMILES, substantially outperforming large general-purpose LLMs. More importantly, MolSpectLLM not only achieves strong performance on molecular elucidation tasks, but also generates accurate 3D molecular structures directly from SMILES or spectral inputs, bridging spectral analysis, molecular elucidation, and molecular design.

  High-frequency physiological waveform modality offers deep, real-time insights into patient status. Recently, physiological foundation models based on Photoplethysmography (PPG), such as PPG-GPT, have been shown to predict critical events, including Cardiac Arrest (CA). However, their powerful representation still needs to be leveraged suitably, especially when the downstream data/label is scarce. We offer three orthogonal improvements to improve PPG-only CA systems by using minimal auxiliary information. First, we propose to use time-to-event modeling, either through simple regression to the event onset time or by pursuing fine-grained discrete survival modeling. Second, we encourage the model to learn CA-focused features by making them patient-identity invariant. This is achieved by first training the largest-scale de-identified biometric identification model, referred to as the p-vector, and subsequently using it adversarially to deconfound cues, such as person identity, that may cause overfitting through memorization. Third, we propose regression on the pseudo-lab values generated by pre-trained auxiliary estimator networks. This is crucial since true blood lab measurements, such as lactate, sodium, troponin, and potassium, are collected sparingly. Via zero-shot prediction, the auxiliary networks can enrich cardiac arrest waveform labels and generate pseudo-continuous estimates as targets. Our proposals can independently improve the 24-hour time-averaged AUC from the 0.74 to the 0.78-0.80 range. We primarily improve over longer time horizons with minimal degradation near the event, thus pushing the Early Warning System research. Finally, we pursue multi-task formulation and diagnose it with a high gradient conflict rate among competing losses, which we alleviate via the PCGrad optimization technique.

  Multimodal Procedural Planning (MPP) aims to generate step-by-step instructions that combine text and images, with the central challenge of preserving object-state consistency across modalities while producing informative plans. Existing approaches often leverage large language models (LLMs) to refine textual steps; however, visual object-state alignment and systematic evaluation are largely underexplored. We present MMPlanner, a zero-shot MPP framework that introduces Object State Reasoning Chain-of-Thought (OSR-CoT) prompting to explicitly model object-state transitions and generate accurate multimodal plans. To assess plan quality, we design LLM-as-a-judge protocols for planning accuracy and cross-modal alignment, and further propose a visual step-reordering task to measure temporal coherence. Experiments on RECIPEPLAN and WIKIPLAN show that MMPlanner achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving textual planning by +6.8%, cross-modal alignment by +11.9%, and visual step ordering by +26.7%

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods must be resource-efficient yet handle heterogeneous reasoning transformations, and classical low-rank adaptation (LoRA) is constrained by the nominal rank $r$. Hadamard-style extensions like HiRA raise the nominal rank but couple every update to the global energy pattern of the frozen weight matrix, while ABBA trades this inductive bias for fully learned dense intermediates. To address the limitation of global modulation, we propose Block Hadamard high-Rank Adaptation (BHRA), which partitions each weight matrix and applies HiRA-style multiplicative modulation independently within every block, preserving the PEFT parameter footprint while unlocking localized rank amplification. Our empirical analyses reveal that this blockwise design maintains rich spectra across rank budgets, mitigating the collapse induced by global modulation. Across eight commonsense reasoning tasks and two arithmetic benchmarks with Llama-3.2 1B/3B, Mistral-7B, and Gemma-2 9B, BHRA consistently surpasses strong PEFT baselines under matched parameter budgets.

  The possibility of LLM self-awareness and even sentience is gaining increasing public attention and has major safety and policy implications, but the science of measuring them is still in a nascent state. Here we introduce a novel methodology for quantitatively evaluating metacognitive abilities in LLMs. Taking inspiration from research on metacognition in nonhuman animals, our approach eschews model self-reports and instead tests to what degree models can strategically deploy knowledge of internal states. Using two experimental paradigms, we demonstrate that frontier LLMs introduced since early 2024 show increasingly strong evidence of certain metacognitive abilities, specifically the ability to assess and utilize their own confidence in their ability to answer factual and reasoning questions correctly and the ability to anticipate what answers they would give and utilize that information appropriately. We buttress these behavioral findings with an analysis of the token probabilities returned by the models, which suggests the presence of an upstream internal signal that could provide the basis for metacognition. We further find that these abilities 1) are limited in resolution, 2) emerge in context-dependent manners, and 3) seem to be qualitatively different from those of humans. We also report intriguing differences across models of similar capabilities, suggesting that LLM post-training may have a role in developing metacognitive abilities.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at in-context learning, the ability to use information provided as context to improve prediction of future tokens. Induction heads have been argued to play a crucial role for in-context learning in Transformer Language Models. These attention heads make a token attend to successors of past occurrences of the same token in the input. This basic mechanism supports LLMs' ability to copy and predict repeating patterns. However, it is unclear if this same mechanism can support in-context learning of more complex repetitive patterns with hierarchical structure. Natural language is teeming with such cases: The article "the" in English usually prefaces multiple nouns in a text. When predicting which token succeeds a particular instance of "the", we need to integrate further contextual cues from the text to predict the correct noun. If induction heads naively attend to all past instances of successor tokens of "the" in a context-independent manner, they cannot support this level of contextual information integration. In this study, we design a synthetic in-context learning task, where tokens are repeated with hierarchical dependencies. Here, attending uniformly to all successor tokens is not sufficient to accurately predict future tokens. Evaluating a range of LLMs on these token sequences and natural language analogues, we find adaptive induction heads that support prediction by learning what to attend to in-context. Next, we investigate how induction heads themselves learn in-context. We find evidence that learning is supported by attention heads that uncover a set of latent contexts, determining the different token transition relationships. Overall, we not only show that LLMs have induction heads that learn, but offer a complete mechanistic account of how LLMs learn to predict higher-order repetitive patterns in-context.

  Data augmentation is a widely used strategy to improve model robustness and generalization by enriching training datasets with synthetic examples. While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong generative capabilities for this purpose, their applications in high-stakes domains like healthcare present unique challenges due to the risk of generating clinically incorrect or misleading information. In this work, we propose a novel query-based model collaboration framework that integrates expert-level domain knowledge to guide the augmentation process to preserve critical medical information. Experiments on clinical prediction tasks demonstrate that our lightweight collaboration-based approach consistently outperforms existing LLM augmentation methods while improving safety through reduced factual errors. This framework addresses the gap between LLM augmentation potential and the safety requirements of specialized domains.

  Tabular foundation models are becoming increasingly popular for low-resource tabular problems. These models make up for small training datasets by pretraining on large volumes of synthetic data. The prior knowledge obtained via pretraining provides the exceptional performance, but the resulting model becomes a black box that is difficult to interpret and costly to inference. In this work, we explore an alternative strategy: using reasoning-capable LLMs to induce decision trees for small tabular datasets in agentic setup. We design a minimal set of tools for constructing, analyzing and manipulating decision trees. By using these tools, LLMs combine their prior knowledge with learning from data to create a lightweight decision tree that outperforms traditional CART on low-resource tabular problems. While a single decision tree does not outperform state-of-the-art black box models, it comes with a human-readable reasoning trace that can be checked for biases and data leaks. Furthermore, the reasoning-based LLM's creation process allows for additional human input: correcting biases or incorporating domain-specific intuition that is not captured in the data.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The integration of new modalities enhances the capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) but also introduces additional vulnerabilities. In particular, simple visual jailbreaking attacks can manipulate open-source MLLMs more readily than sophisticated textual attacks. However, these underdeveloped attacks exhibit extremely limited cross-model transferability, failing to reliably identify vulnerabilities in closed-source MLLMs. In this work, we analyse the loss landscape of these jailbreaking attacks and find that the generated attacks tend to reside in high-sharpness regions, whose effectiveness is highly sensitive to even minor parameter changes during transfer. To further explain the high-sharpness localisations, we analyse their feature representations in both the intermediate layers and the spectral domain, revealing an improper reliance on narrow layer representations and semantically poor frequency components. Building on this, we propose a Feature Over-Reliance CorrEction (FORCE) method, which guides the attack to explore broader feasible regions across layer features and rescales the influence of frequency features according to their semantic content. By eliminating non-generalizable reliance on both layer and spectral features, our method discovers flattened feasible regions for visual jailbreaking attacks, thereby improving cross-model transferability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach effectively facilitates visual red-teaming evaluations against closed-source MLLMs.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) offer broad utility but remain prone to hallucination and out-of-distribution (OOD) errors. We propose EigenTrack, an interpretable real-time detector that uses the spectral geometry of hidden activations, a compact global signature of model dynamics. By streaming covariance-spectrum statistics such as entropy, eigenvalue gaps, and KL divergence from random baselines into a lightweight recurrent classifier, EigenTrack tracks temporal shifts in representation structure that signal hallucination and OOD drift before surface errors appear. Unlike black- and grey-box methods, it needs only a single forward pass without resampling. Unlike existing white-box detectors, it preserves temporal context, aggregates global signals, and offers interpretable accuracy-latency trade-offs.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized numerous fields, yet their adaptation to specialized tasks in privacy-sensitive domains such as healthcare and finance remains constrained due to the scarcity of accessible training data caused by stringent privacy requirements. Secure Multi-party Computation (MPC)-based privacy-preserving machine learning provides theoretical guarantees for the privacy of model parameters and data. However, its application to LLMs has been predominantly limited to inference, as fine-tuning introduces significant efficiency challenges, particularly in backward propagation, optimizer, and self-attention operations. To address these challenges, we propose SecP-Tuning, the first MPC-based framework designed for efficient, privacy-preserving prompt tuning of LLMs. SecP-Tuning innovatively integrates Forward-only Tuning (FoT) through the ``data owner-server interaction" paradigm, effectively removing the need for privacy-preserving computations in backward propagation and optimization processes. Furthermore, it devises an efficient privacy-preserving Random Feature Attention (RFA), effectively mitigating the computational complexity of softmax-based self-attention and circumventing MPC-incompatible nonlinear operations. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to full-Parameter Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and gradient-based prompt tuning, SecP-Tuning achieves approximately 12 times and 16 times end-to-end acceleration, as well as 18 times and 20 times reductions in communication overhead, respectively. Moreover, in five few-shot tasks, it achieves an average performance score of 82.45, outperforming SFT's 79.90 and prompt tuning's 73.73. Additionally, the ``black-box/API-style" privacy-preserving tuning paradigm of SecP-Tuning effectively avoids memory leakage risks caused by gradient/parameter transmission.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Latent-space monitors aim to detect undesirable behaviours in Large Language Models by leveraging their internal representations rather than relying solely on black-box outputs. These methods have shown promise in identifying behaviours such as deception and unsafe completions. However, these monitors may themselves become training signals, for example, by using problematic samples found in deployment to retrain models. This raises an important question: can models learn to evade such monitors? To evaluate this capability, we introduce RL-Obfuscation, in which LLMs are finetuned via reinforcement learning to evade latent-space monitors while maintaining their blackbox behaviour. We apply RL-Obfuscation to Language Models ranging from 7B to 14B parameters and evaluate their Evasion Success Rate against a suite of monitors. We find that token-level monitors are highly vulnerable to this attack while more holistic monitors, such as max-pooling or attention-based probes, remain robust. Moreover, for these vulnerable monitors, models trained to evade a single static monitor can generalise to evade other unseen monitors. We also find that the models can be trained to conditionally bypass latent-space monitors on only certain inputs. Finally, we study how the models bypass these monitors and find that the model can learn to repurpose tokens to have different internal representations.

  Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a pivotal method for improving the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, prevalent RL approaches such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Group-Regularized Policy Optimization (GRPO) face critical limitations due to their reliance on sparse outcome-based rewards and inadequate mechanisms for incentivizing exploration. These limitations result in inefficient guidance for reasoning. Specifically, sparse rewards fail to deliver sufficient feedback, particularly for challenging problems. Furthermore, such rewards induce systematic biases that prioritize exploitation of familiar trajectories over novel solution discovery. These shortcomings critically hinder performance in complex reasoning tasks, which inherently demand iterative refinement across intermediate steps. To address these challenges, we propose an Intrinsic Motivation guidEd exploratioN meThOd foR LLM Reasoning (i-MENTOR), a method designed to deliver dense rewards and amplify exploration in the RL-based paradigm. i-MENTOR introduces three innovations: trajectory-aware exploration rewards that mitigate bias in token-level strategies while maintaining computational efficiency; error-conditioned reward allocation to ensure efficient exploration on challenging samples while intrinsically stabilizing training; and advantage-preserving integration that maintains advantage distribution integrity while incorporating exploratory guidance. Experiments across 4 public datasets demonstrate i-MENTOR's effectiveness, achieving a 22.23\% improvement on AIME 2024.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Sparse attention mechanisms aim to reduce computational overhead with minimal accuracy loss by selectively processing salient tokens. Despite their effectiveness, most methods merely exploit a model's inherent sparsity and thus plateau at moderate budgets (about 50\% token reduction), with little headroom to push budget lower without hurting accuracy. Other approaches attempt to enforce sparsity through trainable sparse attention or sharpness-inducing regularizers, but these either fix rigid patterns that ignore input and layer dynamics, or optimize proxy objectives without direct control over token budgets. In this paper, we explicitly reinforce token sparsity in well-posed multimodal large language models (MLLMs) through a simple RL-based post-training framework named \textit{Sparsity Forcing}. Our method explores the efficiency-accuracy trade-off by running multiple rollouts with different token budgets, where both efficiency (token reduction ratio) and performance (answer correctness) are formulated as joint rewards. By contrasting rollouts within each group, the more efficient and correct answer is rewarded while less efficient or incorrect ones are penalized, thereby turning token saving into an end-to-end, inference-consistent optimization objective. Across thirteen image and video benchmarks, Sparsity Forcing raises token reduction ratio on Qwen2-VL/Qwen2.5-VL from 20\% to 75\% with minimal accuracy decline, significantly reducing long-context inference memory by up to 3$\times$ while speeding up decoding by up to 3.3$\times$.

  Vision-and-Language Navigation requires an embodied agent to navigate through unseen environments, guided by natural language instructions and a continuous video stream. Recent advances in VLN have been driven by the powerful semantic understanding of Multimodal Large Language Models. However, these methods typically rely on explicit semantic memory, such as building textual cognitive maps or storing historical visual frames. This type of method suffers from spatial information loss, computational redundancy, and memory bloat, which impede efficient navigation. Inspired by the implicit scene representation in human navigation, analogous to the left brain's semantic understanding and the right brain's spatial cognition, we propose JanusVLN, a novel VLN framework featuring a dual implicit neural memory that models spatial-geometric and visual-semantic memory as separate, compact, and fixed-size neural representations. This framework first extends the MLLM to incorporate 3D prior knowledge from the spatial-geometric encoder, thereby enhancing the spatial reasoning capabilities of models based solely on RGB input. Then, the historical key-value caches from the spatial-geometric and visual-semantic encoders are constructed into a dual implicit memory. By retaining only the KVs of tokens in the initial and sliding window, redundant computation is avoided, enabling efficient incremental updates. Extensive experiments demonstrate that JanusVLN outperforms over 20 recent methods to achieve SOTA performance. For example, the success rate improves by 10.5-35.5 compared to methods using multiple data types as input and by 3.6-10.8 compared to methods using more RGB training data. This indicates that the proposed dual implicit neural memory, as a novel paradigm, explores promising new directions for future VLN research. Ours project page:this https URL.

  The ability of robots to interpret human instructions and execute manipulation tasks necessitates the availability of task-relevant tabletop scenes for training. However, traditional methods for creating these scenes rely on time-consuming manual layout design or purely randomized layouts, which are limited in terms of plausibility or alignment with the tasks. In this paper, we formulate a novel task, namely task-oriented tabletop scene generation, which poses significant challenges due to the substantial gap between high-level task instructions and the tabletop scenes. To support research on such a challenging task, we introduce MesaTask-10K, a large-scale dataset comprising approximately 10,700 synthetic tabletop scenes with manually crafted layouts that ensure realistic layouts and intricate inter-object relations. To bridge the gap between tasks and scenes, we propose a Spatial Reasoning Chain that decomposes the generation process into object inference, spatial interrelation reasoning, and scene graph construction for the final 3D layout. We present MesaTask, an LLM-based framework that utilizes this reasoning chain and is further enhanced with DPO algorithms to generate physically plausible tabletop scenes that align well with given task descriptions. Exhaustive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of MesaTask compared to baselines in generating task-conforming tabletop scenes with realistic layouts. Project page is atthis https URL

  Recent Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) increasingly use Reinforcement Learning (RL) for post-pretraining, such as RL with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) for objective tasks and RL from Human Feedback (RLHF) for subjective tasks. However, RLHF incurs high costs and potential reward-policy mismatch due to reliance on human preferences, while RLVR still wastes supervision by discarding rollouts and correctness signals after each update. To address these challenges, we introduce the Synergistic Policy And Reward Co-Evolving Framework (SPARK), an efficient, on-policy, and stable method that builds on RLVR. Instead of discarding rollouts and correctness data, SPARK recycles this valuable information to simultaneously train the model itself as a generative reward model. This auxiliary training uses a mix of objectives, such as pointwise reward score, pairwise comparison, and evaluation conditioned on further-reflection responses, to teach the model to evaluate and improve its own responses. Our process eliminates the need for a separate reward model and costly human preference data. SPARK creates a positive co-evolving feedback loop: improved reward accuracy yields better policy gradients, which in turn produce higher-quality rollouts that further refine the reward model. Our unified framework supports test-time scaling via self-reflection without external reward models and their associated costs. We show that SPARK achieves significant performance gains on multiple LLM and LVLM models and multiple reasoning, reward models, and general benchmarks. For example, SPARK-VL-7B achieves an average 9.7% gain on 7 reasoning benchmarks, 12.1% on 2 reward benchmarks, and 1.5% on 8 general benchmarks over the baselines, demonstrating robustness and broad generalization.

  Precisely evaluating video understanding models remains challenging: commonly used metrics such as BLEU, ROUGE, and BERTScore fail to capture the fineness of human judgment, while obtaining such judgments through manual evaluation is costly. Recent work has explored using large language models (LLMs) or multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) as evaluators, but their extension to video understanding remains relatively unexplored. In this work, we introduce VideoJudge, a 3B and 7B-sized MLLM judge specialized to evaluate outputs from video understanding models (\textit{i.e.}, text responses conditioned on videos). To train VideoJudge, our recipe builds on the interplay between a generator and an evaluator: the generator is prompted to produce responses conditioned on a target rating, and responses not matching the evaluator's rating are discarded. Across three out of four meta-evaluation benchmarks, VideoJudge-7B outperforms larger MLLM judge baselines such as Qwen2.5-VL (32B and 72B). Notably, we find that LLM judges (Qwen3) models perform worse than MLLM judges (Qwen2.5-VL) and long chain-of-thought reasoning does not improve performance, indicating that providing video inputs is crucial for evaluation of video understanding tasks.

  Cross-View Geo-Localization (CVGL) focuses on identifying correspondences between images captured from distinct perspectives of the same geographical location. However, existing CVGL approaches are typically restricted to a single view or modality, and their direct visual matching strategy lacks interpretability: they only determine whether two images correspond, without explaining the rationale behind the match. In this paper, we present GLEAM-C, a foundational CVGL model that unifies multiple views and modalities-including UAV imagery, street maps, panoramic views, and ground photographs-by aligning them exclusively with satellite imagery. Our framework enhances training efficiency through optimized implementation while achieving accuracy comparable to prior modality-specific CVGL models through a two-phase training strategy. Moreover, to address the lack of interpretability in traditional CVGL methods, we leverage the reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to propose a new task, GLEAM-X, which combines cross-view correspondence prediction with explainable reasoning. To support this task, we construct a bilingual benchmark using GPT-4o and Doubao-1.5-Thinking-Vision-Pro to generate training and testing data. The test set is further refined through detailed human revision, enabling systematic evaluation of explainable cross-view reasoning and advancing transparency and scalability in geo-localization. Together, GLEAM-C and GLEAM-X form a comprehensive CVGL pipeline that integrates multi-modal, multi-view alignment with interpretable correspondence analysis, unifying accurate cross-view matching with explainable reasoning and advancing Geo-Localization by enabling models to better Explain And Match.

  We introduce GeoDANO, a geometric vision-language model (VLM) with a domain-agnostic vision encoder, for solving plane geometry problems. Although VLMs have been employed for solving geometry problems, their ability to recognize geometric features remains insufficiently analyzed. To address this gap, we propose a benchmark that evaluates the recognition of visual geometric features, including primitives such as dots and lines, and relations such as orthogonality. Our preliminary study shows that vision encoders often used in general-purpose VLMs, e.g., OpenCLIP, fail to detect these features and struggle to generalize across domains. To overcome the limitation, we develop GeoCLIP, a CLIP-based model trained on synthetic geometric diagram--caption pairs. Benchmark results show that GeoCLIP outperforms existing vision encoders in recognizing geometric features. We then propose our VLM, GeoDANO, which augments GeoCLIP with a domain adaptation strategy for unseen diagram styles. GeoDANO outperforms specialized methods for plane geometry problems and GPT-4o on MathVerse. The implementation is available atthis https URL.

  Image captioning is a fundamental task that bridges the visual and linguistic domains, playing a critical role in pre-training Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). Current state-of-the-art captioning models are typically trained with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), a paradigm that relies on expensive, non-scalable data annotated by humans or proprietary models. This approach often leads to models that memorize specific ground-truth answers, limiting their generality and ability to generate diverse, creative descriptions. To overcome the limitation of SFT, we propose applying the Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) paradigm to the open-ended task of image captioning. A primary challenge, however, is designing an objective reward function for the inherently subjective nature of what constitutes a "good" caption. We introduce Captioning Reinforcement Learning (CapRL), a novel training framework that redefines caption quality through its utility: a high-quality caption should enable a non-visual language model to accurately answer questions about the corresponding image. CapRL employs a decoupled two-stage pipeline where an LVLM generates a caption, and the objective reward is derived from the accuracy of a separate, vision-free LLM answering Multiple-Choice Questions based solely on that caption. As the first study to apply RLVR to the subjective image captioning task, we demonstrate that CapRL significantly enhances multiple settings. Pretraining on the CapRL-5M caption dataset annotated by CapRL-3B results in substantial gains across 12 benchmarks. Moreover, within the Prism Framework for caption quality evaluation, CapRL achieves performance comparable to Qwen2.5-VL-72B, while exceeding the baseline by an average margin of 8.4%.

  Can humans identify AI-generated (fake) videos and provide grounded reasons? While video generation models have advanced rapidly, a critical dimension -- whether humans can detect deepfake traces within a generated video, i.e., spatiotemporal grounded visual artifacts that reveal a video as machine generated -- has been largely overlooked. We introduce DeeptraceReward, the first fine-grained, spatially- and temporally- aware benchmark that annotates human-perceived fake traces for video generation reward. The dataset comprises 4.3K detailed annotations across 3.3K high-quality generated videos. Each annotation provides a natural-language explanation, pinpoints a bounding-box region containing the perceived trace, and marks precise onset and offset timestamps. We consolidate these annotations into 9 major categories of deepfake traces that lead humans to identify a video as AI-generated, and train multimodal language models (LMs) as reward models to mimic human judgments and localizations. On DeeptraceReward, our 7B reward model outperforms GPT-5 by 34.7% on average across fake clue identification, grounding, and explanation. Interestingly, we observe a consistent difficulty gradient: binary fake v.s. real classification is substantially easier than fine-grained deepfake trace detection; within the latter, performance degrades from natural language explanations (easiest), to spatial grounding, to temporal labeling (hardest). By foregrounding human-perceived deepfake traces, DeeptraceReward provides a rigorous testbed and training signal for socially aware and trustworthy video generation.

  Radiography Report Generation (RRG) has gained significant attention in medical image analysis as a promising tool for alleviating the growing workload of radiologists. However, despite numerous advancements, existing methods have yet to achieve the quality required for deployment in real-world clinical settings. Meanwhile, large Visual Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable progress in the general domain by adopting training strategies originally designed for Large Language Models (LLMs), such as alignment techniques. In this paper, we introduce a model-agnostic framework to enhance RRG accuracy using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Our approach leverages random contrastive sampling to construct training pairs, eliminating the need for reward models or human preference annotations. Experiments on supplementing three state-of-the-art models with our Random DPO show that our method improves clinical performance metrics by up to 5%, without requiring any additional training data.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) aims to endow models with the ability to continuously adapt to evolving data streams. Recent advances in pre-trained vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) provide a powerful foundation for this task. However, existing approaches often rely on simplistic templates, such as "a photo of a [CLASS]", which overlook the hierarchical nature of visual concepts. For example, recognizing "cat" versus "car" depends on coarse-grained cues, while distinguishing "cat" from "lion" requires fine-grained details. Similarly, the current feature mapping in CLIP relies solely on the representation from the last layer, neglecting the hierarchical information contained in earlier layers. In this work, we introduce HiErarchical Representation MAtchiNg (HERMAN) for CLIP-based CIL. Our approach leverages LLMs to recursively generate discriminative textual descriptors, thereby augmenting the semantic space with explicit hierarchical cues. These descriptors are matched to different levels of the semantic hierarchy and adaptively routed based on task-specific requirements, enabling precise discrimination while alleviating catastrophic forgetting in incremental tasks. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance.

  Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable success across diverse vision-language tasks, yet their internal decision-making mechanisms remain insufficiently understood. Existing interpretability research has primarily focused on cross-modal attribution, identifying which image regions the model attends to during output generation. However, these approaches often overlook intra-modal dependencies. In the visual modality, attributing importance to isolated image patches ignores spatial context due to limited receptive fields, resulting in fragmented and noisy explanations. In the textual modality, reliance on preceding tokens introduces spurious activations. Failing to effectively mitigate these interference compromises attribution fidelity. To address these limitations, we propose enhancing interpretability by leveraging intra-modal interaction. For the visual branch, we introduce \textit{Multi-Scale Explanation Aggregation} (MSEA), which aggregates attributions over multi-scale inputs to dynamically adjust receptive fields, producing more holistic and spatially coherent visual explanations. For the textual branch, we propose \textit{Activation Ranking Correlation} (ARC), which measures the relevance of contextual tokens to the current token via alignment of their top-$k$ prediction rankings. ARC leverages this relevance to suppress spurious activations from irrelevant contexts while preserving semantically coherent ones. Extensive experiments across state-of-the-art MLLMs and benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing interpretability methods, yielding more faithful and fine-grained explanations of model behavior.

  Along with the rapid advancement of numerous Text-to-Video (T2V) models, growing concerns have emerged regarding their safety risks. While recent studies have explored vulnerabilities in models like LLMs, VLMs, and Text-to-Image (T2I) models through jailbreak attacks, T2V models remain largely unexplored, leaving a significant safety gap. To address this gap, we introduce SceneSplit, a novel black-box jailbreak method that works by fragmenting a harmful narrative into multiple scenes, each individually benign. This approach manipulates the generative output space, the abstract set of all potential video outputs for a given prompt, using the combination of scenes as a powerful constraint to guide the final outcome. While each scene individually corresponds to a wide and safe space where most outcomes are benign, their sequential combination collectively restricts this space, narrowing it to an unsafe region and significantly increasing the likelihood of generating a harmful video. This core mechanism is further enhanced through iterative scene manipulation, which bypasses the safety filter within this constrained unsafe region. Additionally, a strategy library that reuses successful attack patterns further improves the attack's overall effectiveness and robustness. To validate our method, we evaluate SceneSplit across 11 safety categories on T2V models. Our results show that it achieves a high average Attack Success Rate (ASR) of 77.2% on Luma Ray2, 84.1% on Hailuo, and 78.2% on Veo2, significantly outperforming the existing baseline. Through this work, we demonstrate that current T2V safety mechanisms are vulnerable to attacks that exploit narrative structure, providing new insights for understanding and improving the safety of T2V models.

We introduce Neural-MedBench, a compact yet reasoning-intensive benchmark specifically designed to probe the limits of multimodal clinical reasoning in neurology. Neural-MedBench integrates multi-sequence MRI scans, structured electronic health records, and clinical notes, and encompasses three core task families: differential diagnosis, lesion recognition, and rationale generation. To ensure reliable evaluation, we develop a hybrid scoring pipeline that combines LLM-based graders, clinician validation, and semantic similarity metrics. Through systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art VLMs, including GPT-4o, Claude-4, and MedGemma, we observe a sharp performance drop compared to conventional datasets. Error analysis shows that reasoning failures, rather than perceptual errors, dominate model shortcomings. Our findings highlight the necessity of a Two-Axis Evaluation Framework: breadth-oriented large datasets for statistical generalization, and depth-oriented, compact benchmarks such as Neural-MedBench for reasoning fidelity. We release Neural-MedBench atthis https URLas an open and extensible diagnostic testbed, which guides the expansion of future benchmarks and enables rigorous yet cost-effective assessment of clinically trustworthy AI.

  Referring expression understanding in remote sensing poses unique challenges, as it requires reasoning over complex object-context relationships. While supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on multimodal large language models achieves strong performance with massive labeled datasets, they struggle in data-scarce scenarios, leading to poor generalization. To address this limitation, we propose Geo-R1, a reasoning-centric reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) paradigm for few-shot geospatial referring. Geo-R1 enforces the model to first generate explicit, interpretable reasoning chains that decompose referring expressions, and then leverage these rationales to localize target objects. This "reason first, then act" process enables the model to make more effective use of limited annotations, enhances generalization, and provides interpretability. We validate Geo-R1 on three carefully designed few-shot geospatial referring benchmarks, where our model consistently and substantially outperforms SFT baselines. It also demonstrates strong cross-dataset generalization, highlighting its robustness. Code and data will be released atthis http URL.

  _Boyang Liu, Yifan Hu, Senjie Jin, Shihan Dou, Gonglei Shi, Jie Shao, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are well suited to image aesthetic assessment, as they can capture high-level aesthetic features leveraging their cross-modal understanding capacity. However, the scarcity of multimodal aesthetic reasoning data and the inherently subjective nature of aesthetic judgment make it difficult for MLLMs to generate accurate aesthetic judgments with interpretable rationales. To this end, we propose Aes-R1, a comprehensive aesthetic reasoning framework with reinforcement learning (RL). Concretely, Aes-R1 integrates a pipeline, AesCoT, to construct and filter high-quality chain-of-thought aesthetic reasoning data used for cold-start. After teaching the model to generate structured explanations prior to scoring, we then employ the Relative-Absolute Policy Optimization (RAPO), a novel RL algorithm that jointly optimizes absolute score regression and relative ranking order, improving both per-image accuracy and cross-image preference judgments. Aes-R1 enables MLLMs to generate grounded explanations alongside faithful scores, thereby enhancing aesthetic scoring and reasoning in a unified framework. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Aes-R1 improves the backbone's average PLCC/SRCC by 47.9%/34.8%, surpassing state-of-the-art baselines of similar size. More ablation studies validate Aes-R1's robust generalization under limited supervision and in out-of-distribution scenarios.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Diffusion Transformers (DiT)-based video generation models with 3D full attention exhibit strong generative capabilities. Trajectory control represents a user-friendly task in the field of controllable video generation. However, existing methods either require substantial training resources or are specifically designed for U-Net, do not take advantage of the superior performance of DiT. To address these issues, we propose DiTraj, a simple but effective training-free framework for trajectory control in text-to-video generation, tailored for DiT. Specifically, first, to inject the object's trajectory, we propose foreground-background separation guidance: we use the Large Language Model (LLM) to convert user-provided prompts into foreground and background prompts, which respectively guide the generation of foreground and background regions in the video. Then, we analyze 3D full attention and explore the tight correlation between inter-token attention scores and position embedding. Based on this, we propose inter-frame Spatial-Temporal Decoupled 3D-RoPE (STD-RoPE). By modifying only foreground tokens' position embedding, STD-RoPE eliminates their cross-frame spatial discrepancies, strengthening cross-frame attention among them and thus enhancing trajectory control. Additionally, we achieve 3D-aware trajectory control by regulating the density of position embedding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms previous methods in both video quality and trajectory controllability.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Text-to-image generation has advanced rapidly with large-scale multimodal training, yet fine-grained controllability remains a critical challenge. Counterfactual controllability, defined as the capacity to deliberately generate images that contradict common-sense patterns, remains a major challenge but plays a crucial role in enabling creativity and exploratory applications. In this work, we address this gap with a focus on counterfactual size (e.g., generating a tiny walrus beside a giant button) and propose an automatic prompt engineering framework that adapts base prompts into revised prompts for counterfactual images. The framework comprises three components: an image evaluator that guides dataset construction by identifying successful image generations, a supervised prompt rewriter that produces revised prompts, and a DPO-trained ranker that selects the optimal revised prompt. We construct the first counterfactual size text-image dataset and enhance the image evaluator by extending Grounded SAM with refinements, achieving a 114 percent improvement over its backbone. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and ChatGPT-4o, establishing a foundation for future research on counterfactual controllability.

  Text-to-image (T2I) models have been widely applied in generating high-fidelity images across various domains. However, these models may also be abused to produce Not-Safe-for-Work (NSFW) content via jailbreak attacks. Existing jailbreak methods primarily manipulate the textual prompt, leaving potential vulnerabilities in image-based inputs largely unexplored. Moreover, text-based methods face challenges in bypassing the model's safety filters. In response to these limitations, we propose the Multimodal Prompt Decoupling Attack (MPDA), which utilizes image modality to separate the harmful semantic components of the original unsafe prompt. MPDA follows three core steps: firstly, a large language model (LLM) decouples unsafe prompts into pseudo-safe prompts and harmful prompts. The former are seemingly harmless sub-prompts that can bypass filters, while the latter are sub-prompts with unsafe semantics that trigger filters. Subsequently, the LLM rewrites the harmful prompts into natural adversarial prompts to bypass safety filters, which guide the T2I model to modify the base image into an NSFW output. Finally, to ensure semantic consistency between the generated NSFW images and the original unsafe prompts, the visual language model generates image captions, providing a new pathway to guide the LLM in iterative rewriting and refining the generated content.

  This study aimed to enhance disease classification accuracy from retinal fundus images by integrating fine-grained image features and global textual context using a novel multimodal deep learning architecture. Existing multimodal large language models (MLLMs) often struggle to capture low-level spatial details critical for diagnosing retinal diseases such as glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, and retinitis pigmentosa. This model development and validation study was conducted on 1,305 fundus image-text pairs compiled from three public datasets (FIVES, HRF, and StoneRounds), covering acquired and inherited retinal diseases, and evaluated using classification accuracy and F1-score. The MDF-MLLM integrates skip features from four U-Net encoder layers into cross-attention blocks within a LLaMA 3.2 11B MLLM. Vision features are patch-wise projected and fused using scaled cross-attention and FiLM-based U-Net modulation. Baseline MLLM achieved 60% accuracy on the dual-type disease classification task. MDF-MLLM, with both U-Net and MLLM components fully fine-tuned during training, achieved a significantly higher accuracy of 94%, representing a 56% improvement. Recall and F1-scores improved by as much as 67% and 35% over baseline, respectively. Ablation studies confirmed that the multi-depth fusion approach contributed to substantial gains in spatial reasoning and classification, particularly for inherited diseases with rich clinical text. MDF-MLLM presents a generalizable, interpretable, and modular framework for fundus image classification, outperforming traditional MLLM baselines through multi-scale feature fusion. The architecture holds promise for real-world deployment in clinical decision support systems. Future work will explore synchronized training techniques, a larger pool of diseases for more generalizability, and extending the model for segmentation tasks.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In recent years, integrating multimodal understanding and generation into a single unified model has emerged as a promising paradigm. While this approach achieves strong results in text-to-image (T2I) generation, it still struggles with precise image editing. We attribute this limitation to an imbalanced division of responsibilities. The understanding module primarily functions as a translator that encodes user instructions into semantic conditions, while the generation module must simultaneously act as designer and painter, inferring the original layout, identifying the target editing region, and rendering the new content. This imbalance is counterintuitive because the understanding module is typically trained with several times more data on complex reasoning tasks than the generation module. To address this issue, we introduce Draw-In-Mind (DIM), a dataset comprising two complementary subsets: (i) DIM-T2I, containing 14M long-context image-text pairs to enhance complex instruction comprehension; and (ii) DIM-Edit, consisting of 233K chain-of-thought imaginations generated by GPT-4o, serving as explicit design blueprints for image edits. We connect a frozen Qwen2.5-VL-3B with a trainable SANA1.5-1.6B via a lightweight two-layer MLP, and train it on the proposed DIM dataset, resulting in DIM-4.6B-T2I/Edit. Despite its modest parameter scale, DIM-4.6B-Edit achieves SOTA or competitive performance on the ImgEdit and GEdit-Bench benchmarks, outperforming much larger models such as UniWorld-V1 and Step1X-Edit. These findings demonstrate that explicitly assigning the design responsibility to the understanding module provides significant benefits for image editing.

  Recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) increasingly integrate multiple vision encoders to improve performance on various benchmarks, assuming that diverse pretraining objectives yield complementary visual signals. However, we show this assumption often fails in practice. Through systematic encoder masking across representative multi encoder MLLMs, we find that performance typically degrades gracefully and sometimes even improves when selected encoders are masked, revealing pervasive encoder redundancy. To quantify this effect, we introduce two principled metrics: the Conditional Utilization Rate (CUR), which measures an encoders marginal contribution in the presence of others, and the Information Gap (IG), which captures heterogeneity in encoder utility within a model. Using these tools, we observe (i) strong specialization on tasks like OCR and Chart, where a single encoder can dominate with a CUR greater than 90%, (ii) high redundancy on general VQA and knowledge-based tasks, where encoders are largely interchangeable, (iii) instances of detrimental encoders with negative CUR. Notably, masking specific encoders can yield up to 16% higher accuracy on a specific task category and 3.6% overall performance boost compared to the fullthis http URL, single and dual encoder variants recover over 90% of baseline on most non OCR tasks. Our analysis challenges the more encoders are better heuristic in MLLMs and provides actionable diagnostics for developing more efficient and effective multimodal architectures.

  Temporal Change Description (TCD) and Future Satellite Image Forecasting (FSIF) are critical, yet historically disjointed tasks in Satellite Image Time Series (SITS) analysis. Both are fundamentally limited by the common challenge of modeling long-range temporal dynamics. To explore how to improve the performance of methods on both tasks simultaneously by enhancing long-range temporal understanding capabilities, we introduce TAMMs, the first unified framework designed to jointly perform TCD and FSIF within a single MLLM-diffusion architecture. TAMMs introduces two key innovations: Temporal Adaptation Modules (TAM) enhance frozen MLLM's ability to comprehend long-range dynamics, and Semantic-Fused Control Injection (SFCI) mechanism translates this change understanding into fine-grained generative control. This synergistic design makes the understanding from the TCD task to directly inform and improve the consistency of the FSIF task. Extensive experiments demonstrate TAMMs significantly outperforms state-of-the-art specialist baselines on both tasks.

  The "Reason-Then-Respond" paradigm, enhanced by Reinforcement Learning, has shown great promise in advancing Multimodal Large Language Models. However, its application to the video domain has led to specialized models that excel at either question answering (QA) or captioning tasks, but struggle to master both. Naively combining reward signals from these tasks results in mutual performance degradation, which we attribute to a conflict between their opposing task natures. To address this challenge, we propose a novel training framework built upon two intermediate proxy tasks: DarkEventInfer, which presents videos with masked event segments, requiring models to infer the obscured content based on contextual video cues; and MixVidQA, which presents interleaved video sequences composed of two distinct clips, challenging models to isolate and reason about one while disregarding the other. These proxy tasks compel the model to simultaneously develop both holistic, divergent understanding and precise, convergent reasoning capabilities. Embodying this framework, we present VidBridge-R1, the first versatile video reasoning model that effectively bridges the paradigm conflict. Extensive experiments show that VidBridge-R1 achieves significant performance gains on both QA and captioning within one model, demonstrating the efficacy of our approach in fostering more generalizable and powerful video understanding models.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting improves reasoning in large language models (LLMs), but its reliance on unstructured text limits interpretability and executability in embodied tasks. Prior work has explored structured CoTs using scene or logic graphs, yet these remain fundamentally limited: they model only low-order relations, lack constructs like inheritance or behavioral abstraction, and provide no standardized semantics for sequential or conditional planning. We propose UML-CoT, a structured reasoning and planning framework that leverages Unified Modeling Language (UML) to generate symbolic CoTs and executable action plans. UML class diagrams capture compositional object semantics, while activity diagrams model procedural control flow. Our three-stage training pipeline combines supervised fine-tuning with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), including reward learning from answer-only data. We evaluate UML-CoT on MRoom-30k, a new benchmark of cluttered room-cleaning scenarios. UML-CoT outperforms unstructured CoTs in interpretability, planning coherence, and execution success, highlighting UML as a more expressive and actionable structured reasoning formalism.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Video anomaly detection (VAD) is crucial for intelligent surveillance, but a significant challenge lies in identifying complex anomalies, which are events defined by intricate relationships and temporal dependencies among multiple entities rather than by isolated actions. While self-supervised learning (SSL) methods effectively model low-level spatiotemporal patterns, they often struggle to grasp the semantic meaning of these interactions. Conversely, large language models (LLMs) offer powerful contextual reasoning but are computationally expensive for frame-by-frame analysis and lack fine-grained spatial localization. We introduce HyCoVAD, Hybrid Complex Video Anomaly Detection, a hybrid SSL-LLM model that combines a multi-task SSL temporal analyzer with LLM validator. The SSL module is built upon an nnFormer backbone which is a transformer-based model for image segmentation. It is trained with multiple proxy tasks, learns from video frames to identify those suspected of anomaly. The selected frames are then forwarded to the LLM, which enriches the analysis with semantic context by applying structured, rule-based reasoning to validate the presence of anomalies. Experiments on the challenging ComplexVAD dataset show that HyCoVAD achieves a 72.5% frame-level AUC, outperforming existing baselines by 12.5% while reducing LLM computation. We release our interaction anomaly taxonomy, adaptive thresholding protocol, and code to facilitate future research in complex VAD scenarios.

  Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in aligning visual inputs with natural language outputs. Yet, the extent to which generated tokens depend on visual modalities remains poorly understood, limiting interpretability and reliability. In this work, we present EAGLE, a lightweight black-box framework for explaining autoregressive token generation in MLLMs. EAGLE attributes any selected tokens to compact perceptual regions while quantifying the relative influence of language priors and perceptual evidence. The framework introduces an objective function that unifies sufficiency (insight score) and indispensability (necessity score), optimized via greedy search over sparsified image regions for faithful and efficient attribution. Beyond spatial attribution, EAGLE performs modality-aware analysis that disentangles what tokens rely on, providing fine-grained interpretability of model decisions. Extensive experiments across open-source MLLMs show that EAGLE consistently outperforms existing methods in faithfulness, localization, and hallucination diagnosis, while requiring substantially less GPU memory. These results highlight its effectiveness and practicality for advancing the interpretability of MLLMs. The code is available atthis https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Universal image restoration (UIR) aims to recover images degraded by unknown mixtures while preserving semantics -- conditions under which discriminative restorers and UNet-based diffusion priors often oversmooth, hallucinate, or drift. We present LucidFlux, a caption-free UIR framework that adapts a large diffusion transformer (Flux.1) without image captions. LucidFlux introduces a lightweight dual-branch conditioner that injects signals from the degraded input and a lightly restored proxy to respectively anchor geometry and suppress artifacts. Then, a timestep- and layer-adaptive modulation schedule is designed to route these cues across the backbone's hierarchy, in order to yield coarse-to-fine and context-aware updates that protect the global structure while recovering texture. After that, to avoid the latency and instability of text prompts or MLLM captions, we enforce caption-free semantic alignment via SigLIP features extracted from the proxy. A scalable curation pipeline further filters large-scale data for structure-rich supervision. Across synthetic and in-the-wild benchmarks, LucidFlux consistently outperforms strong open-source and commercial baselines, and ablation studies verify the necessity of each component. LucidFlux shows that, for large DiTs, when, where, and what to condition on -- rather than adding parameters or relying on text prompts -- is the governing lever for robust and caption-free universal image restoration in the wild.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Text adversarial attack methods are typically designed for static scenarios with fixed numbers of output labels and a predefined label space, relying on extensive querying of the victim model (query-based attacks) or the surrogate model (transfer-based attacks). To address this gap, we introduce the Textual Dynamic Outputs Attack (TDOA) method, which employs a clustering-based surrogate model training approach to convert the dynamic-output scenario into a static single-output scenario. To improve attack effectiveness, we propose the farthest-label targeted attack strategy, which selects adversarial vectors that deviate most from the model's coarse-grained labels, thereby maximizing disruption. We extensively evaluate TDOA on four datasets and eight victim models (e.g., ChatGPT-4o, ChatGPT-4.1), showing its effectiveness in crafting adversarial examples and its strong potential to compromise large language models with limited access. With a single query per text, TDOA achieves a maximum attack success rate of 50.81\%. Additionally, we find that TDOA also achieves state-of-the-art performance in conventional static output scenarios, reaching a maximum ASR of 82.68\%. Meanwhile, by conceptualizing translation tasks as classification problems with unbounded output spaces, we extend the TDOA framework to generative settings, surpassing prior results by up to 0.64 RDBLEU and 0.62 RDchrF.

  Occlusion remains a significant challenge for current vision models to robustly interpret complex and dense real-world images and scenes. To address this limitation and to enable accurate prediction of the occlusion order relationship between objects, we propose leveraging the advanced capability of a pre-trained GPT-4 model to deduce the order. By providing a specifically designed prompt along with the input image, GPT-4 can analyze the image and generate order predictions. The response can then be parsed to construct an occlusion matrix which can be utilized in assisting with other occlusion handling tasks and image understanding. We report the results of evaluating the model on COCOA and InstaOrder datasets. The results show that by using semantic context, visual patterns, and commonsense knowledge, the model can produce more accurate order predictions. Unlike baseline methods, the model can reason about occlusion relationships in a zero-shot fashion, which requires no annotated training data and can easily be integrated into occlusion handling frameworks.

These contributions provide a robust and reproducible methodological framework for automated multimodal disinformation analysis.

  Engineering design operates through hierarchical abstraction from system specifications to component implementations, requiring visual understanding coupled with mathematical reasoning at each level. While Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at natural image tasks, their ability to extract mathematical models from technical diagrams remains unexplored. We present \textbf{CircuitSense}, a comprehensive benchmark evaluating circuit understanding across this hierarchy through 8,006+ problems spanning component-level schematics to system-level block diagrams. Our benchmark uniquely examines the complete engineering workflow: Perception, Analysis, and Design, with a particular emphasis on the critical but underexplored capability of deriving symbolic equations from visual inputs. We introduce a hierarchical synthetic generation pipeline consisting of a grid-based schematic generator and a block diagram generator with auto-derived symbolic equation labels. Comprehensive evaluation of six state-of-the-art MLLMs, including both closed-source and open-source models, reveals fundamental limitations in visual-to-mathematical reasoning. Closed-source models achieve over 85\% accuracy on perception tasks involving component recognition and topology identification, yet their performance on symbolic derivation and analytical reasoning falls below 19\%, exposing a critical gap between visual parsing and symbolic reasoning. Models with stronger symbolic reasoning capabilities consistently achieve higher design task accuracy, confirming the fundamental role of mathematical understanding in circuit synthesis and establishing symbolic reasoning as the key metric for engineering competence.

  Urban development impacts over half of the global population, making human-centered understanding of its structural and perceptual changes essential for sustainable development. While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities across various domains, existing benchmarks that explore their performance in urban environments remain limited, lacking systematic exploration of temporal evolution and subjective perception of urban environment that aligns with human perception. To address these limitations, we propose UrbanFeel, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the performance of MLLMs in urban development understanding and subjective environmental perception. UrbanFeel comprises 14.3K carefully constructed visual questions spanning three cognitively progressive dimensions: Static Scene Perception, Temporal Change Understanding, and Subjective Environmental Perception. We collect multi-temporal single-view and panoramic street-view images from 11 representative cities worldwide, and generate high-quality question-answer pairs through a hybrid pipeline of spatial clustering, rule-based generation, model-assisted prompting, and manual annotation. Through extensive evaluation of 20 state-of-the-art MLLMs, we observe that Gemini-2.5 Pro achieves the best overall performance, with its accuracy approaching human expert levels and narrowing the average gap to just 1.5\%. Most models perform well on tasks grounded in scene understanding. In particular, some models even surpass human annotators in pixel-level change detection. However, performance drops notably in tasks requiring temporal reasoning over urban development. Additionally, in the subjective perception dimension, several models reach human-level or even higher consistency in evaluating dimension such as beautiful and safety.

  Analyzing instructional interactions between an instructor and a learner who are co-present in the same physical space is a critical problem for educational support and skill transfer. Yet such face-to-face instructional scenes have not been systematically studied in computer vision. We identify two key reasons: i) the lack of suitable datasets and ii) limited analytical techniques. To address this gap, we present a new egocentric video dataset of face-to-face instruction and provide ground-truth annotations for two fundamental tasks that serve as a first step toward a comprehensive understanding of instructional interactions: procedural step segmentation and conversation-state classification. Using this dataset, we benchmark multimodal large language models (MLLMs) against conventional task-specific models. Since face-to-face instruction involves multiple modalities (speech content and prosody, gaze and body motion, and visual context), effective understanding requires methods that handle verbal and nonverbal communication in an integrated manner. Accordingly, we evaluate recently introduced MLLMs that jointly process images, audio, and text. This evaluation quantifies the extent to which current machine learning models understand face-to-face instructional scenes. In experiments, MLLMs outperform specialized baselines even without task-specific fine-tuning, suggesting their promise for holistic understanding of instructional interactions.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable success across diverse vision-language tasks, yet they remain highly susceptible to hallucinations, producing content that is fluent but inconsistent with visual evidence. Such hallucinations, spanning objects, attributes, and relations, persist even in larger models, while existing mitigation approaches often require additional finetuning, handcrafted priors, or trade-offs that compromise informativeness and scalability. To address this limitation, we propose a training-free, self-supervised method for hallucination mitigation. Our approach introduces a novel hallucination amplification mechanism: a caption is projected into the visual space via a text-to-image model to reveal implicit hallucination signals, serving as a negative anchor, while the original image provides a positive anchor. Leveraging these dual anchors, we edit decoder hidden states by pulling representations toward faithful semantics and pushing them away from hallucination directions. This correction requires no human priors or additional training costs, ensuring both effectiveness and efficiency. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks show that our method significantly reduces hallucinations at the object, attribute, and relation levels while largely preserving recall and caption richness, e.g., achieving a hallucination reduction by over 5% using LLaVA-v1.5-7B on CHAIR. Furthermore, results on diverse architectures, including LLaVA-NEXT-7B, Cambrian-8B, and InstructBLIP-7B, validate strong cross-architecture generalization. More importantly, when applied to hallucination-free captions, our method introduces almost no side effects, underscoring its robustness and practical plug-and-play applicability. The implementation will be publicly available.

  With the rise in popularity of smart glasses, users' attention has been integrated into Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to streamline multi-modal querying in daily scenarios. However, leveraging gaze data to model users' attention may introduce ambiguity challenges: (1) users' verbal questions become ambiguous by using pronouns or skipping context, (2) humans' gaze patterns can be noisy and exhibit complex spatiotemporal relationships with their spoken questions. Previous works only consider single image as visual modality input, failing to capture the dynamic nature of the user's attention. In this work, we introduce GLARIFY, a novel method to leverage spatiotemporal gaze information to enhance the model's effectiveness in real-world applications. Initially, we analyzed hundreds of querying samples with the gaze modality to demonstrate the noisy nature of users' gaze patterns. We then utilized GPT-4o to design an automatic data synthesis pipeline to generate the GLARIFY-Ambi dataset, which includes a dedicated chain-of-thought (CoT) process to handle noisy gaze patterns. Finally, we designed a heatmap module to incorporate gaze information into cutting-edge VLMs while preserving their pretrained knowledge. We evaluated GLARIFY using a hold-out test set. Experiments demonstrate that GLARIFY significantly outperforms baselines. By robustly aligning VLMs with human attention, GLARIFY paves the way for a usable and intuitive interaction paradigm with a visual assistant.

  Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved exceptional performance across diverse tasks, continually surpassing previous expectations regarding their capabilities. Nevertheless, their proficiency in perceiving emotions from images remains debated, with studies yielding divergent results in zero-shot scenarios. We argue that this inconsistency stems partly from constraints in existing evaluation methods, including the oversight of plausible responses, limited emotional taxonomies, neglect of contextual factors, and labor-intensive annotations. To facilitate customized visual emotion evaluation for MLLMs, we propose an Emotion Statement Judgment task that overcomes these constraints. Complementing this task, we devise an automated pipeline that efficiently constructs emotion-centric statements with minimal human effort. Through systematically evaluating prevailing MLLMs, our study showcases their stronger performance in emotion interpretation and context-based emotion judgment, while revealing relative limitations in comprehending perception subjectivity. When compared to humans, even top-performing MLLMs like GPT4o demonstrate remarkable performance gaps, underscoring key areas for future improvement. By developing a fundamental evaluation framework and conducting a comprehensive MLLM assessment, we hope this work contributes to advancing emotional intelligence in MLLMs. Project page:this https URL.

  Visual In-Context Learning (VICL) uses input-output image pairs, referred to as in-context pairs (or examples), as prompts alongside query images to guide models in performing diverse vision tasks. However, VICL often suffers from over-reliance on a single in-context pair, which can lead to biased and unstable predictions. We introduce PAtch-based $k$-Nearest neighbor visual In-Context Learning (PANICL), a general training-free framework that mitigates this issue by leveraging multiple in-context pairs. PANICL smooths assignment scores across pairs, reducing bias without requiring additional training. Extensive experiments on a variety of tasks, including foreground segmentation, single object detection, colorization, multi-object segmentation, and keypoint detection, demonstrate consistent improvements over strong baselines. Moreover, PANICL exhibits strong robustness to domain shifts, including dataset-level shift (e.g., from COCO to Pascal) and label-space shift (e.g., FSS-1000), and generalizes well to other VICL models such as SegGPT, Painter, and LVM, highlighting its versatility and broad applicability.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Spatial understanding is a critical capability for vision foundation models. While recent advances in large vision models or vision-language models (VLMs) have expanded recognition capabilities, most benchmarks emphasize localization accuracy rather than whether models capture how objects are arranged and related within a scene. This gap is consequential; effective scene understanding requires not only identifying objects, but reasoning about their relative positions, groupings, and depth. In this paper, we present a systematic benchmark for object-centric spatial reasoning in foundation models. Using a controlled synthetic dataset, we evaluate state-of-the-art vision models (e.g., GroundingDINO, Florence-2, OWLv2) and large VLMs (e.g., InternVL, LLaVA, GPT-4o) across three tasks: spatial localization, spatial reasoning, and downstream retrieval tasks. We find a stable trade-off: detectors such as GroundingDINO and OWLv2 deliver precise boxes with limited relational reasoning, while VLMs like SmolVLM and GPT-4o provide coarse layout cues and fluent captions but struggle with fine-grained spatial context. Our study highlights the gap between localization and true spatial understanding, and pointing toward the need for spatially-aware foundation models in the community.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models, trained on extensive corpora, successfully unify diverse linguistic tasks within a single generative framework. Inspired by this, recent works like Large Vision Model (LVM) extend this paradigm to vision by organizing tasks into sequential visual sentences, where visual prompts serve as the context to guide outputs. However, such modeling requires task-specific pre-training across modalities and sources, which is costly and limits scalability to unseen tasks. Given that pre-trained video generation models inherently capture temporal sequence dependencies, we explore a more unified and scalable alternative: can a pre-trained video generation model adapt to diverse image and video tasks? To answer this, we propose UniVid, a framework that fine-tunes a video diffusion transformer to handle various vision tasks without task-specific modifications. Tasks are represented as visual sentences, where the context sequence defines both the task and the expected output modality. We evaluate the generalization of UniVid from two perspectives: (1) cross-modal inference with contexts composed of both images and videos, extending beyond LVM's uni-modal setting; (2) cross-source tasks from natural to annotated data, without multi-source pre-training. Despite being trained solely on natural video data, UniVid generalizes well in both settings. Notably, understanding and generation tasks can easily switch by simply reversing the visual sentence order in this paradigm. These findings highlight the potential of pre-trained video generation models to serve as a scalable and unified foundation for vision modeling. Our code will be released atthis https URL.

  Group-level emotion recognition (GER) aims to identify holistic emotions within a scene involving multiple individuals. Current existed methods underestimate the importance of visual scene contextual information in modeling individual relationships. Furthermore, they overlook the crucial role of semantic information from emotional labels for complete understanding of emotions. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework that incorporates visual scene context and label-guided semantic information to improve GER performance. It involves the visual context encoding module that leverages multi-scale scene information to diversely encode individual relationships. Complementarily, the emotion semantic encoding module utilizes group-level emotion labels to prompt a large language model to generate nuanced emotion lexicons. These lexicons, in conjunction with the emotion labels, are then subsequently refined into comprehensive semantic representations through the utilization of a structured emotion tree. Finally, similarity-aware interaction is proposed to align and integrate visual and semantic information, thereby generating enhanced group-level emotion representations and subsequently improving the performance of GER. Experiments on three widely adopted GER datasets demonstrate that our proposed method achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Prevalent text-to-video retrieval systems mainly adopt embedding models for feature extraction and compute cosine similarities for ranking. However, this design presents two limitations. Low-quality text-video data pairs could compromise the retrieval, yet are hard to identify and examine. Cosine similarity alone provides no explanation for the ranking results, limiting the interpretability. We ask that can we interpret the ranking results, so as to assess the retrieval models and examine the text-video data? This work proposes X-CoT, an explainable retrieval framework upon LLM CoT reasoning in place of the embedding model-based similarity ranking. We first expand the existing benchmarks with additional video annotations to support semantic understanding and reduce data bias. We also devise a retrieval CoT consisting of pairwise comparison steps, yielding detailed reasoning and complete ranking. X-CoT empirically improves the retrieval performance and produces detailed rationales. It also facilitates the model behavior and data quality analysis. Code and data are available at:this https URL.

  Short video platforms are evolving rapidly, making the identification of inappropriate content increasingly critical. Existing approaches typically train separate and small classification models for each type of issue, which requires extensive human-labeled data and lacks cross-issue generalization. We propose a reasoning-enhanced multimodal large language model (MLLM) pretraining paradigm for unified inappropriate content detection. To address the distribution gap between short video content and the original pretraining data of MLLMs, as well as the complex issue definitions, we introduce three targeted pretraining tasks: (1) \textit{Caption}, to enhance the MLLM's perception of video details; (2) \textit{Visual Question Answering (VQA)}, to deepen the MLLM's understanding of issue definitions and annotation guidelines; (3) \textit{Chain-of-Thought (CoT)}, to enhance the MLLM's reasoning capability. Experimental results show that our pretraining approach significantly improves the MLLM's performance in both zero-shot and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) settings. In addition, our pretrained model demonstrates strong generalization capabilities to emergent, previously unseen issues.

  The generation of quadrilateral-dominant meshes is a cornerstone of professional 3D content creation. However, existing generative models generate quad meshes by first generating triangle meshes and then merging triangles into quadrilaterals with some specific rules, which typically produces quad meshes with poor topology. In this paper, we introduce QuadGPT, the first autoregressive framework for generating quadrilateral meshes in an end-to-end manner. QuadGPT formulates this as a sequence prediction paradigm, distinguished by two key innovations: a unified tokenization method to handle mixed topologies of triangles and quadrilaterals, and a specialized Reinforcement Learning fine-tuning method tDPO for better generation quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that QuadGPT significantly surpasses previous triangle-to-quad conversion pipelines in both geometric accuracy and topological quality. Our work establishes a new benchmark for native quad-mesh generation and showcases the power of combining large-scale autoregressive models with topology-aware RL refinement for creating structured 3D assets.

  Video reasoning has emerged as a critical capability for multimodal large language models (MLLMs), requiring models to move beyond static perception toward coherent understanding of temporal dynamics in complex scenes. Yet existing MLLMs often exhibit process inconsistency, where intermediate reasoning drifts from video dynamics even when the final answer is correct, undermining interpretability and robustness. To address this issue, we introduce MOSS-ChatV, a reinforcement learning framework with a Dynamic Time Warping (DTW)-based process reward. This rule-based reward aligns reasoning traces with temporally grounded references, enabling efficient process supervision without auxiliary reward models. We further identify dynamic state prediction as a key measure of video reasoning and construct MOSS-Video, a benchmark with annotated reasoning traces, where the training split is used to fine-tune MOSS-ChatV and the held-out split is reserved for evaluation. MOSS-ChatV achieves 87.2\% on MOSS-Video (test) and improves performance on general video benchmarks such as MVBench and MMVU. The framework consistently yields gains across different architectures, including Qwen2.5-VL and Phi-2, confirming its broad applicability. Evaluations with GPT-4o-as-judge further show that MOSS-ChatV produces more consistent and stable reasoning traces.

  Dataset distillation aims to synthesize a small dataset from a large dataset, enabling the model trained on it to perform well on the original dataset. With the blooming of large language models and multimodal large language models, the importance of multimodal datasets, particularly image-text datasets, has grown significantly. However, existing multimodal dataset distillation methods are constrained by the Matching Training Trajectories algorithm, which significantly increases the computing resource requirement, and takes days to process the distillation. In this work, we introduce EDGE, a generative distillation method for efficient multimodal dataset distillation. Specifically, we identify two key challenges of distilling multimodal datasets with generative models: 1) The lack of correlation between generated images and captions. 2) The lack of diversity among generated samples. To address the aforementioned issues, we propose a novel generative model training workflow with a bi-directional contrastive loss and a diversity loss. Furthermore, we propose a caption synthesis strategy to further improve text-to-image retrieval performance by introducing more text information. Our method is evaluated on Flickr30K, COCO, and CC3M datasets, demonstrating superior performance and efficiency compared to existing approaches. Notably, our method achieves results 18x faster than the state-of-the-art method.

  The advent of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has significantly advanced end-to-end autonomous driving, demonstrating powerful reasoning abilities for high-level behavior planning tasks. However, existing methods are often constrained by a passive perception paradigm, relying solely on text-based reasoning. This passivity restricts the model's capacity to actively seek crucial visual evidence when faced with uncertainty. To address this, we introduce DriveAgent-R1, the first autonomous driving agent capable of active perception for planning. In complex scenarios, DriveAgent-R1 proactively invokes tools to perform visual reasoning, firmly grounding its decisions in visual evidence, thereby enhancing both interpretability and reliability. Furthermore, we propose a hybrid thinking framework, inspired by human driver cognitive patterns, allowing the agent to adaptively switch between efficient text-only reasoning and robust tool-augmented visual reasoning based on scene complexity. This capability is cultivated through a three-stage progressive training strategy, featuring a core Cascaded Reinforcement Learning (Cascaded RL) phase. Extensive experiments on the Drive-Internal dataset, which is rich in long-tail scenarios, and the public nuScenes dataset show that, with only 3B parameters, DriveAgent-R1 achieves competitive performance comparable to top closed model systems such as GPT-5 and to human driving proficiency while remaining deployment-friendly, offering a proven path toward building more intelligent autonomous driving systems.

  With the rapid development of foundation video generation technologies, long video generation models have exhibited promising research potential thanks to expanded content creation space. Recent studies reveal that the goal of long video generation tasks is not only to extend video duration but also to accurately express richer narrative content within longer videos. However, due to the lack of evaluation benchmarks specifically designed for long video generation models, the current assessment of these models primarily relies on benchmarks with simple narrative prompts (e.g., VBench). To the best of our knowledge, our proposed NarrLV is the first benchmark to comprehensively evaluate the Narrative expression capabilities of Long Video generation models. Inspired by film narrative theory, (i) we first introduce the basic narrative unit maintaining continuous visual presentation in videos as Temporal Narrative Atom (TNA), and use its count to quantitatively measure narrative richness. Guided by three key film narrative elements influencing TNA changes, we construct an automatic prompt generation pipeline capable of producing evaluation prompts with a flexibly expandable number of TNAs. (ii) Then, based on the three progressive levels of narrative content expression, we design an effective evaluation metric using the MLLM-based question generation and answering framework. (iii) Finally, we conduct extensive evaluations on existing long video generation models and the foundation generation models. Experimental results demonstrate that our metric aligns closely with human judgments. The derived evaluation outcomes reveal the detailed capability boundaries of current video generation models in narrative content expression.

  Instruction-based image editing (IIE) has advanced rapidly with the success of diffusion models. However, existing efforts primarily focus on simple and explicit instructions to execute editing operations such as adding, deleting, moving, or swapping objects. They struggle to handle more complex implicit hypothetical instructions that require deeper reasoning to infer plausible visual changes and user intent. Additionally, current datasets provide limited support for training and evaluating reasoning-aware editing capabilities. Architecturally, these methods also lack mechanisms for fine-grained detail extraction that support such reasoning. To address these limitations, we propose Reason50K, a large-scale dataset specifically curated for training and evaluating hypothetical instruction reasoning image editing, along with ReasonBrain, a novel framework designed to reason over and execute implicit hypothetical instructions across diverse scenarios. Reason50K includes over 50K samples spanning four key reasoning scenarios: Physical, Temporal, Causal, and Story reasoning. ReasonBrain leverages Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for editing guidance generation and a diffusion model for image synthesis, incorporating a Fine-grained Reasoning Cue Extraction (FRCE) module to capture detailed visual and textual semantics essential for supporting instruction reasoning. To mitigate the semantic loss, we further introduce a Cross-Modal Enhancer (CME) that enables rich interactions between the fine-grained cues and MLLM-derived features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ReasonBrain consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on reasoning scenarios while exhibiting strong zero-shot generalization to conventional IIE tasks. Our dataset and code will be released publicly.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Scene synthesis and editing has emerged as a promising direction in computer graphics. Current trained approaches for 3D indoor scenes either oversimplify object semantics through one-hot class encodings (e.g., 'chair' or 'table'), require masked diffusion for editing, ignore room boundaries, or rely on floor plan renderings that fail to capture complex layouts. LLM-based methods enable richer semantics via natural language (e.g., 'modern studio with light wood furniture'), but lack editing functionality, are limited to rectangular layouts, or rely on weak spatial reasoning from implicit world models. We introduce ReSpace, a generative framework for text-driven 3D indoor scene synthesis and editing using autoregressive language models. Our approach features a compact structured scene representation with explicit room boundaries that enables asset-agnostic deployment and frames scene editing as a next-token prediction task. We leverage a dual-stage training approach combining supervised fine-tuning and preference alignment, enabling a specially trained language model for object addition that accounts for user instructions, spatial geometry, object semantics, and scene-level composition. For scene editing, we employ a zero-shot LLM to handle object removal and prompts for addition. We further introduce a voxelization-based evaluation capturing fine-grained geometry beyond 3D bounding boxes. Experimental results surpass state-of-the-art on addition and achieve superior human-perceived quality on full scene synthesis.

  Recent advances in 3D content generation have amplified demand for dynamic models that are both visually realistic and physically consistent. However, state-of-the-art video diffusion models frequently produce implausible results such as momentum violations and object interpenetrations. Existing physics-aware approaches often rely on task-specific fine-tuning or supervised data, which limits their scalability and applicability. To address the challenge, we present PhyMAGIC, a training-free framework that generates physically consistent motion from a single image. PhyMAGIC integrates a pre-trained image-to-video diffusion model, confidence-guided reasoning via LLMs, and a differentiable physics simulator to produce 3D assets ready for downstream physical simulation without fine-tuning or manual supervision. By iteratively refining motion prompts using LLM-derived confidence scores and leveraging simulation feedback, PhyMAGIC steers generation toward physically consistent dynamics. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that PhyMAGIC outperforms state-of-the-art video generators and physics-aware baselines, enhancing physical property inference and motion-text alignment while maintaining visual fidelity.

  Recent advances in multimodal Reward Models (RMs) have shown significant promise in delivering reward signals to align vision models with human preferences. However, current RMs are generally restricted to providing direct responses or engaging in shallow reasoning processes with limited depth, often leading to inaccurate reward signals. We posit that incorporating explicit long chains of thought (CoT) into the reward reasoning process can significantly strengthen their reliability and robustness. Furthermore, we believe that once RMs internalize CoT reasoning, their direct response accuracy can also be improved through implicit reasoning capabilities. To this end, this paper proposes UnifiedReward-Think, the first unified multimodal CoT-based reward model, capable of multi-dimensional, step-by-step long-chain reasoning for both visual understanding and generation reward tasks. Specifically, we adopt an exploration-driven reinforcement fine-tuning approach to elicit and incentivize the model's latent complex reasoning ability: (1) We first use a small amount of image generation preference data to distill the reasoning process of GPT-4o, which is then used for the model's cold start to learn the format and structure of CoT reasoning. (2) Subsequently, by leveraging the model's prior knowledge and generalization capabilities, we prepare large-scale unified multimodal preference data to elicit the model's reasoning process across various vision tasks. During this phase, correct reasoning outputs are retained for rejection sampling to refine the model (3) while incorrect predicted samples are finally used for Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) based reinforcement fine-tuning, enabling the model to explore diverse reasoning paths and optimize for correct and robust solutions. Extensive experiments across various vision reward tasks demonstrate the superiority of our model.

  To enhance the controllability of text-to-image diffusion models, current ControlNet-like models have explored various control signals to dictate image attributes. However, existing methods either handle conditions inefficiently or use a fixed number of conditions, which does not fully address the complexity of multiple conditions and their potential conflicts. This underscores the need for innovative approaches to manage multiple conditions effectively for more reliable and detailed image synthesis. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework, DynamicControl, which supports dynamic combinations of diverse control signals, allowing adaptive selection of different numbers and types of conditions. Our approach begins with a double-cycle controller that generates an initial real score sorting for all input conditions by leveraging pre-trained conditional generation models and discriminative models. This controller evaluates the similarity between extracted conditions and input conditions, as well as the pixel-level similarity with the source image. Then, we integrate a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) to build an efficient condition evaluator. This evaluator optimizes the ordering of conditions based on the double-cycle controller's score ranking. Our method jointly optimizes MLLMs and diffusion models, utilizing MLLMs' reasoning capabilities to facilitate multi-condition text-to-image (T2I) tasks. The final sorted conditions are fed into a parallel multi-control adapter, which learns feature maps from dynamic visual conditions and integrates them to modulate ControlNet, thereby enhancing control over generated images. Through both quantitative and qualitative comparisons, DynamicControl demonstrates its superiority over existing methods in terms of controllability, generation quality and composability under various conditional controls.

  Empathetic response generation is a crucial task for creating more human-like and supportive conversational agents.

By building a comprehensive understanding before generation, TRACE unites deep analysis with expressive generation. Experimental results show that our framework significantly outperforms strong baselines in both automatic and LLM-based evaluations, confirming that our structured decomposition is a promising paradigm for creating more capable and interpretable empathetic agents.

  Large language models (LLMs) achieve impressive results over various tasks, and ever-expanding public repositories contain an abundance of pre-trained models. Therefore, identifying the best-performing LLM for a given task is a significant challenge. Previous works have suggested learning LLM representations to address this. However, these approaches present limited scalability and require costly retraining to encompass additional models and datasets. Moreover, the produced representation utilizes distinct spaces that cannot be easily interpreted. This work presents an efficient, training-free approach to representing LLMs as linear operators within the prompts' semantic task space, thus providing a highly interpretable representation of the models' application. Our method utilizes closed-form computation of geometrical properties and ensures exceptional scalability and real-time adaptability to dynamically expanding repositories. We demonstrate our approach on success prediction and model selection tasks, achieving competitive or state-of-the-art results with notable performance in out-of-sample scenarios.

  Structured output from large language models (LLMs) has enhanced efficiency in processing generated information and is increasingly adopted in industrial applications. Prior studies have investigated the impact of structured output on LLMs' generation quality, often presenting one-way findings. Some suggest that structured format enhances completeness and factual accuracy, while others argue that it restricts the reasoning capacity of LLMs and leads to reductions in standard evaluation metrics. Potential limitations of these assessments include restricted testing scenarios, weakly controlled comparative settings, and reliance on coarse metrics. In this work, we present a refined analysis using causal inference. Based on one assumed and two guaranteed constraints, we derive five potential causal structures characterizing the influence of structured output on LLMs' generation: (1) collider without m-bias, (2) collider with m-bias, (3) single cause from instruction, (4) single cause from output format, and (5) independence. Across seven public and one developed reasoning tasks, we find that coarse metrics report positive, negative, or neutral effects of structured output on GPT-4o's generation. However, causal inference reveals no causal impact in 43 out of 48 scenarios. In the remaining 5, 3 involve multifaceted causal structures influenced by concrete instructions.

  This paper introduces a simple and scalable approach to improve the data efficiency of large language model (LLM) training by augmenting existing text data with thinking trajectories. The compute for pre-training LLMs has been growing at an unprecedented rate, while the availability of high-quality data remains limited. Consequently, maximizing the utility of available data constitutes a significant research challenge. A primary impediment is that certain high-quality tokens are difficult to learn given a fixed model capacity, as the underlying rationale for a single token can be exceptionally complex and deep. To address this issue, we propose Thinking augmented Pre-Training (TPT), a universal methodology that augments text with automatically generated thinking trajectories. Such augmentation effectively increases the volume of the training data and makes high-quality tokens more learnable through step-by-step reasoning and decomposition. We apply TPT across diverse training configurations up to $100$B tokens, encompassing pre-training with both constrained and abundant data, as well as mid-training from strong open-source checkpoints. Experimental results indicate that our method substantially improves the performance of LLMs across various model sizes and families. Notably, TPT enhances the data efficiency of LLM pre-training by a factor of $3$. For a $3$B parameter model, it improves the post-training performance by over $10\%$ on several challenging reasoning benchmarks.

  Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant advances across numerous vision-language tasks. MLLMs have shown promising capability in aligning visual and textual modalities, allowing them to process image-text pairs with clear and explicit meanings. However, resolving the inherent ambiguities present in real-world language and visual contexts remains a challenge. Existing multimodal benchmarks typically overlook linguistic and visual ambiguities, relying mainly on unimodal context for disambiguation and thus failing to exploit the mutual clarification potential between modalities. To bridge this gap, we introduce MUCAR, a novel and challenging benchmark designed explicitly for evaluating multimodal ambiguity resolution across multilingual and cross-modal scenarios. MUCAR includes first a multilingual dataset where ambiguous textual expressions are uniquely resolved by corresponding visual contexts, and second a dual-ambiguity dataset that systematically pairs ambiguous images with ambiguous textual contexts, with each combination carefully constructed to yield a single, clear interpretation through mutual disambiguation. Extensive evaluations involving 19 state-of-the-art multimodal models--encompassing both open-source and proprietary architectures--reveal substantial gaps compared to human-level performance, highlighting the need for future research into more sophisticated cross-modal ambiguity comprehension methods, further pushing the boundaries of multimodal reasoning.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit position bias - a systematic tendency to neglect information at specific context positions. However, the patterns of position bias behavior, depending on the language or model, remain unexplored. We present a multilingual study across five typologically distinct languages (English, Russian, German, Hindi, and Vietnamese) and five model architectures, examining how position bias interacts with prompt strategies and affects output entropy. Our key findings are: (1) Position bias is primarily model-driven, yet exhibits language-specific variations. For instance, Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct and DeepSeek 7B Chat consistently favors late positions, challenging established assumptions of a universal early-token bias in LLMs. (2) Explicitly instructing the model that "the context is relevant to the query" unexpectedly reduces accuracy across languages, undermining common prompt-engineering practices. (3) While the largest accuracy drop occurs when relevant information is placed in the middle of the context, this is not explicitly reflected by a corresponding peak in output entropy.

  Solving non-convex resource allocation problems poses significant challenges in wireless communication systems, often beyond the capability of traditional optimization techniques. To address this issue, we propose LLM-OptiRA, the first framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to automatically detect and transform non-convex components into solvable forms, enabling fully automated resolution of non-convex resource allocation problems in wireless communication systems. LLM-OptiRA not only simplifies problem-solving by reducing reliance on expert knowledge, but also integrates error correction and feasibility validation mechanisms to ensure robustness. Experimental results show that LLM-OptiRA achieves an execution rate of 96% and a success rate of 80% on GPT-4, significantly outperforming baseline approaches in complex optimization tasks across diverse scenarios.

  Multi-agent systems built on large language models (LLMs) promise enhanced problem-solving through distributed information integration, but may also replicate collective reasoning failures observed in human groups. Yet the absence of a theory-grounded benchmark makes it difficult to systematically evaluate and improve such reasoning. We introduce HiddenBench, the first benchmark for evaluating collective reasoning in multi-agent LLMs. It builds on the Hidden Profile paradigm from social psychology, where individuals each hold asymmetric pieces of information and must communicate to reach the correct decision. To ground the benchmark, we formalize the paradigm with custom tasks and show that GPT-4.1 groups fail to integrate distributed knowledge, exhibiting human-like collective reasoning failures that persist even with varied prompting strategies. We then construct the full benchmark, spanning 65 tasks drawn from custom designs, prior human studies, and automatic generation. Evaluating 15 LLMs across four model families, HiddenBench exposes persistent limitations while also providing comparative insights: some models (e.g., Gemini-2.5-Flash/Pro) achieve higher performance, yet scale and reasoning are not reliable indicators of stronger collective reasoning. Our work delivers the first reproducible benchmark for collective reasoning in multi-agent LLMs, offering diagnostic insight and a foundation for future research on artificial collective intelligence.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  LLMs are often trained with RL from human or AI feedback, yet such methods typically compress nuanced feedback into scalar rewards, discarding much of their richness and inducing scale imbalance. We propose treating verbal feedback as a conditioning signal. Inspired by language priors in text-to-image generation, which enable novel outputs from unseen prompts, we introduce the feedback-conditional policy (FCP). FCP learns directly from response-feedback pairs, approximating the feedback-conditional posterior through maximum likelihood training on offline data. We further develop an online bootstrapping stage where the policy generates under positive conditions and receives fresh feedback to refine itself. This reframes feedback-driven learning as conditional generation rather than reward optimization, offering a more expressive way for LLMs to directly learn from verbal feedback.

  In an era dominated by Large Language Models (LLMs), understanding their capabilities and limitations, especially in high-stakes fields like law, is crucial. While LLMs such as Meta's LLaMA, OpenAI's ChatGPT, Google's Gemini, DeepSeek, and other emerging models are increasingly integrated into legal workflows, their performance in multilingual, jurisdictionally diverse, and adversarial contexts remains insufficiently explored. This work evaluates LLaMA and Gemini on multilingual legal and non-legal benchmarks, and assesses their adversarial robustness in legal tasks through character and word-level perturbations. We use an LLM-as-a-Judge approach for human-aligned evaluation. We moreover present an open-source, modular evaluation pipeline designed to support multilingual, task-diverse benchmarking of any combination of LLMs and datasets, with a particular focus on legal tasks, including classification, summarization, open questions, and general reasoning. Our findings confirm that legal tasks pose significant challenges for LLMs with accuracies often below 50% on legal reasoning benchmarks such as LEXam, compared to over 70% on general-purpose tasks like XNLI. In addition, while English generally yields more stable results, it does not always lead to higher accuracy. Prompt sensitivity and adversarial vulnerability is also shown to persist across languages. Finally, a correlation is found between the performance of a language and its syntactic similarity to English. We also observe that LLaMA is weaker than Gemini, with the latter showing an average advantage of about 24 percentage points across the same task. Despite improvements in newer LLMs, challenges remain in deploying them reliably for critical, multilingual legal applications.

  Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is a powerful framework for improving the reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, current methods such as GRPO rely only on problems where the model responses to the same input differ in correctness, while ignoring those where all responses receive the same reward - so-called zero-variance prompts. In this work, we argue that such prompts are not useless but can, in fact, provide meaningful feedback for policy optimization. To this end, we introduce RL with Zero-Variance Prompts (RL-ZVP), a novel algorithm that extract learning signals from zero-variance prompts. RL-ZVP directly rewards correctness and penalizes errors even without contrasting responses, modulating feedback with token-level characteristics to preserve informative, nuanced signals. Across six math reasoning benchmarks, RL-ZVP achieves significant improvements of up to 8.61 points in accuracy and 7.77 points in pass rate over GRPO, while consistently outperforming other baselines that filter out zero-variance prompts. These results highlight the untapped potential of learning from zero-variance prompts in RLVR.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated impressive capabilities in various text generation tasks. However, it remains challenging to use them off-the-shelf in streaming applications (such as live translation), where the output must continually update as the input context expands, while still maintaining a reasonable computational cost to meet the latency requirement.In this work, we reexamine the re-translation approach to simultaneous translation and propose Self-Speculative Biased Decoding, a novel inference paradigm designed to avoid repeatedly generating output from scratch for a consistently growing input stream. We propose using the most recent output as a draft for the current growing input context. During the verification stage, the output will be biased towards the draft token for a higher draft acceptance rate. This strategy not only minimizes flickering that might distract users but also leads to higher speedups. Conventional decoding may take charge from the point of divergence after draft verification and continue until the end condition is met.Unlike existing speculative decoding strategies, our approach eliminates the need for draft computations, making it a model-agnostic and plug-and-play solution for accelerating latency-sensitive streaming applications. Experimental results on simultaneous text-to-text re-translation demonstrate that our approach achieves up to 1.7x speedup compared to conventional auto-regressive re-translation without compromising quality. Additionally, it significantly reduces flickering by 80% by incorporating the display-only mask-k technique.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The expanding long-context capabilities of large language models are constrained by a significant memory bottleneck: the key-value (KV) cache required for autoregressive generation. This bottleneck is substantial; for instance, a Llama-3.1-8B model processing a 32K-token prompt at a batch size of 4 requires approximately 16GB for its KV cache, a size exceeding the model's weights. While KV-cache compression via low-rank projection is a promising direction, existing methods rely on a static, offline-learned subspace that performs poorly under data distribution shifts. To overcome these limitations, we introduce OjaKV, a novel framework that integrates a strategic hybrid storage policy with online subspace adaptation. First, OjaKV recognizes that not all tokens are equally important for compression; it preserves the crucial first and most recent tokens in full-rank, maintaining high-fidelity anchors for attention. Second, for the vast majority of intermediate tokens, it applies low-rank compression by incrementally adapting the projection basis using Oja's algorithm for online principal component analysis. This adaptation involves a comprehensive update during prompt prefilling and lightweight periodic updates during decoding, ensuring the subspace remains aligned with the evolving context. Crucially, our framework is fully compatible with modern attention modules like FlashAttention. Experiments demonstrate that OjaKV maintains or even improves zero-shot accuracy at high compression ratios. In particular, OjaKV achieves its strongest gains on very long-context benchmarks that require complex reasoning, highlighting the importance of online subspace adaptation in dynamically tracking context shifts. These results establish our hybrid framework as a practical, plug-and-play solution for memory-efficient long-context inference without requiring model fine-tuning.

  Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has become a leading approach for improving large language model (LLM) reasoning capabilities. Most current methods follow variants of Group Relative Policy Optimization, which samples multiple reasoning completions, scores them relative to each other, and adjusts the policy accordingly. However, these approaches invariably sample discrete tokens at each reasoning step, discarding the rich distributional information in the model's probability distribution over candidate tokens. While preserving and utilizing this distributional information has proven beneficial in non-RL settings, current RLVR methods seem to be unnecessarily constraining the reasoning search space by not using this information. To address this limitation, we investigate mixture-of-token generation (MoT-G) in RLVR. We present a unified framework that generalizes existing MoT-G approaches, including existing training-free methods that construct mixture embeddings as weighted sums over token embeddings, and extend RLVR to operate directly in this continuous mixture space for generating chain-of-thought. Evaluating two MoT-G variants on Reasoning-Gym, a suite of reasoning-intensive language tasks, we find that MoT--G methods achieve substantial improvements (5--35 \% gains on 7 out of 10 tasks) compared to standard decoding with the Qwen2.5-1.5B model, while reaching comparable accuracy with half the number of trajectories, suggesting improved training efficiency. Through comprehensive hidden-state and token-level analyses, we provide evidence that MoT--G's benefits may stem from its ability to maintain higher hidden-state entropy throughout the reasoning process and promote exploration in token space.

  Logic reasoning in natural language has been recognized as an important measure of human intelligence for Large Language Models (LLMs). Popular benchmarks may entangle multiple reasoning skills and thus provide unfaithful evaluations on the logic reasoning skill. Meanwhile, existing logic reasoning benchmarks are limited in language diversity and their distributions are deviated from the distribution of an ideal logic reasoning benchmark, which may lead to biased evaluation results. This paper thereby proposes a new classical logic benchmark DivLogicEval, consisting of natural sentences composed of diverse statements in a counterintuitive way. To ensure a more reliable evaluation, we also introduce a new evaluation metric that mitigates the influence of bias and randomness inherent in LLMs. Through experiments, we demonstrate the extent to which logical reasoning is required to answer the questions in DivLogicEval and compare the performance of different popular LLMs in conducting logical reasoning.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) are trained on vast and diverse internet corpora that often include inaccurate or misleading content. Consequently, LLMs can generate misinformation, making robust fact-checking essential. This review systematically analyzes how LLM-generated content is evaluated for factual accuracy by exploring key challenges such as hallucinations, dataset limitations, and the reliability of evaluation metrics. The review emphasizes the need for strong fact-checking frameworks that integrate advanced prompting strategies, domain-specific fine-tuning, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods. It proposes five research questions that guide the analysis of the recent literature from 2020 to 2025, focusing on evaluation methods and mitigation techniques. Instruction tuning, multi-agent reasoning, and RAG frameworks for external knowledge access are also reviewed. The key findings demonstrate the limitations of current metrics, the importance of validated external evidence, and the improvement of factual consistency through domain-specific customization. The review underscores the importance of building more accurate, understandable, and context-aware fact-checking. These insights contribute to the advancement of research toward more trustworthy models.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved strong performance in domains like mathematics, factual question answering, and code generation, yet their ability to reason on these tasks in different languages remains underdeveloped. Especially for low-resource languages such as Swahili or Thai, LLMs can often misinterpret prompts or default to reasoning in English. This implicit bias toward high-resource languages undermines factual accuracy, interpretability, and trust. We propose M2A, a novel method that combines multi-scale multilingual alignment with language-consistency rewards on machine-translated questions, training models to reason directly and accurately in the target language. Furthermore, existing multilingual benchmarks only evaluate on final answers, overlooking whether reasoning occurs in the intended language. To close this gap, we introduce GeoFact-X, a geography-based multilingual factual reasoning benchmark together with reasoning traces in five languages: English, Hindi, Japanese, Swahili, and Thai. Our results show that M2A significantly enhances multilingual reasoning fidelity in both mathematical and factual reasoning tasks, highlighting that reasoning-aware multilingual reinforcement learning is crucial for robust cross-lingual generalization.this https URL

  Biomedical researchers increasingly rely on large-scale structured databases for complex analytical tasks. However, current text-to-SQL systems often struggle to map qualitative scientific questions into executable SQL, particularly when implicit domain reasoning is required. We introduce BiomedSQL, the first benchmark explicitly designed to evaluate scientific reasoning in text-to-SQL generation over a real-world biomedical knowledge base. BiomedSQL comprises 68,000 question/SQL query/answer triples grounded in a harmonized BigQuery knowledge base that integrates gene-disease associations, causal inference from omics data, and drug approval records. Each question requires models to infer domain-specific criteria, such as genome-wide significance thresholds, effect directionality, or trial phase filtering, rather than rely on syntactic translation alone. We evaluate a range of open- and closed-source LLMs across prompting strategies and interaction paradigms. Our results reveal a substantial performance gap: GPT-o3-mini achieves 59.0% execution accuracy, while our custom multi-step agent, BMSQL, reaches 62.6%, both well below the expert baseline of 90.0%. BiomedSQL provides a new foundation for advancing text-to-SQL systems capable of supporting scientific discovery through robust reasoning over structured biomedical knowledge bases.

  Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) leverages large language models (LLMs) combined with external contexts to enhance the accuracy and reliability of generated responses. However, reliably attributing generated content to specific context segments, context attribution, remains challenging due to the computationally intensive nature of current methods, which often require extensive fine-tuning or human annotation. In this work, we introduce a novel Jensen-Shannon Divergence driven method to Attribute Response to Context (ARC-JSD), enabling efficient and accurate identification of essential context sentences without additional fine-tuning, gradient-calculation or surrogate modelling. Evaluations on a wide range of RAG benchmarks, such as TyDi QA, Hotpot QA, and Musique, using instruction-tuned LLMs in different scales demonstrate superior accuracy and significant computational efficiency improvements compared to the previous surrogate-based method. Furthermore, our mechanistic analysis reveals specific attention heads and multilayer perceptron (MLP) layers responsible for context attribution, providing valuable insights into the internal workings of RAG models and how they affect RAG behaviours.

  Lifelong learning enables large language models (LLMs) to adapt to evolving information by continually updating their internal knowledge. An ideal system should support efficient, wide-ranging updates while preserving existing capabilities and ensuring reliable deployment. Model editing stands out as a promising solution for this goal, offering a focused and efficient way to revise a model's internal knowledge. Although recent paradigms have made notable progress, they often struggle to meet the demands of practical lifelong adaptation at scale. To bridge this gap, we propose UltraEdit, a training-, subject-, and memory-free approach that is well-suited for ultra-scalable, real-world lifelong model editing. UltraEdit fundamentally differs from traditional paradigms by computing parameter shifts in one step using only a hidden state and its gradient, making the approach simple yet efficient. To improve scalability in lifelong settings, UltraEdit employs a lifelong normalization strategy that continuously updates feature statistics across turns, allowing it to adapt to distributional shifts and maintain consistency over time. UltraEdit achieves editing speeds over 7x faster than the previous state-of-the-art method, which was also the fastest known approach, while using less than 1/4 the VRAM. This makes it the only method currently capable of editing a 7B LLM on a 24GB consumer-grade GPU. Furthermore, we construct UltraEditBench, the largest dataset in the field to date with over 2M editing pairs, and demonstrate that our method supports up to 2M edits while maintaining high accuracy. Comprehensive experiments on five datasets and six models show that UltraEdit consistently achieves superior performance across diverse model editing scenarios, taking a further step towards safe and scalable lifelong learning.

  Grouped-Query Attention (GQA) is a widely adopted strategy for reducing the computational cost of attention layers in large language models (LLMs). However, current GQA configurations are often suboptimal because they overlook how context length influences inference cost. Since inference cost grows with context length, the most cost-efficient GQA configuration should also vary accordingly. In this work, we analyze the relationship among context length, model size, GQA configuration, and model loss, and introduce two innovations: (1) we decouple the total head size from the hidden size, enabling more flexible control over attention FLOPs; and (2) we jointly optimize the model size and the GQA configuration to arrive at a better allocation of inference resources between attention layers and other components. Our analysis reveals that commonly used GQA configurations are highly suboptimal for long-context scenarios. More importantly, we propose a recipe for deriving cost-optimal GQA configurations. Our results show that for long-context scenarios, one should use fewer attention heads while scaling up model size. Configurations selected by our recipe can reduce both memory usage and FLOPs by more than 50% compared to Llama-3's GQA, with *no degradation in model capabilities*. Our findings offer valuable insights for designing efficient long-context LLMs. The code is available atthis https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Agent systems powered by large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance on repository-level code-generation tasks. However, for tasks such as website codebase generation, which depend heavily on visual effects and user-interaction feedback, current code agents rely only on simple code execution for feedback and verification. This approach fails to capture the actual quality of the generated code. In this paper, we propose WebGen-Agent, a novel website-generation agent that leverages comprehensive and multi-level visual feedback to iteratively generate and refine the website codebase. Detailed and expressive text descriptions and suggestions regarding the screenshots and GUI-agent testing of the websites are generated by a visual language model (VLM), together with scores that quantify their quality. The screenshot and GUI-agent scores are further integrated with a backtracking and select-best mechanism, enhancing the performance of the agent. Utilizing the accurate visual scores inherent in the WebGen-Agent workflow, we further introduce \textit{Step-GRPO with Screenshot and GUI-agent Feedback} to improve the ability of LLMs to act as the reasoning engine of WebGen-Agent. By using the screenshot and GUI-agent scores at each step as the reward in Step-GRPO, we provide a dense and reliable process supervision signal, which effectively improves the model's website-generation ability. On the WebGen-Bench dataset, WebGen-Agent increases the accuracy of Claude-3.5-Sonnet from 26.4% to 51.9% and its appearance score from 3.0 to 3.9, outperforming the previous state-of-the-art agent system. Additionally, our Step-GRPO training approach increases the accuracy of Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct from 38.9% to 45.4% and raises the appearance score from 3.4 to 3.7.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The immense computational cost of training Large Language Models (LLMs) presents a major barrier to innovation. While FP8 training offers a promising solution with significant theoretical efficiency gains, its widespread adoption has been hindered by the lack of a comprehensive, open-source training recipe. To bridge this gap, we introduce an end-to-end FP8 training recipe that seamlessly integrates continual pre-training and supervised fine-tuning. Our methodology employs a fine-grained, hybrid-granularity quantization strategy to maintain numerical fidelity while maximizing computational efficiency. Through extensive experiments, including the continue pre-training of models on a 160B-token corpus, we demonstrate that our recipe is not only remarkably stable but also essentially lossless, achieving performance on par with the BF16 baseline across a suite of reasoning benchmarks. Crucially, this is achieved with substantial efficiency improvements, including up to a 22% reduction in training time, a 14% decrease in peak memory usage, and a 19% increase in throughput. Our results establish FP8 as a practical and robust alternative to BF16, and we will release the accompanying code to further democratize large-scale model training.

  Large language models (LLMs) have been widely used for problem-solving tasks. Most recent work improves their performance through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with labeled data or reinforcement learning (RL) from task feedback. In this paper, we study a new perspective: the divergence in solutions generated by LLMs for a single problem. We show that higher solution divergence is positively related to better problem-solving abilities across various models. Based on this finding, we propose solution divergence as a novel metric that can support both SFT and RL strategies. We test this idea on three representative problem domains and find that using solution divergence consistently improves success rates. These results suggest that solution divergence is a simple but effective tool for advancing LLM training and evaluation.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) excel at operating at scale by leveraging social media and various data crawled from the web. Whereas existing corpora are diverse, their frequent lack of long-term temporal structure may however limit an LLM's ability to contextualize semantic and normative evolution of language and to capture diachronic variation. To support analysis and training for the latter, we introduce CHRONOBERG, a temporally structured corpus of English book texts spanning 250 years, curated from Project Gutenberg and enriched with a variety of temporal annotations. First, the edited nature of books enables us to quantify lexical semantic change through time-sensitive Valence-Arousal-Dominance (VAD) analysis and to construct historically calibrated affective lexicons to support temporally grounded interpretation. With the lexicons at hand, we demonstrate a need for modern LLM-based tools to better situate their detection of discriminatory language and contextualization of sentiment across various time-periods. In fact, we show how language models trained sequentially on CHRONOBERG struggle to encode diachronic shifts in meaning, emphasizing the need for temporally aware training and evaluation pipelines, and positioning CHRONOBERG as a scalable resource for the study of linguistic change and temporal generalization.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Automating the translation of natural language to first-order logic (FOL) is crucial for knowledge representation and formal methods, yet remains challenging. We present a systematic evaluation of fine-tuned LLMs for this task, comparing architectures (encoder-decoder vs. decoder-only) and training strategies. Using the MALLS and Willow datasets, we explore techniques like vocabulary extension, predicate conditioning, and multilingual training, introducing metrics for exact match, logical equivalence, and predicate alignment. Our fine-tuned Flan-T5-XXL achieves 70% accuracy with predicate lists, outperforming GPT-4o and even the DeepSeek-R1-0528 model with CoT reasoning ability as well as symbolic systems like ccg2lambda. Key findings show: (1) predicate availability boosts performance by 15-20%, (2) T5 models surpass larger decoder-only LLMs, and (3) models generalize to unseen logical arguments (FOLIO dataset) without specific training. While structural logic translation proves robust, predicate extraction emerges as the main bottleneck.

  _Yifang Zhang, Pengfei Duan, Yiwen Yang, Shengwu Xiong_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Currently, the main approach for Large Language Models (LLMs) to tackle the hallucination issue is incorporating Knowledge Graphs(KGs).However, LLMs typically treat KGs as plain text, extracting only semantic information and limiting their use of the crucial structural aspects of KGs. Another challenge is the gap between the embedding spaces of KGs encoders and LLMs text embeddings, which hinders the effective integration of structured knowledge. To overcome these obstacles, we put forward the SSKG-LLM, an innovative model architecture that is designed to efficiently integrate both the Structural and Semantic information of KGs into the reasoning processes of LLMs. SSKG-LLM incorporates the Knowledge Graph Retrieval (KGR) module and the Knowledge Graph Encoding (KGE) module to preserve semantics while utilizing structure. Then, the Knowledge Graph Adaptation (KGA) module is incorporated to enable LLMs to understand KGs embeddings. We conduct extensive experiments and provide a detailed analysis to explore how incorporating the structural information of KGs can enhance the factual reasoning abilities of LLMs. Our code are available atthis https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) has demonstrated remarkable capabilities, elevating the critical importance of LLM safety. However, existing safety methods rely on ad-hoc taxonomy and lack a rigorous, systematic protection, failing to ensure safety for the nuanced and complex behaviors of modern LLM systems. To address this problem, we solve LLM safety from legal compliance perspectives, named safety compliance. In this work, we posit relevant established legal frameworks as safety standards for defining and measuring safety compliance, including the EU AI Act and GDPR, which serve as core legal frameworks for AI safety and data security in Europe. To bridge the gap between LLM safety and legal compliance, we first develop a new benchmark for safety compliance by generating realistic LLM safety scenarios seeded with legal statutes. Subsequently, we align Qwen3-8B using Group Policy Optimization (GRPO) to construct a safety reasoner, Compliance Reasoner, which effectively aligns LLMs with legal standards to mitigate safety risks. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the Compliance Reasoner achieves superior performance on the new benchmark, with average improvements of +10.45% for the EU AI Act and +11.85% for GDPR.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs), despite their remarkable capabilities, rely on singular, pre-dominant reasoning paradigms, hindering their performance on intricate problems that demand diverse cognitive strategies. To address this, we introduce Composite Reasoning (CR), a novel reasoning approach empowering LLMs to dynamically explore and combine multiple reasoning styles like deductive, inductive, and abductive for more nuanced problem-solving. Evaluated on scientific and medical question-answering benchmarks, our approach outperforms existing baselines like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and also surpasses the accuracy of DeepSeek-R1 style reasoning (SR) capabilities, while demonstrating superior sample efficiency and adequate token usage. Notably, CR adaptively emphasizes domain-appropriate reasoning styles. It prioritizes abductive and deductive reasoning for medical question answering, but shifts to causal, deductive, and inductive methods for scientific reasoning. Our findings highlight that by cultivating internal reasoning style diversity, LLMs acquire more robust, adaptive, and efficient problem-solving abilities.

  _Tiago Fernandes Tavares_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Unsupervised analysis of text corpora is challenging, especially in data-scarce domains where traditional topic models struggle. While these models offer a solution, they typically describe clusters with lists of keywords that require significant manual effort to interpret and often lack semantic coherence. To address this critical interpretability gap, we introduce Recursive Thematic Partitioning (RTP), a novel framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to interactively build a binary tree. Each node in the tree is a natural language question that semantically partitions the data, resulting in a fully interpretable taxonomy where the logic of each cluster is explicit. Our experiments demonstrate that RTP's question-driven hierarchy is more interpretable than the keyword-based topics from a strong baseline like BERTopic. Furthermore, we establish the quantitative utility of these clusters by showing they serve as powerful features in downstream classification tasks, particularly when the data's underlying themes correlate with the task labels. RTP introduces a new paradigm for data exploration, shifting the focus from statistical pattern discovery to knowledge-driven thematic analysis. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the thematic paths from the RTP tree can serve as structured, controllable prompts for generative models. This transforms our analytical framework into a powerful tool for synthesis, enabling the consistent imitation of specific characteristics discovered in the source corpus.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this paper, we offer a simple argument for the conclusion that the outputs of large language models (LLMs) are meaningless. Our argument is based on two key premises: (a) that certain kinds of intentions are needed in order for LLMs' outputs to have literal meanings, and (b) that LLMs cannot plausibly have the right kinds of intentions. We defend this argument from various types of responses, for example, the semantic externalist argument that deference can be assumed to take the place of intentions and the semantic internalist argument that meanings can be defined purely in terms of intrinsic relations between concepts, such as conceptual roles. We conclude the paper by discussing why, even if our argument is sound, the outputs of LLMs nevertheless seem meaningful and can be used to acquire true beliefs and even knowledge.

  _Shijing Hu, Jingyang Li, Zhihui Lu, Pan Zhou_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Speculative decoding accelerates large language model (LLM) inference by letting a lightweight draft model propose multiple tokens that the target model verifies in parallel. Yet existing training objectives optimize only a single greedy draft path, while decoding follows a tree policy that re-ranks and verifies multiple branches. This draft policy misalignment limits achievable speedups. We introduce Group Tree Optimization (GTO), which aligns training with the decoding-time tree policy through two components: (i) Draft Tree Reward, a sampling-free objective equal to the expected acceptance length of the draft tree under the target model, directly measuring decoding performance; (ii) Group-based Draft Policy Training, a stable optimization scheme that contrasts trees from the current and a frozen reference draft model, forming debiased group-standardized advantages and applying a PPO-style surrogate along the longest accepted sequence for robust updates. We further prove that increasing our Draft Tree Reward provably improves acceptance length and speedup. Across dialogue (MT-Bench), code (HumanEval), and math (GSM8K), and multiple LLMs (e.g., LLaMA-3.1-8B, LLaMA-3.3-70B, Vicuna-1.3-13B, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-LLaMA-8B), GTO increases acceptance length by 7.4% and yields an additional 7.7% speedup over prior state-of-the-art EAGLE-3. By bridging draft policy misalignment, GTO offers a practical, general solution for efficient LLM inference.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting helps Large Language Models (LLMs) tackle complex reasoning by eliciting explicit step-by-step rationales. However, CoT's verbosity increases latency and memory usage and may propagate early errors across long chains. We propose the Reasoning Capsule (R-Capsule), a framework that aims to combine the efficiency of latent reasoning with the transparency of explicit CoT. The core idea is to compress the high-level plan into a small set of learned latent tokens (a Reasoning Capsule) while keeping execution steps lightweight or explicit. This hybrid approach is inspired by the Information Bottleneck (IB) principle, where we encourage the capsule to be approximately minimal yet sufficient for the task. Minimality is encouraged via a low-capacity bottleneck, which helps improve efficiency. Sufficiency is encouraged via a dual objective: a primary task loss for answer accuracy and an auxiliary plan-reconstruction loss that encourages the capsule to faithfully represent the original textual plan. The reconstruction objective helps ground the latent space, thereby improving interpretability and reducing the use of uninformative shortcuts. Our framework strikes a balance between efficiency, accuracy, and interpretability, thereby reducing the visible token footprint of reasoning while maintaining or improving accuracy on complex benchmarks.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Legal Article Prediction (LAP) is a critical task in legal text classification, leveraging natural language processing (NLP) techniques to automatically predict relevant legal articles based on the fact descriptions of cases. As a foundational step in legal decision-making, LAP plays a pivotal role in determining subsequent judgments, such as charges and penalties. Despite its importance, existing methods face significant challenges in addressing the complexities of LAP. Supervised classification models (SCMs), such as CNN and BERT, struggle to fully capture intricate fact patterns due to their inherent limitations. Conversely, large language models (LLMs), while excelling in generative tasks, perform suboptimally in predictive scenarios due to the abstract and ID-based nature of legal articles. Furthermore, the diversity of legal systems across jurisdictions exacerbates the issue, as most approaches are tailored to specific countries and lack broader applicability. To address these limitations, we propose Uni-LAP, a universal framework for legal article prediction that integrates the strengths of SCMs and LLMs through tight collaboration. Specifically, in Uni-LAP, the SCM is enhanced with a novel Top-K loss function to generate accurate candidate articles, while the LLM employs syllogism-inspired reasoning to refine the final predictions. We evaluated Uni-LAP on datasets from multiple jurisdictions, and empirical results demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing baselines, showcasing its effectiveness and generalizability.

  With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), natural language processing (NLP) has achieved remarkable progress. Nonetheless, significant challenges remain in handling texts with ambiguity, polysemy, or uncertainty. We introduce the Fuzzy Reasoning Chain (FRC) framework, which integrates LLM semantic priors with continuous fuzzy membership degrees, creating an explicit interaction between probability-based reasoning and fuzzy membership reasoning. This transition allows ambiguous inputs to be gradually transformed into clear and interpretable decisions while capturing conflicting or uncertain signals that traditional probability-based methods cannot. We validate FRC on sentiment analysis tasks, where both theoretical analysis and empirical results show that it ensures stable reasoning and facilitates knowledge transfer across different model scales. These findings indicate that FRC provides a general mechanism for managing subtle and ambiguous expressions with improved interpretability and robustness.

  _Seongho Joo, Kyungmin Min, Jahyun Koo, Kyomin Jung_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Despite the great advancement of Language modeling in recent days, Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT3 are notorious for generating non-factual responses, so-called "hallucination" problems. Existing methods for detecting and alleviating this hallucination problem require external resources or the internal state of LLMs, such as the output probability of each token. Given the LLM's restricted external API availability and the limited scope of external resources, there is an urgent demand to establish the Black-Box approach as the cornerstone for effective hallucination detection. In this work, we propose a simple black-box hallucination detection metric after the investigation of the behavior of LLMs under expression of uncertainty. Our comprehensive analysis reveals that LLMs generate consistent responses when they present factual responses while non-consistent responses vice versa. Based on the analysis, we propose an efficient black-box hallucination detection metric with the expression of uncertainty. The experiment demonstrates that our metric is more predictive of the factuality in model responses than baselines that use internal knowledge of LLMs.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Political stance detection in low-resource and culturally complex settings poses a critical challenge for large language models (LLMs). In the Thai political landscape - marked by indirect language, polarized figures, and entangled sentiment and stance - LLMs often display systematic biases such as sentiment leakage and favoritism toward entities. These biases undermine fairness and reliability. We present ThaiFACTUAL, a lightweight, model-agnostic calibration framework that mitigates political bias without requiring fine-tuning. ThaiFACTUAL uses counterfactual data augmentation and rationale-based supervision to disentangle sentiment from stance and reduce bias. We also release the first high-quality Thai political stance dataset, annotated with stance, sentiment, rationales, and bias markers across diverse entities and events. Experimental results show that ThaiFACTUAL significantly reduces spurious correlations, enhances zero-shot generalization, and improves fairness across multiple LLMs. This work highlights the importance of culturally grounded debiasing techniques for underrepresented languages.

  Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being applied to clinical care, a domain where both accuracy and transparent reasoning are critical for safe and trustworthy deployment. Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting, which elicits step-by-step reasoning, has demonstrated improvements in performance and interpretability across a wide range of tasks. However, its effectiveness in clinical contexts remains largely unexplored, particularly in the context of electronic health records (EHRs), the primary source of clinical documentation, which are often lengthy, fragmented, and noisy. In this work, we present the first large-scale systematic study of CoT for clinical text understanding. We assess 95 advanced LLMs on 87 real-world clinical text tasks, covering 9 languages and 8 task types. Contrary to prior findings in other domains, we observe that 86.3\% of models suffer consistent performance degradation in the CoT setting. More capable models remain relatively robust, while weaker ones suffer substantial declines. To better characterize these effects, we perform fine-grained analyses of reasoning length, medical concept alignment, and error profiles, leveraging both LLM-as-a-judge evaluation and clinical expert evaluation. Our results uncover systematic patterns in when and why CoT fails in clinical contexts, which highlight a critical paradox: CoT enhances interpretability but may undermine reliability in clinical text tasks. This work provides an empirical basis for clinical reasoning strategies of LLMs, highlighting the need for transparent and trustworthy approaches.

  Automated scoring plays a crucial role in education by reducing the reliance on human raters, offering scalable and immediate evaluation of student work. While large language models (LLMs) have shown strong potential in this task, their use as end-to-end raters faces challenges such as low accuracy, prompt sensitivity, limited interpretability, and rubric misalignment. These issues hinder the implementation of LLM-based automated scoring in assessment practice. To address the limitations, we propose AutoSCORE, a multi-agent LLM framework enhancing automated scoring via rubric-aligned Structured COmponent REcognition. With two agents, AutoSCORE first extracts rubric-relevant components from student responses and encodes them into a structured representation (i.e., Scoring Rubric Component Extraction Agent), which is then used to assign final scores (i.e., Scoring Agent). This design ensures that model reasoning follows a human-like grading process, enhancing interpretability and robustness. We evaluate AutoSCORE on four benchmark datasets from the ASAP benchmark, using both proprietary and open-source LLMs (GPT-4o, LLaMA-3.1-8B, and LLaMA-3.1-70B). Across diverse tasks and rubrics, AutoSCORE consistently improves scoring accuracy, human-machine agreement (QWK, correlations), and error metrics (MAE, RMSE) compared to single-agent baselines, with particularly strong benefits on complex, multi-dimensional rubrics, and especially large relative gains on smaller LLMs. These results demonstrate that structured component recognition combined with multi-agent design offers a scalable, reliable, and interpretable solution for automated scoring.

  Understanding the qualitative intent of citations is essential for a comprehensive assessment of academic research, a task that poses unique challenges for agglutinative languages like Turkish. This paper introduces a systematic methodology and a foundational dataset to address this problem. We first present a new, publicly available dataset of Turkish citation intents, created with a purpose-built annotation tool. We then evaluate the performance of standard In-Context Learning (ICL) with Large Language Models (LLMs), demonstrating that its effectiveness is limited by inconsistent results caused by manually designed prompts. To address this core limitation, we introduce a programmable classification pipeline built on the DSPy framework, which automates prompt optimization systematically. For final classification, we employ a stacked generalization ensemble to aggregate outputs from multiple optimized models, ensuring stable and reliable predictions. This ensemble, with an XGBoost meta-model, achieves a state-of-the-art accuracy of 91.3\%. Ultimately, this study provides the Turkish NLP community and the broader academic circles with a foundational dataset and a robust classification framework paving the way for future qualitative citation studies.

  Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is a widely adopted parameter-efficient fine-tuning method for large language models. However, its linear nature limits expressiveness. We propose LoRAN, a non-linear extension of LoRA that applies lightweight transformations to the low-rank updates. We further introduce Sinter, a sine-based activation that adds structured perturbations without increasing parameter count. Experiments across summarization and classification tasks show that LoRAN consistently improves over QLoRA. Ablation studies reveal that Sinter outperforms standard activations such as Sigmoid, ReLU, and Tanh, highlighting the importance of activation design in lowrank tuning.

  Reward models (RMs) are crucial for aligning large language models (LLMs) with diverse cultures. Consequently, evaluating their cultural awareness is essential for further advancing global alignment of LLMs. However, existing RM evaluations fall short in assessing cultural awareness due to the scarcity of culturally relevant evaluation datasets. To fill this gap, we propose Cultural Awareness Reward modeling Benchmark (CARB), covering 10 distinct cultures across 4 cultural domains. Our extensive evaluation of state-of-the-art RMs reveals their deficiencies in modeling cultural awareness and demonstrates a positive correlation between performance on CARB and downstream multilingual cultural alignment tasks. Further analysis identifies the spurious correlations within culture-aware reward modeling, wherein RM's scoring relies predominantly on surface-level features rather than authentic cultural nuance understanding. To address these, we propose Think-as-Locals to elicit deeper culturally grounded reasoning from generative RMs via reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards (RLVR) and employ well-designed rewards to ensure accurate preference judgments and high-quality structured evaluation criteria generation. Experimental results validate its efficacy in mitigating spurious features interference and advancing culture-aware reward modeling.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in multilingual and multicultural environments where moral reasoning is essential for generating ethically appropriate responses. Yet, the dominant pretraining of LLMs on English-language data raises critical concerns about their ability to generalize judgments across diverse linguistic and cultural contexts. In this work, we systematically investigate how language mediates moral decision-making in LLMs. We translate two established moral reasoning benchmarks into five culturally and typologically diverse languages, enabling multilingual zero-shot evaluation. Our analysis reveals significant inconsistencies in LLMs' moral judgments across languages, often reflecting cultural misalignment. Through a combination of carefully constructed research questions, we uncover the underlying drivers of these disparities, ranging from disagreements to reasoning strategies employed by LLMs. Finally, through a case study, we link the role of pretraining data in shaping an LLM's moral compass. Through this work, we distill our insights into a structured typology of moral reasoning errors that calls for more culturally-aware AI.

  Large language model (LLM) providers boast big numbers for maximum context window sizes. To test the real world use of context windows, we 1) define a concept of maximum effective context window, 2) formulate a testing method of a context window's effectiveness over various sizes and problem types, and 3) create a standardized way to compare model efficacy for increasingly larger context window sizes to find the point of failure. We collected hundreds of thousands of data points across several models and found significant differences between reported Maximum Context Window (MCW) size and Maximum Effective Context Window (MECW) size. Our findings show that the MECW is, not only, drastically different from the MCW but also shifts based on the problem type. A few top of the line models in our test group failed with as little as 100 tokens in context; most had severe degradation in accuracy by 1000 tokens in context. All models fell far short of their Maximum Context Window by as much as 99 percent. Our data reveals the Maximum Effective Context Window shifts based on the type of problem provided, offering clear and actionable insights into how to improve model accuracy and decrease model hallucination rates.

  Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses large language model (LLM) hallucinations by grounding responses in external knowledge, but its effectiveness is compromised by poor-quality retrieved contexts containing irrelevant or noisy information. While existing approaches attempt to improve performance through context selection based on predefined context quality assessment metrics, they show limited gains over standard RAG. We attribute this limitation to their failure in holistically utilizing available information (query, context list, and generator) for comprehensive quality assessment. Inspired by recent advances in data selection, we reconceptualize context quality assessment as an inference-time data valuation problem and introduce the Contextual Influence Value (CI value). This novel metric quantifies context quality by measuring the performance degradation when removing each context from the list, effectively integrating query-aware relevance, list-aware uniqueness, and generator-aware alignment. Moreover, CI value eliminates complex selection hyperparameter tuning by simply retaining contexts with positive CI values. To address practical challenges of label dependency and computational overhead, we develop a parameterized surrogate model for CI value prediction during inference. The model employs a hierarchical architecture that captures both local query-context relevance and global inter-context interactions, trained through oracle CI value supervision and end-to-end generator feedback. Extensive experiments across 8 NLP tasks and multiple LLMs demonstrate that our context selection method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, effectively filtering poor-quality contexts while preserving critical information.

  Large language model hallucination represents a critical challenge where outputs deviate from factual accuracy due to distributional biases in training data. While recent investigations establish that specific hidden layers exhibit differences between hallucinatory and factual content, the precise localization of hallucination signals within layers remains unclear, limiting the development of efficient detection methods. We propose a dual-model architecture integrating a Projected Fusion (PF) block for adaptive inter-layer feature weighting and a Differential Feature Learning (DFL) mechanism that identifies discriminative features by computing differences between parallel encoders learning complementary representations from identical inputs. Through systematic experiments across HaluEval's question answering, dialogue, and summarization datasets, we demonstrate that hallucination signals concentrate in highly sparse feature subsets, achieving significant accuracy improvements on question answering and dialogue tasks. Notably, our analysis reveals a hierarchical "funnel pattern" where shallow layers exhibit high feature diversity while deep layers demonstrate concentrated usage, enabling detection performance to be maintained with minimal degradation using only 1\% of feature dimensions. These findings suggest that hallucination signals are more concentrated than previously assumed, offering a pathway toward computationally efficient detection systems that could reduce inference costs while maintaining accuracy.

  Adapting billion-parameter language models to a downstream task is still costly, even with parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT). We re-cast task adaptation as output-distribution alignment: the objective is to steer the output distribution toward the task distribution directly during decoding rather than indirectly through weight updates. Building on this view, we introduce Steering Vector Decoding (SVD), a lightweight, PEFT-compatible, and theoretically grounded method. We start with a short warm-start fine-tune and extract a task-aware steering vector from the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence gradient between the output distribution of the warm-started and pre-trained models. This steering vector is then used to guide the decoding process to steer the model's output distribution towards the task distribution. We theoretically prove that SVD is first-order equivalent to the gradient step of full fine-tuning and derive a globally optimal solution for the strength of the steering vector. Across three tasks and nine benchmarks, SVD paired with four standard PEFT methods improves multiple-choice accuracy by up to 5 points and open-ended truthfulness by 2 points, with similar gains (1-2 points) on commonsense datasets without adding trainable parameters beyond the PEFT adapter. SVD thus offers a lightweight, theoretically grounded path to stronger task adaptation for large language models.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) face significant accuracy degradation due to insufficient reasoning ability when dealing with complex and abstract tasks. Thought structures such as Chain of Thought (CoT) and Tree of Thought (ToT) focus on enhancing the reasoning capability of LLMs. However, they suffer from inherent drawbacks such as redundancy within the same layer of the tree structure and the singularity of the paths in the chain structure. Some studies have utilized Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods to enhance CoT and ToT in mitigating hallucinations in LLMs, yet the fundamental shortcomings of the thought structures still persist. Furthermore, when dealing with multi-entity and multi-hop information, the retrieved verification knowledge often contains large amounts of fragmented, superficial, or even erroneous data, misleading the reasoning process of LLMs. To address these issues, we propose the Matrix of Thought (MoT), a novel and efficient thought structure for LLMs. MoT explores problems in both horizontal and vertical dimensions through a "column-cell communication" mechanism, enabling LLMs to actively engage in multi-strategy and deep thinking while reducing redundancy in the thought nodes within the column cells, thereby enhancing the reasoning capability of LLMs. Additionally, through a fact-correction mechanism, it leverages the knowledge graph triples retrieved by RAG and the original text to construct knowledge units and correct erroneous answers. To validate the effectiveness of this method, we conducted extensive experiments in three tasks: 24-point game, question answering evaluation, and propositionthis http URLresults demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods, with reasoning time only 14.4\% of that of the baseline method, proving its efficiency and accuracy.

  Current evaluation paradigms for large language models (LLMs) suffer from overestimated or biased evaluations and mismatched question difficulty, leading to incomplete evaluations of knowledge and capability boundaries, which hinder their effective application and optimization. To address these challenges, we propose Agent-as-Interviewer, a dynamic evaluation paradigm that employs LLM agents to conduct multi-turn interactions for evaluation. Unlike current benchmarking or dynamic interaction paradigms, Agent-as-Interviewer utilizes agents to invoke knowledge tools for wider and deeper knowledge in the dynamic multi-turn question generation, achieving more comprehensive evaluations of LLM's knowledge boundaries. It also leverages agents to plan query strategies for adjustment of the question difficulty levels, enhancing the difficulty control to match the actual capabilities of target LLMs. Based on this paradigm, we develop JudgeAgent, a knowledge-wise dynamic evaluation framework that employs knowledge-driven synthesis as the agent's tool and uses difficulty scoring as strategy guidance, thereby finally providing valuable suggestions to help targets optimize themselves. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of JudgeAgent's suggestions, demonstrating that Agent-as-Interviewer can accurately identify the knowledge and capability boundaries of target models.

  Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by incorporating external knowledge into their input prompts. However, when the retrieved context contradicts the LLM's parametric knowledge, it often fails to resolve the conflict between incorrect external context and correct parametric knowledge, known as context-memory conflict. To tackle this problem, we introduce Conflict-Aware REtrieval-Augmented Generation (CARE), consisting of a context assessor and a base LLM. The context assessor encodes compact memory token embeddings from raw context tokens. Through grounded/adversarial soft prompting, the context assessor is trained to discern unreliable context and capture a guidance signal that directs reasoning toward the more reliable knowledge source. Extensive experiments show that CARE effectively mitigates context-memory conflicts, leading to an average performance gain of 5.0\% on QA and fact-checking benchmarks, establishing a promising direction for trustworthy and adaptive RAG systems.

  Reinforcement learning (RL) is a pivotal task for enhancing Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning. Conventional algorithms, however, typically adhere to a coarse-grained credit assignment paradigm, applying a uniform reward to all tokens in a sequence, a critical flaw in long-chain reasoning tasks. In this paper, we address this challenge and propose Dynamic Entropy Weighting, a novel mechanism that facilitates fine-grained rewards through two new algorithms: Group Token Policy Optimization (GTPO), which assigns an entropy-weighted reward to each token, and the analogous algorithm Sequence-Level GRPO (GRPO-S). Our approach is founded on the hypothesis that high policy entropy within a reasoning path is a powerful heuristic for cognitive effort at pivotal junctures, which can be repurposed into a learning signal. By repurposing policy entropy for reward shaping, we achieve true per-token credit assignment. Experimental results across challenging reasoning benchmarks validate the superiority of our approach, showing our methods significantly outperform a strong DAPO baseline and confirming our entropy-weighting mechanism as the key driver of this performance boost.

  Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) aims to interpret natural language queries and perform structured reasoning over knowledge graphs by leveraging their relational and semantic structures to retrieve accurate answers. Existing methods primarily follow either the retrieve-then-reason paradigm, which relies on Graph Neural Networks or heuristic rules to extract static candidate paths, or dynamic path generation strategies that employ LLMs with prompting to jointly perform retrieval and reasoning. However, the former lacks adaptability due to static path extraction and the absence of contextual refinement, while the latter suffers from high computational costs and limited evaluation accuracy because of their dependence on fixed scoring functions and repeated LLM calls. To address these issues, this paper proposes Dynamically Adaptive MCTS-based Reasoning (DAMR), a novel framework that integrates LLM-guided Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with adaptive path evaluation to enable efficient and context-aware KGQA. DAMR leverages MCTS as a backbone, where an LLM-based planner selects the top-$k$ semantically relevant relations at each expansion step to effectively reduce the search space. To enhance evaluation accuracy, we introduce a lightweight Transformer-based scorer that performs context-aware plausibility estimation by jointly encoding the question and relation sequence through cross-attention, thereby capturing fine-grained semantic shifts during multi-hop reasoning. Furthermore, to mitigate the scarcity of high-quality supervision, DAMR incorporates a dynamic pseudo-path refinement mechanism that periodically generates training signals from partial paths explored during search, enabling the scorer to continually adapt to the evolving distribution of reasoning trajectories. Extensive experiments on multiple KGQA benchmarks show that DAMR significantly outperforms SOTA methods.

  Current benchmarks for evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) often do not exhibit enough writing style diversity, with many adhering primarily to standardized conventions. Such benchmarks do not fully capture the rich variety of communication patterns exhibited by humans. Thus, it is possible that LLMs, which are optimized on these benchmarks, may demonstrate brittle performance when faced with "non-standard" input. In this work, we test this hypothesis by rewriting evaluation prompts using persona-based LLM prompting, a low-cost method to emulate diverse writing styles. Our results show that, even with identical semantic content, variations in writing style and prompt formatting significantly impact the estimated performance of the LLM under evaluation. Notably, we identify distinct writing styles that consistently trigger either low or high performance across a range of models and tasks, irrespective of model family, size, and recency. Our work offers a scalable approach to augment existing benchmarks, improving the external validity of the assessments they provide for measuring LLM performance across linguistic variations.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multi-turn dialogues are essential in many real-world applications of large language models, such as chatbots and virtual assistants. As conversation histories become longer, existing large language models face increasing computational and memory challenges, which hinder their ability to provide efficient and responsive interactions. Most current acceleration methods either compress the context or optimize key value caching, but they often rely on fixed or position-based heuristics that do not adapt well to the dynamic and unpredictable patterns found in actual multi-turn conversations. As a result, these models cannot accurately identify and prioritize the most relevant context, leading to degraded response quality. In this paper, we present LoopServe, an adaptive dual-phase inference acceleration framework for large language models in multi-turn dialogues. LoopServe introduces two main innovations. First, it performs online sparsification during the prefilling phase by dynamically selecting the most important parts of the attention matrix for each new input. Second, it uses progressive key value compression during decoding by adaptively maintaining a relevant and efficient cache based on the most recently generated output tokens. We also propose a new benchmark with eleven multi-turn datasets that reflect realistic query positions and conversational dependencies. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LoopServe consistently achieves superior effectiveness compared to existing baselines and significantly accelerates LLM inference across a wide range of long-context dialogue tasks.

  We propose cache steering, a lightweight method for implicit steering of language models via a one-shot intervention applied directly to the key-value cache. To validate its effectiveness, we apply cache steering to induce chain-of-thought reasoning in small language models. Our approach constructs steering vectors from reasoning traces, obtained either from teacher models (e.g., GPT-4o) or existing human annotations, that shift model behavior toward more explicit, multi-step reasoning without fine-tuning or prompt modifications. Experimental evaluations on diverse reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that cache steering improves both the qualitative structure of model reasoning and quantitative task performance. Additional experiments show that the method also scales to larger models and yields further gains on challenging datasets such as GPQA and MATH. Compared to prior activation steering techniques that require continuous interventions, our one-shot cache steering offers substantial advantages in terms of inference latency, hyperparameter stability, and ease of integration with existing inference APIs. Beyond mere reasoning induction, we show that cache steering enables controllable transfer of reasoning styles (e.g., stepwise, causal, analogical), making it a practical tool for behavior-level guidance of language models.

  Recent benchmarks for Large Language Model (LLM) agents primarily focus on evaluating reasoning, planning, and execution capabilities, while another critical component-memory, encompassing how agents memorize, update, and retrieve long-term information-is under-evaluated due to the lack of benchmarks. We term agents with memory mechanisms as memory agents. In this paper, based on classic theories from memory science and cognitive science, we identify four core competencies essential for memory agents: accurate retrieval, test-time learning, long-range understanding, and selective forgetting. Existing benchmarks either rely on limited context lengths or are tailored for static, long-context settings like book-based QA, which do not reflect the interactive, multi-turn nature of memory agents that incrementally accumulate information. Moreover, no existing benchmarks cover all four competencies. We introduce MemoryAgentBench, a new benchmark specifically designed for memory agents. Our benchmark transforms existing long-context datasets and incorporates newly constructed datasets into a multi-turn format, effectively simulating the incremental information processing characteristic of memory agents. By carefully selecting and curating datasets, our benchmark provides comprehensive coverage of the four core memory competencies outlined above, thereby offering a systematic and challenging testbed for assessing memory quality. We evaluate a diverse set of memory agents, ranging from simple context-based and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems to advanced agents with external memory modules and tool integration. Empirical results reveal that current methods fall short of mastering all four competencies, underscoring the need for further research into comprehensive memory mechanisms for LLM agents.

  Post-training algorithms such as Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) are widely used to adapt multimodal large language models to downstream tasks. While effective at task adaptation, their impact on prior knowledge remains unclear. In this paper, we introduce jigsaw puzzles as a novel task absent from existing pretraining corpora and systematically study the behavior of SFT and RFT on open-source multimodal model, Qwen2.5-VL series. Our experiments reveal a sharp trade-off: SFT enables rapid task acquisition but leads to catastrophic forgetting, whereas RFT learns more slowly but maintains prior knowledge. We study this phenomenon through learning dynamics by examining both the magnitude and direction of how training data influence prior knowledge. Our analysis shows that RFT mainly reinforces correct samples naturally aligned with the base model's probability landscape, leading to weaker interference with prior knowledge. Moreover, training on RFT-simulated rollouts, which exert a small magnitude of influence and are well aligned in direction to prior knowledge, allows SFT to preserve prior knowledge better while rapidly learning new tasks. These findings suggest that distribution of training data, rather than algorithmic differences, plays a central role in forgetting, and highlight RFT's potential for stable continual learning in multimodal large language models.

  As large language models (LLMs) are progressively deployed in various real-world applications, personalization of LLMs has become increasingly important. While various approaches to LLM personalization such as prompt-based and training-based methods have been actively explored, the development of effective decoding-time algorithms remains largely overlooked, despite their demonstrated potential. In this paper, we propose CoPe (Contrasting Personal Preference), a novel decoding-time approach applied after performing parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) on user-specific data. Our core idea is to leverage reward-guided decoding specifically for personalization by maximizing each user's implicit reward signal. We evaluate CoPe across five open-ended personalized text generation tasks. Our empirical results demonstrate that CoPe achieves strong performance, improving personalization by an average of 10.57% in ROUGE-L, without relying on external reward models or additional training procedures.

  Probing large language models (LLMs) has yielded valuable insights into their internal mechanisms by linking neural activations to interpretable semantics. However, the complex mechanisms that link neuron's functional co-activation with the emergent model capabilities remains largely unknown, hindering a deeper understanding and safer development of LLMs. In this work, we introduce graph probing, a method for uncovering the functional connectivity of LLM neurons and relating it to language generation performance. By probing models across diverse LLM families and scales, we discover a universal predictability of next-token prediction performance using only neural topology, which persists even when retaining just 1% of neuron connections. Strikingly, probing on topology outperforms probing on activation by up to 130.4%, suggesting that neural topology contains orders of richer information of LLM performance than neural activation, which can be easily extracted with simple linear or MLP probes. To explain the dependence between neural topology and language performance, we identify default networks and hub neurons in LLMs and provide causal evidence by interventional experiments on multiple benchmarks, showing that LLMs actually exploit these topological information. Further analyses suggest that neural topology can be effectively leveraged to improve the efficiency, reliability, and safety of LLMs through proof-of-concept applications in model pruning, hallucination detection, and LLM fingerprinting.

  Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in domains such as visual understanding and mathematical reasoning. However, their application in the medical domain is constrained by two key challenges: (1) multimodal medical datasets are scarce and often contain sparse information, limiting reasoning depth; and (2) Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), though effective in general domains, cannot reliably improve model performance in the medical domain. To overcome these challenges, during the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage, we incorporate high-quality textual reasoning data and general multimodal data alongside multimodal medical data to efficiently enhance foundational medical capabilities and restore the base model's reasoning ability. Moreover, considering that there are some multimodal medical datasets with sparse information, we further synthesize reflective-pattern-injected chain-of-thought (CoT) in addition to general CoT samples, equipping the model with initial reflective reasoning capabilities that provide a structured foundation for subsequent RLVR training. Finally, we introduce our InfiMed-Series models, InfiMed-SFT-3B and InfiMed-RL-3B, both of which deliver state-of-the-art performance across seven multimodal medical benchmarks. Notably, InfiMed-RL-3B achieves an average accuracy of 59.2%, outperforming even larger models like InternVL3-8B, which achieves 57.3%. Specifically, during the SFT phase, we utilized 188K samples, while the RLVR phase incorporated 36K samples, demonstrating the efficacy of both training strategies in achieving superior performance. We also conducted a series of extensive experiments, which provide valuable insights that contribute to advancing the performance of MLLMs in medical scenarios.

  Open-domain question answering (OpenQA) represents a cornerstone in natural language processing (NLP), primarily focused on extracting answers from unstructured textual data. With the rapid advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs), LLM-based OpenQA methods have reaped the benefits of emergent understanding and answering capabilities enabled by massive parameters compared to traditional methods. However, most of these methods encounter two critical challenges: how to integrate knowledge into LLMs effectively and how to adaptively generate results with specific answer formats for various task situations. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework named GenKI, which aims to improve the OpenQA performance by exploring Knowledge Integration and controllable Generation on LLMs simultaneously. Specifically, we first train a dense passage retrieval model to retrieve associated knowledge from a given knowledge base. Subsequently, we introduce a novel knowledge integration model that incorporates the retrieval knowledge into instructions during fine-tuning to intensify the model. Furthermore, to enable controllable generation in LLMs, we leverage a certain fine-tuned LLM and an ensemble based on text consistency incorporating all coherence, fluency, and answer format assurance. Finally, extensive experiments conducted on the TriviaQA, MSMARCO, and CMRC2018 datasets, featuring diverse answer formats, have demonstrated the effectiveness of GenKI with comparison of state-of-the-art baselines. Moreover, ablation studies have disclosed a linear relationship between the frequency of retrieved knowledge and the model's ability to recall knowledge accurately against the ground truth.

  Evaluating and iterating upon recommender systems is crucial, yet traditional A/B testing is resource-intensive, and offline methods struggle with dynamic user-platform interactions. While agent-based simulation is promising, existing platforms often lack a mechanism for user actions to dynamically reshape the environment. To bridge this gap, we introduce RecInter, a novel agent-based simulation platform for recommender systems featuring a robust interaction mechanism. In RecInter platform, simulated user actions (e.g., likes, reviews, purchases) dynamically update item attributes in real-time, and introduced Merchant Agents can reply, fostering a more realistic and evolving ecosystem. High-fidelity simulation is ensured through Multidimensional User Profiling module, Advanced Agent Architecture, and LLM fine-tuned on Chain-of-Thought (CoT) enriched interaction data. Our platform achieves significantly improved simulation credibility and successfully replicates emergent phenomena like Brand Loyalty and the Matthew Effect. Experiments demonstrate that this interaction mechanism is pivotal for simulating realistic system evolution, establishing our platform as a credible testbed for recommender systems research.

  Large language models (LLMs) require iterative updates to address the outdated information problem, where LLM unlearning offers an approach for selective removal. However, mainstream unlearning methods primarily rely on fine-tuning techniques, which often lack precision in targeted unlearning and struggle to balance unlearning efficacy with general ability under massive and sequential settings. To bridge this gap, in this work, we introduce UniErase, a novel unlearning framework that demonstrates precision and balanced performances between knowledge unlearning and ability retaining. We first propose the Unlearning Token, which is optimized to steer LLMs toward a forgetting space. To achieve concrete unlearning behaviors, we further introduce the lightweight Unlearning Edit to efficiently associate the unlearning targets with this meta-token. Serving as a new unlearning paradigm via editing, UniErase achieves outstanding performances across batch, sequential, and precise unlearning tasks under fictitious and real-world knowledge scenarios. On the TOFU benchmark, compared with 8 baselines, UniErase, modifying only $\sim$ \textbf{3.66%} of the LLM parameters, outperforms the previous best-forgetting baseline by \textbf{$\sim$ 4.01$\times$} for \textbf{model ability} with even higher unlearning efficacy. Similarly, UniErase, with better ability retention, also surpasses the previous best-retaining method by \textbf{35.96%} for \textbf{unlearning efficacy}, showing balanced and dual top-tier performances in the current unlearning community.

  Large language models (LLMs) consistently benefit from further fine-tuning on various tasks. However, we observe that directly tuning the Instruct (i.e., instruction-tuned) models often leads to marginal improvements and even performance degeneration. Notably, paired Base models, the foundation for these Instruct variants, contain highly similar weight values (i.e., less than 2% on average for Llama 3.1 8B). The Base model tends to be a good learner yet a weak backbone without post-training. Therefore, we propose a novel Shadow-FT framework to tune the Instruct models by leveraging the corresponding Base models. The key insight is to fine-tune the Base model, and then \textit{directly} graft the learned weight updates to the Instruct model. Our proposed Shadow-FT introduces no additional parameters, is easy to implement, and significantly improves performance. We conduct extensive experiments on tuning mainstream LLMs, such as Qwen 3 and Llama 3 series, and evaluate them across 19 benchmarks covering coding, reasoning, and mathematical tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that Shadow-FT consistently outperforms conventional full-parameter and parameter-efficient tuning approaches. Further analyses indicate that Shadow-FT can be applied to multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and combined with direct preference optimization~(DPO).

  Token-level attention tuning, a class of training-free methods including Post-hoc Attention Steering (PASTA) and Attention Calibration (ACT), has emerged as a promising way to improve frozen LLMs with interpretable interventions. However, these methods depend on auxiliary heuristics to identify "important" task-specific tokens, which can introduce bias and limit applicability when token importance is unclear or when using optimized kernels where attention maps are inaccessible. We propose a simpler and more elegant alternative: acting only on the initial token (e.g., <BOS> in LLaMA). We show theoretically that adding lightweight biases to this token's attention logits monotonically controls the entropy of the downstream attention distribution - an effect amplified by its natural function as an attention sink. Our empirical analysis reveals that this tuning process can positively affect LLMs and better unlock their pretrained knowledge, with stronger effects in early layers and distinct scaling preferences across attention heads. Building on these insights, we introduce ZeroTuning: a training-free method that improves LLM performance by applying head-specific attention adjustments to the initial token, requiring zero parameter updates. We present two variants: a supervised mode that calibrates on validation examples, and a novel unsupervised mode that directly minimizes the model's output entropy. The method is lightweight, kernel-agnostic, and requires only four lines of modification to the standard LlamaAttention code. It achieves broad gains across 15 datasets and outperforms previous, more complex methods; for instance, with Llama-3.1-8B, it yields relative improvements of 19.9% on classification, 4.5% on question answering, and 2.1% on dialogue. ZeroTuning also works out-of-the-box with quantized inference and maintains its performance improvements with increasing context lengths.

  We introduce fs1, a simple yet effective method that improves the factuality of reasoning traces by sourcing them from large reasoning models (e.g., DeepSeek-R1) and grounding them by conditioning on knowledge graph (KG) paths. We fine-tune eight instruction-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) on 3.9K factually grounded reasoning traces and rigorously evaluate them on six complex open-domain question-answering (QA) benchmarks encompassing 23.9K questions. Our results demonstrate that our fs1-tuned model (32B parameters) consistently outperforms instruction-tuned counterparts with parallel sampling by 6-14 absolute points (pass@$16$). Our detailed analysis shows that fs1 considerably improves model performance over more complex questions (requiring 3 or more hops on KG paths) and numerical answer types compared to the baselines. Furthermore, in single-pass inference, we notice that smaller LLMs show the most improvements. While prior works demonstrate the effectiveness of reasoning traces primarily in the STEM domains, our work shows strong evidence that anchoring reasoning to factual KG paths is a critical step in transforming LLMs for reliable knowledge-intensive tasks.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have been transformative across many domains. However, hallucination -- confidently outputting incorrect information -- remains one of the leading challenges for LLMs. This raises the question of how to accurately assess and quantify the uncertainty of LLMs. Extensive literature on traditional models has explored Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) to measure uncertainty and employed calibration techniques to address the misalignment between uncertainty and accuracy. While some of these methods have been adapted for LLMs, the literature lacks an in-depth analysis of their effectiveness and does not offer a comprehensive benchmark to enable insightful comparison among existing solutions. In this work, we fill this gap via a systematic survey of representative prior works on UQ and calibration for LLMs and introduce a rigorous benchmark. Using two widely used reliability datasets, we empirically evaluate six related methods, which justify the significant findings of our review. Finally, we provide outlooks for key future directions and outline open challenges. To the best of our knowledge, this survey is the first dedicated study to review the calibration methods and relevant metrics for LLMs.

  Navigating dilemmas involving conflicting values is challenging even for humans in high-stakes domains, let alone for AI, yet prior work has been limited to everyday scenarios. To close this gap, we introduce CLASH (Character perspective-based LLM Assessments in Situations with High-stakes), a meticulously curated dataset consisting of 345 high-impact dilemmas along with 3,795 individual perspectives of diverse values. CLASH enables the study of critical yet underexplored aspects of value-based decision-making processes, including understanding of decision ambivalence and psychological discomfort as well as capturing the temporal shifts of values in the perspectives of characters. By benchmarking 14 non-thinking and thinking models, we uncover several key findings. (1) Even strong proprietary models, such as GPT-5 and Claude-4-Sonnet, struggle with ambivalent decisions, achieving only 24.06 and 51.01 accuracy. (2) Although LLMs reasonably predict psychological discomfort, they do not adequately comprehend perspectives involving value shifts. (3) Cognitive behaviors that are effective in the math-solving and game strategy domains do not transfer to value reasoning. Instead, new failure patterns emerge, including early commitment and overcommitment. (4) The steerability of LLMs towards a given value is significantly correlated with their value preferences. (5) Finally, LLMs exhibit greater steerability when reasoning from a third-party perspective, although certain values (e.g., safety) benefit uniquely from first-person framing.

  Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods have significantly enhanced the performance of large language models (LLMs) in domain-specific tasks. However, existing RAG methods do not adequately utilize the naturally inherent hierarchical knowledge in human cognition, which limits the capabilities of RAG systems. In this paper, we introduce a new RAG approach, called HiRAG, which utilizes hierarchical knowledge to enhance the semantic understanding and structure capturing capabilities of RAG systems in the indexing and retrieval processes. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that HiRAG achieves significant performance improvements over the state-of-the-art baseline methods.

  Advanced reasoning in large language models has achieved remarkable performance on challenging tasks, but the prevailing long-context reasoning paradigm faces critical limitations: quadratic computational scaling with sequence length, reasoning constrained by maximum context boundaries, and performance degradation beyond pre-training context windows. Existing approaches primarily compress reasoning chains without addressing the fundamental scaling problem. To overcome these challenges, we introduce InftyThink, a paradigm that transforms monolithic reasoning into an iterative process with intermediate summarization. By interleaving short reasoning segments with concise progress summaries, our approach enables unbounded reasoning depth while maintaining bounded computational costs. This creates a characteristic sawtooth memory pattern that significantly reduces computational complexity compared to traditional approaches. Furthermore, we develop a methodology for reconstructing long-context reasoning datasets into our iterative format, transforming OpenR1-Math into 333K training instances. Experiments across multiple model architectures demonstrate that our approach reduces computational costs while improving performance, with Qwen2.5-Math-7B showing 3-13% improvements across MATH500, AIME24, and GPQA_diamond benchmarks. Our work challenges the assumed trade-off between reasoning depth and computational efficiency, providing a more scalable approach to complex reasoning without architectural modifications.

  While Large Language Models (LLMs) can amplify online misinformation, they also show promise in tackling misinformation. In this paper, we empirically study the capabilities of three LLMs -- ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude -- in countering political misinformation. We implement a two-step, chain-of-thought prompting approach, where models first identify credible sources for a given claim and then generate persuasive responses. Our findings suggest that models struggle to ground their responses in real news sources, and tend to prefer citing left-leaning sources. We also observe varying degrees of response diversity among models. Our findings highlight concerns about using LLMs for fact-checking through only prompt-engineering, emphasizing the need for more robust guardrails. Our results have implications for both researchers and non-technical users.

  In real-world scenarios, most of the data obtained from the information retrieval (IR) system is unstructured. Converting natural language sentences into structured Knowledge Graphs (KGs) remains a critical challenge. We identified three limitations with respect to existing KG construction methods: (1) There could be a large amount of noise in real-world documents, which could result in extracting messy information. (2) Naive LLMs usually extract inaccurate knowledge from some domain-specific documents. (3) Hallucination phenomenon cannot be overlooked when directly using LLMs to construct KGs. In this paper, we propose \textbf{GraphJudge}, a KG construction framework to address the aforementioned challenges. In this framework, we designed an entity-centric strategy to eliminate the noise information in the documents. And we fine-tuned a LLM as a graph judge to finally enhance the quality of generated KGs. Experiments conducted on two general and one domain-specific text-graph pair datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance against various baseline methods with strong generalization abilities.

  Instruction-fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) under 14B parameters continue to underperform on natural language understanding (NLU) tasks, often trailing smaller models like BERT-base on benchmarks such as GLUE and SuperGLUE. Motivated by the success of reinforcement learning in reasoning tasks (e.g., DeepSeek), we explore Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) as a framework to improve the NLU capabilities of LLMs. We frame NLU as a reinforcement learning environment, treating token generation as a sequence of actions and optimizing for reward signals based on alignment with ground-truth labels. PPO consistently outperforms supervised fine-tuning, yielding an average improvement of 6.3 points on GLUE, and surpasses zero-shot and few-shot prompting by 38.7 and 26.1 points, respectively. Notably, PPO-tuned models outperform GPT-4o by over 4\% on average across sentiment and natural language inference tasks, including gains of 7.3\% on the Mental Health dataset and 10.9\% on SIGA-nli. This work highlights a promising direction for adapting LLMs to new tasks by reframing them as reinforcement learning problems, enabling learning through simple end-task rewards rather than extensive data curation.

  Context-grounded hallucinations are cases where model outputs contain information not verifiable against the source text. We study the applicability of LLMs for localizing such hallucinations, as a more practical alternative to existing complex evaluation pipelines. In the absence of established benchmarks for meta-evaluation of hallucinations localization, we construct one tailored to LLMs, involving a challenging human annotation of over 1,000 examples. We complement the benchmark with an LLM-based evaluation protocol, verifying its quality in a human evaluation. Since existing representations of hallucinations limit the types of errors that can be expressed, we propose a new representation based on free-form textual descriptions, capturing the full range of possible errors. We conduct a comprehensive study, evaluating four large-scale LLMs, which highlights the benchmark's difficulty, as the best model achieves an F1 score of only 0.67. Through careful analysis, we offer insights into optimal prompting strategies for the task and identify the main factors that make it challenging for LLMs: (1) a tendency to incorrectly flag missing details as inconsistent, despite being instructed to check only facts in the output; and (2) difficulty with outputs containing factually correct information absent from the source - and thus not verifiable - due to alignment with the model's parametric knowledge.

  LLMs trained for logical reasoning excel at step-by-step deduction to reach verifiable answers. However, this paradigm is ill-suited for navigating social situations, which induce an interpretive process of analyzing ambiguous cues that rarely yield a definitive outcome. To bridge this gap, we introduce Cognitive Reasoning, a paradigm modeled on human social cognition. It formulates the interpretive process into a structured cognitive flow of interconnected cognitive units (e.g., observation or attribution), which combine adaptively to enable effective social thinking and responses. We then propose CogFlow, a complete framework that instills this capability in LLMs. CogFlow first curates a dataset of cognitive flows by simulating the associative and progressive nature of human thought via tree-structured planning. After instilling the basic cognitive reasoning capability via supervised fine-tuning, CogFlow adopts reinforcement learning to enable the model to improve itself via trial and error, guided by a multi-objective reward that optimizes both cognitive flow and response quality. Extensive experiments show that CogFlow effectively enhances the social cognitive capabilities of LLMs, and even humans, leading to more effective social decision-making.

  Alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs) along multiple objectives-helpfulness, harmlessness, and honesty (HHH)-is critical for safe and reliable deployment. Prior work has used steering vector-small control signals injected into hidden states-to guide LLM outputs, typically via one-to-one (1-to-1) Transformer decoders. In this setting, optimizing a single alignment objective can inadvertently overwrite representations learned for other objectives, leading to catastrophic forgetting. More recent approaches extend steering vectors via one-to-many (1-to-N) Transformer decoders. While this alleviates catastrophic forgetting, naive multi-branch designs optimize each objective independently, which can cause inference fragmentation-outputs across HHH objectives may become inconsistent. We propose Adaptive Multi-Branch Steering (AMBS), a two-stage 1-to-N framework for unified and efficient multi-objective alignment. In Stage I, post-attention hidden states of the Transformer layer are computed once to form a shared representation. In Stage II, this representation is cloned into parallel branches and steered via a policy-reference mechanism, enabling objective-specific control while maintaining cross-objective consistency. Empirical evaluations on Alpaca, BeaverTails, and TruthfulQA show that AMBS consistently improves HHH alignment across multiple 7B LLM backbones. For example, on DeepSeek-7B, AMBS improves average alignment scores by +32.4% and reduces unsafe outputs by 11.0% compared to a naive 1-to-N baseline, while remaining competitive with state-of-the-art methods.

  Large language models (LLMs) often respond confidently to questions even when they lack the necessary information, leading to hallucinated answers. In this work, we study the problem of (un)answerability detection, focusing on extractive question answering (QA) where the model should determine if a passage contains sufficient information to answer a given question. We propose a simple approach for identifying a direction in the model's activation space that captures unanswerability and uses it for classification. This direction is selected by applying activation additions during inference and measuring their impact on the model's abstention behavior. We show that projecting hidden activations onto this direction yields a reliable score for (un)answerability classification. Experiments on two open-weight LLMs and four extractive QA benchmarks show that our method effectively detects unanswerable questions and generalizes better across datasets than existing prompt-based and classifier-based approaches. Moreover, the obtained directions extend beyond extractive QA to unanswerability that stems from factors, such as lack of scientific consensus and subjectivity. Last, causal interventions show that adding or ablating the directions effectively controls the abstention behavior of the model.

  A wealth of operational intelligence is locked within the unstructured free-text of wind turbine maintenance logs, a resource largely inaccessible to traditional quantitative reliability analysis. While machine learning has been applied to this data, existing approaches typically stop at classification, categorising text into predefined labels. This paper addresses the gap in leveraging modern large language models (LLMs) for more complex reasoning tasks. We introduce an exploratory framework that uses LLMs to move beyond classification and perform deep semantic analysis. We apply this framework to a large industrial dataset to execute four analytical workflows: failure mode identification, causal chain inference, comparative site analysis, and data quality auditing. The results demonstrate that LLMs can function as powerful "reliability co-pilots," moving beyond labelling to synthesise textual information and generate actionable, expert-level hypotheses. This work contributes a novel and reproducible methodology for using LLMs as a reasoning tool, offering a new pathway to enhance operational intelligence in the wind energy sector by unlocking insights previously obscured in unstructured data.

FLEXI systematically evaluates the latency, quality, and conversational effectiveness of real-time dialogue through six diverse human-LLM interaction scenarios, revealing significant gaps between open source and commercial models in emergency awareness, turn terminating, and interaction latency. Finally, we suggest that next token-pair prediction offers a promising path toward achieving truly seamless and human-like full-duplex interaction.

  Prevalent semantic speech tokenizers, designed to capture linguistic content, are surprisingly fragile. We find they are not robust to meaning-irrelevant acoustic perturbations; even at high Signal-to-Noise Ratios (SNRs) where speech is perfectly intelligible, their output token sequences can change drastically, increasing the learning burden for downstream LLMs. This instability stems from two flaws: a brittle single-path quantization architecture and a distant training signal indifferent to intermediate token stability. To address this, we introduce StableToken, a tokenizer that achieves stability through a consensus-driven mechanism. Its multi-branch architecture processes audio in parallel, and these representations are merged via a powerful bit-wise voting mechanism to form a single, stable token sequence. StableToken sets a new state-of-the-art in token stability, drastically reducing Unit Edit Distance (UED) under diverse noise conditions. This foundational stability translates directly to downstream benefits, significantly improving the robustness of SpeechLLMs on a variety of tasks.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) with reasoning capabilities have achieved state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of tasks. Despite its empirical success, the tasks and model scales at which reasoning becomes effective, as well as its training and inference costs, remain underexplored. In this work, we rely on a synthetic data distillation framework to conduct a large-scale supervised study. We compare Instruction Fine-Tuning (IFT) and reasoning models of varying sizes, on a wide range of math-centric and general-purpose tasks, evaluating both multiple-choice and open-ended formats. Our analysis reveals that reasoning consistently improves model performance, often matching or surpassing significantly larger IFT systems. Notably, while IFT remains Pareto-optimal in training and inference costs, reasoning models become increasingly valuable as model size scales, overcoming IFT performance limits on reasoning-intensive and open-ended tasks.

  Large language models (LLMs) often seamlessly adapt to new tasks through in-context learning (ICL) or supervised fine-tuning (SFT). However, both of these approaches face key limitations: ICL is inefficient when handling many demonstrations, and SFT incurs training overhead while sacrificing flexibility. Mapping instructions or demonstrations from context directly into adapter parameters offers an appealing alternative. While prior work explored generating adapters based on a single input context, it has overlooked the need to integrate multiple chunks of information. To address this gap, we introduce CompAs, a meta-learning framework that translates context into adapter parameters with a compositional structure. Adapters generated this way can be merged algebraically, enabling instructions, demonstrations, or retrieved passages to be seamlessly combined without reprocessing long prompts. Critically, this approach yields three benefits: lower inference cost, robustness to long-context instability, and establishes a principled solution when input exceeds the model's context window. Furthermore, CompAs encodes information into adapter parameters in a reversible manner, enabling recovery of input context through a decoder, facilitating safety and security. Empirical results on diverse multiple-choice and extractive question answering tasks show that CompAs outperforms ICL and prior generator-based methods, especially when scaling to more inputs. Our work establishes composable adapter generation as a practical and efficient alternative for scaling LLM deployment.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) are gearing up to surpass human creativity. The veracity of the statement needs careful consideration. In recent developments, critical questions arise regarding the authenticity of human work and the preservation of their creativity and innovative abilities. This paper investigates such issues. This paper addresses machine-generated text detection across several scenarios, including document-level binary and multiclass classification or generator attribution, sentence-level segmentation to differentiate between human-AI collaborative text, and adversarial attacks aimed at reducing the detectability of machine-generated text. We introduce a new work called BMAS English: an English language dataset for binary classification of human and machine text, for multiclass classification, which not only identifies machine-generated text but can also try to determine its generator, and Adversarial attack addressing where it is a common act for the mitigation of detection, and Sentence-level segmentation, for predicting the boundaries between human and machine-generated text. We believe that this paper will address previous work in Machine-Generated Text Detection (MGTD) in a more meaningful way.

  Fact-checking real-world claims, particularly numerical claims, is inherently complex that require multistep reasoning and numerical reasoning for verifying diverse aspects of the claim. Although large language models (LLMs) including reasoning models have made tremendous advances, they still fall short on fact-checking real-world claims that require a combination of compositional and numerical reasoning. They are unable to understand nuance of numerical aspects, and are also susceptible to the reasoning drift issue, where the model is unable to contextualize diverse information resulting in misinterpretation and backtracking of reasoning process. In this work, we systematically explore scaling test-time compute (TTS) for LLMs on the task of fact-checking complex numerical claims, which entails eliciting multiple reasoning paths from an LLM. We train a verifier model (VERIFIERFC) to navigate this space of possible reasoning paths and select one that could lead to the correct verdict. We observe that TTS helps mitigate the reasoning drift issue, leading to significant performance gains for fact-checking numerical claims. To improve compute efficiency in TTS, we introduce an adaptive mechanism that performs TTS selectively based on the perceived complexity of the claim. This approach achieves 1.8x higher efficiency than standard TTS, while delivering a notable 18.8% performance improvement over single-shot claim verification methods.

  _Shaoning Sun, Jiachen Yu, Zongqi Wang, Xuewei Yang, Tianle Gu, Yujiu Yang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs), generative reward models (GRMs) have been widely adopted for reward modeling and evaluation. Previous studies have primarily focused on training specialized GRMs by optimizing them on preference datasets with the judgment correctness as supervision. While it's widely accepted that GRMs with stronger problem-solving capabilities typically exhibit superior judgment abilities, we first identify a significant solve-to-judge gap when examining individual queries. Specifically, the solve-to-judge gap refers to the phenomenon where GRMs struggle to make correct judgments on some queries (14%-37%), despite being fully capable of solving them. In this paper, we propose the Solve-to-Judge (S2J) approach to address this problem. Specifically, S2J simultaneously leverages both the solving and judging capabilities on a single GRM's output for supervision, explicitly linking the GRM's problem-solving and evaluation abilities during model optimization, thereby narrowing the gap. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that S2J effectively reduces the solve-to-judge gap by 16.2%, thereby enhancing the model's judgment performance by 5.8%. Notably, S2J achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance among GRMs built on the same base model while utilizing a significantly smaller training dataset. Moreover, S2J accomplishes this through self-evolution without relying on more powerful external models for distillation.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Post-training compression of large language models (LLMs) largely relies on low-rank weight approximation, which represents each column of a weight matrix in a shared low-dimensional subspace. While this is a computationally efficient strategy, the imposed structural constraint is rigid and can lead to a noticeable model accuracy drop. In this work, we propose CoSpaDi (Compression via Sparse Dictionary Learning), a novel training-free compression framework that replaces low-rank decomposition with a more flexible structured sparse factorization in which each weight matrix is represented with a dense dictionary and a column-sparse coefficient matrix. This formulation enables a union-of-subspaces representation: different columns of the original weight matrix are approximated in distinct subspaces spanned by adaptively selected dictionary atoms, offering greater expressiveness than a single invariant basis. Crucially, CoSpaDi leverages a small calibration dataset to optimize the factorization such that the output activations of compressed projection layers closely match those of the original ones, thereby minimizing functional reconstruction error rather than mere weight approximation. This data-aware strategy preserves better model fidelity without any fine-tuning under reasonable compression ratios. Moreover, the resulting structured sparsity allows efficient sparse-dense matrix multiplication and is compatible with post-training quantization for further memory and latency gains. We evaluate CoSpaDi across multiple Llama and Qwen models under per-layer and per-group settings at 20-50\% compression ratios, demonstrating consistent superiority over state-of-the-art data-aware low-rank methods both in accuracy and perplexity. Our results establish structured sparse dictionary learning as a powerful alternative to conventional low-rank approaches for efficient LLM deployment.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Fine-tuning, a foundational method for adapting large language models, has long been considered ineffective for model editing. Here, we challenge this belief, arguing that the reported failure arises not from the inherent limitation of fine-tuning itself, but from adapting it to the sequential nature of the editing task, a single-pass depth-first pipeline that optimizes each sample to convergence before moving on. While intuitive, this depth-first pipeline coupled with sample-wise updating over-optimizes each edit and induces interference across edits. Our controlled experiments reveal that simply restoring fine-tuning to the standard breadth-first (i.e., epoch-based) pipeline with mini-batch optimization substantially improves its effectiveness for model editing. Moreover, fine-tuning in editing also suffers from suboptimal tuning parameter locations inherited from prior methods. Through systematic analysis of tuning locations, we derive LocFT-BF, a simple and effective localized editing method built on the restored fine-tuning framework. Extensive experiments across diverse LLMs and datasets demonstrate that LocFT-BF outperforms state-of-the-art methods by large margins. Notably, to our knowledge, it is the first to sustain 100K edits and 72B-parameter models,10 x beyond prior practice, without sacrificing general capabilities. By clarifying a long-standing misconception and introducing a principled localized tuning strategy, we advance fine-tuning from an underestimated baseline to a leading method for model editing, establishing a solid foundation for future research.

  The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to widespread AI-Generated Text (AIGT) on social media platforms, creating unique challenges where content dynamics are driven by user engagement and evolve over time. However, existing datasets mainly depict static AIGT detection. In this work, we introduce RedNote-Vibe, the first longitudinal (5-years) dataset for social media AIGT analysis. This dataset is sourced from Xiaohongshu platform, containing user engagement metrics (e.g., likes, comments) and timestamps spanning from the pre-LLM period to July 2025, which enables research into the temporal dynamics and user interaction patterns of AIGT. Furthermore, to detect AIGT in the context of social media, we propose PsychoLinguistic AIGT Detection Framework (PLAD), an interpretable approach that leverages psycholinguistic features. Our experiments show that PLAD achieves superior detection performance and provides insights into the signatures distinguishing human and AI-generated content. More importantly, it reveals the complex relationship between these linguistic features and social media engagement. The dataset is available atthis https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) enhances factual reasoning in LLMs by structurally modeling knowledge through graph-based representations. However, existing GraphRAG approaches face two core limitations: shallow retrieval that fails to surface all critical evidence, and inefficient utilization of pre-constructed structural graph data, which hinders effective reasoning from complex queries. To address these challenges, we propose \textsc{GraphSearch}, a novel agentic deep searching workflow with dual-channel retrieval for GraphRAG. \textsc{GraphSearch} organizes the retrieval process into a modular framework comprising six modules, enabling multi-turn interactions and iterative reasoning. Furthermore, \textsc{GraphSearch} adopts a dual-channel retrieval strategy that issues semantic queries over chunk-based text data and relational queries over structural graph data, enabling comprehensive utilization of both modalities and their complementary strengths. Experimental results across six multi-hop RAG benchmarks demonstrate that \textsc{GraphSearch} consistently improves answer accuracy and generation quality over the traditional strategy, confirming \textsc{GraphSearch} as a promising direction for advancing graph retrieval-augmented generation.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) hold substantial potential for accelerating academic ideation but face critical challenges in grounding ideas and mitigating confirmation bias for further refinement. We propose integrating motivational knowledge graphs and socratic dialogue to address these limitations in enhanced LLM ideation (MotivGraph-SoIQ). This novel framework provides essential grounding and practical idea improvement steps for LLM ideation by integrating a Motivational Knowledge Graph (MotivGraph) with a Q-Driven Socratic Ideator. The MotivGraph structurally stores three key node types(problem, challenge and solution) to offer motivation grounding for the LLM ideation process. The Ideator is a dual-agent system utilizing Socratic questioning, which facilitates a rigorous refinement process that mitigates confirmation bias and improves idea quality across novelty, experimental rigor, and motivational rationality dimensions. On the ICLR25 paper topics dataset, MotivGraph-SoIQ exhibits clear advantages over existing state-of-the-art approaches across LLM-based scoring, ELO ranking, and human evaluation metrics.

  How to make human-interpreter-like read/write decisions for simultaneous speech translation (SimulST) systems? Current state-of-the-art systems formulate SimulST as a multi-turn dialogue task, requiring specialized interleaved training data and relying on computationally expensive large language model (LLM) inference for decision-making. In this paper, we propose SimulSense, a novel framework for SimulST that mimics human interpreters by continuously reading input speech and triggering write decisions to produce translation when a new sense unit is perceived. Experiments against two state-of-the-art baseline systems demonstrate that our proposed method achieves a superior quality-latency tradeoff and substantially improved real-time efficiency, where its decision-making is up to 9.6x faster than the baselines.

  _Min-Hsuan Yeh, Yixuan Li, Tanwi Mallick_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) aims to mitigate hallucinations in large language models (LLMs) by grounding responses in retrieved documents. Yet, RAG-based LLMs still hallucinate even when provided with correct and sufficient context. A growing line of work suggests that this stems from an imbalance between how models use external context and their internal knowledge, and several approaches have attempted to quantify these signals for hallucination detection. However, existing methods require extensive hyperparameter tuning, limiting their generalizability. We propose LUMINA, a novel framework that detects hallucinations in RAG systems through context-knowledge signals: external context utilization is quantified via distributional distance, while internal knowledge utilization is measured by tracking how predicted tokens evolve across transformer layers. We further introduce a framework for statistically validating these measurements. Experiments on common RAG hallucination benchmarks and four open-source LLMs show that LUMINA achieves consistently high AUROC and AUPRC scores, outperforming prior utilization-based methods by up to +13% AUROC on HalluRAG. Moreover, LUMINA remains robust under relaxed assumptions about retrieval quality and model matching, offering both effectiveness and practicality.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multi-Turn Long-Form Question Answering (MT-LFQA) is a key application paradigm of Large Language Models (LLMs) in knowledge-intensive domains. However, existing benchmarks are limited to single-turn dialogue, while multi-turn dialogue benchmarks typically assess other orthogonal capabilities rather than knowledge-intensive factuality. To bridge this critical gap, we introduce \textbf{KnowMT-Bench}, the \textit{first-ever} benchmark designed to systematically evaluate MT-LFQA for LLMs across knowledge-intensive fields, including medicine, finance, and law. To faithfully assess the model's real-world performance, KnowMT-Bench employs a dynamic evaluation setting where models generate their own multi-turn dialogue histories given logically progressive question sequences. The factual capability and information delivery efficiency of the \textit{final-turn} answer are then evaluated using a human-validated automated pipeline. Our experiments reveal that multi-turn contexts degrade performance: factual capability declines due to the contextual noise from self-generated histories, while information efficiency drops as models become more verbose with increasing dialogue length. We then investigate mitigation strategies, demonstrating that retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) can effectively alleviate and even reverse this factual degradation. These findings underscore the importance of our benchmark in evaluating and enhancing the conversational factual capabilities of LLMs in real-world knowledge-intensive applications.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Cascade systems route computational requests to smaller models when possible and defer to larger models only when necessary, offering a promising approach to balance cost and quality in LLM deployment. However, they face a fundamental challenge in open-ended text generation: determining output reliability when generation quality lies on a continuous spectrum, often with multiple valid responses. To address this, we propose semantic agreement -- meaning-level consensus between ensemble outputs -- as a training-free signal for reliable deferral. We show that when diverse model outputs agree semantically, their consensus is a stronger reliability signal than token-level confidence. Evaluated from 500M to 70B-parameter models, we find that semantic cascades match or surpass target-model quality at 40% of the cost and reduce latency by up to 60%. Our method requires no model internals, works across black-box APIs, and remains robust to model updates, making it a practical baseline for real-world LLM deployment.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) transcend passive generation and act as goal-directed agents by invoking external tools. Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a principled framework for optimizing these emergent tool-use policies, yet the prevailing paradigm relies exclusively on sparse outcome rewards and lacks consideration of the particularity of tool-use tasks, inflating policy-gradient variance and resulting in inefficient training. To better understand and address these challenges, we first establish a theoretical link between policy entropy and training stability of tool-use tasks, which reveals that structured, low-entropy tokens are primary determinants of rewards. Motivated by this insight, we propose \textbf{Res}haped \textbf{T}oken-level policy gradients (\textbf{ResT}) for tool-use tasks. ResT reshapes the policy gradient through entropy-informed token reweighting, progressively upweighting reasoning tokens as training proceeds. This entropy-aware scheme enables a smooth shift from structural correctness to semantic reasoning and stabilizes convergence in multi-turn tool-use tasks. Evaluation on BFCL and API-Bank shows that ResT achieves state-of-the-art results, outperforming prior methods by up to $8.76\%$. When fine-tuned on a 4B base LLM, ResT further surpasses GPT-4o by $4.11\%$ on single-turn tasks and $1.50\%$ on multi-turn base tasks.

  In this paper, we introduce a combination of novel and exciting tasks: the solution and generation of linguistic puzzles. We focus on puzzles used in Linguistic Olympiads for high school students. We first extend the existing benchmark for the task of solving linguistic puzzles. We explore the use of Large Language Models (LLMs), including recent state-of-the-art models such as OpenAI's o1, for solving linguistic puzzles, analyzing their performance across various linguistic topics. We demonstrate that LLMs outperform humans on most puzzles types, except for those centered on writing systems, and for the understudied languages. We use the insights from puzzle-solving experiments to direct the novel task of puzzle generation. We believe that automating puzzle generation, even for relatively simple puzzles, holds promise for expanding interest in linguistics and introducing the field to a broader audience. This finding highlights the importance of linguistic puzzle generation as a research task: such puzzles can not only promote linguistics but also support the dissemination of knowledge about rare and understudied languages.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Simultaneous Machine Translation (SiMT) requires high-quality translations under strict real-time constraints, which traditional encoder-decoder policies with only READ/WRITE actions cannot fully address. We extend the action space of SiMT with four adaptive actions: SENTENCE_CUT, DROP, PARTIAL_SUMMARIZATION and PRONOMINALIZATION, which enable real-time restructuring, omission, and simplification while preserving semantic fidelity. We implement these actions in a decoder-only large language model (LLM) framework and construct training references through action-aware prompting. To evaluate both quality and latency, we further develop a latency-aware TTS pipeline that maps textual outputs to speech with realistic timing. Experiments on the ACL60/60 English-Chinese and English-German benchmarks show that our framework consistently improves semantic metrics (e.g., COMET-KIWI) and achieves lower delay (measured by Average Lagging) compared to reference translations and salami-based baselines. Notably, combining DROP and SENTENCE_CUT yields the best overall balance between fluency and latency. These results demonstrate that enriching the action space of LLM-based SiMT provides a promising direction for bridging the gap between human and machine interpretation.

  Deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) for question answering (QA) over lengthy contexts is a significant challenge. In industrial settings, this process is often hindered by high computational costs and latency, especially when multiple questions must be answered based on the same context. In this work, we explore the capabilities of LLMs to answer multiple questions based on the same conversational context. We conduct extensive experiments and benchmark a range of both proprietary and public models on this challenging task. Our findings highlight that while strong proprietary LLMs like GPT-4o achieve the best overall performance, fine-tuned public LLMs with up to 8 billion parameters can surpass GPT-4o in accuracy, which demonstrates their potential for transparent and cost-effective deployment in real-world applications.

  As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into daily life, there is growing demand for AI assistants that are not only reactive but also proactive and personalized. While recent advances have pushed forward proactivity and personalization individually, their combination remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce ProPerSim, a new task and simulation framework for developing assistants capable of making timely, personalized recommendations in realistic home scenarios. In our simulation environment, a user agent with a rich persona interacts with the assistant, providing ratings on how well each suggestion aligns with its preferences and context. The assistant's goal is to use these ratings to learn and adapt to achieve higher scores over time. Built on ProPerSim, we propose ProPerAssistant, a retrieval-augmented, preference-aligned assistant that continually learns and adapts through user feedback. Experiments across 32 diverse personas show that ProPerAssistant adapts its strategy and steadily improves user satisfaction, highlighting the promise of uniting proactivity and personalization.

  Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Graph-based RAG has become the important paradigm for enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs) with external knowledge. However, existing approaches face a fundamental trade-off. While graph-based methods are inherently dependent on high-quality graph structures, they face significant practical constraints: manually constructed knowledge graphs are prohibitively expensive to scale, while automatically extracted graphs from corpora are limited by the performance of the underlying LLM extractors, especially when using smaller, local-deployed models. This paper presents Think-on-Graph 3.0 (ToG-3), a novel framework that introduces Multi-Agent Context Evolution and Retrieval (MACER) mechanism to overcome these limitations. Our core innovation is the dynamic construction and refinement of a Chunk-Triplets-Community heterogeneous graph index, which pioneeringly incorporates a dual-evolution mechanism of Evolving Query and Evolving Sub-Graph for precise evidence retrieval. This approach addresses a critical limitation of prior Graph-based RAG methods, which typically construct a static graph index in a single pass without adapting to the actual query. A multi-agent system, comprising Constructor, Retriever, Reflector, and Responser agents, collaboratively engages in an iterative process of evidence retrieval, answer generation, sufficiency reflection, and, crucially, evolving query and subgraph. This dual-evolving multi-agent system allows ToG-3 to adaptively build a targeted graph index during reasoning, mitigating the inherent drawbacks of static, one-time graph construction and enabling deep, precise reasoning even with lightweight LLMs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ToG-3 outperforms compared baselines on both deep and broad reasoning benchmarks, and ablation studies confirm the efficacy of the components of MACER framework.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Peer review serves as a backbone of academic research, but in most AI conferences, the review quality is degrading as the number of submissions explodes. To reliably detect low-quality reviews, we define misinformed review points as either "weaknesses" in a review that contain incorrect premises, or "questions" in a review that can be already answered by the paper. We verify that 15.2% of weaknesses and 26.4% of questions are misinformed and introduce ReviewScore indicating if a review point is misinformed. To evaluate the factuality of each premise of weaknesses, we propose an automated engine that reconstructs every explicit and implicit premise from a weakness. We build a human expert-annotated ReviewScore dataset to check the ability of LLMs to automate ReviewScore evaluation. Then, we measure human-model agreements on ReviewScore using eight current state-of-the-art LLMs and verify moderate agreements. We also prove that evaluating premise-level factuality shows significantly higher agreements than evaluating weakness-level factuality. A thorough disagreement analysis further supports a potential of fully automated ReviewScore evaluation.

  This pilot study explores the localisation capabilities of state-of-the-art multilingual AI models when translating figurative language, such as idioms and puns, from English into a diverse range of global languages. It expands on existing LLM translation research and industry benchmarks, which emphasise grammatical accuracy and token-level correctness, by focusing on cultural appropriateness and overall localisation quality - critical factors for real-world applications like marketing and e-commerce.To investigate these challenges, this project evaluated a sample of 87 LLM-generated translations of e-commerce marketing emails across 24 regional dialects of 20 languages. Human reviewers fluent in each target language provided quantitative ratings and qualitative feedback on faithfulness to the original's tone, meaning, and intended audience. Findings suggest that, while leading models generally produce grammatically correct translations, culturally nuanced language remains a clear area for improvement, often requiring substantial human refinement. Notably, even high-resource global languages, despite topping industry benchmark leaderboards, frequently mistranslated figurative expressions and wordplay.This work challenges the assumption that data volume is the most reliable predictor of machine translation quality and introduces cultural appropriateness as a key determinant of multilingual LLM performance - an area currently underexplored in existing academic and industry benchmarks. As a proof of concept, this pilot highlights limitations of current multilingual AI systems for real-world localisation use cases. Results of this pilot support the opportunity for expanded research at greater scale to deliver generalisable insights and inform deployment of reliable machine translation workflows in culturally diverse contexts.

  The advancement of vision language models (VLMs) has empowered embodied agents to accomplish simple multimodal planning tasks, but not long-horizon ones requiring long sequences of actions. In text-only simulations, long-horizon planning has seen significant improvement brought by repositioning the role of LLMs. Instead of directly generating action sequences, LLMs translate the planning domain and problem into a formal planning language like the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL), which can call a formal solver to derive the plan in a verifiable manner. In multimodal environments, research on VLM-as-formalizer remains scarce, usually involving gross simplifications such as predefined object vocabulary or overly similar few-shot examples. In this work, we present a suite of five VLM-as-formalizer pipelines that tackle one-shot, open-vocabulary, and multimodal PDDL formalization. We evaluate those on an existing benchmark while presenting another two that for the first time account for planning with authentic, multi-view, and low-quality images. We conclude that VLM-as-formalizer greatly outperforms end-to-end plan generation. We reveal the bottleneck to be vision rather than language, as VLMs often fail to capture an exhaustive set of necessary object relations. While generating intermediate, textual representations such as captions or scene graphs partially compensate for the performance, their inconsistent gain leaves headroom for future research directions on multimodal planning formalization.

  Trustworthy Large Language Models (LLMs) must cite human-verifiable sources in high-stakes domains such as healthcare, law, academia, and finance, where even small errors can have severe consequences. Practitioners and researchers face a choice: let models generate citations during decoding, or let models draft answers first and then attach appropriate citations. To clarify this choice, we introduce two paradigms: Generation-Time Citation (G-Cite), which produces the answer and citations in one pass, and Post-hoc Citation (P-Cite), which adds or verifies citations after drafting. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation from zero-shot to advanced retrieval-augmented methods across four popular attribution datasets and provide evidence-based recommendations that weigh trade-offs across use cases. Our results show a consistent trade-off between coverage and citation correctness, with retrieval as the main driver of attribution quality in both paradigms. P-Cite methods achieve high coverage with competitive correctness and moderate latency, whereas G-Cite methods prioritize precision at the cost of coverage and speed. We recommend a retrieval-centric, P-Cite-first approach for high-stakes applications, reserving G-Cite for precision-critical settings such as strict claim verification.

  Diabetes mellitus is a major global health challenge, affecting over half a billion adults worldwide with prevalence projected to rise. Although the American Diabetes Association (ADA) provides clear diagnostic thresholds, early recognition remains difficult due to vague symptoms, borderline laboratory values, gestational complexity, and the demands of long-term monitoring. Advances in large language models (LLMs) offer opportunities to enhance decision support through structured, interpretable, and patient-friendly outputs. This study evaluates GPT-5, the latest generative pre-trained transformer, using a simulation framework built entirely on synthetic cases aligned with ADA Standards of Care 2025 and inspired by public datasets including NHANES, Pima Indians, EyePACS, and MIMIC-IV. Five representative scenarios were tested: symptom recognition, laboratory interpretation, gestational diabetes screening, remote monitoring, and multimodal complication detection. For each, GPT-5 classified cases, generated clinical rationales, produced patient explanations, and output structured JSON summaries. Results showed strong alignment with ADA-defined criteria, suggesting GPT-5 may function as a dual-purpose tool for clinicians and patients, while underscoring the importance of reproducible evaluation frameworks for responsibly assessing LLMs in healthcare.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) often exhibit sycophantic behaviors -- such as excessive agreement with or flattery of the user -- but it is unclear whether these behaviors arise from a single mechanism or multiple distinct processes. We decompose sycophancy into sycophantic agreement and sycophantic praise, contrasting both with genuine agreement. Using difference-in-means directions, activation additions, and subspace geometry across multiple models and datasets, we show that: (1) the three behaviors are encoded along distinct linear directions in latent space; (2) each behavior can be independently amplified or suppressed without affecting the others; and (3) their representational structure is consistent across model families and scales. These results suggest that sycophantic behaviors correspond to distinct, independently steerable representations.

  Small language models (SLMs) become unprecedentedly appealing due to their approximately equivalent performance compared to large language models (LLMs) in certain fields with less energy and time consumption during training and inference. However, the personally identifiable information (PII) leakage of SLMs for downstream tasks has yet to be explored. In this study, we investigate the PII leakage of the chatbot based on SLM. We first finetune a new chatbot, i.e., ChatBioGPT based on the backbone of BioGPT using medical datasets Alpaca and HealthCareMagic. It shows a matchable performance in BERTscore compared with previous studies of ChatDoctor and ChatGPT. Based on this model, we prove that the previous template-based PII attacking methods cannot effectively extract the PII in the dataset for leakage detection under the SLM condition. We then propose GEP, which is a greedy coordinate gradient-based (GCG) method specifically designed for PII extraction. We conduct experimental studies of GEP and the results show an increment of up to 60$\times$ more leakage compared with the previous template-based methods. We further expand the capability of GEP in the case of a more complicated and realistic situation by conducting free-style insertion where the inserted PII in the dataset is in the form of various syntactic expressions instead of fixed templates, and GEP is still able to reveal a PII leakage rate of up to 4.53%.

  For an LLM to correctly respond to an instruction it must understand both the semantics and the domain (i.e., subject area) of a given task-instruction pair. However, syntax can also convey implicit information Recent work shows that syntactic templates -- frequent sequences of Part-of-Speech (PoS) tags -- are prevalent in training data and often appear in model outputs. In this work we characterize syntactic templates, domain, and semantics in task-instruction pairs. We identify cases of spurious correlations between syntax and domain, where models learn to associate a domain with syntax during training; this can sometimes override prompt semantics. Using a synthetic training dataset, we find that the syntactic-domain correlation can lower performance (mean 0.51 +/- 0.06) on entity knowledge tasks in OLMo-2 models (1B-13B). We introduce an evaluation framework to detect this phenomenon in trained models, and show that it occurs on a subset of the FlanV2 dataset in open (OLMo-2-7B; Llama-4-Maverick), and closed (GPT-4o) models. Finally, we present a case study on the implications for safety finetuning, showing that unintended syntactic-domain correlations can be used to bypass refusals in OLMo-2-7B Instruct and GPT-4o. Our findings highlight two needs: (1) to explicitly test for syntactic-domain correlations, and (2) to ensure syntactic diversity in training data, specifically within domains, to prevent such spurious correlations.

  Long document summarization remains a significant challenge for current large language models (LLMs), as existing approaches commonly struggle with information loss, factual inconsistencies, and coherence issues when processing excessively long documents. We propose SummQ, a novel adversarial multi-agent framework that addresses these limitations through collaborative intelligence between specialized agents operating in two complementary domains: summarization and quizzing. Our approach employs summary generators and reviewers that work collaboratively to create and evaluate comprehensive summaries, while quiz generators and reviewers create comprehension questions that serve as continuous quality checks for the summarization process. This adversarial dynamic, enhanced by an examinee agent that validates whether the generated summary contains the information needed to answer the quiz questions, enables iterative refinement through multifaceted feedback mechanisms. We evaluate SummQ on three widely used long document summarization benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods across ROUGE and BERTScore metrics, as well as in LLM-as-a-Judge and human evaluations. Our comprehensive analyses reveal the effectiveness of the multi-agent collaboration dynamics, the influence of different agent configurations, and the impact of the quizzing mechanism. This work establishes a new approach for long document summarization that uses adversarial agentic collaboration to improve summarization quality.

  Reliable question answering with large language models (LLMs) is challenged by hallucinations, fluent but factually incorrect outputs arising from epistemic uncertainty. Existing entropy-based semantic-level uncertainty estimation methods are limited by sampling noise and unstable clustering of variable-length answers. We propose Semantic Reformulation Entropy (SRE), which improves uncertainty estimation in two ways. First, input-side semantic reformulations produce faithful paraphrases, expand the estimation space, and reduce biases from superficial decoder tendencies. Second, progressive, energy-based hybrid clustering stabilizes semantic grouping. Experiments on SQuAD and TriviaQA show that SRE outperforms strong baselines, providing more robust and generalizable hallucination detection. These results demonstrate that combining input diversification with multi-signal clustering substantially enhances semantic-level uncertainty estimation.

  The demand for efficient deployment of large language models (LLMs) has driven interest in quantization, which reduces inference cost, and parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), which lowers training overhead. This motivated the development of quantization-aware PEFT to produce accurate yet efficient quantized models. In this setting, reducing quantization error prior to fine-tuning is crucial for achieving high model accuracy. However, existing methods that rely on low-rank adaptation suffer from limited representational capacity. Recent Fourier-related transform (FT)-based adapters offer greater representational power than low-rank adapters, but their direct integration into quantized models often results in ineffective error reduction and increased computational overhead. To overcome these limitations, we propose QWHA, a method that integrates FT-based adapters into quantized models by employing the Walsh-Hadamard Transform (WHT) as the transform kernel, together with a novel adapter initialization scheme incorporating adaptive parameter selection and value refinement. We demonstrate that QWHA effectively mitigates quantization errors while facilitating fine-tuning, and that its design substantially reduces computational cost. Experimental results show that QWHA consistently outperforms baselines in low-bit quantization accuracy and achieves significant training speedups over existing FT-based adapters.

  Despite widespread success in language understanding and generation, large language models (LLMs) exhibit unclear and often inconsistent behavior when faced with tasks that require probabilistic reasoning. In this work, we present the first comprehensive study of the reasoning capabilities of LLMs over explicit discrete probability distributions. Given observations from a probability distribution, we evaluate models on three carefully designed tasks, mode identification, maximum likelihood estimation, and sample generation, by prompting them to provide responses to queries about either the joint distribution or its conditionals. These tasks thus probe a range of probabilistic skills, including frequency analysis, marginalization, and generative behavior. Through comprehensive empirical evaluations, we demonstrate that there exists a clear performance gap between smaller and larger models, with the latter demonstrating stronger inference and surprising capabilities in sample generation. Furthermore, our investigations reveal notable limitations, including sensitivity to variations in the notation utilized to represent probabilistic outcomes and performance degradation of over 60% as context length increases. Together, our results provide a detailed understanding of the probabilistic reasoning abilities of LLMs and identify key directions for future improvement.

  The paradigm of Large Language Models (LLMs) has increasingly shifted toward agentic applications, where web browsing capabilities are fundamental for retrieving information from diverse online sources. However, existing open-source web agents either demonstrate limited information-seeking abilities on complex tasks or lack transparent implementations. In this work, we identify that the key challenge lies in the scarcity of challenging data for information seeking. To address this limitation, we introduce WebExplorer: a systematic data generation approach using model-based exploration and iterative, long-to-short query evolution. This method creates challenging query-answer pairs that require multi-step reasoning and complex web navigation. By leveraging our curated high-quality dataset, we successfully develop advanced web agent WebExplorer-8B through supervised fine-tuning followed by reinforcement learning. Our model supports 128K context length and up to 100 tool calling turns, enabling long-horizon problem solving. Across diverse information-seeking benchmarks, WebExplorer-8B achieves the state-of-the-art performance at its scale. Notably, as an 8B-sized model, WebExplorer-8B is able to effectively search over an average of 16 turns after RL training, achieving higher accuracy than WebSailor-72B on BrowseComp-en/zh and attaining the best performance among models up to 100B parameters on WebWalkerQA and FRAMES. Beyond these information-seeking tasks, our model also achieves strong generalization on the HLE benchmark even though it is only trained on knowledge-intensive QA data. These results highlight our approach as a practical path toward long-horizon web agents.

  Enhancing the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to interpret sheet music is a crucial step toward building AI musicians. However, current research lacks both evaluation benchmarks and training data for sheet music reasoning. Inspired by mathematics, where simple operations yield infinite verifiable problems, we introduce a novel approach that treats core music theory rules, such as those governing beats and intervals, as programmatic functions to systematically synthesize a vast and diverse corpus of sheet music reasoning problems. This approach allows us to introduce a data synthesis framework that generates verifiable sheet music questions in both textual and visual modalities, leading to the Synthetic Sheet Music Reasoning Benchmark (SSMR-Bench) and a complementary training set. Evaluation results on SSMR-Bench highlight the key role reasoning plays in interpreting sheet music, while also pointing out the ongoing challenges in understanding sheet music in a visual format. By leveraging synthetic data for RLVR, all models show significant improvements on the SSMR-Bench. Additionally, they also demonstrate considerable advancements on previously established human-crafted benchmarks, such as MusicTheoryBench and the music subset of MMMU. Finally, our results show that the enhanced reasoning ability can also facilitate music composition.

  In August 2025, OpenAI released GPT-OSS models, its first open weight large language models since GPT-2 in 2019, comprising two mixture of experts architectures with 120B and 20B parameters. We evaluated both variants against six contemporary open source large language models ranging from 14.7B to 235B parameters, representing both dense and sparse designs, across ten benchmarks covering general knowledge, mathematical reasoning, code generation, multilingual understanding, and conversational ability. All models were tested in unquantised form under standardised inference settings, with statistical validation using McNemars test and effect size analysis. Results show that gpt-oss-20B consistently outperforms gpt-oss-120B on several benchmarks, such as HumanEval and MMLU, despite requiring substantially less memory and energy per response. Both models demonstrate mid-tier overall performance within the current open source landscape, with relative strength in code generation and notable weaknesses in multilingual tasks. These findings provide empirical evidence that scaling in sparse architectures may not yield proportional performance gains, underscoring the need for further investigation into optimisation strategies and informing more efficient model selection for future open source deployments.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has significantly advanced the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet the reliability of these reasoning chains remains a critical challenge. A widely held "cascading failure" hypothesis suggests that errors are most detrimental when they occur early in the reasoning process. This paper challenges that assumption through systematic error-injection experiments, revealing a counter-intuitive phenomenon we term "Late-Stage Fragility": errors introduced in the later stages of a CoT chain are significantly more likely to corrupt the final answer than identical errors made at the beginning. To address this specific vulnerability, we introduce the Adaptive Self-Correction Chain-of-Thought (ASCoT) method. ASCoT employs a modular pipeline in which an Adaptive Verification Manager (AVM) operates first, followed by the Multi-Perspective Self-Correction Engine (MSCE). The AVM leverages a Positional Impact Score function I(k) that assigns different weights based on the position within the reasoning chains, addressing the Late-Stage Fragility issue by identifying and prioritizing high-risk, late-stage steps. Once these critical steps are identified, the MSCE applies robust, dual-path correction specifically to the failure parts. Extensive experiments on benchmarks such as GSM8K and MATH demonstrate that ASCoT achieves outstanding accuracy, outperforming strong baselines, including standard CoT. Our work underscores the importance of diagnosing specific failure modes in LLM reasoning and advocates for a shift from uniform verification strategies to adaptive, vulnerability-aware correction mechanisms.

  Modern approaches to enhancing Large Language Models' factual accuracy and knowledge utilization face a fundamental trade-off: non-parametric retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) provides flexible access to external knowledge but suffers from high inference latency and shallow integration, while parametric fine-tuning methods like LoRA risk catastrophic forgetting and degraded general capabilities. In this work, we propose MLP Memory, a lightweight parametric module that learns to internalize retrieval patterns without explicit document access. By pretraining an MLP to imitate a $k$NN retriever's behavior on the entire pretraining dataset, we create a differentiable memory component that captures the benefits of retrieval-based knowledge access in a fully parametric form. Our architecture integrates this pretrained MLP Memory with Transformer decoders through simple probability interpolation, achieving 12.3\% relative improvement on five question-answering benchmarks and 5.2 points absolute gain across nine general NLP tasks, while reducing hallucinations by up to 10 points on HaluEval. Moreover, MLP Memory delivers 2.5$\times$ faster inference than RAG with superior accuracy. Our findings show that learning retrieval patterns parametrically bridges the gap between efficient inference and effective knowledge access, offering a practical alternative to both RAG and fine-tuning approaches.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable advancements in tackling agent-oriented tasks. Despite their potential, existing work faces challenges when deploying LLMs in agent-based environments. The widely adopted agent paradigm ReAct centers on integrating single-step reasoning with immediate action execution, which limits its effectiveness in complex tasks requiring long-term strategic planning. Furthermore, the coordination between the planner and executor during problem-solving is also a critical factor to consider in agent design. Additionally, current approaches predominantly rely on supervised fine-tuning, which often leads models to memorize established task completion trajectories, thereby restricting their generalization ability when confronted with novel problem contexts. To address these challenges, we introduce an adaptive global plan-based agent paradigm AdaPlan, aiming to synergize high-level explicit guidance with execution to support effective long-horizon decision-making. Based on the proposed paradigm, we further put forward PilotRL, a global planning-guided training framework for LLM agents driven by progressive reinforcement learning. We first develop the model's ability to follow explicit guidance from global plans when addressing agent tasks. Subsequently, based on this foundation, we focus on optimizing the quality of generated plans. Finally, we conduct joint optimization of the model's planning and execution coordination. Experiments indicate that PilotRL could achieve state-of-the-art performances, with LLaMA3.1-8B-Instruct + PilotRL surpassing closed-sourced GPT-4o by 3.60%, while showing a more substantial gain of 55.78% comparing to GPT-4o-mini at a comparable parameter scale.

  Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has significantly enhanced the reasoning capability of large language models by optimizing the arithmetic mean of token-level rewards. Unfortunately, GRPO is observed to suffer from unstable policy updates when facing tokens with outlier importance-weighted rewards, which manifest as extreme importance sampling ratios during training. In this study, we propose Geometric-Mean Policy Optimization (GMPO), with the aim to improve the stability of GRPO through suppressing token reward outliers. Instead of optimizing the arithmetic mean, GMPO maximizes the geometric mean of token-level rewards, which is inherently less sensitive to outliers and maintains a more stable range of importance sampling ratio. GMPO is plug-and-play-simply replacing GRPO's arithmetic mean with the geometric mean of token-level rewards, as the latter is inherently less sensitive to outliers. GMPO is theoretically plausible-analysis reveals that both GMPO and GRPO are weighted forms of the policy gradient while the former enjoys more stable weights, which consequently benefits policy optimization and performance. Experiments on multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that GMPO-7B improves the average Pass@1 of GRPO by up to 4.1%, outperforming many state-of-the-art approaches.

  Diffusion Large Language Models (DLLMs) have emerged as a compelling alternative to Autoregressive models, designed for fast parallel generation. However, existing DLLMs are plagued by a severe quality-speed trade-off, where faster parallel decoding leads to significant performance degradation. We attribute this to the irreversibility of standard decoding in DLLMs, which is easily polarized into the wrong decoding direction along with early error context accumulation. To resolve this, we introduce Wide-In, Narrow-Out (WINO), a training-free decoding algorithm that enables revokable decoding in DLLMs. WINO employs a parallel draft-and-verify mechanism, aggressively drafting multiple tokens while simultaneously using the model's bidirectional context to verify and re-mask suspicious ones for refinement. Verified in open-source DLLMs like LLaDA and MMaDA, WINO is shown to decisively improve the quality-speed trade-off. For instance, on the GSM8K math benchmark, it accelerates inference by 6$\times$ while improving accuracy by 2.58%; on Flickr30K captioning, it achieves a 10$\times$ speedup with higher performance. More comprehensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the superiority and provide an in-depth understanding of WINO.

  Length generalization, the ability to solve problems of longer sequences than those observed during training, poses a core challenge of Transformer-based large language models (LLM). Although existing studies have predominantly focused on data-driven approaches for arithmetic operations and symbolic manipulation tasks, these approaches tend to be task-specific with limited overall performance. To pursue a more general solution, this paper focuses on a broader case of reasoning problems that are computable, i.e., problems that algorithms can solve, thus can be solved by the Turing Machine. From this perspective, this paper proposes Turing MAchine Imitation Learning (TAIL) to improve the length generalization ability of LLMs. TAIL synthesizes chain-of-thoughts (CoT) data that imitate the execution process of a Turing Machine by computer programs, which linearly expands the reasoning steps into atomic states to alleviate shortcut learning and explicit memory fetch mechanism to reduce the difficulties of dynamic and long-range data access in elementary operations. To validate the reliability and universality of TAIL, we construct a challenging synthetic dataset covering 8 classes of algorithms and 18 tasks. Without bells and whistles, TAIL significantly improves the length generalization ability as well as the performance of Qwen2.5-7B on various tasks using only synthetic data, surpassing previous methods and DeepSeek-R1. The experimental results reveal that the key concepts in the Turing Machine, instead of the thinking styles, are indispensable for TAIL for length generalization, through which the model exhibits read-and-write behaviors consistent with the properties of the Turing Machine in their attention layers. This work provides a promising direction for future research in the learning of LLM reasoning from synthetic data.

  Recently, the development of large language models (LLMs) and reasoning large language models (RLLMs) have gained considerable attention from many researchers. RLLMs enhance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs through Long Chain-of-Thought (Long CoT) processes, significantly improving the performance of LLMs in addressing complex problems. However, there are few works that systematically explore what methods can fully unlock the performance of LLMs and RLLMs within the financial domain. To investigate the impact of various methods on LLMs and RLLMs, we utilize five LLMs and three RLLMs to assess the effects of prompting methods, agentic frameworks, and multilingual alignment methods on financial question-answering tasks. Our research findings indicate: (1) Current prompting methods and agent frameworks enhance the performance of LLMs in financial question answering by simulating Long CoT; (2) RLLMs possess inherent Long CoT capabilities, which limits the effectiveness of conventional methods in further enhancing their performance; (3) Current advanced multilingual alignment methods primarily improve the multilingual performance of LLMs by extending the reasoning length, which yields minimal benefits for RLLMs. Additionally, we discuss strategies for enhancing the performance of LLMs and RLLMs in financial question answering, which may serve as a inspiration for future improvements. We hope that this study can serve as an important reference for LLMs and RLLMs in the field of financial question answering.

  Controllable generation is a fundamental task in NLP with many applications, providing a basis for function calling to agentic communication. However, even state-of-the-art autoregressive Large Language Models (LLMs) today exhibit unreliability when required to generate structured output. Inspired by the current new diffusion-based large language models (dLLM), we realize that the architectural difference, especially the global information-sharing mechanism for language modeling, may be the key to unlock next-level controllable generation. To explore the possibility, we propose Self-adaptive Schema Scaffolding ($S^3$), a novel framework that enables dLLM to stably generate reliable structured outputs (e.g., JSON) by utilizing its innate reverse reasoning capability and global context awareness. $S^3$ initiates a schematic template directly in the output context as a starting state for dLLM, offering a more robust and general method than intricate prompt optimization. Experiments demonstrate that our method substantially unlocks the dLLM's potential in controllable generation in terms of structure adherence, content fidelity, and faithfulness. These results establish new perspectives and practical pathways for deploying language models in controllable generation tasks.

  Recent multi-modal Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4o have demonstrated strong capabilities of direct speech interaction. However, the lack of specialized and comprehensive benchmarks for end-to-end speech LLM evaluation hinders optimizing the user experience of Audio LLMs in real-world applications. Existing evaluation methods often adapt text-based benchmarks, overlooking speech's unique characteristics and challenges, including prosody, homophones, stuttering, and differing user expectations. Here, we introduce the first comprehensive benchmark designed to systematically evaluate end-to-end speechLLMs in practical speech conversations. We systematically curate real-world chat data relevant to spoken scenarios, introduce diversity in speaker attributes and acoustic conditions, and augment the dataset with speech-specific phenomena. We further design a query-aware evaluation method to use customized evaluation checklists and prompts to enhance the accuracy of automatic evaluation. We conduct comprehensive testing and detailed analysis of various mainstream speech models, revealing significant differences in model performance across different speech scenarios. The use of query-aware evaluation further enables a finer-grained assessment under various speech-specific scenarios. Our benchmark can provide valuable insights for speech model development and evaluation.

  Multimodal Knowledge Graphs (MMKGs), which represent explicit knowledge across multiple modalities, play a pivotal role by complementing the implicit knowledge of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) and enabling more grounded reasoning via Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). However, existing MMKGs are generally limited in scope: they are often constructed by augmenting pre-existing knowledge graphs, which restricts their knowledge, resulting in outdated or incomplete knowledge coverage, and they often support only a narrow range of modalities, such as text and visual information. These limitations restrict applicability to multimodal tasks, particularly as recent MLLMs adopt richer modalities like video and audio. Therefore, we propose the Visual-Audio-Text Knowledge Graph (VAT-KG), the first concept-centric and knowledge-intensive multimodal knowledge graph that covers visual, audio, and text information, where each triplet is linked to multimodal data and enriched with detailed descriptions of concepts. Specifically, our construction pipeline ensures cross-modal knowledge alignment between multimodal data and fine-grained semantics through a series of stringent filtering and alignment steps, enabling the automatic generation of MMKGs from any multimodal dataset. We further introduce a novel multimodal RAG framework that retrieves detailed concept-level knowledge in response to queries from arbitrary modalities. Experiments on question answering tasks across various modalities demonstrate the effectiveness of VAT-KG in supporting MLLMs, highlighting its practical value in unifying and leveraging multimodal knowledge.

  Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs)-based text embedding models primarily focus on data scaling or synthesis, yet limited exploration of training techniques and data quality, thereby constraining performance. In this work, we propose KaLM-Embedding-V2, a series of versatile and compact embedding models, systematically incentivizing advanced embedding capability in LLMs by superior training techniques and high-quality data. For model architecture, we implement the models on a 0.5B compact size with simple mean-pooling to produce fixed-length embeddings and remove the causal attention mask to enable fully bidirectional representation learning. For training techniques, we propose a progressive multi-stage training pipeline: pre-training on weakly supervised large-scale datasets, fine-tuning with supervised high-quality datasets, and contrastive distillation with fine-grained soft signals, integrated with focal-style reweighting and online hard-negative mixing to emphasize difficult samples and enrich hard negatives, respectively. For training data, we curate over 20 categories for pre-training and 100 categories for fine-tuning and contrastive distillation, to improve both performance and generalization, leveraging task-specific instructions, hard-negative mining, and example-based multi-class labeling to ensure high quality. Combining these techniques, our KaLM-Embedding-V2 series achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark, outperforming models of comparable size and rivaling models 3-26x larger, setting a new standard for versatile and compact embedding models under 1B parameters. The code, data, and models will be publicly available to facilitate academic research.

  Alignment of large language models (LLMs) with principles like helpfulness, honesty, and harmlessness typically relies on scalar rewards that obscure which objectives drive the training signal. We introduce QA-LIGN, which decomposes monolithic rewards into interpretable principle-specific evaluations through structured natural language programs. Models learn through a draft, critique, and revise pipeline, where symbolic evaluation against the rubrics provides transparent feedback for both initial and revised responses during GRPO training. Applied to uncensored Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, QA-LIGN reduces attack success rates by up to 68.7% while maintaining a 0.67% false refusal rate, achieving Pareto optimal safety-helpfulness performance and outperforming both DPO and GRPO with state-of-the-art reward models given equivalent training. These results demonstrate that making reward signals interpretable and modular improves alignment effectiveness, suggesting transparency enhances LLM safety.

  In this work, we present the first study to explore inference-time scaling on table reasoning tasks. We develop and evaluate two post-training strategies to enable inference-time scaling: distillation from frontier model reasoning traces and reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR). For distillation, we introduce a large-scale dataset of reasoning traces generated by DeepSeek-R1, which we use to fine-tune LLMs into the Table-R1-SFT model. For RLVR, we propose task-specific verifiable reward functions and apply the GRPO algorithm to obtain the Table-R1-Zero model. We evaluate our Table-R1-series models across diverse table reasoning tasks, including short-form QA, fact verification, and free-form QA. Notably, the Table-R1-Zero model matches or exceeds the performance of GPT-4.1 and DeepSeek-R1, while using only a 7B-parameter LLM. It also demonstrates strong generalization to out-of-domain datasets. Extensive ablation and qualitative analyses reveal the benefits of instruction tuning, model architecture choices, and cross-task generalization, as well as emergence of essential table reasoning skills during RL training.

  While Ukrainian NLP has seen progress in many texts processing tasks, emotion classification remains an underexplored area with no publicly available benchmark to date. In this work, we introduce EmoBench-UA, the first annotated dataset for emotion detection in Ukrainian texts. Our annotation schema is adapted from the previous English-centric works on emotion detection (Mohammad et al., 2018; Mohammad, 2022) guidelines. The dataset was created through crowdsourcing using thethis http URLplatform ensuring high-quality of the annotation process. Then, we evaluate a range of approaches on the collected dataset, starting from linguistic-based baselines, synthetic data translated from English, to large language models (LLMs). Our findings highlight the challenges of emotion classification in non-mainstream languages like Ukrainian and emphasize the need for further development of Ukrainian-specific models and training resources.

  Large language models (LLMs) are demonstrably capable of cross-lingual transfer, but can produce inconsistent output when prompted with the same queries written in different languages. To understand how language models are able to generalize knowledge from one language to the others, we measure representation similarity between languages, and apply the logit lens to interpret the implicit steps taken by LLMs to solve multilingual multi-choice reasoning questions. Our analyses reveal LLMs predict inconsistently and are less accurate because they rely on representations that are dissimilar across languages, rather than working in a shared semantic space. While larger models are more multilingual, we show their hidden states are more likely to dissociate from the shared representation compared to smaller models, but are nevertheless more capable of retrieving knowledge embedded across different languages. Finally, we demonstrate that knowledge sharing in small models can be facilitated by steering their latent processing towards the shared semantic space. This improves the models' multilingual reasoning performance, as a result of more knowledge transfer from, and better output consistency with English.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable capabilities across various tasks, yet guiding them to follow desired behaviours during inference remains a significant challenge. Activation steering offers a promising method to control the generation process of LLMs by modifying their internal activations. However, existing methods commonly intervene in the model's behaviour using steering vectors generated by the model itself, which constrains their effectiveness to that specific model and excludes the possibility of leveraging powerful external expert models for steering. To address these limitations, we propose ExpertSteer, a novel approach that leverages arbitrary specialized expert models to generate steering vectors, enabling intervention in any LLMs. ExpertSteer transfers the knowledge from an expert model to a target LLM through a cohesive four-step process: first aligning representation dimensions with auto-encoders to enable cross-model transfer, then identifying intervention layer pairs based on mutual information analysis, next generating steering vectors from the expert model using Recursive Feature Machines, and finally applying these vectors on the identified layers during inference to selectively guide the target LLM without updating model parameters. We conduct comprehensive experiments using three LLMs on 15 popular benchmarks across four distinct domains. Experiments demonstrate that ExpertSteer significantly outperforms established baselines across diverse tasks at minimal cost.

  Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) on a mixture of diverse datasets poses challenges due to data imbalance and heterogeneity. Existing methods often address these issues across datasets (globally) but overlook the imbalance and heterogeneity within individual datasets (locally), which limits their effectiveness. We introduce Hierarchical Balancing Optimization (HBO), a novel method that enables LLMs to autonomously adjust data allocation during fine-tuning both across datasets (globally) and within each individual dataset (locally). HBO employs a bilevel optimization strategy with two types of actors: a Global Actor, which balances data sampling across different subsets of the training mixture, and several Local Actors, which optimizes data usage within each subset based on difficulty levels. These actors are guided by reward functions derived from the LLM's training state, which measure learning progress and relative performance improvement. We evaluate HBO on three LLM backbones across nine diverse tasks in multilingual and multitask setups. Results show that HBO consistently outperforms existing baselines, achieving significant accuracy gains. Our in-depth analysis further demonstrates that both the global actor and local actors of HBO effectively adjust data usage during fine-tuning. HBO provides a comprehensive solution to the challenges of data imbalance and heterogeneity in LLM fine-tuning, enabling more effective training across diverse datasets.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) are susceptible to adversarial attacks such as jailbreaking, which can elicit harmful or unsafe behaviors. This vulnerability is exacerbated in multilingual settings, where multilingual safety-aligned data is often limited. Thus, developing a guardrail capable of detecting and filtering unsafe content across diverse languages is critical for deploying LLMs in real-world applications. In this work, we introduce a multilingual guardrail with reasoning for prompt classification. Our method consists of: (1) synthetic multilingual data generation incorporating culturally and linguistically nuanced variants, (2) supervised fine-tuning, and (3) a curriculum-based Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) framework that further improves performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our multilingual guardrail, MrGuard, consistently outperforms recent baselines across both in-domain and out-of-domain languages by more than 15%. We also evaluate MrGuard's robustness to multilingual variations, such as code-switching and low-resource language distractors in the prompt, and demonstrate that it preserves safety judgments under these challenging conditions. The multilingual reasoning capability of our guardrail enables it to generate explanations, which are particularly useful for understanding language-specific risks and ambiguities in multilingual content moderation.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) not only have solved complex reasoning problems but also exhibit remarkable performance in tasks that require subjective decision making. Existing studies suggest that LLM generations can be subjectively grounded to some extent, yet exploring whether LLMs can account for individual-level subjectivity has not been sufficiently studied. In this paper, we characterize subjectivity of individuals on social media and infer their moral judgments using LLMs. We propose a framework, SOLAR (Subjective Ground with Value Abstraction), that observes value conflicts and trade-offs in the user-generated texts to better represent subjective ground of individuals. Empirical results show that our framework improves overall inference results as well as performance on controversial situations. Additionally, we qualitatively show that SOLAR provides explanations about individuals' value preferences, which can further account for their judgments.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Using language models to scalably approximate human preferences on text quality (LLM-as-a-judge) has become a standard practice applicable to many tasks. A judgment is often extracted from the judge's textual output alone, typically with greedy decoding. However, LLM judges naturally provide distributions over judgment tokens, inviting a breadth of inference methods for extracting fine-grained preferences. We find that taking the mean of the judgment distribution consistently outperforms taking the mode (i.e. greedy decoding) in all evaluation settings (i.e. pointwise, pairwise, and listwise). We further explore novel methods of deriving preferences from judgment distributions, and find that methods incorporating risk aversion often improve performance. Lastly, we analyze LLM-as-a-judge paired with chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting, showing that CoT can collapse the spread of the judgment distribution, often harming performance. Our findings show that leveraging distributional output improves LLM-as-a-judge, as opposed to using the text interface alone.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language model (LLM) agents typically adopt a step-by-step reasoning framework, in which they interleave the processes of thinking and acting to accomplish the given task. However, this paradigm faces a deep-rooted one-pass issue whereby each generated intermediate thought is plugged into the trajectory regardless of its correctness, which can cause irreversible error propagation. To address the issue, this paper proposes a novel framework called Generator-Assistant Stepwise Rollback (GA-Rollback) to induce better decision-making for LLM agents. Particularly, GA-Rollback utilizes a generator to interact with the environment and an assistant to examine each action produced by the generator, where the assistant triggers a rollback operation upon detection of incorrect actions. Moreover, we introduce two additional strategies tailored for the rollback scenario to further improve its effectiveness. Extensive experiments show that GA-Rollback achieves significant improvements over several strong baselines on three widely used benchmarks. Our analysis further reveals that GA-Rollback can function as a robust plug-and-play module, integrating seamlessly with other methods.

  _Yupeng Chang, Chenlu Guo, Yi Chang, Yuan Wu_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), particularly Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), adapts large language models (LLMs) by training only a small fraction of parameters. However, as the rank of the low-rank matrices used for adaptation increases, LoRA often exhibits an unstable "double descent" phenomenon, characterized by transient divergence in the training loss, which delays convergence and impairs generalization by causing instability due to the attraction to sharp local minima. To address this, we introduce LoRA-MGPO, a framework that incorporates Momentum-Guided Perturbation Optimization (MGPO). MGPO stabilizes training dynamics by mitigating the double descent phenomenon and guiding weight perturbations using momentum vectors from the optimizer's state, thus avoiding dual gradient computations. Additionally, an adaptive normalization scheme scales the magnitude of perturbations based on an exponential moving average (EMA) of gradient norms, further enhancing stability. While EMA controls the magnitude of the perturbations, MGPO guides their direction, ensuring a more stable optimization trajectory. Experiments on a suite of natural language understanding and generation benchmarks show that LoRA-MGPO consistently achieves superior performance over LoRA and other PEFT methods. The analysis indicates that LoRA-MGPO leads to smoother loss curves, faster convergence, and improved generalization by stabilizing the training process and mitigating the attraction to sharp minima.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We know from prior work that LLMs encode social biases, and that this manifests in clinical tasks. In this work we adopt tools from mechanistic interpretability to unveil sociodemographic representations and biases within LLMs in the context of healthcare. Specifically, we ask: Can we identify activations within LLMs that encode sociodemographic information (e.g., gender, race)? We find that gender information is highly localized in MLP layers and can be reliably manipulated at inference time via patching. Such interventions can surgically alter generated clinical vignettes for specific conditions, and also influence downstream clinical predictions which correlate with gender, e.g., patient risk of depression. We find that representation of patient race is somewhat more distributed, but can also be intervened upon, to a degree. To our knowledge, this is the first application of mechanistic interpretability methods to LLMs for healthcare.

  Large language models (LLMs) are designed to perform a wide range of tasks. To improve their ability to solve complex problems requiring multi-step reasoning, recent research leverages process reward modeling to provide fine-grained feedback at each step of the reasoning process for reinforcement learning (RL), but it predominantly focuses on English. In this paper, we tackle the critical challenge of extending process reward models (PRMs) to multilingual settings. To achieve this, we train multilingual PRMs on a dataset spanning seven languages, which is translated from English. Through comprehensive evaluations on two widely used reasoning benchmarks across 11 languages, we demonstrate that multilingual PRMs not only improve average accuracy but also reduce early-stage reasoning errors. Furthermore, our results highlight the sensitivity of multilingual PRMs to both the number of training languages and the volume of English data, while also uncovering the benefits arising from more candidate responses and trainable parameters. This work opens promising avenues for robust multilingual applications in complex, multi-step reasoning tasks. In addition, we release the code to foster research along this line.

  Free-text responses are commonly collected in psychological studies, providing rich qualitative insights that quantitative measures may not capture. Labeling curated topics of research interest in free-text data by multiple trained human coders is typically labor-intensive and time-consuming. Though large language models (LLMs) excel in language processing, LLM-assisted labeling techniques relying on closed-source LLMs cannot be directly applied to free-text data, without explicit consent for external use.In this study, we propose a framework of assembling locally-deployable LLMs to enhance the labeling of predetermined topics in free-text data under privacy constraints. Analogous to annotation by multiple human raters, this framework leverages the heterogeneity of diverse open-source LLMs. The ensemble approach seeks a balance between the agreement and disagreement across LLMs, guided by a relevancy scoring methodology that utilizes embedding distances between topic descriptions and LLMs' reasoning. We evaluated the ensemble approach using both publicly accessible Reddit data from eating disorder related forums, and free-text responses from eating disorder patients, both complemented by human annotations.We found that: (1) there is heterogeneity in the performance of labeling among same-sized LLMs, with some showing low sensitivity but high precision, while others exhibit high sensitivity but low precision. (2) Compared to individual LLMs, the ensemble of LLMs achieved the highest accuracy and optimal precision-sensitivity trade-off in predicting human annotations. (3) The relevancy scores across LLMs showed greater agreement than dichotomous labels, indicating that the relevancy scoring method effectively mitigates the heterogeneity in LLMs' labeling.

  Despite the outstanding capabilities of large language models (LLMs), knowledge-intensive reasoning still remains a challenging task due to LLMs' limitations in compositional reasoning and the hallucination problem. A prevalent solution is to employ chain-of-thought (CoT) with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), which first formulates a reasoning plan by decomposing complex questions into simpler sub-questions, and then applies iterative RAG at each sub-question. However, prior works exhibit two crucial problems: inadequate reasoning planning and poor incorporation of heterogeneous knowledge. In this paper, we introduce AtomR, a framework for LLMs to conduct accurate heterogeneous knowledge reasoning at the atomic level. Inspired by how knowledge graph query languages model compositional reasoning through combining predefined operations, we propose three atomic knowledge operators, a unified set of operators for LLMs to retrieve and manipulate knowledge from heterogeneous sources. First, in the reasoning planning stage, AtomR decomposes a complex question into a reasoning tree where each leaf node corresponds to an atomic knowledge operator, achieving question decomposition that is highly fine-grained and orthogonal. Subsequently, in the reasoning execution stage, AtomR executes each atomic knowledge operator, which flexibly selects, retrieves, and operates atomic level knowledge from heterogeneous sources. We also introduce BlendQA, a challenging benchmark specially tailored for heterogeneous knowledge reasoning. Experiments on three single-source and two multi-source datasets show that AtomR outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by a large margin, with F1 score improvements of 9.4% on 2WikiMultihop and 9.5% on BlendQA. We release our code and datasets.

  Topic modeling is a key method in text analysis, but existing approaches fail to efficiently scale to large datasets or are limited by assuming one topic per document. Overcoming these limitations, we introduce Semantic Component Analysis (SCA), a topic modeling technique that discovers multiple topics per sample by introducing a decomposition step to the clustering-based topic modeling framework. We evaluate SCA on Twitter datasets in English, Hausa and Chinese. There, it achieves competitive coherence and diversity compared to BERTopic, while uncovering at least double the topics and maintaining a noise rate close to zero. We also find that SCA outperforms the LLM-based TopicGPT in scenarios with similar compute budgets. SCA thus provides an effective and efficient approach for topic modeling of large datasets.

  Vertical text input is commonly encountered in various real-world applications, such as mathematical computations and word-based Sudoku puzzles. While current large language models (LLMs) have excelled in natural language tasks, they remain vulnerable to variations in text formatting. Recent research demonstrates that modifying input formats, such as vertically aligning words for encoder-based models, can substantially lower accuracy in text classification tasks. While easily understood by humans, these inputs can significantly mislead models, posing a potential risk of bypassing detection in real-world scenarios involving harmful or sensitive information. With the expanding application of LLMs, a crucial question arises: Do decoder-based LLMs exhibit similar vulnerabilities to vertically formatted text input? In this paper, we investigate the impact of vertical text input on the performance of various LLMs across multiple text classification datasets and analyze the underlying causes. Our findings are as follows: (i) Vertical text input significantly degrades the accuracy of LLMs in text classification tasks. (ii) Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning does not help LLMs recognize vertical input or mitigate its vulnerability, but few-shot learning with careful analysis does. (iii) We explore the underlying cause of the vulnerability by analyzing the inherent issues in tokenization and attention matrices.

  Using special tokens (e.g., gist, memory, or compressed tokens) to compress context information is a common practice for large language models (LLMs). However, existing approaches often neglect that position encodings inherently induce local inductive biases in models, causing the compression process to ignore holistic contextual dependencies. We propose \textbf{Enhanced Position Layout (EPL)}, a simple yet effective method that improves the context compression capability of LLMs by only adjusting position IDs, the numerical identifiers that specify token positions. EPL minimizes the distance between context tokens and their corresponding special tokens and at the same time maintains the sequence order in position IDs between context tokens, special tokens, and the subsequent tokens. Integrating EPL into our best performing context compression model results in a 1.9 ROUGE-1 F1 improvement on out-of-domain question answering datasets on average. When extended to multimodal scenarios, EPL leads to an average accuracy gain of 2.6 points for vision compression LLMs.

  Specialized entity linking (EL) models are well-trained at mapping mentions to unique knowledge base (KB) entities according to a given context. However, specialized EL models struggle to disambiguate long-tail entities due to their limited training data. Meanwhile, extensively pre-trained large language models (LLMs) possess broader knowledge of uncommon entities. Yet, with a lack of specialized EL training, LLMs frequently fail to generate accurate KB entity names, limiting their standalone effectiveness in EL. With the observation that LLMs are more adept at context generation instead of EL execution, we introduce LLM-Augmented Entity Linking (LLMAEL), the first framework to enhance specialized EL models with LLM data augmentation. LLMAEL leverages off-the-shelf, tuning-free LLMs as context augmenters, generating entity descriptions to serve as additional input for specialized EL models. Experiments show that LLMAEL sets new state-of-the-art results across 6 widely adopted EL benchmarks: compared to prior methods that integrate tuning-free LLMs into EL, LLMAEL achieves an absolute 8.9% gain in EL accuracy. We release our code and datasets.

  Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized the field of natural language processing (NLP), and recent studies have aimed to understand their underlying mechanisms. However, most of this research is conducted within a monolingual setting, primarily focusing on English. Few studies have attempted to explore the internal workings of LLMs in multilingual settings. In this study, we aim to fill this research gap by examining how neuron activation is shared across tasks and languages. We classify neurons into four distinct categories based on their responses to a specific input across different languages: all-shared, partial-shared, specific, and non-activated. Building upon this categorisation, we conduct extensive experiments on three tasks across nine languages using several LLMs and present an in-depth analysis in this work. Our findings reveal that: (i) deactivating the all-shared neurons significantly decreases performance; (ii) the shared neurons play a vital role in generating responses, especially for the all-shared neurons; (iii) neuron activation patterns are highly sensitive and vary across tasks, LLMs, and languages. These findings shed light on the internal workings of multilingual LLMs and pave the way for future research. We release the code to foster research in this area.

  Constituency parsing is a fundamental yet unsolved challenge in natural language processing. In this paper, we examine the potential of recent large language models (LLMs) to address this challenge. We reformat constituency parsing as a sequence-to-sequence generation problem and evaluate the performance of a diverse range of LLMs under zero-shot, few-shot, and supervised fine-tuning learning paradigms. We observe that while LLMs achieve acceptable improvements, they still encounter substantial limitations, due to the absence of mechanisms to guarantee the validity and faithfulness of the generated constituent trees. Motivated by this observation, we propose two strategies to guide LLMs to generate more accurate constituent trees by learning from erroneous samples and refining outputs in a multi-agent collaboration way, respectively. The experimental results demonstrate that our methods effectively reduce the occurrence of invalid and unfaithful trees, thereby enhancing overall parsing performance and achieving promising results across different learning paradigms.

  Effective real-world multi-agent collaboration requires not only accurate planning but also the ability to reason about collaborators' intents -- a crucial capability for avoiding miscoordination and redundant communication under partial observable environments. Due to their strong planning and reasoning capabilities, large language models (LLMs) have emerged as promising autonomous agents for collaborative task solving. However, existing collaboration frameworks for LLMs overlook their reasoning potential for dynamic intent inference, and thus produce inconsistent plans and redundant communication, reducing collaboration efficiency. To bridge this gap, we propose CoBel-World, a novel framework that equips LLM agents with a collaborative belief world -- an internal representation jointly modeling the physical environment and collaborators' mental states. CoBel-World enables agents to parse open-world task knowledge into structured beliefs via a symbolic belief language, and perform zero-shot Bayesian-style belief updates through LLM reasoning. This allows agents to proactively detect potential miscoordination (e.g., conflicting plans) and communicate adaptively. Evaluated on challenging embodied benchmarks (i.e., TDW-MAT and C-WAH), CoBel-World significantly reduces communication costs by 22-60% and improves task completion efficiency by 4-28% compared to the strongest baseline. Our results show that explicit, intent-aware belief modeling is essential for efficient and human-like collaboration in LLM-based multi-agent systems.

  Language is a powerful communicative and cognitive tool. It enables humans to express thoughts, share intentions, and reason about complex phenomena. Despite our fluency in using and understanding language, the question of how it arises and evolves over time remains unsolved. A leading hypothesis in linguistics and anthropology posits that language evolved to meet the ecological and social demands of early human cooperation. Language did not arise in isolation, but through shared survival goals. Inspired by this view, we investigate the emergence of language in multi-agent Foraging Games. These environments are designed to reflect the cognitive and ecological constraints believed to have influenced the evolution of communication. Agents operate in a shared grid world with only partial knowledge about other agents and the environment, and must coordinate to complete games like picking up high-value targets or executing temporally ordered actions. Using end-to-end deep reinforcement learning, agents learn both actions and communication strategies from scratch. We find that agents develop communication protocols with hallmark features of natural language: arbitrariness, interchangeability, displacement, cultural transmission, and compositionality. We quantify each property and analyze how different factors, such as population size, social dynamics, and temporal dependencies, shape specific aspects of the emergent language. Our framework serves as a platform for studying how language can evolve from partial observability, temporal reasoning, and cooperative goals in embodied multi-agent settings. We will release all data, code, and models publicly.

  Understanding how Large Language Models (LLMs) perform complex reasoning and their failure mechanisms is a challenge in interpretability research. To provide a measurable geometric analysis perspective, we define the concept of the Reasoning Manifold, a latent low-dimensional geometric structure formed by the internal representations corresponding to all correctly reasoned generations. This structure can be conceptualized as the embodiment of the effective thinking paths that the model has learned to successfully solve a given task. Based on this concept, we build REMA, a framework that explains the origins of failures by quantitatively comparing the spatial relationships of internal model representations corresponding to both erroneous and correct reasoning samples. Specifically, REMA first quantifies the geometric deviation of each erroneous representation by calculating its k-nearest neighbors distance to the approximated manifold formed by correct representations, thereby providing a unified failure signal. It then localizes the divergence points where these deviations first become significant by tracking this deviation metric across the model's layers and comparing it against a baseline of internal fluctuations from correct representations, thus identifying where the reasoning chain begins to go off-track. Our extensive experiments on diverse language and multimodal models and tasks demonstrate the low-dimensional nature of the reasoning manifold and the high separability between erroneous and correct reasoning representations. The results also validate the effectiveness of the REMA framework in analyzing the origins of reasoning failures. This research connects abstract reasoning failures to measurable geometric deviations in representations, providing new avenues for in-depth understanding and diagnosis of the internal computational processes of black-box models.

  This paper introduces TrueGradeAI, an AI-driven digital examination framework designed to overcome the shortcomings of traditional paper-based assessments, including excessive paper usage, logistical complexity, grading delays, and evaluator bias. The system preserves natural handwriting by capturing stylus input on secure tablets and applying transformer-based optical character recognition for transcription. Evaluation is conducted through a retrieval-augmented pipeline that integrates faculty solutions, cache layers, and external references, enabling a large language model to assign scores with explicit, evidence-linked reasoning. Unlike prior tablet-based exam systems that primarily digitize responses, TrueGradeAI advances the field by incorporating explainable automation, bias mitigation, and auditable grading trails. By uniting handwriting preservation with scalable and transparent evaluation, the framework reduces environmental costs, accelerates feedback cycles, and progressively builds a reusable knowledge base, while actively working to mitigate grading bias and ensure fairness in assessment.

  As LLMs are increasingly deployed as agents, agentic reasoning - the ability to combine tool use, especially search, and reasoning - becomes a critical skill. However, it is hard to disentangle agentic reasoning when evaluated in complex environments and tasks. Current agent benchmarks often mix agentic reasoning with challenging math reasoning, expert-level knowledge, and other advanced capabilities. To fill this gap, we build a novel benchmark, GSM-Agent, where an LLM agent is required to solve grade-school-level reasoning problems, but is only presented with the question in the prompt without the premises that contain the necessary information to solve the task, and needs to proactively collect that information using tools. Although the original tasks are grade-school math problems, we observe that even frontier models like GPT-5 only achieve 67% accuracy. To understand and analyze the agentic reasoning patterns, we propose the concept of agentic reasoning graph: cluster the environment's document embeddings into nodes, and map each tool call to its nearest node to build a reasoning path. Surprisingly, we identify that the ability to revisit a previously visited node, widely taken as a crucial pattern in static reasoning, is often missing for agentic reasoning for many models. Based on the insight, we propose a tool-augmented test-time scaling method to improve LLM's agentic reasoning performance by adding tools to encourage models to revisit. We expect our benchmark and the agentic reasoning framework to aid future studies of understanding and pushing the boundaries of agentic reasoning.

  Test-Time Scaling (TTS) enhances the reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs) by allocating additional computation during inference. However, existing approaches primarily rely on output-level sampling while overlooking the role of model architecture. In mainstream Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) LLMs, we observe that varying the number of activated experts yields complementary solution sets with stable accuracy, revealing a new and underexplored source of diversity. Motivated by this observation, we propose Dynamic Experts Search (DES), a TTS strategy that elevates expert activation into a controllable dimension of the search space. DES integrates two key components: (1) Dynamic MoE, which enables direct control of expert counts during inference to generate diverse reasoning trajectories without additional cost; and (2) Expert Configuration Inheritance, which preserves consistent expert counts within a reasoning path while varying them across runs, thereby balancing stability and diversity throughout the search. Extensive experiments across MoE architectures, verifiers and reasoning benchmarks (i.e., math, code and knowledge) demonstrate that DES reliably outperforms TTS baselines, enhancing accuracy and stability without additional cost. These results highlight DES as a practical and scalable form of architecture-aware TTS, illustrating how structural flexibility in modern LLMs can advance reasoning.

  White box monitors that analyze model internals offer promising advantages for detecting potentially harmful behaviors in large language models, including lower computational costs and integration into layered defensethis http URL, training and evaluating these monitors requires response exemplars that exhibit the target behaviors, typically elicited through prompting or fine-tuning. This presents a challenge when the information used to elicit behaviors inevitably leaks into the data that monitors ingest, inflating their effectiveness. We present a systematic framework for evaluating a monitor's performance in terms of its ability to detect genuine model behavior rather than superficial elicitation artifacts. Furthermore, we propose three novel strategies to evaluate the monitor: content filtering (removing deception-related text from inputs), score filtering (aggregating only over task-relevant tokens), and prompt distilled fine-tuned model organisms (models trained to exhibit deceptive behavior without explicit prompting). Using deception detection as a representative case study, we identify two forms of leakage that inflate monitor performance: elicitation leakage from prompts that explicitly request harmful behavior, and reasoning leakage from models that verbalize their deceptive actions. Through experiments on multiple deception benchmarks, we apply our proposed mitigation strategies and measure performance retention. Our evaluation of the monitors reveal three crucial findings: (1) Content filtering is a good mitigation strategy that allows for a smooth removal of elicitation signal and can decrease probe AUROC by 30\% (2) Score filtering was found to reduce AUROC by 15\% but is not as straightforward to attribute to (3) A finetuned model organism improves monitor evaluations but reduces their performance by upto 40\%, even when re-trained.

  The scaling of Large Language Models (LLMs) has exposed a critical gap between their performance on static benchmarks and their fragility in dynamic, information-rich environments. While models excel at isolated tasks, the computational limits that govern their reasoning under cognitive load remain poorly understood. In this work, we introduce a formal theory of computational cognitive load, positing that extraneous, task-irrelevant information (Context Saturation) and interference from task-switching (Attentional Residue) are key mechanisms that degrade performance. We designed the Interleaved Cognitive Evaluation (ICE), a deconfounded benchmark to systematically manipulate these load factors on challenging multi-hop reasoning tasks. A comprehensive study (N = 10 replications per item across 200 questions) revealed significant performance variations across five instruction-tuned models. Smaller open-source architectures (Llama-3-8B-Instruct, Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2) exhibited baseline brittleness, achieving 0% accuracy (SEM = 0.0) across all conditions, including clean controls, on this high-intrinsic-load task. In contrast, Gemini-2.0-Flash-001 showed partial resilience, achieving 85% accuracy in control conditions, with a statistically significant degradation under context saturation ($\beta = -0.003$ per % load, $p < 0.001$). These findings provide preliminary evidence that cognitive load is a key contributor to reasoning failures, supporting theories of hallucination-as-guessing under uncertainty. We conclude that dynamic, cognitive-aware stress testing, as exemplified by the ICE benchmark, is essential for evaluating the true resilience and safety of advanced AI systems.

  Inspired by the dual-process theory of human cognition from \textit{Thinking, Fast and Slow}, we introduce \textbf{PRIME} (Planning and Retrieval-Integrated Memory for Enhanced Reasoning), a multi-agent reasoning framework that dynamically integrates \textbf{System 1} (fast, intuitive thinking) and \textbf{System 2} (slow, deliberate thinking). PRIME first employs a Quick Thinking Agent (System 1) to generate a rapid answer; if uncertainty is detected, it then triggers a structured System 2 reasoning pipeline composed of specialized agents for \textit{planning}, \textit{hypothesis generation}, \textit{retrieval}, \textit{information integration}, and \textit{decision-making}. This multi-agent design faithfully mimics human cognitive processes and enhances both efficiency and accuracy. Experimental results with LLaMA 3 models demonstrate that PRIME enables open-source LLMs to perform competitively with state-of-the-art closed-source models like GPT-4 and GPT-4o on benchmarks requiring multi-hop and knowledge-grounded reasoning. This research establishes PRIME as a scalable solution for improving LLMs in domains requiring complex, knowledge-intensive reasoning.

  Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable potential in various domains, yet their application in the medical field is hindered by several challenges. General-purpose MLLMs often lack the specialized knowledge required for medical tasks, leading to uncertain or hallucinatory responses. Knowledge distillation from advanced models struggles to capture domain-specific expertise in radiology and pharmacology. Additionally, the computational cost of continual pretraining with large-scale medical data poses significant efficiency challenges. To address these issues, we propose InfiMed-Foundation-1.7B and InfiMed-Foundation-4B, two medical-specific MLLMs designed to deliver state-of-the-art performance in medical applications. We combined high-quality general-purpose and medical multimodal data and proposed a novel five-dimensional quality assessment framework to curate high-quality multimodal medical datasets. We employ low-to-high image resolution and multimodal sequence packing to enhance training efficiency, enabling the integration of extensive medical data. Furthermore, a three-stage supervised fine-tuning process ensures effective knowledge extraction for complex medical tasks. Evaluated on the MedEvalKit framework, InfiMed-Foundation-1.7B outperforms Qwen2.5VL-3B, while InfiMed-Foundation-4B surpasses HuatuoGPT-V-7B and MedGemma-27B-IT, demonstrating superior performance in medical visual question answering and diagnostic tasks. By addressing key challenges in data quality, training efficiency, and domain-specific knowledge extraction, our work paves the way for more reliable and effective AI-driven solutions in healthcare.

  The growing demand for large language models (LLMs) with tunable reasoning capabilities in many real-world applications highlights a critical need for methods that can efficiently produce a spectrum of models balancing reasoning depth and computational cost. Model merging has emerged as a promising, training-free technique to address this challenge by arithmetically combining the weights of a general-purpose model with a specialized reasoning model. While various merging techniques exist, their potential to create a spectrum of models with fine-grained control over reasoning abilities remains largely unexplored. This work presents a large-scale empirical study evaluating a range of model merging techniques across multiple reasoning benchmarks. We systematically vary merging strengths to construct accuracy-efficiency curves, providing the first comprehensive view of the tunable performance landscape. Our findings reveal that model merging offers an effective and controllable method for calibrating the trade-off between reasoning accuracy and token efficiency, even when parent models have highly divergent weight spaces. Crucially, we identify instances of Pareto Improvement, where a merged model achieves both higher accuracy and lower token consumption than one of its parents. Our study provides the first comprehensive analysis of this tunable space, offering practical guidelines for creating LLMs with specific reasoning profiles to meet diverse application demands.

  Autonomous agents have recently achieved remarkable progress across diverse domains, yet most evaluations focus on short-horizon, fully observable tasks. In contrast, many critical real-world tasks, such as large-scale software development, commercial investment, and scientific discovery, unfold in long-horizon and partially observable scenarios where success hinges on sustained reasoning, planning, memory management, and tool use. Existing benchmarks rarely capture these long-horizon challenges, leaving a gap in systematic evaluation. To bridge this gap, we introduce \textbf{UltraHorizon} a novel benchmark that measures the foundational capabilities essential for complex real-world challenges. We use exploration as a unifying task across three distinct environments to validate these core competencies. Agents are designed in long-horizon discovery tasks where they must iteratively uncover hidden rules through sustained reasoning, planning, memory and tools management, and interaction with environments. Under the heaviest scale setting, trajectories average \textbf{200k+} tokens and \textbf{400+} tool calls, whereas in standard configurations they still exceed \textbf{35k} tokens and involve more than \textbf{60} tool calls on average. Our extensive experiments reveal that LLM-agents consistently underperform in these settings, whereas human participants achieve higher scores, underscoring a persistent gap in agents' long-horizon abilities. We also observe that simple scaling fails in our task. To better illustrate the failure of agents, we conduct an in-depth analysis of collected trajectories. We identify eight types of errors and attribute them to two primary causes: in-context locking and functional fundamental capability gaps. \href{this https URL}{Our code will be available here.}

  The adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) as automated evaluators (LLM-as-a-judge) has revealed critical inconsistencies in current evaluation frameworks. We identify two fundamental types of inconsistencies: (1) Score-Comparison Inconsistency, where lower-rated responses outperform higher-scored ones in pairwise comparisons, and (2) Pairwise Transitivity Inconsistency, manifested through circular preference chains (A>B>C>A) and equivalence contradictions (A=B=C\neq A). We argue that these issues come from information loss in discrete rating systems and ambiguous tie judgments during pairwise evaluation. We propose TrustJudge, a probabilistic framework that addresses these limitations through two key innovations: 1) distribution-sensitive scoring that computes continuous expectations from discrete rating probabilities, preserving information entropy for more precise scoring, and 2) likelihood-aware aggregation that resolves transitivity violations using bidirectional preference probabilities or perplexity. We also formalize the theoretical limitations of current LLM-as-a-judge frameworks and demonstrate how TrustJudge's components overcome them. When evaluated with Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct as judge using our dataset, TrustJudge reduces Score-Comparison inconsistency by 8.43% (from 23.32% to 14.89%) and Pairwise Transitivity inconsistency by 10.82% (from 15.22% to 4.40%), while maintaining higher evaluation accuracy. Our work provides the first systematic analysis of evaluation framework inconsistencies in LLM-as-a-judge paradigms, offering both theoretical insights and practical solutions for reliable automated assessment. The framework demonstrates consistent improvements across various model architectures and scales, enabling more trustworthy LLM evaluation without requiring additional training or human annotations.

  Current LLMs for creating fully-structured reports face the challenges of formatting errors, content hallucinations, and privacy leakage issues when uploading data to externalthis http URLaim to develop an open-source, accurate LLM for creating fully-structured and standardized LCS reports from varying free-text reports across institutions and demonstrate its utility in automatic statistical analysis and individual lung nodule retrieval. With IRB approvals, our retrospective study included 5,442 de-identified LDCT LCS radiology reports from two institutions. We constructed two evaluation datasets by labeling 500 pairs of free-text and fully-structured radiology reports and one large-scale consecutive dataset from January 2021 to December 2023. Two radiologists created a standardized template for recording 27 lung nodule features on LCS. We designed a dynamic-template-constrained decoding method to enhance existing LLMs for creating fully-structured reports from free-text radiology reports. Using consecutive structured reports, we automated descriptive statistical analyses and a nodule retrieval prototype. Our best LLM for creating fully-structured reports achieved high performance on cross-institutional datasets with an F1 score of about 97%, with neither formatting errors nor content hallucinations. Our method consistently improved the best open-source LLMs by up to 10.42%, and outperformed GPT-4o by 17.19%. The automatically derived statistical distributions were consistent with prior findings regarding attenuation, location, size, stability, and Lung-RADS. The retrieval system with structured reports allowed flexible nodule-level search and complex statistical analysis. Our developed software is publicly available for local deployment and further research.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promising capabilities for solving Operations Research (OR) problems. While reinforcement learning serves as a powerful paradigm for LLM training on OR problems, existing works generally face two key limitations. First, outcome reward suffers from the credit assignment problem, where correct final answers can reinforce flawed reasoning. Second, conventional discriminative process supervision is myopic, failing to evaluate the interdependent steps of OR modeling holistically. To this end, we introduce StepORLM, a novel self-evolving framework with generative process supervision. At its core, StepORLM features a co-evolutionary loop where a policy model and a generative process reward model (GenPRM) iteratively improve on each other. This loop is driven by a dual-feedback mechanism: definitive, outcome-based verification from an external solver, and nuanced, holistic process evaluation from the GenPRM. The combined signal is used to align the policy via Weighted Direct Preference Optimization (W-DPO) and simultaneously refine the GenPRM. Our resulting 8B-parameter StepORLM establishes a new state-of-the-art across six benchmarks, significantly outperforming vastly larger generalist models, agentic methods, and specialized baselines. Moreover, the co-evolved GenPRM is able to act as a powerful and universally applicable process verifier, substantially boosting the inference scaling performance of both our own model and other existing LLMs.

  Leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for social simulation is a frontier in computational social science. Understanding the social logics these agents embody is critical to this attempt. However, existing research has primarily focused on cooperation in small-scale, task-oriented games, overlooking how altruism, which means sacrificing self-interest for collective benefit, emerges in large-scale agent societies. To address this gap, we introduce a Schelling-variant urban migration model that creates a social dilemma, compelling over 200 LLM agents to navigate an explicit conflict between egoistic (personal utility) and altruistic (system utility) goals. Our central finding is a fundamental difference in the social tendencies of LLMs. We identify two distinct archetypes: "Adaptive Egoists", which default to prioritizing self-interest but whose altruistic behaviors significantly increase under the influence of a social norm-setting message board; and "Altruistic Optimizers", which exhibit an inherent altruistic logic, consistently prioritizing collective benefit even at a direct cost to themselves. Furthermore, to qualitatively analyze the cognitive underpinnings of these decisions, we introduce a method inspired by Grounded Theory to systematically code agent reasoning. In summary, this research provides the first evidence of intrinsic heterogeneity in the egoistic and altruistic tendencies of different LLMs. We propose that for social simulation, model selection is not merely a matter of choosing reasoning capability, but of choosing an intrinsic social action logic. While "Adaptive Egoists" may offer a more suitable choice for simulating complex human societies, "Altruistic Optimizers" are better suited for modeling idealized pro-social actors or scenarios where collective welfare is the primary consideration.

  Geometric Problem Solving (GPS) poses a unique challenge for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), requiring not only the joint interpretation of text and diagrams but also iterative visuospatial reasoning. While existing approaches process diagrams as static images, they lack the capacity for dynamic manipulation - a core aspect of human geometric reasoning involving auxiliary line construction and affine transformations. We present GeoSketch, a neural-symbolic framework that recasts geometric reasoning as an interactive perception-reasoning-action loop. GeoSketch integrates: (1) a Perception module that abstracts diagrams into structured logic forms, (2) a Symbolic Reasoning module that applies geometric theorems to decide the next deductive step, and (3) a Sketch Action module that executes operations such as drawing auxiliary lines or applying transformations, thereby updating the diagram in a closed loop. To train this agent, we develop a two-stage pipeline: supervised fine-tuning on 2,000 symbolic-curated trajectories followed by reinforcement learning with dense, symbolic rewards to enhance robustness and strategic exploration. To evaluate this paradigm, we introduce the GeoSketch Benchmark, a high-quality set of 390 geometry problems requiring auxiliary construction or affine transformations. Experiments on strong MLLM baselines demonstrate that GeoSketch significantly improves stepwise reasoning accuracy and problem-solving success over static perception methods. By unifying hierarchical decision-making, executable visual actions, and symbolic verification, GeoSketch advances multimodal reasoning from static interpretation to dynamic, verifiable interaction, establishing a new foundation for solving complex visuospatial problems.

  Recent work by Chatzi et al. and Ravfogel et al. has developed, for the first time, a method for generating counterfactuals of probabilistic Large Language Models. Such counterfactuals tell us what would - or might - have been the output of an LLM if some factual prompt ${\bf x}$ had been ${\bf x}^*$ instead. The ability to generate such counterfactuals is an important necessary step towards explaining, evaluating, and comparing, the behavior of LLMs. I argue, however, that the existing method rests on an ambiguous interpretation of LLMs: it does not interpret LLMs literally, for the method involves the assumption that one can change the implementation of an LLM's sampling process without changing the LLM itself, nor does it interpret LLMs as intended, for the method involves explicitly representing a nondeterministic LLM as a deterministic causal model. I here present a much simpler method for generating counterfactuals that is based on an LLM's intended interpretation by representing it as a nondeterministic causal model instead. The advantage of my simpler method is that it is directly applicable to any black-box LLM without modification, as it is agnostic to any implementation details. The advantage of the existing method, on the other hand, is that it directly implements the generation of a specific type of counterfactuals that is useful for certain purposes, but not for others. I clarify how both methods relate by offering a theoretical foundation for reasoning about counterfactuals in LLMs based on their intended semantics, thereby laying the groundwork for novel application-specific methods for generating counterfactuals.

  This paper presents an evaluation framework for assessing Large Language Models' (LLMs) capabilities in combinatorial optimization, specifically addressing the 2D bin-packing problem. We introduce a systematic methodology that combines LLMs with evolutionary algorithms to generate and refine heuristic solutions iteratively. Through comprehensive experiments comparing LLM generated heuristics against traditional approaches (Finite First-Fit and Hybrid First-Fit), we demonstrate that LLMs can produce more efficient solutions while requiring fewer computational resources. Our evaluation reveals that GPT-4o achieves optimal solutions within two iterations, reducing average bin usage from 16 to 15 bins while improving space utilization from 0.76-0.78 to 0.83. This work contributes to understanding LLM evaluation in specialized domains and establishes benchmarks for assessing LLM performance in combinatorial optimization tasks.

  Travel planning (TP) agent has recently worked as an emerging building block to interact with external tools and resources for travel itinerary generation, ensuring enjoyable user experience. Despite its benefits, existing studies rely on hand craft prompt and fixed agent workflow, hindering more flexible and autonomous TP agent. This paper proposes DeepTravel, an end to end agentic reinforcement learning framework for building autonomous travel planning agent, capable of autonomously planning, executing tools, and reflecting on tool responses to explore, verify, and refine intermediate actions in multi step reasoning. To achieve this, we first construct a robust sandbox environment by caching transportation, accommodation and POI data, facilitating TP agent training without being constrained by real world APIs limitations (e.g., inconsistent outputs). Moreover, we develop a hierarchical reward modeling system, where a trajectory level verifier first checks spatiotemporal feasibility and filters unsatisfied travel itinerary, and then the turn level verifier further validate itinerary detail consistency with tool responses, enabling efficient and precise reward service. Finally, we propose the reply augmented reinforcement learning method that enables TP agent to periodically replay from a failures experience buffer, emerging notable agentic capacity. We deploy trained TP agent on DiDi Enterprise Solutions App and conduct comprehensive online and offline evaluations, demonstrating that DeepTravel enables small size LLMs (e.g., Qwen3 32B) to significantly outperform existing frontier LLMs such as OpenAI o1, o3 and DeepSeek R1 in travel planning tasks.

  Data science, which transforms raw data into actionable insights, is critical for data-driven decision-making. However, these tasks are often complex, involving steps for exploring multiple data sources and synthesizing findings to deliver insightful answers. While large language models (LLMs) show significant promise in automating this process, they often struggle with heterogeneous data formats and generate sub-optimal analysis plans, as verifying plan sufficiency is inherently difficult without ground-truth labels for such open-ended tasks. To overcome these limitations, we introduce DS-STAR, a novel data science agent. Specifically, DS-STAR makes three key contributions: (1) a data file analysis module that automatically explores and extracts context from diverse data formats, including unstructured types; (2) a verification step where an LLM-based judge evaluates the sufficiency of the analysis plan at each stage; and (3) a sequential planning mechanism that starts with a simple, executable plan and iteratively refines it based on the DS-STAR's feedback until its sufficiency is verified. This iterative refinement allows DS-STAR to reliably navigate complex analyses involving diverse data sources. Our experiments show that DS-STAR achieves state-of-the-art performance across three challenging benchmarks: DABStep, KramaBench, and DA-Code. Moreover, DS-STAR particularly outperforms baselines on hard tasks that require processing multiple data files with heterogeneous formats.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reward is critical to the evaluation and training of large language models (LLMs). However, existing rule-based or model-based reward methods struggle to generalize to GUI agents, where access to ground-truth trajectories or application databases is often unavailable, and static trajectory-based LLM-as-a-Judge approaches suffer from limited accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose ProRe, a proactive reward system that leverages a general-purpose reasoner and domain-specific evaluator agents (actors). The reasoner schedules targeted state probing tasks, which the evaluator agents then execute by actively interacting with the environment to collect additional observations. This enables the reasoner to assign more accurate and verifiable rewards to GUI agents. Empirical results on over 3K trajectories demonstrate that ProRe improves reward accuracy and F1 score by up to 5.3% and 19.4%, respectively. Furthermore, integrating ProRe with state-of-the-art policy agents yields a success rate improvement of up to 22.4%.

  Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents aim to automate a wide spectrum of human tasks by emulating user interaction. Despite rapid advancements, current approaches are hindered by several critical challenges: data bottleneck in end-to-end training, high cost of delayed error detection, and risk of contradictory guidance. Inspired by the human cognitive loop of Thinking, Alignment, and Reflection, we present D-Artemis -- a novel deliberative framework in this paper. D-Artemis leverages a fine-grained, app-specific tip retrieval mechanism to inform its decision-making process. It also employs a proactive Pre-execution Alignment stage, where Thought-Action Consistency (TAC) Check module and Action Correction Agent (ACA) work in concert to mitigate the risk of execution failures. A post-execution Status Reflection Agent (SRA) completes the cognitive loop, enabling strategic learning from experience. Crucially, D-Artemis enhances the capabilities of general-purpose Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for GUI tasks without the need for training on complex trajectory datasets, demonstrating strong generalization. D-Artemis establishes new state-of-the-art (SOTA) results across both major benchmarks, achieving a 75.8% success rate on AndroidWorld and 96.8% on ScreenSpot-V2. Extensive ablation studies further demonstrate the significant contribution of each component to the framework.

  Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are increasingly positioned as AI collaborators for building complex web-related applications like GUI agents and front-end code generation. However, existing benchmarks largely emphasize visual perception or UI code generation, showing insufficient evaluation on the reasoning, robustness and safety capability required for end-to-end web applications. To bridge the gap, we introduce a comprehensive web understanding benchmark, named WebRSSBench, that jointly evaluates Reasoning, Robustness, and Safety across eight tasks, such as position relationship reasoning, color robustness, and safety critical detection, etc. The benchmark is constructed from 729 websites and contains 3799 question answer pairs that probe multi-step inference over page structure, text, widgets, and safety-critical interactions. To ensure reliable measurement, we adopt standardized prompts, deterministic evaluation scripts, and multi-stage quality control combining automatic checks with targeted human verification. We evaluate 12 MLLMs on WebRSSBench. The results reveal significant gaps, models still struggle with compositional and cross-element reasoning over realistic layouts, show limited robustness when facing perturbations in user interfaces and content such as layout rearrangements or visual style shifts, and are rather conservative in recognizing and avoiding safety critical or irreversible actions.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning exposes the intermediate thinking process of large language models (LLMs), yet verifying those traces at scale remains unsolved. In response, we introduce the idea of decision pivots-minimal, verifiable checkpoints that any correct reasoning path must visit. We hypothesize that correct reasoning, though stylistically diverse, converge on the same pivot set, while incorrect ones violate at least one pivot. Leveraging this property, we propose a self-training pipeline that (i) samples diverse reasoning paths and mines shared decision pivots, (ii) compresses each trace into pivot-focused short-path reasoning using an auxiliary verifier, and (iii) post-trains the model using its self-generated outputs. The proposed method aligns reasoning without ground truth reasoning data or external metrics. Experiments on standard benchmarks such as LogiQA, MedQA, and MATH500 show the effectiveness of our method.

  Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated notable potential in medical applications, yet they face substantial challenges in handling complex real-world clinical diagnoses using conventional prompting methods. Current prompt engineering and multi-agent approaches typically optimize isolated inferences, neglecting the accumulation of reusable clinical experience. To address this, this study proposes a novel Multi-Agent Clinical Diagnosis (MACD) framework, which allows LLMs to self-learn clinical knowledge via a multi-agent pipeline that summarizes, refines, and applies diagnostic insights. It mirrors how physicians develop expertise through experience, enabling more focused and accurate diagnosis on key disease-specific cues. We further extend it to a MACD-human collaborative workflow, where multiple LLM-based diagnostician agents engage in iterative consultations, supported by an evaluator agent and human oversight for cases where agreement is not reached. Evaluated on 4,390 real-world patient cases across seven diseases using diverse open-source LLMs (Llama-3.1 8B/70B, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama 70B), MACD significantly improves primary diagnostic accuracy, outperforming established clinical guidelines with gains up to 22.3% (MACD). In direct comparison with physician-only diagnosis under the same evaluation protocol, MACD achieves comparable or superior performance, with improvements up to 16%. Furthermore, the MACD-human workflow yields an 18.6% improvement over physician-only diagnosis, demonstrating the synergistic potential of human-AI collaboration. Notably, the self-learned clinical knowledge exhibits strong cross-model stability, transferability across LLMs, and capacity for model-specificthis http URLwork thus presents a scalable self-learning paradigm that bridges the gap between the intrinsic knowledge of LLMs.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Existing multimodal browsing benchmarks often fail to require genuine multimodal reasoning, as many tasks can be solved with text-only heuristics without vision-in-the-loop verification. We introduce MMSearch-Plus, a 311-task benchmark that enforces multimodal understanding by requiring extraction and propagation of fine-grained visual cues through iterative image-text retrieval and cross-validation under retrieval noise. Our curation procedure seeds questions whose answers require extrapolating from spatial cues and temporal traces to out-of-image facts such as events, dates, and venues. Beyond the dataset, we provide a model-agnostic agent framework with standard browsing tools and a set-of-mark (SoM) module, which lets the agent place marks, crop subregions, and launch targeted image/text searches. SoM enables provenance-aware zoom-and-retrieve and improves robustness in multi-step reasoning. We evaluated closed- and open-source MLLMs in this framework. The strongest system achieves an end-to-end accuracy of 36.0%, and integrating SoM produces consistent gains in multiple settings, with improvements up to +3.9 points. From failure analysis, we observe recurring errors in locating relevant webpages and distinguishing between visually similar events. These results underscore the challenges of real-world multimodal search and establish MMSearch-Plus as a rigorous benchmark for advancing agentic MLLMs.

  Collaborative partnership matters in inquiry-oriented education. However, most study partners are selected either rely on experience-based assignments with little scientific planning or build on rule-based machine assistants, encountering difficulties in knowledge expansion and inadequate flexibility. This paper proposes an LLM-empowered agent model for simulating and selecting learning partners tailored to inquiry-oriented learning, named InqEduAgent. Generative agents are designed to capture cognitive and evaluative features of learners in real-world scenarios. Then, an adaptive matching algorithm with Gaussian process augmentation is formulated to identify patterns within prior knowledge. Optimal learning-partner matches are provided for learners facing different exercises. The experimental results show the optimal performance of InqEduAgent in most knowledge-learning scenarios and LLM environment with different levels of capabilities. This study promotes the intelligent allocation of human-based learning partners and the formulation of AI-based learning partners.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have catalyzed research on role-playing agents (RPAs). However, the process of collecting character-specific utterances and continually updating model parameters to track rapidly changing persona attributes is resource-intensive. Although retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) can alleviate this problem, if a persona does not contain knowledge relevant to a given query, RAG-based RPAs are prone to hallucination, making it challenging to generate accurate responses. In this paper, we propose Amadeus, a training-free framework that can significantly enhance persona consistency even when responding to questions that lie beyond a character's knowledge. Amadeus is composed of Adaptive Context-aware Text Splitter (ACTS), Guided Selection (GS), and Attribute Extractor (AE). To facilitate effective RAG-based role-playing, ACTS partitions each character's persona into optimally sized, overlapping chunks and augments this representation with hierarchical contextual information. AE identifies a character's general attributes from the chunks retrieved by GS and uses these attributes as a final context to maintain robust persona consistency even when answering out-of-knowledge questions. To underpin the development and rigorous evaluation of RAG-based RPAs, we manually construct CharacterRAG, a role-playing dataset that consists of persona documents for 15 distinct fictional characters totaling 976K written characters, and 450 question-answer pairs. We find that our proposed method effectively models not only the knowledge possessed by characters, but also various attributes such as personality.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in large language models (LLMs), particularly those enhanced through reinforced post-training, have demonstrated impressive reasoning capabilities, as exemplified by models such as OpenAI o1 and DeepSeek-R1. However, these capabilities are predominantly benchmarked on domains like mathematical problem solving and code generation, leaving open the question of whether such reasoning skills generalize to complex real-world scenarios. In this paper, we introduce LocationReasoner, a benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs' reasoning abilities in the context of real-world site selection, where models must identify feasible locations by reasoning over diverse and complicated spatial, environmental, and logistic constraints. The benchmark covers carefully crafted queries of varying difficulty levels and is supported by a sandbox environment with in-house tools for constraint-based location search. Automated verification further guarantees the scalability of the benchmark, enabling the addition of arbitrary number of queries. Extensive evaluations on real-world site selection data from Boston, New York, and Tampa reveal that state-of-the-art reasoning models offer limited improvement over their non-reasoning predecessors in real-world contexts, with even the latest OpenAI o4 model failing on 30% of site selection tasks. Moreover, agentic strategies such as ReAct and Reflexion often suffer from over-reasoning, leading to worse outcomes than direct prompting. With key limitations of LLMs in holistic and non-linear reasoning highlighted, we release LocationReasoner to foster the development of LLMs and agents capable of robust, grounded reasoning in real-world decision-making tasks. Codes and data for our benchmark are available atthis https URL.

  Recent advances in LLMs-based agent systems have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in solving complex tasks. Nevertheless, current protocols (e.g., A2A and MCP) suffer from insufficient capabilities in context management, limited adaptability to diverse environments, and the absence of dynamic agent architectures. To address these limitations, we propose the Tool-Environment-Agent (TEA) Protocol, which establishes a principled basis for integrating environments, agents, and tools into an unified system. The TEA protocol treats environments and agents as first-class resources, enabling comprehensive context management and adaptive environment integration. Based on this protocol, we introduce AgentOrchestra, a hierarchical multi-agent framework with a central planning agent that decomposes complex objectives and coordinates specialized agents. Each sub-agent is dedicated to specific functions, providing capabilities for data analysis, file operations, web navigation, and interactive reasoning. Notably, AgentOrchestra introduces a tool manager agent that supports intelligent evolution through dynamic tool creation, retrieval, and reuse mechanisms. Experiments on three widely used benchmarks show that AgentOrchestra consistently outperforms existing baselines, achieving state-of-the-art performance of 83.39% on GAIA and ranking among the top general-purpose LLM-based agents. These results highlight the effectiveness of the TEA Protocol and hierarchical organization in building general-purpose multi-agent systems.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as an effective approach for mitigating hallucination in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Although existing methods have achieved significant progress by utilizing vision-oriented contrastive objectives for enhancing MLLMs' attention to visual inputs and hence reducing hallucination, they suffer from non-rigorous optimization objective function and indirect preference supervision. To address these limitations, we propose a Symmetric Multimodal Preference Optimization (SymMPO), which conducts symmetric preference learning with direct preference supervision (i.e., response pairs) for visual understanding enhancement, while maintaining rigorous theoretical alignment with standard DPO. In addition to conventional ordinal preference learning, SymMPO introduces a preference margin consistency loss to quantitatively regulate the preference gap between symmetric preference pairs. Comprehensive evaluation across five benchmarks demonstrate SymMPO's superior performance, validating its effectiveness in hallucination mitigation of MLLMs.

  Recent advancements in vision-language models have increased interest in Device-Control Agents (DC agents) for managing graphical user interfaces (GUIs). With the growing complexity and integration of such agents into various applications, effective evaluation methods have become crucial. The current evaluation method for DC agents primarily focuses on the instruction level, providing the current state (e.g., screenshots) and past execution history to determine actions for target instructions, helping identify potential execution failures. However, in GUI environments, a single state may contain multiple interactive widgets, each linked to different instructions, presenting an opportunity for diverse actions based on various instruction targets. Evaluating the agent's performance solely at the instruction level may overlook the broader context of these interactions. To capture a more comprehensive view of agent performance, we propose a new evaluation method, XBOUND, to evaluate the accuracy of instruction completion on a per-state basis. XBOUND provides a state-level evaluation framework, serving as a tool to assess agents' capabilities within environmental states. Our evaluation yields several key insights: UI-TARS stands out as the strongest 7B model, current agents display a bimodal performance pattern in instruction unification, and sub-7B models remain limited in state mastery. We further identify GPT-based planning as a critical bottleneck, and show that grounding data mainly benefits action matching, while trajectory data is more effective for instruction unification.

  Many real-world scientific and industrial applications require the optimization of expensive black-box functions. Bayesian Optimization (BO) provides an effective framework for such problems. However, traditional BO methods are prone to get trapped in local optima and often lack interpretable insights. To address this issue, this paper designs Reasoning BO, a novel framework that leverages reasoning models to guide the sampling process in BO while incorporating multi-agent systems and knowledge graphs for online knowledge accumulation. By integrating the reasoning and contextual understanding capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), we can provide strong guidance to enhance the BO process. As the optimization progresses, Reasoning BO provides real-time sampling recommendations along with critical insights grounded in plausible scientific theories, aiding in the discovery of superior solutions within the search space. We systematically evaluate our approach across 10 diverse tasks encompassing synthetic mathematical functions and complex real-world applications. The framework demonstrates its capability to progressively refine sampling strategies through real-time insights and hypothesis evolution, effectively identifying higher-performing regions of the search space for focused exploration. This process highlights the powerful reasoning and context-learning abilities of LLMs in optimization scenarios. For example, in the Direct Arylation task, our method increased the yield to 60.7%, whereas traditional BO achieved only a 25.2% yield. Furthermore, our investigation reveals that smaller LLMs, when fine-tuned through reinforcement learning, can attain comparable performance to their larger counterparts.

  Embodied agents operating in household environments must interpret ambiguous and under-specified human instructions. A capable household robot should recognize ambiguity and ask relevant clarification questions to infer the user intent accurately, leading to more effective task execution. To study this problem, we introduce the Ask-to-Act task, where an embodied agent is tasked with a single or multi-object rearrangement task using an under-specified instruction in a home environment. The agent must strategically ask minimal, yet relevant, clarification questions to resolve ambiguity while navigating under partial observability. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach that fine-tunes multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) as vision-language-action (VLA) policies using online reinforcement learning (RL) with LLM-generated rewards. Our method eliminates the need for large-scale human demonstrations or manually engineered rewards for training such agents. We benchmark against strong zero-shot baselines including GPT-4o as well as supervised fine-tuned MLLMs on our task. Our results show that our RL-finetuned MLLM outperforms all baselines by a significant margin (10.4-16.5%), generalizing well to novel scenes and tasks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of adapting MLLMs as VLA agents that can act and ask for help using LLM-generated rewards with online RL.
