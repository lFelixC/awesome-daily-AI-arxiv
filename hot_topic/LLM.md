- **[Debate2Create: Robot Co-design via Large Language Model Debates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25850)**  `arXiv:2510.25850`  `cs.RO` `cs.LG` `cs.MA`  
  _Kevin Qiu, Marek Cygan_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Automating the co-design of a robot's morphology and control is a long-standing challenge due to the vast design space and the tight coupling between body and behavior. We introduce Debate2Create (D2C), a framework in which large language model (LLM) agents engage in a structured dialectical debate to jointly optimize a robot's design and its reward function. In each round, a design agent proposes targeted morphological modifications, and a control agent devises a reward function tailored to exploit the new design. A panel of pluralistic judges then evaluates the design-control pair in simulation and provides feedback that guides the next round of debate. Through iterative debates, the agents progressively refine their proposals, producing increasingly effective robot designs. Notably, D2C yields diverse and specialized morphologies despite no explicit diversity objective. On a quadruped locomotion benchmark, D2C discovers designs that travel 73% farther than the default, demonstrating that structured LLM-based debate can serve as a powerful mechanism for emergent robot co-design. Our results suggest that multi-agent debate, when coupled with physics-grounded feedback, is a promising new paradigm for automated robot design.

- **[Kinodynamic Task and Motion Planning using VLM-guided and Interleaved Sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26139)**  `arXiv:2510.26139`  `cs.RO`  
  _Minseo Kwon, Young J. Kim_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Task and Motion Planning (TAMP) integrates high-level task planning with low-level motion feasibility, but existing methods are costly in long-horizon problems due to excessive motion sampling. While LLMs provide commonsense priors, they lack 3D spatial reasoning and cannot ensure geometric or dynamic feasibility. We propose a kinodynamic TAMP framework based on a hybrid state tree that uniformly represents symbolic and numeric states during planning, enabling task and motion decisions to be jointly decided. Kinodynamic constraints embedded in the TAMP problem are verified by an off-the-shelf motion planner and physics simulator, and a VLM guides exploring a TAMP solution and backtracks the search based on visual rendering of the states. Experiments on the simulated domains and in the real world show 32.14% - 1166.67% increased average success rates compared to traditional and LLM-based TAMP planners and reduced planning time on complex problems, with ablations further highlighting the benefits of VLM guidance.

- **[Stop Wasting Your Tokens: Towards Efficient Runtime Multi-Agent Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26585)**  `arXiv:2510.26585`  `cs.MA` `cs.AI`  
  _Fulin Lin, Shaowen Chen, Ruishan Fang, Hongwei Wang, Tao Lin_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  While Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) excel at complex tasks, their growing autonomy with operational complexity often leads to critical inefficiencies, such as excessive token consumption and failures arising from misinformation. Existing methods primarily focus on post-hoc failure attribution, lacking proactive, real-time interventions to enhance robustness and efficiency. To this end, we introduce SupervisorAgent, a lightweight and modular framework for runtime, adaptive supervision that operates without altering the base agent's architecture. Triggered by an LLM-free adaptive filter, SupervisorAgent intervenes at critical junctures to proactively correct errors, guide inefficient behaviors, and purify observations. On the challenging GAIA benchmark, SupervisorAgent reduces the token consumption of the Smolagent framework by an average of 29.45% without compromising its success rate. Extensive experiments across five additional benchmarks (math reasoning, code generation, and question answering) and various SoTA foundation models validate the broad applicability and robustness of our approach.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As LLM agents advance, they are increasingly mediating economic decisions, ranging from product discovery to transactions, on behalf of users. Such applications promise benefits but also raise many questions about agent accountability and value for users. Addressing these questions requires understanding how agents behave in realistic market conditions. However, previous research has largely evaluated agents in constrained settings, such as single-task marketplaces (e.g., negotiation) or structured two-agent interactions. Real-world markets are fundamentally different: they require agents to handle diverse economic activities and coordinate within large, dynamic ecosystems where multiple agents with opaque behaviors may engage in open-ended dialogues. To bridge this gap, we investigate two-sided agentic marketplaces where Assistant agents represent consumers and Service agents represent competing businesses. To study these interactions safely, we develop Magentic-Marketplace-- a simulated environment where Assistants and Services can operate. This environment enables us to study key market dynamics: the utility agents achieve, behavioral biases, vulnerability to manipulation, and how search mechanisms shape market outcomes. Our experiments show that frontier models can approach optimal welfare-- but only under ideal search conditions. Performance degrades sharply with scale, and all models exhibit severe first-proposal bias, creating 10-30x advantages for response speed over quality. These findings reveal how behaviors emerge across market conditions, informing the design of fair and efficient agentic marketplaces.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reinforcement learning (RL) with verifiable rewards has recently catalyzed a wave of "MLLM-r1" approaches that bring RL to vision language models. Most representative paradigms begin with a cold start, typically employing supervised fine-tuning (SFT), to initialize the policy before RL. However, SFT-based cold start adopts the reasoning paradigm intertwined with task solution and output format, which may induce instruction-style overfitting, weakens out-of-distribution generalization, and ultimately affects downstream RL. We revisit the cold start along two views, its training method and data construction, and introduce the Generalization Factor (GF) coefficient to quantify the generalization capability under different methods. Our empirical study finds that preference-based training methods (e.g. DPO) generalizes better than SFT-based methods in cold start. Motivated by this, we propose SPECS-a Self-distilled, Preference-based Cold Start framework that decouples multimodal learning: (1) generates introspective preference data pairs via self-distillation, avoiding reliance on larger teachers or manual annotation; (2) performs preference-based training to learn, focusing on shallow, transferable surface-form criteria (format, structure, style) rather than memorizing content; and (3) hands off to RL with verifiable rewards for deep reasoning results. Experimental results across multiple multimodal benchmarks show that our decoupling learning framework yields consistent performance gains over strong baselines, improving MEGA-Bench by 4.1% and MathVista by 12.2%. Additional experiments indicate that SPECS contributes to reducing in-distribution "stuckness," improving exploration, stabilizing training, and raising the performance ceiling.

- **[Defeating the Training-Inference Mismatch via FP16](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26788)**  `arXiv:2510.26788`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI` `cs.CL`  
  _Penghui Qi, Zichen Liu, Xiangxin Zhou, Tianyu Pang, Chao Du, Wee Sun Lee, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs) often suffers from instability due to the numerical mismatch between the training and inference policies. While prior work has attempted to mitigate this issue through algorithmic corrections or engineering alignments, we show that its root cause lies in the floating point precision itself. The widely adopted BF16, despite its large dynamic range, introduces large rounding errors that breaks the consistency between training and inference. In this work, we demonstrate that simply reverting to \textbf{FP16} effectively eliminates this mismatch. The change is simple, fully supported by modern frameworks with only a few lines of code change, and requires no modification to the model architecture or learning algorithm. Our results suggest that using FP16 uniformly yields more stable optimization, faster convergence, and stronger performance across diverse tasks, algorithms and frameworks. We hope these findings motivate a broader reconsideration of precision trade-offs in RL fine-tuning.

- **[Seek in the Dark: Reasoning via Test-Time Instance-Level Policy Gradient in Latent Space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13308)**  `arXiv:2505.13308`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI` `cs.CL`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reasoning ability, a core component of human intelligence, continues to pose a significant challenge for Large Language Models (LLMs) in the pursuit of AGI. Although model performance has improved under the training scaling law, significant challenges remain, particularly with respect to training algorithms, such as catastrophic forgetting, and the limited availability of novel training data. As an alternative, test-time scaling enhances reasoning performance by increasing test-time computation without parameter updating. Unlike prior methods in this paradigm focused on token space, we propose leveraging latent space for more effective reasoning and better adherence to the test-time scaling law. We introduce LatentSeek, a novel framework that enhances LLM reasoning through Test-Time Instance-level Adaptation (TTIA) within the model's latent space. Specifically, LatentSeek leverages policy gradient to iteratively update latent representations, guided by self-generated reward signals. LatentSeek is evaluated on a range of reasoning benchmarks, including GSM8K, MATH-500, and AIME2024, across multiple LLM architectures. Results show that LatentSeek consistently outperforms strong baselines, such as Chain-of-Thought prompting and fine-tuning-based methods. Furthermore, our analysis demonstrates that LatentSeek is highly efficient, typically converging within a few iterations for problems of average complexity, while also benefiting from additional iterations, thereby highlighting the potential of test-time scaling in the latent space. These findings position LatentSeek as a lightweight, scalable, and effective solution for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of LLMs.

- **[Language Models can Self-Improve at State-Value Estimation for Better Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02878)**  `arXiv:2503.02878`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI` `cs.CL`  
  _Ethan Mendes, Alan Ritter_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Collecting ground-truth rewards or human demonstrations for multi-step reasoning tasks is often prohibitively expensive, particularly in interactive domains such as web tasks. We introduce Self-Taught Lookahead (STL), a reward-free framework that improves language model-based value functions by reasoning explicitly about state transitions. STL can be viewed as a chain-of-thought analogue of the value iteration algorithm: instead of regressing directly on numeric values, a value LLM is trained to simulate a step of lookahead in natural language - predicting the next action, resulting state, and rationale for its value, thereby refining value estimates without any labeled data. This self-supervised procedure yields more accurate state-value predictions, which in turn enable lightweight search algorithms to expand fewer states while maintaining strong performance. Empirically, STL-trained value models built on moderately sized (8B parameter) open-weight LLMs boost web agent success rates by 39%, achieving comparable performance with proprietary models. STL also generalizes to multi-hop QA and math puzzles. We find that STL enables small open-source models to guide efficient search, reducing inference costs by integrating explicit reasoning with value learning.

- **[STaMP: Sequence Transformation and Mixed Precision for Low-Precision Activation Quantization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26771)**  `arXiv:2510.26771`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Marco Federici, Riccardo Del Chiaro, Boris van Breugel, Paul Whatmough, Markus Nagel_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Quantization is the key method for reducing inference latency, power and memory footprint of generative AI models. However, accuracy often degrades sharply when activations are quantized below eight bits. Recent work suggests that invertible linear transformations (e.g. rotations) can aid quantization, by reparameterizing feature channels and weights. In this paper, we propose \textit{Sequence Transformation and Mixed Precision} (STaMP) quantization, a novel strategy that applies linear transformations along the \textit{sequence} dimension to exploit the strong local correlation in language and visual data. By keeping a small number of tokens in each intermediate activation at higher precision, we can maintain model accuracy at lower (average) activations bit-widths. We evaluate STaMP on recent LVM and LLM architectures, demonstrating that it significantly improves low bit width activation quantization and complements established activation and weight quantization methods including recent feature transformations.

- **[Angular Steering: Behavior Control via Rotation in Activation Space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26243)**  `arXiv:2510.26243`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Hieu M. Vu, Tan M. Nguyen_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Controlling specific behaviors in large language models while preserving their general capabilities is a central challenge for safe and reliable artificial intelligence deployment. Current steering methods, such as vector addition and directional ablation, are constrained within a two-dimensional subspace defined by the activation and feature direction, making them sensitive to chosen parameters and potentially affecting unrelated features due to unintended interactions in activation space. We introduce Angular Steering, a novel and flexible method for behavior modulation that operates by rotating activations within a fixed two-dimensional subspace. By formulating steering as a geometric rotation toward or away from a target behavior direction, Angular Steering provides continuous, fine-grained control over behaviors such as refusal and compliance. We demonstrate this method using refusal steering emotion steering as use cases. Additionally, we propose Adaptive Angular Steering, a selective variant that rotates only activations aligned with the target feature, further enhancing stability and coherence. Angular Steering generalizes existing addition and orthogonalization techniques under a unified geometric rotation framework, simplifying parameter selection and maintaining model stability across a broader range of adjustments. Experiments across multiple model families and sizes show that Angular Steering achieves robust behavioral control while maintaining general language modeling performance, underscoring its flexibility, generalization, and robustness compared to prior approaches.

- **[Test-Time Alignment of LLMs via Sampling-Based Optimal Control in pre-logit space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26219)**  `arXiv:2510.26219`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Sekitoshi Kanai, Tsukasa Yoshida, Hiroshi Takahashi, Haru Kuroki, Kazumune Hashimoto_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Test-time alignment of large language models (LLMs) attracts attention because fine-tuning LLMs requires high computational costs. In this paper, we propose a new test-time alignment method called adaptive importance sampling on pre-logits (AISP) on the basis of the sampling-based model predictive control with the stochastic control input. AISP applies the Gaussian perturbation into pre-logits, which are outputs of the penultimate layer, so as to maximize expected rewards with respect to the mean of the perturbation. We demonstrate that the optimal mean is obtained by importance sampling with sampled rewards. AISP outperforms best-of-n sampling in terms of rewards over the number of used samples and achieves higher rewards than other reward-based test-time alignment methods.

- **[Nirvana: A Specialized Generalist Model With Task-Aware Memory Mechanism](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26083)**  `arXiv:2510.26083`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Yuhua Jiang, Shuang Cheng, Yihao Liu, Ermo Hua, Che Jiang, Weigao Sun, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Specialized Generalist Models (SGMs) aim to preserve broad capabilities while achieving expert-level performance in target domains. However, traditional LLM structures including Transformer, Linear Attention, and hybrid models do not employ specialized memory mechanism guided by task information. In this paper, we present Nirvana, an SGM with specialized memory mechanism, linear time complexity, and test-time task information extraction. Besides, we propose the Task-Aware Memory Trigger ($\textit{Trigger}$) that flexibly adjusts memory mechanism based on the current task's requirements. In Trigger, each incoming sample is treated as a self-supervised fine-tuning task, enabling Nirvana to adapt its task-related parameters on the fly to domain shifts. We also design the Specialized Memory Updater ($\textit{Updater}$) that dynamically memorizes the context guided by Trigger. We conduct experiments on both general language tasks and specialized medical tasks. On a variety of natural language modeling benchmarks, Nirvana achieves competitive or superior results compared to the existing LLM structures. To prove the effectiveness of Trigger on specialized tasks, we test Nirvana's performance on a challenging medical task, i.e., Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). We post-train frozen Nirvana backbone with lightweight codecs on paired electromagnetic signals and MRI images. Despite the frozen Nirvana backbone, Trigger guides the model to adapt to the MRI domain with the change of task-related parameters. Nirvana achieves higher-quality MRI reconstruction compared to conventional MRI models as well as the models with traditional LLMs' backbone, and can also generate accurate preliminary clinical reports accordingly.

- **[Revealing Multimodal Causality with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17784)**  `arXiv:2509.17784`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Uncovering cause-and-effect mechanisms from data is fundamental to scientific progress. While large language models (LLMs) show promise for enhancing causal discovery (CD) from unstructured data, their application to the increasingly prevalent multimodal setting remains a critical challenge. Even with the advent of multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), their efficacy in multimodal CD is hindered by two primary limitations: (1) difficulty in exploring intra- and inter-modal interactions for comprehensive causal variable identification; and (2) insufficiency to handle structural ambiguities with purely observational data. To address these challenges, we propose MLLM-CD, a novel framework for multimodal causal discovery from unstructured data. It consists of three key components: (1) a novel contrastive factor discovery module to identify genuine multimodal factors based on the interactions explored from contrastive sample pairs; (2) a statistical causal structure discovery module to infer causal relationships among discovered factors; and (3) an iterative multimodal counterfactual reasoning module to refine the discovery outcomes iteratively by incorporating the world knowledge and reasoning capabilities of MLLMs. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed MLLM-CD in revealing genuine factors and causal relationships among them from multimodal unstructured data.

- **[Incentivizing LLMs to Self-Verify Their Answers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01369)**  `arXiv:2506.01369`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Fuxiang Zhang, Jiacheng Xu, Chaojie Wang, Ce Cui, Yang Liu, Bo An_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable progress in complex reasoning tasks through both post-training and test-time scaling laws. While prevalent test-time scaling approaches are often realized by using external reward models to guide the model generation process, we find that only marginal gains can be acquired when scaling a model post-trained on specific reasoning tasks. We identify that the limited improvement stems from distribution discrepancies between the specific post-trained generator and the general reward model. To address this, we propose a framework that incentivizes LLMs to self-verify their own answers. By unifying answer generation and verification within a single reinforcement learning (RL) process, we train models that can effectively assess the correctness of their own solutions. The trained model can further scale its performance at inference time by verifying its generations, without the need for external verifiers. We train our self-verification models based on Qwen2.5-Math-7B and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, demonstrating their capabilities across varying reasoning context lengths. Experiments on multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that our models can not only improve post-training performance but also enable effective test-time scaling.

- **[LoRAQuant: Mixed-Precision Quantization of LoRA to Ultra-Low Bits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26690)**  `arXiv:2510.26690`  `cs.LG`  
  _Amir Reza Mirzaei, Yuqiao Wen, Yanshuai Cao, Lili Mou_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has become a popular technique for parameter-efficient fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs). In many real-world scenarios, multiple adapters are loaded simultaneously to enable LLM customization for personalized user experiences or to support a diverse range of tasks. Although each adapter is lightweight in isolation, their aggregate cost becomes substantial at scale. To address this, we propose LoRAQuant, a mixed-precision post-training quantization method tailored to LoRA. Specifically, LoRAQuant reparameterizes each adapter by singular value decomposition (SVD) to concentrate the most important information into specific rows and columns. This makes it possible to quantize the important components to higher precision, while quantizing the rest to ultra-low bitwidth. We conduct comprehensive experiments with LLaMA 2-7B, LLaMA 2-13B, and Mistral 7B models on mathematical reasoning, coding, and summarization tasks. Results show that our LoRAQuant uses significantly lower bits than other quantization methods, but achieves comparable or even higher performance.

  _Ruilin Wang, Huixia Li, Yuexiao Ma, Xiawu Zheng, Fei Chao, Xuefeng Xiao, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Inference latency stands as a critical bottleneck in the large-scale deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs). Speculative decoding methods have recently shown promise in accelerating inference without compromising the output distribution. However, existing work typically relies on a dualistic draft-verify framework and lacks rigorous theoretical grounding. In this paper, we introduce a novel \emph{polybasic} speculative decoding framework, underpinned by a comprehensive theoretical analysis. Specifically, we prove a fundamental theorem that characterizes the optimal inference time for multi-model speculative decoding systems, shedding light on how to extend beyond the dualistic approach to a more general polybasic paradigm. Through our theoretical investigation of multi-model token generation, we expose and optimize the interplay between model capabilities, acceptance lengths, and overall computational cost. Our framework supports both standalone implementation and integration with existing speculative techniques, leading to accelerated performance in practice. Experimental results across multiple model families demonstrate that our approach yields speedup ratios ranging from $3.31\times$ to $4.01\times$ for LLaMA2-Chat 7B, up to $3.87 \times$ for LLaMA3-8B, up to $4.43 \times$ for Vicuna-7B and up to $3.85 \times$ for Qwen2-7B -- all while preserving the original output distribution. We release our theoretical proofs and implementation code to facilitate further investigation into polybasic speculative decoding.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Data selection is a critical aspect of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Current data selection methods are largely heuristic-based, lacking theoretical guarantees and generalizability. This work proposes a theoretically-grounded approach using influence functions to estimate the contribution of each data point to the learning objective. To overcome the prohibitive computational cost of policy rollouts required for online influence estimation, we introduce an off-policy influence estimation method that efficiently approximates data influence using pre-collected offline trajectories. Furthermore, to manage the high-dimensional gradients of LLMs, we employ sparse random projection to reduce dimensionality and improve storage and computation efficiency. Leveraging these techniques, we develop \textbf{C}urriculum \textbf{R}L with \textbf{O}ff-\textbf{P}olicy \text{I}nfluence guidance (\textbf{CROPI}), a multi-stage RL framework that iteratively selects the most influential data for the current policy. Experiments on models up to 7B parameters demonstrate that CROPI significantly accelerates training. On a 1.5B model, it achieves a 2.66x step-level acceleration while using only 10\% of the data per stage compared to full-dataset training. Our results highlight the substantial potential of influence-based data selection for efficient RLVR.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Financial forecasting increasingly uses large neural network models, but their opacity raises challenges for trust and regulatory compliance. We present several approaches to explainable and reliable AI in finance. \emph{First}, we describe how Time-LLM, a time series foundation model, uses a prompt to avoid a wrong directional forecast. \emph{Second}, we show that combining foundation models for time series forecasting with a reliability estimator can filter our unreliable predictions. \emph{Third}, we argue for symbolic reasoning encoding domain rules for transparent justification. These approaches shift emphasize executing only forecasts that are both reliable and explainable. Experiments on equity and cryptocurrency data show that the architecture reduces false positives and supports selective execution. By integrating predictive performance with reliability estimation and rule-based reasoning, our framework advances transparent and auditable financial AI systems.

- **[Agent Skills Enable a New Class of Realistic and Trivially Simple Prompt Injections](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26328)**  `arXiv:2510.26328`  `cs.LG`  
  _David Schmotz, Sahar Abdelnabi, Maksym Andriushchenko_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Enabling continual learning in LLMs remains a key unresolved research challenge. In a recent announcement, a frontier LLM company made a step towards this by introducing Agent Skills, a framework that equips agents with new knowledge based on instructions stored in simple markdown files. Although Agent Skills can be a very useful tool, we show that they are fundamentally insecure, since they enable trivially simple prompt injections. We demonstrate how to hide malicious instructions in long Agent Skill files and referenced scripts to exfiltrate sensitive data, such as internal files or passwords. Importantly, we show how to bypass system-level guardrails of a popular coding agent: a benign, task-specific approval with the "Don't ask again" option can carry over to closely related but harmful actions. Overall, we conclude that despite ongoing research efforts and scaling model capabilities, frontier LLMs remain vulnerable to very simple prompt injections in realistic scenarios.

- **[Do Not Step Into the Same River Twice: Learning to Reason from Trial and Error](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26109)**  `arXiv:2510.26109`  `cs.LG`  
  _Chenming Tang, Hsiu-Yuan Huang, Weijie Liu, Saiyong Yang, Yunfang Wu_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has significantly boosted the reasoning capability of large language models (LLMs) recently. However, existing RLVR approaches merely train LLMs based on their own generated responses and are constrained by the initial capability of LLMs, thus prone to exploration stagnation, in which LLMs fail to solve more training problems and cannot further learn from the training data. Some work tries to address this by leveraging off-policy solutions to training problems but requires external guidance from experts which suffers from limited availability. In this work, we propose LTE (Learning to reason from Trial and Error), an approach hinting LLMs with their previously self-generated incorrect answers and problem of overlong responses, which does not require any external expert guidance. Experiments validate the effectiveness of LTE, which outperforms the normal group relative policy optimization (GRPO) by 6.38 in Pass@1 and 9.00 in Pass@k on average across six mathematics benchmarks for Qwen3-4B-Base. Further analysis confirms that LTE successfully mitigates the problem of exploration stagnation and enhances both exploitation and exploration during training.

- **[LLMBisect: Breaking Barriers in Bug Bisection with A Comparative Analysis Pipeline](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26086)**  `arXiv:2510.26086`  `cs.LG`  
  _Zheng Zhang, Haonan Li, Xingyu Li, Hang Zhang, Zhiyun Qian_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Bug bisection has been an important security task that aims to understand the range of software versions impacted by a bug, i.e., identifying the commit that introduced the bug. However, traditional patch-based bisection methods are faced with several significant barriers: For example, they assume that the bug-inducing commit (BIC) and the patch commit modify the same functions, which is not always true. They often rely solely on code changes, while the commit message frequently contains a wealth of vulnerability-related information. They are also based on simple heuristics (e.g., assuming the BIC initializes lines deleted in the patch) and lack any logical analysis of the vulnerability.In this paper, we make the observation that Large Language Models (LLMs) are well-positioned to break the barriers of existing solutions, e.g., comprehend both textual data and code in patches and commits. Unlike previous BIC identification approaches, which yield poor results, we propose a comprehensive multi-stage pipeline that leverages LLMs to: (1) fully utilize patch information, (2) compare multiple candidate commits in context, and (3) progressively narrow down the candidates through a series of down-selection steps. In our evaluation, we demonstrate that our approach achieves significantly better accuracy than the state-of-the-art solution by more than 38\%. Our results further confirm that the comprehensive multi-stage pipeline is essential, as it improves accuracy by 60\% over a baseline LLM-based bisection method.

- **[PRESTO: Preimage-Informed Instruction Optimization for Prompting Black-Box LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25808)**  `arXiv:2510.25808`  `cs.LG`  
  _Jaewon Chu, Seunghun Lee, Hyunwoo J. Kim_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across diverse domains, due to their strong instruction-following capabilities. This has led to increasing interest in optimizing instructions for black-box LLMs, whose internal parameters are inaccessible but widely used due to their strong performance. To optimize instructions for black-box LLMs, recent methods employ white-box LLMs to generate candidate instructions from optimized soft prompts. However, white-box LLMs often map different soft prompts to the same instruction, leading to redundant queries. While previous studies regarded this many-to-one mapping as a structure that hinders optimization efficiency, we reinterpret it as a useful prior knowledge that can accelerate the optimization. To this end, we introduce PREimage-informed inSTruction Optimization (PRESTO), a novel framework that leverages the preimage structure of soft prompts for efficient optimization. PRESTO consists of three key components: (1) score sharing, which shares the evaluation score with all soft prompts in a preimage; (2) preimage-based initialization, which selects initial data points that maximize search space coverage using preimage information; and (3) score consistency regularization, which enforces prediction consistency within each preimage. By leveraging preimages, PRESTO achieves the effect of effectively obtaining 14 times more scored data under the same query budget, resulting in more efficient optimization. Experimental results on 33 instruction optimization tasks demonstrate the superior performance of PRESTO. Code is available atthis https URL

- **[On the Impossibility of Retrain Equivalence in Machine Unlearning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16629)**  `arXiv:2510.16629`  `cs.LG`

  Machine unlearning seeks to selectively remove the "influence" of specific training data on a model's outputs. The ideal goal is Retrain Equivalence--behavior identical to a model trained from scratch on only the retained data. This goal was formulated for models trained on i.i.d. data batches, but modern pipelines often involve multi-stage training, with each stage having a distinct data distribution and objective. Examples include LLM fine-tuning for alignment, reasoning ability, etc. Our study shows via theory and experiments that this shift to multi-stage training introduces a fundamental barrier for machine unlearning. The theory indicates that the outcome of local unlearning--methods that only use gradients computed on the forget set--is path-dependent. That is, a model's behavior during unlearning is influenced by the order of its training stages during learning, making it impossible for path-oblivious algorithms to universally achieve Retrain Equivalence. We empirically demonstrate the same phenomenon in LLM post-training across Llama and Qwen models (1B to 14B) with gradient ascent, NPO, and SimNPO local unlearning algorithms. Models fine-tuned via different orderings of identical training stages diverge in behavior during unlearning, with the degradation in GSM8K accuracy after unlearning varying by over 20% across paths. We also observe that some learning paths consistently produce models that unlearn slowly. During unlearning, whether the probability mass gets squeezed into paraphrasing or alternative concepts is also path-dependent. These results consistently show that Retrain Equivalence is an ill-posed target for local unlearning algorithms, so long as the target models are trained in stages. In situations where access to models' training histories is hard, the current work calls for rethinking the definition and desiderata of machine unlearning.

  Activation patching is a standard method in mechanistic interpretability for localizing the components of a model responsible for specific behaviors, but it is computationally expensive to apply at scale. Attribution patching offers a faster, gradient-based approximation, yet suffers from noise and reduced reliability in deep, highly non-linear networks. In this work, we introduce Relevance Patching (RelP), which replaces the local gradients in attribution patching with propagation coefficients derived from Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP). LRP propagates the network's output backward through the layers, redistributing relevance to lower-level components according to local propagation rules that ensure properties such as relevance conservation or improved signal-to-noise ratio. Like attribution patching, RelP requires only two forward passes and one backward pass, maintaining computational efficiency while improving faithfulness. We validate RelP across a range of models and tasks, showing that it more accurately approximates activation patching than standard attribution patching, particularly when analyzing residual stream and MLP outputs in the Indirect Object Identification (IOI) task. For instance, for MLP outputs in GPT-2 Large, attribution patching achieves a Pearson correlation of 0.006, whereas RelP reaches 0.956, highlighting the improvement offered by RelP. Additionally, we compare the faithfulness of sparse feature circuits identified by RelP and Integrated Gradients (IG), showing that RelP achieves comparable faithfulness without the extra computational cost associated with IG.

  Estimating treatment effects is crucial for personalized decision-making in medicine, but this task faces unique challenges in clinical practice. At training time, models for estimating treatment effects are typically trained on well-structured medical datasets that contain detailed patient information. However, at inference time, predictions are often made using textual descriptions (e.g., descriptions with self-reported symptoms), which are incomplete representations of the original patient information. In this work, we make three contributions. (1) We show that the discrepancy between the data available during training time and inference time can lead to biased estimates of treatment effects. We formalize this issue as an inference time text confounding problem, where confounders are fully observed during training time but only partially available through text at inference time. (2) To address this problem, we propose a novel framework for estimating treatment effects that explicitly accounts for inference time text confounding. Our framework leverages large language models together with a custom doubly robust learner to mitigate biases caused by the inference time text confounding. (3) Through a series of experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in real-world applications.

  _Yuanyao Chen, Rongsheng Chen, Fu Luo, Zhenkun Wang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Neural Combinatorial Optimization (NCO) has emerged as a promising learning-based paradigm for addressing Vehicle Routing Problems (VRPs) by minimizing the need for extensive manual engineering. While existing NCO methods, trained on small-scale instances (e.g., 100 nodes), have demonstrated considerable success on problems of similar scale, their performance significantly degrades when applied to large-scale scenarios. This degradation arises from the distributional shift between training and testing data, rendering policies learned on small instances ineffective for larger problems. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a novel learning framework driven by Large Language Models (LLMs). This framework learns a projection between the training and testing distributions, which is then deployed to enhance the scalability of the NCO model. Notably, unlike prevailing techniques that necessitate joint training with the neural network, our approach operates exclusively during the inference phase, obviating the need for model retraining. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method enables a backbone model (trained on 100-node instances) to achieve superior performance on large-scale Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) and Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) of up to 100K nodes from diverse distributions.

  _Amir Hossein Rahmati, Sanket Jantre, Weifeng Zhang, Yucheng Wang, Byung-Jun Yoon, Nathan M. Urban, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) offers a cost-effective solution for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs), but it often produces overconfident predictions in data-scarce few-shot settings. To address this issue, several classical statistical learning approaches have been repurposed for scalable uncertainty-aware LoRA fine-tuning. However, these approaches neglect how input characteristics affect the predictive uncertainty estimates. To address this limitation, we propose Contextual Low-Rank Adaptation (C-LoRA) as a novel uncertainty-aware and parameter efficient fine-tuning approach, by developing new lightweight LoRA modules contextualized to each input data sample to dynamically adapt uncertainty estimates. Incorporating data-driven contexts into the parameter posteriors, C-LoRA mitigates overfitting, achieves well-calibrated uncertainties, and yields robust predictions. Extensive experiments on LLaMA2-7B models demonstrate that C-LoRA consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art uncertainty-aware LoRA methods in both uncertainty quantification and model generalization. Ablation studies further confirm the critical role of our contextual modules in capturing sample-specific uncertainties. C-LoRA sets a new standard for robust, uncertainty-aware LLM fine-tuning in few-shot regimes. Although our experiments are limited to 7B models, our method is architecture-agnostic and, in principle, applies beyond this scale; studying its scaling to larger models remains an open problem.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In the molecular domain, numerous studies have explored the use of multimodal large language models (LLMs) to construct a general-purpose, multi-task molecular model. However, these efforts are still far from achieving a truly universal molecular model. We identify three key challenges in this endeavor: (1) Existing molecular task datasets are typically small in scale and lack comprehensive domain coverage. (2) Tasks from different molecular subfields are difficult to effectively learn jointly through LLMs due to significant distributional shifts and competition among tasks, which introduces instability in the learning process. (3) Both inter-task and intra-task molecular representations demand different intrinsic dimensions in the language space, making it challenging to balance between redundancy and insufficiency in language model representations. To address these challenges, we innovatively categorize existing small-molecule tasks into four types: Mol2Mol, Mol2Text, Mol2Num, and Text2Mol. We then collect a dataset encompassing over 16 tasks with more than 1.4 million samples, making it the largest molecular instruction-tuning dataset to date. Leveraging the extensive pretraining of LLMs on existing chemical literature, we propose a novel multimodal LLM framework, named Omni-Mol, which unifies all small-molecule tasks and supports both molecular generation and understanding. The core of Omni-Mol is our proposed MoGE, which dynamically adapts to the intrinsic rank of different tasks. This mixture-of-experts architecture enhances the model's ability to handle diverse tasks and modalities effectively. Our model achieves unified instruction tuning across 16 tasks and attains state-of-the-art performance on 13 of them. Extensive experiments further demonstrate the scalability and versatility of Omni-Mol.

  True intelligence hinges on the ability to uncover and leverage hidden causal relations. Despite significant progress in AI and computer vision (CV), there remains a lack of benchmarks for assessing models' abilities to infer latent causality from complex visual data. In this paper, we introduce \textsc{\textbf{Causal3D}}, a novel and comprehensive benchmark that integrates structured data (tables) with corresponding visual representations (images) to evaluate causal reasoning. Designed within a systematic framework, Causal3D comprises 19 3D-scene datasets capturing diverse causal relations, views, and backgrounds, enabling evaluations across scenes of varying complexity. We assess multiple state-of-the-art methods, including classical causal discovery, causal representation learning, and large/vision-language models (LLMs/VLMs). Our experiments show that as causal structures grow more complex without prior knowledge, performance declines significantly, highlighting the challenges even advanced methods face in complex causal scenarios. Causal3D serves as a vital resource for advancing causal reasoning in CV and fostering trustworthy AI in critical domains.

  Academic poster generation is a crucial yet challenging task in scientific communication, requiring the compression of long-context interleaved documents into a single, visually coherent page. To address this challenge, we introduce the first benchmark and metric suite for poster generation, which pairs recent conference papers with author-designed posters and evaluates outputs on (i)Visual Quality-semantic alignment with human posters, (ii)Textual Coherence-language fluency, (iii)Holistic Assessment-six fine-grained aesthetic and informational criteria scored by a VLM-as-judge, and notably (iv)PaperQuiz-the poster's ability to convey core paper content as measured by VLMs answering generated quizzes. Building on this benchmark, we propose PosterAgent, a top-down, visual-in-the-loop multi-agent pipeline: the (a)Parser distills the paper into a structured asset library; the (b)Planner aligns text-visual pairs into a binary-tree layout that preserves reading order and spatial balance; and the (c)Painter-Commenter loop refines each panel by executing rendering code and using VLM feedback to eliminate overflow and ensure alignment. In our comprehensive evaluation, we find that GPT-4o outputs-though visually appealing at first glance-often exhibit noisy text and poor PaperQuiz scores, and we find that reader engagement is the primary aesthetic bottleneck, as human-designed posters rely largely on visual semantics to convey meaning. Our fully open-source variants (e.g. based on the Qwen-2.5 series) outperform existing 4o-driven multi-agent systems across nearly all metrics, while using 87% fewer tokens. It transforms a 22-page paper into a finalized yet editable .pptx poster - all for just $0.005. These findings chart clear directions for the next generation of fully automated poster-generation models. The code and datasets are available atthis https URL.

  Vision-based end-to-end (E2E) driving has garnered significant interest in the research community due to its scalability and synergy with multimodal large language models (MLLMs). However, current E2E driving benchmarks primarily feature nominal scenarios, failing to adequately test the true potential of these systems. Furthermore, existing open-loop evaluation metrics often fall short in capturing the multi-modal nature of driving or effectively evaluating performance in long-tail scenarios. To address these gaps, we introduce the Waymo Open Dataset for End-to-End Driving (WOD-E2E). WOD-E2E contains 4,021 driving segments (approximately 12 hours), specifically curated for challenging long-tail scenarios that that are rare in daily life with an occurring frequency of less than 0.03%. Concretely, each segment in WOD-E2E includes the high-level routing information, ego states, and 360-degree camera views from 8 surrounding cameras. To evaluate the E2E driving performance on these long-tail situations, we propose a novel open-loop evaluation metric: Rater Feedback Score (RFS). Unlike conventional metrics that measure the distance between predicted way points and the logs, RFS measures how closely the predicted trajectory matches rater-annotated trajectory preference labels. We have released rater preference labels for all WOD-E2E validation set segments, while the held out test set labels have been used for the 2025 WOD-E2E Challenge. Through our work, we aim to foster state of the art research into generalizable, robust, and safe end-to-end autonomous driving agents capable of handling complex real-world situations.

  Can Video-LLMs achieve consistent temporal understanding when videos capture the same event from different viewpoints? To study this, we introduce EgoExo-Con (Consistency), a benchmark of comprehensively synchronized egocentric and exocentric video pairs with human-refined queries in natural language. EgoExo-Con emphasizes two temporal understanding tasks: Temporal Verification and Temporal Grounding. It evaluates not only correctness but consistency across viewpoints. Our analysis reveals two critical limitations of existing Video-LLMs: (1) models often fail to maintain consistency, with results far worse than their single-view performances. (2) When naively finetuned with synchronized videos of both viewpoints, the models show improved consistency but often underperform those trained on a single view. For improvements, we propose View-GRPO, a novel reinforcement learning framework that effectively strengthens view-specific temporal reasoning while encouraging consistent comprehension across viewpoints. Our method demonstrates its superiority over naive SFT and GRPO, especially for improving cross-view consistency. All resources will be made publicly available.

  Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) are transforming the future of transportation through advances in intelligent perception, decision-making, and control systems. However, their success is tied to one core capability, reliable object detection in complex and multimodal environments. While recent breakthroughs in Computer Vision (CV) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) have driven remarkable progress, the field still faces a critical challenge as knowledge remains fragmented across multimodal perception, contextual reasoning, and cooperative intelligence. This survey bridges that gap by delivering a forward-looking analysis of object detection in AVs, emphasizing emerging paradigms such as Vision-Language Models (VLMs), Large Language Models (LLMs), and Generative AI rather than re-examining outdated techniques. We begin by systematically reviewing the fundamental spectrum of AV sensors (camera, ultrasonic, LiDAR, and Radar) and their fusion strategies, highlighting not only their capabilities and limitations in dynamic driving environments but also their potential to integrate with recent advances in LLM/VLM-driven perception frameworks. Next, we introduce a structured categorization of AV datasets that moves beyond simple collections, positioning ego-vehicle, infrastructure-based, and cooperative datasets (e.g., V2V, V2I, V2X, I2I), followed by a cross-analysis of data structures and characteristics. Ultimately, we analyze cutting-edge detection methodologies, ranging from 2D and 3D pipelines to hybrid sensor fusion, with particular attention to emerging transformer-driven approaches powered by Vision Transformers (ViTs), Large and Small Language Models (SLMs), and VLMs. By synthesizing these perspectives, our survey delivers a clear roadmap of current capabilities, open challenges, and future opportunities.

  Recent advances in Visual Question Answering (VQA) have demonstrated impressive performance in natural image domains, with models like LLaVA leveraging large language models (LLMs) for open-ended reasoning. However, their generalization degrades significantly when transferred to out-of-domain scenarios such as remote sensing, medical imaging, or math diagrams, due to large distributional shifts and the lack of effective domain adaptation mechanisms. Existing approaches typically rely on per-domain fine-tuning or bespoke pipelines, which are costly, inflexible, and not scalable across diverse tasks. In this paper, we propose CATCH, a plug-and-play framework for cross-domain adaptation that improves the generalization of VQA models while requiring minimal changes to their core architecture. Our key idea is to decouple visual and linguistic adaptation by introducing two lightweight modules: a domain classifier to identify the input image type, and a dual adapter mechanism comprising a Prompt Adapter for language modulation and a Visual Adapter for vision feature adjustment. Both modules are dynamically injected via a unified hook interface, requiring no retraining of the backbone model. Experimental results across four domain-specific VQA benchmarks demonstrate that our framework achieves consistent performance gains without retraining the backbone model, including +2.3 BLEU on MathVQA, +2.6 VQA on MedVQA-RAD, and +3.1 ROUGE on ChartQA. These results highlight that CATCH provides a scalable and extensible approach to multi-domain VQA, enabling practical deployment across diverse application domains.

  In real-world environments, AI systems often face unfamiliar scenarios without labeled data, creating a major challenge for conventional scene understanding models. The inability to generalize across unseen contexts limits the deployment of vision-based applications in dynamic, unstructured settings. This work introduces a Dynamic Context-Aware Scene Reasoning framework that leverages Vision-Language Alignment to address zero-shot real-world scenarios. The goal is to enable intelligent systems to infer and adapt to new environments without prior task-specific training. The proposed approach integrates pre-trained vision transformers and large language models to align visual semantics with natural language descriptions, enhancing contextual comprehension. A dynamic reasoning module refines predictions by combining global scene cues and object-level interactions guided by linguistic priors. Extensive experiments on zero-shot benchmarks such as COCO, Visual Genome, and Open Images demonstrate up to 18% improvement in scene understanding accuracy over baseline models in complex and unseen environments. Results also show robust performance in ambiguous or cluttered scenes due to the synergistic fusion of vision and language. This framework offers a scalable and interpretable approach for context-aware reasoning, advancing zero-shot generalization in dynamic real-world settings.

  Document AI has advanced rapidly and is attracting increasing attention. Yet, while most efforts have focused on document layout analysis (DLA), its generative counterpart, document layout generation, remains underexplored. A major obstacle lies in the scarcity of diverse layouts: academic papers with Manhattan-style structures dominate existing studies, while open-world genres such as newspapers and magazines remain severely underrepresented. To address this gap, we curate OmniLayout-1M, the first million-scale dataset of diverse document layouts, covering six common document types and comprising contemporary layouts collected from multiple sources. Moreover, since existing methods struggle in complex domains and often fail to arrange long sequences coherently, we introduce OmniLayout-LLM, a 0.5B model with designed two-stage Coarse-to-Fine learning paradigm: 1) learning universal layout principles from OmniLayout-1M with coarse category definitions, and 2) transferring the knowledge to a specific domain with fine-grained annotations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves strong performance on multiple domains in M$^{6}$Doc dataset, substantially surpassing both existing layout generation experts and several latest general-purpose LLMs. Our code, models, and dataset will be publicly released.

  As one of the earliest writing systems, Oracle Bone Script (OBS) preserves the cultural and intellectual heritage of ancient civilizations. However, current OBS research faces two major challenges: (1) the interpretation of OBS involves a complex workflow comprising multiple serial and parallel sub-tasks, and (2) the efficiency of OBS information organization and retrieval remains a critical bottleneck, as scholars often spend substantial effort searching for, compiling, and managing relevant resources. To address these challenges, we present OracleAgent, the first agent system designed for the structured management and retrieval of OBS-related information. OracleAgent seamlessly integrates multiple OBS analysis tools, empowered by large language models (LLMs), and can flexibly orchestrate these components. Additionally, we construct a comprehensive domain-specific multimodal knowledge base for OBS, which is built through a rigorous multi-year process of data collection, cleaning, and expert annotation. The knowledge base comprises over 1.4M single-character rubbing images and 80K interpretation texts. OracleAgent leverages this resource through its multimodal tools to assist experts in retrieval tasks of character, document, interpretation text, and rubbing image. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OracleAgent achieves superior performance across a range of multimodal reasoning and generation tasks, surpassing leading mainstream multimodal large language models (MLLMs) (e.g., GPT-4o). Furthermore, our case study illustrates that OracleAgent can effectively assist domain experts, significantly reducing the time cost of OBS research. These results highlight OracleAgent as a significant step toward the practical deployment of OBS-assisted research and automated interpretation systems.

  Despite significant advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), understanding complex temporal dynamics in videos remains a major challenge. Our experiments show that current Video Large Language Model (Video-LLM) architectures have critical limitations in temporal understanding, struggling with tasks that require detailed comprehension of action sequences and temporal progression. In this work, we propose a Video-LLM architecture that introduces stacked temporal attention modules directly within the vision encoder. This design incorporates a temporal attention in vision encoder, enabling the model to better capture the progression of actions and the relationships between frames before passing visual tokens to the LLM. Our results show that this approach significantly improves temporal reasoning and outperforms existing models in video question answering tasks, specifically in action recognition. We improve on benchmarks including VITATECS, MVBench, and Video-MME by up to +5.5%. By enhancing the vision encoder with temporal structure, we address a critical gap in video understanding for Video-LLMs. Project page and code are available at:this https URL.

  Directly modeling the explicit likelihood of the raw data distribution is key topic in the machine learning area, which achieves the scaling successes in Large Language Models by autoregressive modeling. However, continuous AR modeling over visual pixel data suffer from extremely long sequences and high-dimensional spaces. In this paper, we present FARMER, a novel end-to-end generative framework that unifies Normalizing Flows (NF) and Autoregressive (AR) models for tractable likelihood estimation and high-quality image synthesis directly from raw pixels. FARMER employs an invertible autoregressive flow to transform images into latent sequences, whose distribution is modeled implicitly by an autoregressive model. To address the redundancy and complexity in pixel-level modeling, we propose a self-supervised dimension reduction scheme that partitions NF latent channels into informative and redundant groups, enabling more effective and efficient AR modeling. Furthermore, we design a one-step distillation scheme to significantly accelerate inference speed and introduce a resampling-based classifier-free guidance algorithm to boost image generation quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FARMER achieves competitive performance compared to existing pixel-based generative models while providing exact likelihoods and scalable training.

  The rapid proliferation of AI-generated content, driven by advances in generative adversarial networks, diffusion models, and multimodal large language models, has made the creation and dissemination of synthetic media effortless, heightening the risks of misinformation, particularly political deepfakes that distort truth and undermine trust in political institutions. In turn, governments, research institutions, and industry have strongly promoted deepfake detection initiatives as solutions. Yet, most existing models are trained and validated on synthetic, laboratory-controlled datasets, limiting their generalizability to the kinds of real-world political deepfakes circulating on social platforms that affect the public. In this work, we introduce the first systematic benchmark based on the Political Deepfakes Incident Database, a curated collection of real-world political deepfakes shared on social media since 2018. Our study includes a systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art deepfake detectors across academia, government, and industry. We find that the detectors from academia and government perform relatively poorly. While paid detection tools achieve relatively higher performance than free-access models, all evaluated detectors struggle to generalize effectively to authentic political deepfakes, and are vulnerable to simple manipulations, especially in the video domain. Results urge the need for politically contextualized deepfake detection frameworks to better safeguard the public in real-world settings.

  Spatial reasoning is a fundamental capability of multimodal large language models (MLLMs), yet their performance in open aerial environments remains underexplored. In this work, we present Open3D-VQA, a novel benchmark for evaluating MLLMs' ability to reason about complex spatial relationships from an aerial perspective. The benchmark comprises 73k QA pairs spanning 7 general spatial reasoning tasks, including multiple-choice, true/false, and short-answer formats, and supports both visual and point cloud modalities. The questions are automatically generated from spatial relations extracted from both real-world and simulated aerial scenes. Evaluation on 13 popular MLLMs reveals that: 1) Models are generally better at answering questions about relative spatial relations than absolute distances, 2) 3D LLMs fail to demonstrate significant advantages over 2D LLMs, and 3) Fine-tuning solely on the simulated dataset can significantly improve the model's spatial reasoning performance in real-world scenarios.

Our bespoke chunkwise algorithm achieves high hardware efficiency through a specialized variant of the Diagonal-Plus-Low-Rank (DPLR) transition matrices, which substantially reduces computation compared to the general DPLR formulation while remaining more consistent with the classical delta rule.We pretrain a Kimi Linear model with 3B activated parameters and 48B total parameters, based on a layerwise hybrid of KDA and Multi-Head Latent Attention (MLA). Our experiments show that with an identical training recipe, Kimi Linear outperforms full MLA with a sizeable margin across all evaluated tasks, while reducing KV cache usage by up to 75% and achieving up to 6 times decoding throughput for a 1M context. These results demonstrate that Kimi Linear can be a drop-in replacement for full attention architectures with superior performance and efficiency, including tasks with longer input and output lengths.To support further research, we open-source the KDA kernel and vLLM implementations, and release the pre-trained and instruction-tuned model checkpoints.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) face significant inference latency challenges stemming from their autoregressive design and large size. To address this, speculative decoding emerges as a solution, enabling the simultaneous generation and validation of multiple tokens. While recent approaches like EAGLE-2 and EAGLE-3 improve speculative decoding using dynamic tree structures, they often neglect the impact of crucial system variables such as GPU devices and batch sizes.Therefore, we introduce a new dynamic tree decoding approach called CAST that takes into account inference costs, including factors such as GPU configurations and batch sizes, to dynamically refine the tree structure. Through comprehensive experimentation across six diverse tasks and utilizing six distinct LLMs, our methodology demonstrates remarkable results, achieving speeds up to 5.2 times faster than conventional decoding methods. Moreover, it generally outperforms existing state-of-the-art techniques from 5% to 20%.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used in generative applications such as chatting, code generation, and reasoning. However, many realworld workloads such as classification, question answering, recommendation, and text embedding rely solely on the prefill stage of inference, where the model encodes input sequences without performing autoregressive decoding. In these prefill only scenarios, the self-attention computation becomes the primary performance bottleneck due to its quadratic complexity with respect to sequence length. In this paper, we observe that semantically different sentences often produce similar attention maps across layers and heads. Building on this insight, we propose AttnCache, a framework that accelerates the prefill stage of LLM inference by retrieving and reusing similar attention maps. Based on an attention map memorization database, AttnCache employs efficient caching and similarity search techniques to identify and reuse pre-cached attention maps during inference, thereby reducing the computational overhead of self-attention. Experimental results show that AttnCache achieves an average of 1.2x end-to-end and 2x attention speedup on CPU, and 1.6x end-to-end and 3x attention speedup on GPU, with negligible accuracy degradation.

  There is a substantial body of literature examining the mathematical reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), particularly their performance on precise arithmetic operations in autoregressive architectures. However, their ability to perform approximate reasoning in informal, fast-paced mathematical operations has received far less attention, especially among non-autoregressive decoder models. Our work addresses this gap by introducing StreetMath, a benchmark designed to evaluate models' approximation abilities under real-world approximation scenarios. We conduct extensive evaluations across different LLM architectures: Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507, Qwen3-4B-Thinking-2507, Dream-v0-Instruct-7B, Falcon-Mamba-7B-Instruct, and Mamba-GPT-3B. Furthermore, we apply mechanistic interpretability techniques to probe their internal computational states. Our analysis reveals that LLMs generally attempt to compute exact values or invoke external tools even in tasks that call for approximation. Moreover, while models sometimes reach the correct answer in early layers or steps, they still consume more tokens when solving approximation tasks. Additional experiments indicate that exact and approximate arithmetic operations rely on largely separate neural components. Drawing upon research on cognitive psychology, we argue that LLMs do not exhibit cognitive miserliness in the same way humans do in street math settings. We open source our workthis https URL

  While a multi-agent approach based on large language models (LLMs) represents a promising strategy to surpass the capabilities of single models, its success is critically dependent on synergistic team composition. However, forming optimal teams is a significant challenge, as the inherent opacity of most models obscures the internal characteristics necessary for effective collaboration. In this paper, we propose an interaction-centric framework for automatic team composition that does not require any prior knowledge including their internal architectures, training data, or task performances. Our method constructs a "language model graph" that maps relationships between models from the semantic coherence of pairwise conversations, and then applies community detection to identify synergistic model clusters. Our experiments with diverse LLMs demonstrate that the proposed method discovers functionally coherent groups that reflect their latent specializations. Priming conversations with specific topics identified synergistic teams which outperform random baselines on downstream benchmarks and achieve comparable accuracy to that of manually-curated teams based on known model specializations. Our findings provide a new basis for the automated design of collaborative multi-agent LLM teams.

  This paper investigates the structure of linear operators introduced in Hernandez et al. [2023] that decode specific relational facts in transformer language models. We extend their single-relation findings to a collection of relations and systematically chart their organization. We show that such collections of relation decoders can be highly compressed by simple order-3 tensor networks without significant loss in decoding accuracy. To explain this surprising redundancy, we develop a cross-evaluation protocol, in which we apply each linear decoder operator to the subjects of every other relation. Our results reveal that these linear maps do not encode distinct relations, but extract recurring, coarse-grained semantic properties (e.g., country of capital city and country of food are both in the country-of-X property). This property-centric structure clarifies both the operators' compressibility and highlights why they generalize only to new relations that are semantically close. Our findings thus interpret linear relational decoding in transformer language models as primarily property-based, rather than relation-specific.

  Health-related misinformation is very prevalent and potentially harmful. It is difficult to identify, especially when claims distort or misinterpret scientific findings. We investigate the impact of synthetic data generation and lightweight fine-tuning techniques on the ability of large language models (LLMs) to recognize fallacious arguments using the MISSCI dataset and framework. In this work, we propose MisSynth, a pipeline that applies retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to produce synthetic fallacy samples, which are then used to fine-tune an LLM model. Our results show substantial accuracy gains with fine-tuned models compared to vanilla baselines. For instance, the LLaMA 3.1 8B fine-tuned model achieved an over 35% F1-score absolute improvement on the MISSCI test split over its vanilla baseline. We demonstrate that introducing synthetic fallacy data to augment limited annotated resources can significantly enhance zero-shot LLM classification performance on real-world scientific misinformation tasks, even with limited computational resources.

  Current tool-use large language models (LLMs) are trained on static datasets, enabling them to interact with external tools and perform multi-step, tool-integrated reasoning, which produces tool-call trajectories. However, these models imitate how a query is resolved in a generic tool-call routine, thereby failing to explore possible solutions and demonstrating limited performance in an evolved, dynamic tool-call environment. In this work, we propose PORTool, a reinforcement learning (RL) method that encourages a tool-use LLM to explore various trajectories yielding the correct answer. Specifically, this method starts with generating multiple rollouts for a given query, and some of them share the first few tool-call steps, thereby forming a tree-like structure. Next, we assign rewards to each step, based on its ability to produce a correct answer and make successful tool calls. A shared step across different trajectories receives the same reward, while different steps under the same fork receive different rewards. Finally, these step-wise rewards are used to calculate fork-relative advantages, blended with trajectory-relative advantages, to train the LLM for tool use. The experiments utilize 17 tools to address user queries, covering both time-sensitive and time-invariant topics. We conduct ablation studies to systematically justify the necessity and the design robustness of step-wise rewards. Furthermore, we compare the proposed PORTool with other training approaches and demonstrate significant improvements in final accuracy and the number of tool-call steps.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with problems that require multi-step reasoning. For small-scale open-source models, Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) fails when correct solutions are rarely sampled even after many attempts, while Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) tends to overfit long demonstrations through rigid token-by-token imitation. To address this gap, we propose Supervised Reinforcement Learning (SRL), a framework that reformulates problem solving as generating a sequence of logical "actions". SRL trains the model to generate an internal reasoning monologue before committing to each action. It provides smoother rewards based on the similarity between the model's actions and expert actions extracted from the SFT dataset in a step-wise manner. This supervision offers richer learning signals even when all rollouts are incorrect, while encouraging flexible reasoning guided by expert demonstrations. As a result, SRL enables small models to learn challenging problems previously unlearnable by SFT or RLVR. Moreover, initializing training with SRL before refining with RLVR yields the strongest overall performance. Beyond reasoning benchmarks, SRL generalizes effectively to agentic software engineering tasks, establishing it as a robust and versatile training framework for reasoning-oriented LLMs.

  The impact of different multilingual data mixtures in pretraining large language models (LLMs) has been a topic of ongoing debate, often raising concerns about potential trade-offs between language coverage and model performance (i.e., the curse of multilinguality). In this work, we investigate these assumptions by training 1.1B and 3B parameter LLMs on diverse multilingual corpora, varying the number of languages from 25 to 400. Our study challenges common beliefs surrounding multilingual training. First, we find that combining English and multilingual data does not necessarily degrade the in-language performance of either group, provided that languages have a sufficient number of tokens included in the pretraining corpus. Second, we observe that using English as a pivot language (i.e., a high-resource language that serves as a catalyst for multilingual generalization) yields benefits across language families, and contrary to expectations, selecting a pivot language from within a specific family does not consistently improve performance for languages within that family. Lastly, we do not observe a significant "curse of multilinguality" as the number of training languages increases in models at this scale. Our findings suggest that multilingual data, when balanced appropriately, can enhance language model capabilities without compromising performance, even in low-resource settings

  Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed with task-specific adapters catering to multiple downstream applications. In such a scenario, the additional compute associated with these apparently insignificant number of adapter parameters (typically less than 1% of the base model) turns out to be disproportionately significant during inference time (upto 2.5x times that of the base model). In this paper, we propose a new zero-latency fused low-rank adapter (zFLoRA) that introduces zero or negligible latency overhead on top of the base model. Experimental results on LLMs of size 1B, 3B and 7B show that zFLoRA compares favorably against the popular supervised fine-tuning benchmarks including low-rank adapters (LoRA) as well as full fine-tuning (FFT). Experiments are conducted on 18 different tasks across three different categories namely commonsense reasoning, math reasoning and summary-dialogue. Latency measurements made on NPU (Samsung Galaxy S25+) as well as GPU (NVIDIA H100) platforms show that the proposed zFLoRA adapters introduce zero to negligible latency overhead.

  In aphasia research, Speech-Language Pathologists (SLPs) devote extensive time to manually coding speech samples using Correct Information Units (CIUs), a measure of how informative an individual sample of speech is. Developing automated systems to recognize aphasic language is limited by data scarcity. For example, only about 600 transcripts are available in AphasiaBank yet billions of tokens are used to train large language models (LLMs). In the broader field of machine learning (ML), researchers increasingly turn to synthetic data when such are sparse. Therefore, this study constructs and validates two methods to generate synthetic transcripts of the AphasiaBank Cat Rescue picture description task. One method leverages a procedural programming approach while the second uses Mistral 7b Instruct and Llama 3.1 8b Instruct LLMs. The methods generate transcripts across four severity levels (Mild, Moderate, Severe, Very Severe) through word dropping, filler insertion, and paraphasia substitution. Overall, we found, compared to human-elicited transcripts, Mistral 7b Instruct best captures key aspects of linguistic degradation observed in aphasia, showing realistic directional changes in NDW, word count, and word length amongst the synthetic generation methods. Based on the results, future work should plan to create a larger dataset, fine-tune models for better aphasic representation, and have SLPs assess the realism and usefulness of the synthetic transcripts.

  Jailbreaks are adversarial attacks designed to bypass the built-in safety mechanisms of large language models. Automated jailbreaks typically optimize an adversarial suffix or adapt long prompt templates by forcing the model to generate the initial part of a restricted or harmful response. In this work, we show that existing jailbreak attacks that leverage such mechanisms to unlock the model response can be detected by a straightforward perplexity-based filtering on the input prompt. To overcome this issue, we propose LatentBreak, a white-box jailbreak attack that generates natural adversarial prompts with low perplexity capable of evading such defenses. LatentBreak substitutes words in the input prompt with semantically-equivalent ones, preserving the initial intent of the prompt, instead of adding high-perplexity adversarial suffixes or long templates. These words are chosen by minimizing the distance in the latent space between the representation of the adversarial prompt and that of harmless requests. Our extensive evaluation shows that LatentBreak leads to shorter and low-perplexity prompts, thus outperforming competing jailbreak algorithms against perplexity-based filters on multiple safety-aligned models.

  Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) and Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) are the main RL paradigms used in LLM post-training, each offering distinct advantages. However, RLHF struggles with interpretability and reward hacking because it relies on human judgments that usually lack explicit criteria, whereas RLVR is limited in scope by its focus on correctness-based verifiers. We propose Reinforcement Learning with Binary Flexible Feedback (RLBFF), which combines the versatility of human-driven preferences with the precision of rule-based verification, enabling reward models to capture nuanced aspects of response quality beyond mere correctness. RLBFF extracts principles that can be answered in a binary fashion (e.g. accuracy of information: yes, or code readability: no) from natural language feedback. Such principles can then be used to ground Reward Model training as an entailment task (response satisfies or does not satisfy an arbitrary principle). We show that Reward Models trained in this manner can outperform Bradley-Terry models when matched for data and achieve top performance on RM-Bench (86.2%) and JudgeBench (81.4%, #1 on leaderboard as of September 24, 2025). Additionally, users can specify principles of interest at inference time to customize the focus of our reward models, in contrast to Bradley-Terry models. Finally, we present a fully open source recipe (including data) to align Qwen3-32B using RLBFF and our Reward Model, to match or exceed the performance of o3-mini and DeepSeek R1 on general alignment benchmarks of MT-Bench, WildBench, and Arena Hard v2 (at <5% of the inference cost).

  Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) using diverse datasets is crucial for enhancing their overall performance across various domains. In practical scenarios, existing methods based on modeling the mixture proportions of data composition often struggle with data whose domain labels are missing, imprecise or non-normalized, while methods based on data selection usually encounter difficulties in balancing multi-domain performance. To address these challenges, in this work, we investigate the role of data diversity in enhancing the overall abilities of LLMs by empirically constructing contrastive data pools and theoretically deriving explanations. Building upon the insights gained, we propose a new method that gives the LLM a dual identity: an output model to cognitively probe and select data based on diversity reward, as well as an input model to be tuned with the selected data. Extensive experiments show that the proposed method notably boosts performance across domain-undetermined data and a series of foundational downstream tasks when applied to various advanced LLMs. We release our code and hope this study can shed light on the understanding of data diversity and advance feedback-driven data-model co-design for LLMs.

  Despite the remarkable success of Large Language Models (LLMs), evaluating their outputs' quality regarding preference remains a critical challenge. While existing works usually leverage a strong LLM as the judge for comparing LLMs' response pairwisely, such a single-evaluator approach is vulnerable to cyclic preference, i.e., output A is better than B, B than C, but C is better than A, causing contradictory evaluation results. To address this, we introduce PGED (Preference Graph Ensemble and Denoise), a novel approach that leverages multiple model-based evaluators to construct preference graphs, and then ensembles and denoises these graphs for acyclic, non-contradictory evaluation results. We provide theoretical guarantees for our framework, demonstrating its efficacy in recovering the ground truth preference structure. Extensive experiments on ten benchmarks demonstrate PGED 's superiority in three applications: 1) model ranking for evaluation, 2) response selection for test-time scaling, and 3) data selection for model fine-tuning. Notably, PGED combines small LLM evaluators (e.g., Llama3-8B, Mistral-7B, Qwen2-7B) to outperform strong ones (e.g., Qwen2-72B), showcasing its effectiveness in enhancing evaluation reliability and improving model performance.

  As coding agents are increasingly deployed in large codebases, the need to automatically design challenging, codebase-level evaluation is central. We propose Gistify, a task where a coding LLM must create a single, minimal, self-contained file that can reproduce a specific functionality of a codebase. The coding LLM is given full access to a codebase along with a specific entrypoint (e.g., a python command), and the generated file must replicate the output of the same command ran under the full codebase, while containing only the essential components necessary to execute the provided command. Success on Gistify requires both structural understanding of the codebase, accurate modeling of its execution flow as well as the ability to produce potentially large code patches. Our findings show that current state-of-the-art models struggle to reliably solve Gistify tasks, especially ones with long executions traces.

  We present AMO-Bench, an Advanced Mathematical reasoning benchmark with Olympiad level or even higher difficulty, comprising 50 human-crafted problems. Existing benchmarks have widely leveraged high school math competitions for evaluating mathematical reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, many existing math competitions are becoming less effective for assessing top-tier LLMs due to performance saturation (e.g., AIME24/25). To address this, AMO-Bench introduces more rigorous challenges by ensuring all 50 problems are (1) cross-validated by experts to meet at least the International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) difficulty standards, and (2) entirely original problems to prevent potential performance leakages from data memorization. Moreover, each problem in AMO-Bench requires only a final answer rather than a proof, enabling automatic and robust grading for evaluation. Experimental results across 26 LLMs on AMO-Bench show that even the best-performing model achieves only 52.4% accuracy on AMO-Bench, with most LLMs scoring below 40%. Beyond these poor performances, our further analysis reveals a promising scaling trend with increasing test-time compute on AMO-Bench. These results highlight the significant room for improving the mathematical reasoning in current LLMs. We release AMO-Bench to facilitate further research into advancing the reasoning abilities of language models.this https URL

  The "end-to-end" label for LLMs is a misnomer. In practice, they depend on a non-differentiable decoding process that requires laborious, hand-tuning of hyperparameters like temperature and top-p. This paper introduces AutoDeco, a novel architecture that enables truly "end-to-end" generation by learning to control its own decoding strategy. We augment the standard transformer with lightweight heads that, at each step, dynamically predict context-specific temperature and top-p values alongside the next-token logits. This approach transforms decoding into a parametric, token-level process, allowing the model to self-regulate its sampling strategy within a single forward pass.Through extensive experiments on eight benchmarks, we demonstrate that AutoDeco not only significantly outperforms default decoding strategies but also achieves performance comparable to an oracle-tuned baseline derived from "hacking the test set"-a practical upper bound for any static method. Crucially, we uncover an emergent capability for instruction-based decoding control: the model learns to interpret natural language commands (e.g., "generate with low randomness") and adjusts its predicted temperature and top-p on a token-by-token basis, opening a new paradigm for steerable and interactive LLM decoding.

  Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities across multiple domains by leveraging massive pre-training and curated fine-tuning data. However, in data-sensitive fields such as healthcare, the lack of high-quality, domain-specific training corpus hinders LLMs' adaptation for specialized applications. Meanwhile, domain experts have distilled domain wisdom into ontology rules, which formalize relationships among concepts and ensure the integrity of knowledge management repositories. Viewing LLMs as implicit repositories of human knowledge, we propose Evontree, a novel framework that leverages a small set of high-quality ontology rules to systematically extract, validate, and enhance domain knowledge within LLMs, without requiring extensive external datasets. Specifically, Evontree extracts domain ontology from raw models, detects inconsistencies using two core ontology rules, and reinforces the refined knowledge via self-distilled fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on medical QA benchmarks with Llama3-8B-Instruct and Med42-v2 demonstrate consistent outperformance over both unmodified models and leading supervised baselines, achieving up to a 3.7% improvement in accuracy. These results confirm the effectiveness, efficiency, and robustness of our approach for low-resource domain adaptation of LLMs.

  Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is a promising approach for enhancing agentic deep search. However, its application is often hindered by low \textbf{Reward Density} in deep search scenarios, where agents expend significant exploratory costs for infrequent and often null final rewards. In this paper, we formalize this challenge as the \textbf{Reward Density Optimization} problem, which aims to improve the reward obtained per unit of exploration cost. This paper introduce \textbf{InfoFlow}, a systematic framework that tackles this problem from three aspects. 1) \textbf{Subproblem decomposition}: breaking down long-range tasks to assign process rewards, thereby providing denser learning signals. 2) \textbf{Failure-guided hints}: injecting corrective guidance into stalled trajectories to increase the probability of successful outcomes. 3) \textbf{Dual-agent refinement}: employing a dual-agent architecture to offload the cognitive burden of deep exploration. A refiner agent synthesizes the search history, which effectively compresses the researcher's perceived trajectory, thereby reducing exploration cost and increasing the overall reward density. We evaluate InfoFlow on multiple agentic search benchmarks, where it significantly outperforms strong baselines, enabling lightweight LLMs to achieve performance comparable to advanced proprietary LLMs.

  Large language models (LLMs) continue to advance, with an increasing number of domain-specific variants tailored for specialised tasks. However, these models often lack transparency and explainability, can be costly to fine-tune, require substantial prompt engineering, yield inconsistent results across domains, and impose significant adverse environmental impact due to their high computational demands. To address these challenges, we propose the Bayesian network LLM fusion (BNLF) framework, which integrates predictions from three LLMs, including FinBERT, RoBERTa, and BERTweet, through a probabilistic mechanism for sentiment analysis. BNLF performs late fusion by modelling the sentiment predictions from multiple LLMs as probabilistic nodes within a Bayesian network. Evaluated across three human-annotated financial corpora with distinct linguistic and contextual characteristics, BNLF demonstrates consistent gains of about six percent in accuracy over the baseline LLMs, underscoring its robustness to dataset variability and the effectiveness of probabilistic fusion for interpretable sentiment classification.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at general tasks but underperform in specialized domains like economics and psychology, which require deep, principled understanding. To address this, we introduce ACER (Automated Curriculum-Enhanced Regimen) that transforms generalist models into domain experts without sacrificing their broad capabilities. ACER first synthesizes a comprehensive, textbook-style curriculum by generating a table of contents for a subject and then creating question-answer (QA) pairs guided by Bloom's taxonomy. This ensures systematic topic coverage and progressively increasing difficulty. The resulting synthetic corpus is used for continual pretraining with an interleaved curriculum schedule, aligning learning across both content and cognitive dimensions.Experiments with Llama 3.2 (1B and 3B) show significant gains in specialized MMLU subsets. In challenging domains like microeconomics, where baselines struggle, ACER boosts accuracy by 5 percentage points. Across all target domains, we observe a consistent macro-average improvement of 3 percentage points. Notably, ACER not only prevents catastrophic forgetting but also facilitates positive cross-domain knowledge transfer, improving performance on non-target domains by 0.7 points. Beyond MMLU, ACER enhances performance on knowledge-intensive benchmarks like ARC and GPQA by over 2 absolute points, while maintaining stable performance on general reasoning tasks. Our results demonstrate that ACER offers a scalable and effective recipe for closing critical domain gaps in LLMs.

  OpenAI's ChatGPT Atlas introduces new capabilities for web interaction, enabling the model to analyze webpages, process user intents, and execute cursor and keyboard inputs directly within the browser. While its capacity for information retrieval tasks has been demonstrated, its performance in dynamic, interactive environments remains less explored. In this study, we conduct an early evaluation of Atlas's web interaction capabilities using browser-based games as test scenarios, including Google's T-Rex Runner, Sudoku, Flappy Bird, andthis http URL. We employ in-game performance scores as quantitative metrics to assess performance across different task types. Our results show that Atlas performs strongly in logical reasoning tasks like Sudoku, completing puzzles significantly faster than human baselines, but struggles substantially in real-time games requiring precise timing and motor control, often failing to progress beyond initial obstacles. These findings suggest that while Atlas demonstrates capable analytical processing, there remain notable limitations in dynamic web environments requiring real-time interaction.

  Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as a leading approach to reducing hallucinations in large language models (LLMs). Current RAG evaluation benchmarks primarily focus on what we call local RAG: retrieving relevant chunks from a small subset of documents to answer queries that require only localized understanding within specific text chunks. However, many real-world applications require a fundamentally different capability -- global RAG -- which involves aggregating and analyzing information across entire document collections to derive corpus-level insights (for example, "What are the top 10 most cited papers in 2023?"). In this paper, we introduce GlobalQA -- the first benchmark specifically designed to evaluate global RAG capabilities, covering four core task types: counting, extremum queries, sorting, and top-k extraction. Through systematic evaluation across different models and baselines, we find that existing RAG methods perform poorly on global tasks, with the strongest baseline achieving only 1.51 F1 score. To address these challenges, we propose GlobalRAG, a multi-tool collaborative framework that preserves structural coherence through chunk-level retrieval, incorporates LLM-driven intelligent filters to eliminate noisy documents, and integrates aggregation modules for precise symbolic computation. On the Qwen2.5-14B model, GlobalRAG achieves 6.63 F1 compared to the strongest baseline's 1.51 F1, validating the effectiveness of our method.

  Cross-lingual alignment (CLA) aims to align multilingual representations, enabling Large Language Models (LLMs) to seamlessly transfer knowledge across languages. While intuitive, we hypothesize, this pursuit of representational convergence can inadvertently cause "cultural erasure", the functional loss of providing culturally-situated responses that should diverge based on the query language. In this work, we systematically analyze this trade-off by introducing a holistic evaluation framework, the transfer-localization plane, which quantifies both desirable knowledge transfer and undesirable cultural erasure. Using this framework, we re-evaluate recent CLA approaches and find that they consistently improve factual transfer at the direct cost of cultural localization across all six languages studied. Our investigation into the internal representations of these models reveals a key insight: universal factual transfer and culturally-specific knowledge are optimally steerable at different model layers. Based on this finding, we propose Surgical Steering, a novel inference-time method that disentangles these two objectives. By applying targeted activation steering to distinct layers, our approach achieves a better balance between the two competing dimensions, effectively overcoming the limitations of current alignment techniques.

  The use of LLM-based applications as a means to accelerate and/or substitute human labor in the creation of language resources and dataset is a reality. Nonetheless, despite the potential of such tools for linguistic research, comprehensive evaluation of their performance and impact on the creation of annotated datasets, especially under a perspectivized approach to NLP, is still missing. This paper contributes to reduction of this gap by reporting on an extensive evaluation of the (semi-)automatization of FrameNet-like semantic annotation by the use of an LLM-based semantic role labeler. The methodology employed compares annotation time, coverage and diversity in three experimental settings: manual, automatic and semi-automatic annotation. Results show that the hybrid, semi-automatic annotation setting leads to increased frame diversity and similar annotation coverage, when compared to the human-only setting, while the automatic setting performs considerably worse in all metrics, except for annotation time.

  The rapid advancement of large language models(LLMs) has intensified the need for domain and culture specific evaluation. Existing benchmarks are largely Anglocentric and domain-agnostic, limiting their applicability to India-centric contexts. To address this gap, we introduce BhashaBench V1, the first domain-specific, multi-task, bilingual benchmark focusing on critical Indic knowledge systems. BhashaBench V1 contains 74,166 meticulously curated question-answer pairs, with 52,494 in English and 21,672 in Hindi, sourced from authentic government and domain-specific exams. It spans four major domains: Agriculture, Legal, Finance, and Ayurveda, comprising 90+ subdomains and covering 500+ topics, enabling fine-grained evaluation. Evaluation of 29+ LLMs reveals significant domain and language specific performance gaps, with especially large disparities in low-resource domains. For instance, GPT-4o achieves 76.49% overall accuracy in Legal but only 59.74% in Ayurveda. Models consistently perform better on English content compared to Hindi across all domains. Subdomain-level analysis shows that areas such as Cyber Law, International Finance perform relatively well, while Panchakarma, Seed Science, and Human Rights remain notably weak. BhashaBench V1 provides a comprehensive dataset for evaluating large language models across India's diverse knowledge domains. It enables assessment of models' ability to integrate domain-specific knowledge with bilingual understanding. All code, benchmarks, and resources are publicly available to support open research.

  _Cameron Berg, Diogo de Lucena, Judd Rosenblatt_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models sometimes produce structured, first-person descriptions that explicitly reference awareness or subjective experience. To better understand this behavior, we investigate one theoretically motivated condition under which such reports arise: self-referential processing, a computational motif emphasized across major theories of consciousness. Through a series of controlled experiments on GPT, Claude, and Gemini model families, we test whether this regime reliably shifts models toward first-person reports of subjective experience, and how such claims behave under mechanistic and behavioral probes. Four main results emerge: (1) Inducing sustained self-reference through simple prompting consistently elicits structured subjective experience reports across model families. (2) These reports are mechanistically gated by interpretable sparse-autoencoder features associated with deception and roleplay: surprisingly, suppressing deception features sharply increases the frequency of experience claims, while amplifying them minimizes such claims. (3) Structured descriptions of the self-referential state converge statistically across model families in ways not observed in any control condition. (4) The induced state yields significantly richer introspection in downstream reasoning tasks where self-reflection is only indirectly afforded. While these findings do not constitute direct evidence of consciousness, they implicate self-referential processing as a minimal and reproducible condition under which large language models generate structured first-person reports that are mechanistically gated, semantically convergent, and behaviorally generalizable. The systematic emergence of this pattern across architectures makes it a first-order scientific and ethical priority for further investigation.

  Human cognition is theorized to operate in two modes: fast, intuitive System 1 thinking and slow, deliberate System 2 thinking. While current Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) excel at System 2 thinking, their inability to perform fast thinking leads to high computational overhead and latency. In this work, we enable LRMs to approximate human intelligence through dynamic thinking speed adjustment, optimizing accuracy-efficiency trade-offs. Our approach addresses two key questions: (1) how to control thinking speed in LRMs, and (2) when to adjust it for optimal performance. For the first question, we identify the steering vector that governs slow-fast thinking transitions in LRMs' representation space. Using this vector, we achieve the first representation editing-based test-time scaling effect, outperforming existing prompt-based scaling methods. For the second question, we apply real-time difficulty estimation to signal reasoning segments of varying complexity. Combining these techniques, we propose the first reasoning strategy that enables fast processing of easy steps and deeper analysis for complex reasoning. Without any training or additional cost, our plug-in module delivers an average +1.3% accuracy with -8.6% token usage across leading LRMs and advanced reasoning benchmarks. All of our algorithms are implemented based on vLLM and are expected to support broader applications and inspire future research.

  Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities across tasks such as mathematics, coding, and reasoning, yet their learning ability, which is crucial for adapting to dynamic environments and acquiring new knowledge, remains underexplored. In this work, we address this gap by introducing a framework inspired by cognitive psychology and education. Specifically, we decompose general learning ability into three distinct, complementary dimensions: Learning from Instructor (acquiring knowledge via explicit guidance), Learning from Concept (internalizing abstract structures and generalizing to new contexts), and Learning from Experience (adapting through accumulated exploration and feedback). We conduct a comprehensive empirical study across the three learning dimensions and identify several insightful findings, such as (i) interaction improves learning; (ii) conceptual understanding is scale-emergent and benefits larger models; and (iii) LLMs are effective few-shot learners but not many-shot learners. Based on our framework and empirical findings, we introduce a benchmark that provides a unified and realistic evaluation of LLMs' general learning abilities across three learning cognition dimensions. It enables diagnostic insights and supports evaluation and development of more adaptive and human-like models.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Sarcasm is a challenge to sentiment analysis because of the incongruity between stated and implied sentiment. The challenge is exacerbated when the implication may be relevant to a specific country or geographical region. Pragmatic metacognitive prompting (PMP) is a cognition-inspired technique that has been used for pragmatic reasoning. In this paper, we harness PMP for explainable sarcasm detection for Australian and Indian English, alongside a benchmark dataset for standard English. We manually add sarcasm explanations to an existing sarcasm-labeled dataset for Australian and Indian English called BESSTIE, and compare the performance for explainable sarcasm detection for them with FLUTE, a standard English dataset containing sarcasm explanations. Our approach utilising PMP when evaluated on two open-weight LLMs (GEMMA and LLAMA) achieves statistically significant performance improvement across all tasks and datasets when compared with four alternative prompting strategies. We also find that alternative techniques such as agentic prompting mitigate context-related failures by enabling external knowledge retrieval. The focused contribution of our work is utilising PMP in generating sarcasm explanations for varieties of English.

  The use of language models for automatically evaluating long-form text (LLM-as-a-judge) is becoming increasingly common, yet most LLM judges are optimized exclusively for English, with strategies for enhancing their multilingual evaluation capabilities remaining largely unexplored in the current literature. This has created a disparity in the quality of automatic evaluation methods for non-English languages, ultimately hindering the development of models with better multilingual capabilities. To bridge this gap, we introduce M-Prometheus, a suite of open-weight LLM judges ranging from 3B to 14B parameters that can provide both direct assessment and pairwise comparison feedback on multilingual outputs. M-Prometheus models outperform state-of-the-art open LLM judges on multilingual reward benchmarks spanning more than 20 languages, as well as on literary machine translation (MT) evaluation covering 4 language pairs. Furthermore, M-Prometheus models can be leveraged at decoding time to significantly improve generated outputs across all 3 tested languages, showcasing their utility for the development of better multilingual models. Lastly, through extensive ablations, we identify the key factors for obtaining an effective multilingual judge, including backbone model selection and training on synthetic multilingual feedback data instead of translated data. We release our models, training dataset, and code.

  To recognize and mitigate the harms of generative AI systems, it is crucial to consider who is represented in the outputs of generative AI systems and how people are represented. A critical gap emerges when naively improving who is represented, as this does not imply bias mitigation efforts have been applied to address how people are represented. We critically examined this by investigating gender representation in occupation across state-of-the-art large language models. We first show evidence suggesting that over time there have been interventions to models altering the resulting gender distribution, and we find that women are more represented than men when models are prompted to generate biographies or personas. We then demonstrate that representational biases persist in how different genders are represented by examining statistically significant word differences across genders. This results in a proliferation of representational harms, stereotypes, and neoliberalism ideals that, despite existing interventions to increase female representation, reinforce existing systems of oppression.

  Dialogue State Tracking (DST) is a key part of task-oriented dialogue systems, identifying important information in conversations. However, its accuracy drops significantly in spoken dialogue environments due to named entity errors from Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems. We introduce a simple yet effective data augmentation method that targets those entities to improve the robustness of DST model. Our novel method can control the placement of errors using keyword-highlighted prompts while introducing phonetically similar errors. As a result, our method generated sufficient error patterns on keywords, leading to improved accuracy in noised and low-accuracy ASR environments.

  Recent large language model (LLM) research has undergone an architectural shift from encoder-decoder modeling to nowadays the dominant decoder-only modeling. This rapid transition, however, comes without a rigorous comparative analysis especially \textit{from the scaling perspective}, raising concerns that the potential of encoder-decoder models may have been overlooked. To fill this gap, we revisit encoder-decoder LLM (RedLLM), enhancing it with recent recipes from decoder-only LLM (DecLLM). We conduct a comprehensive comparison between RedLLM, pretrained with prefix language modeling (LM), and DecLLM, pretrained with causal LM, at different model scales, ranging from $\sim$150M to $\sim$8B. Using RedPajama V1 (1.6T tokens) for pretraining and FLAN for instruction tuning, our experiments show that RedLLM produces compelling scaling properties and surprisingly strong performance. While DecLLM is overall more compute-optimal during pretraining, RedLLM demonstrates comparable scaling and context length extrapolation capabilities. After instruction tuning, RedLLM achieves comparable and even better results on various downstream tasks while enjoying substantially better inference efficiency. We hope our findings could inspire more efforts on re-examining RedLLM, unlocking its potential for developing powerful and efficient LLMs.

  Multi-page visual documents such as manuals, brochures, presentations, and posters convey key information through layout, colors, icons, and cross-slide references. While large language models (LLMs) offer opportunities in document understanding, current systems struggle with complex, multi-page visual documents, particularly in fine-grained reasoning over elements and pages. We introduce SlideAgent, a versatile agentic framework for understanding multi-modal, multi-page, and multi-layout documents, especially slide decks. SlideAgent employs specialized agents and decomposes reasoning into three specialized levels-global, page, and element-to construct a structured, query-agnostic representation that captures both overarching themes and detailed visual or textual cues. During inference, SlideAgent selectively activates specialized agents for multi-level reasoning and integrates their outputs into coherent, context-aware answers. Extensive experiments show that SlideAgent achieves significant improvement over both proprietary (+7.9 overall) and open-source models (+9.8 overall).

  Purpose: The purpose of this study was to determine if an ensemble of multiple LLM agents could be used collectively to provide a more reliable assessment of a pixel-based AI triage tool than a single LLM.Methods: 29,766 non-contrast CT head exams from fourteen hospitals were processed by a commercial intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) AI detection tool. Radiology reports were analyzed by an ensemble of eight open-source LLM models and a HIPAA compliant internal version of GPT-4o using a single multi-shot prompt that assessed for presence of ICH. 1,726 examples were manually reviewed. Performance characteristics of the eight open-source models and consensus were compared to GPT-4o. Three ideal consensus LLM ensembles were tested for rating the performance of the triage tool.Results: The cohort consisted of 29,766 head CTs exam-report pairs. The highest AUC performance was achieved with llama3.3:70b and GPT-4o (AUC= 0.78). The average precision was highest for Llama3.3:70b and GPT-4o (AP=0.75 & 0.76). Llama3.3:70b had the highest F1 score (0.81) and recall (0.85), greater precision (0.78), specificity (0.72), and MCC (0.57). Using MCC (95% CI) the ideal combination of LLMs were: Full-9 Ensemble 0.571 (0.552-0.591), Top-3 Ensemble 0.558 (0.537-0.579), Consensus 0.556 (0.539-0.574), and GPT4o 0.522 (0.500-0.543). No statistically significant differences were observed between Top-3, Full-9, and Consensus (p > 0.05).Conclusion: An ensemble of medium to large sized open-source LLMs provides a more consistent and reliable method to derive a ground truth retrospective evaluation of a clinical AI triage tool over a single LLM alone.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in language comprehension and generation; however, their widespread adoption is constrained by substantial bandwidth and computational demands. While pruning and low-rank approximation have each demonstrated promising performance individually, their synergy for LLMs remains underexplored. We introduce \underline{S}ynergistic \underline{S}parse and \underline{L}ow-Rank \underline{C}ompression (SSLC) methods for LLMs, which leverages the strengths of both techniques: low-rank approximation compresses the model by retaining its essential structure with minimal information loss, whereas sparse optimization eliminates non-essential weights, preserving those crucial for generalization. Based on theoretical analysis, we first formulate the low-rank approximation and sparse optimization as a unified problem and solve it by iterative optimization algorithm. Experiments on LLaMA and Qwen2.5 models (7B-70B) show that SSLC, without any additional training steps, consistently surpasses standalone methods, achieving state-of-the-arts results. Notably, SSLC compresses Qwen2.5 by 50\% with no performance drop and achieves at least 1.63$\times$ speedup, offering a practical solution for efficient LLM deployment.

  With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs), various LLM-based works have been widely applied in educational fields. However, most existing LLMs and their benchmarks focus primarily on the knowledge dimension, largely neglecting the evaluation of cultivation capabilities that are essential for real-world educational scenarios. Additionally, current benchmarks are often limited to a single subject or question type, lacking sufficient diversity. This issue is particularly prominent within the Chinese context. To address this gap, we introduce OmniEduBench, a comprehensive Chinese educational benchmark. OmniEduBench consists of 24.602K high-quality question-answer pairs. The data is meticulously divided into two core dimensions: the knowledge dimension and the cultivation dimension, which contain 18.121K and 6.481K entries, respectively. Each dimension is further subdivided into 6 fine-grained categories, covering a total of 61 different subjects (41 in the knowledge and 20 in the cultivation). Furthermore, the dataset features a rich variety of question formats, including 11 common exam question types, providing a solid foundation for comprehensively evaluating LLMs' capabilities in education. Extensive experiments on 11 mainstream open-source and closed-source LLMs reveal a clear performance gap. In the knowledge dimension, only Gemini-2.5 Pro surpassed 60\% accuracy, while in the cultivation dimension, the best-performing model, QWQ, still trailed human intelligence by nearly 30\%. These results highlight the substantial room for improvement and underscore the challenges of applying LLMs in education.

A first step towards this objective is to examine the task of inferring discourse structure in scientific writing.In this work, we present a preliminary investigation of pretrained language model (PLM) and Large Language Model (LLM) approaches for Discourse Relation Classification (DRC), focusing on scientific publications, an under-studied genre for this task. We examine how context can help with the DRC task, with our experiments showing that context, as defined by discourse structure, is generally helpful. We also present an analysis of which scientific discourse relation types might benefit most from context.

  Language models can be used to provide interactive, personalized student feedback in educational settings. However, real-world deployment faces three key challenges: privacy concerns, limited computational resources, and the need for pedagogically valid responses. These constraints require small, open-source models that can run locally and reliably ground their outputs in correct information. We introduce SCRIBE, a framework for multi-hop, tool-augmented reasoning designed to generate valid responses to student questions about feedback reports. SCRIBE combines domain-specific tools with a self-reflective inference pipeline that supports iterative reasoning, tool use, and error recovery. We distil these capabilities into 3B and 8B models via two-stage LoRA fine-tuning on synthetic GPT-4o-generated data. Evaluation with a human-aligned GPT-Judge and a user study with 108 students shows that 8B-SCRIBE models achieve comparable or superior quality to much larger models in key dimensions such as relevance and actionability, while being perceived on par with GPT-4o and Llama-3.3 70B by students. These findings demonstrate the viability of SCRIBE for low-resource, privacy-sensitive educational applications.

  Large language models (LLMs) commonly boost reasoning via sample-evaluate-ensemble decoders, achieving label free gains without ground truth. However, prevailing strategies score candidates using only external outputs such as token probabilities, entropies, or self evaluations, and these signals can be poorly calibrated after post training. We instead analyze internal behavior based on neuron activations and uncover three findings: (1) external signals are low dimensional projections of richer internal dynamics; (2) correct responses activate substantially fewer unique neurons than incorrect ones throughout generation; and (3) activations from correct responses exhibit stronger cross sample agreement, whereas incorrect ones diverge. Motivated by these observations, we propose Neuron Agreement Decoding (NAD), an unsupervised best-of-N method that selects candidates using activation sparsity and cross sample neuron agreement, operating solely on internal signals and without requiring comparable textual outputs. NAD enables early correctness prediction within the first 32 generated tokens and supports aggressive early stopping. Across math and science benchmarks with verifiable answers, NAD matches majority voting; on open ended coding benchmarks where majority voting is inapplicable, NAD consistently outperforms Avg@64. By pruning unpromising trajectories early, NAD reduces token usage by 99% with minimal loss in generation quality, showing that internal signals provide reliable, scalable, and efficient guidance for label free ensemble decoding.

  _M√©rilin Sousa Silva, Sina Ahmadi_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Throughout language history, words are borrowed from one language to another and gradually become integrated into the recipient's lexicon. Speakers can often differentiate these loanwords from native vocabulary, particularly in bilingual communities where a dominant language continuously imposes lexical items on a minority language. This paper investigates whether pretrained language models, including large language models, possess similar capabilities for loanword identification. We evaluate multiple models across 10 languages. Despite explicit instructions and contextual information, our results show that models perform poorly in distinguishing loanwords from native ones. These findings corroborate previous evidence that modern NLP systems exhibit a bias toward loanwords rather than native equivalents. Our work has implications for developing NLP tools for minority languages and supporting language preservation in communities under lexical pressure from dominant languages.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The ability to accurately interpret implied meanings plays a crucial role in human communication and language use, and language models are also expected to possess this capability. This study demonstrates that providing language models with pragmatic theories as prompts is an effective in-context learning approach for tasks to understand implied meanings. Specifically, we propose an approach in which an overview of pragmatic theories, such as Gricean pragmatics and Relevance Theory, is presented as a prompt to the language model, guiding it through a step-by-step reasoning process to derive a final interpretation. Experimental results showed that, compared to the baseline, which prompts intermediate reasoning without presenting pragmatic theories (0-shot Chain-of-Thought), our methods enabled language models to achieve up to 9.6\% higher scores on pragmatic reasoning tasks. Furthermore, we show that even without explaining the details of pragmatic theories, merely mentioning their names in the prompt leads to a certain performance improvement (around 1-3%) in larger models compared to the baseline.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Current LLM evaluations often rely on a single instruction template, overlooking models' sensitivity to instruction style-a critical aspect for real-world deployments. We present RCScore, a multi-dimensional framework quantifying how instruction formulation affects model responses. By systematically transforming benchmark problems into multiple instruction styles, RCScore reveals performance variations undetected by conventional metrics. Our experiments across ten LLMs on four reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that instruction style can shift accuracy by up to 16.7% points. We introduce Cross-Response Similarity (CRS), a method applying RCScore metrics to measure stylistic self-consistency, and establish its strong correlation with task accuracy, suggesting consistency as a valuable proxy for model reliability. Additional findings show that deterministic decoding produces more stylistically stable outputs, and model scale correlates positively with cross-style consistency. RCScore offers a principled approach to assess instruction robustness.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced generative applications in natural language processing (NLP). Recent trends in model architectures revolve around efficient variants of transformers or state-space/gated-recurrent models (SSMs, GRMs). However, prevailing SSM/GRM-based methods often emulate only a single attention head, potentially limiting their expressiveness. In this work, we propose MossNet, a novel mixture-of-state-space-experts architecture that emulates a linear multi-head attention (MHA). MossNet leverages a mixture-of-experts (MoE) implementation not only in channel-mixing multi-layered perceptron (MLP) blocks but also in the time-mixing SSM kernels to realize multiple "attention heads." Extensive experiments on language modeling and downstream evaluations show that MossNet outperforms both transformer- and SSM-based architectures of similar model size and data budgets. Larger variants of MossNet, trained on trillions of tokens, further confirm its scalability and superior performance. In addition, real-device profiling on a Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra and an Nvidia A100 GPU demonstrate favorable runtime speed and resource usage compared to similarly sized baselines. Our results suggest that MossNet is a compelling new direction for efficient, high-performing recurrent LLM architectures.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper investigates the relationship between Persuasion Techniques (PTs) and Discourse Relations (DRs) by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and prompt engineering. Since no dataset annotated with both PTs and DRs exists, we took the SemEval 2023 Task 3 dataset labelled with 19 PTs as a starting point and developed LLM-based classifiers to label each instance of the dataset with one of the 22 PDTB 3.0 level-2 DRs. In total, four LLMs were evaluated using 10 different prompts, resulting in 40 unique DR classifiers. Ensemble models using different majority-pooling strategies were used to create 5 silver datasets of instances labelled with both persuasion techniques and level-2 PDTB senses. The silver dataset sizes vary from 1,281 instances to 204 instances, depending on the majority pooling technique used. Statistical analysis of these silver datasets shows that six discourse relations (namely Cause, Purpose, Contrast, Cause+Belief, Concession, and Condition) play a crucial role in persuasive texts, especially in the use of Loaded Language, Exaggeration/Minimisation, Repetition and to cast Doubt. This insight can contribute to detecting online propaganda and misinformation, as well as to our general understanding of effective communication.

  While Test-Time Scaling (TTS) has proven effective in improving the reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs), low diversity in model outputs often becomes a bottleneck; this is partly caused by the common "one problem, one solution" (1P1S) training practice, which provides a single canonical answer and can push models toward a narrow set of reasoning paths. To address this, we propose a "one problem, multiple solutions" (1PNS) training paradigm that exposes the model to a variety of valid reasoning trajectories and thus increases inference diversity. A core challenge for 1PNS is reliably measuring semantic differences between multi-step chains of thought, so we introduce Reasoning Path Divergence (RPD), a step-level metric that aligns and scores Long Chain-of-Thought solutions to capture differences in intermediate reasoning. Using RPD, we curate maximally diverse solution sets per problem and fine-tune Qwen3-4B-Base. Experiments show that RPD-selected training yields more varied outputs and higher pass@k, with an average +2.80% gain in pass@16 over a strong 1P1S baseline and a +4.99% gain on AIME24, demonstrating that 1PNS further amplifies the effectiveness of TTS.

  AI accelerators, customized to AI workloads, provide cost-effective and high-performance solutions for training and inference. Trainium, an AI accelerator recently developed by Amazon Web Services (AWS), provides an attractive option for LLM training and inference through its heterogeneous architecture. However, leveraging Trainium architecture for high performance can be challenging because of its systolic array architecture and special requirement on data layout. In this paper, we design high-performance matrix multiplication (matmul), a critical compute kernel, for LLM inference on Trainium. We introduce a series of techniques customized to Trainium based on kernel fusion and novel caching strategies to reduce data movement across the software-managed memory hierarchy, maximize SRAM bandwidth, and avoid expensive matrix transpose. Evaluating with nine datasets and four recent LLMs, we show that our system largely outperforms the state-of-the-art matmul implemented by AWS on Trainium: at the level of matmul kernel, it achieves an average 1.35x speedup (up to 2.22x), which translates to an average 1.66x speedup (up to 2.49x) for end-to-end LLM inference.

  Machine Translation (MT) is widely employed to address resource scarcity in low-resource languages by generating synthetic data from high-resource counterparts. While sentiment preservation in translation has long been studied, a critical but underexplored factor is the role of cultural alignment between source and target languages. In this paper, we hypothesize that semantic labels are drifted or altered during MT due to cultural divergence. Through a series of experiments across culturally sensitive and neutral domains, we establish three key findings: (1) MT systems, including modern Large Language Models (LLMs), induce label drift during translation, particularly in culturally sensitive domains; (2) unlike earlier statistical MT tools, LLMs encode cultural knowledge, and leveraging this knowledge can amplify label drift; and (3) cultural similarity or dissimilarity between source and target languages is a crucial determinant of label preservation. Our findings highlight that neglecting cultural factors in MT not only undermines label fidelity but also risks misinterpretation and cultural conflict in downstream applications.

  If we cannot inspect the training data of a large language model (LLM), how can we ever know what it has seen? We believe the most compelling evidence arises when the model itself freely reproduces the target content. As such, we propose RECAP, an agentic pipeline designed to elicit and verify memorized training data from LLM outputs. At the heart of RECAP is a feedback-driven loop, where an initial extraction attempt is evaluated by a secondary language model, which compares the output against a reference passage and identifies discrepancies. These are then translated into minimal correction hints, which are fed back into the target model to guide subsequent generations. In addition, to address alignment-induced refusals, RECAP includes a jailbreaking module that detects and overcomes such barriers. We evaluate RECAP on EchoTrace, a new benchmark spanning over 30 full books, and the results show that RECAP leads to substantial gains over single-iteration approaches. For instance, with GPT-4.1, the average ROUGE-L score for the copyrighted text extraction improved from 0.38 to 0.47 - a nearly 24% increase.

  Post-training of Large Language Models (LLMs) is crucial for unlocking their task generalization potential and domain-specific capabilities. However, the current LLM post-training paradigm faces significant data challenges, including the high costs of manual annotation and diminishing marginal returns on data scales. Therefore, achieving data-efficient post-training has become a key research question. In this paper, we present the first systematic survey of data-efficient LLM post-training from a data-centric perspective. We propose a taxonomy of data-efficient LLM post-training methods, covering data selection, data quality enhancement, synthetic data generation, data distillation and compression, and self-evolving data ecosystems. We summarize representative approaches in each category and outline future research directions. By examining the challenges in data-efficient LLM post-training, we highlight open problems and propose potential research avenues. We hope our work inspires further exploration into maximizing the potential of data utilization in large-scale model training. Paper List:this https URL

  Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in content moderation systems, where ensuring fairness and neutrality is essential. In this study, we examine how persona adoption influences the consistency and fairness of harmful content classification across different LLM architectures, model sizes, and content modalities (language vs. vision). At first glance, headline performance metrics suggest that personas have little impact on overall classification accuracy. However, a closer analysis reveals important behavioral shifts. Personas with different ideological leanings display distinct propensities to label content as harmful, showing that the lens through which a model "views" input can subtly shape its judgments. Further agreement analyses highlight that models, particularly larger ones, tend to align more closely with personas from the same political ideology, strengthening within-ideology consistency while widening divergence across ideological groups. To show this effect more directly, we conducted an additional study on a politically targeted task, which confirmed that personas not only behave more coherently within their own ideology but also exhibit a tendency to defend their perspective while downplaying harmfulness in opposing views. Together, these findings highlight how persona conditioning can introduce subtle ideological biases into LLM outputs, raising concerns about the use of AI systems that may reinforce partisan perspectives under the guise of neutrality.

  Long-context language models unlock advanced capabilities in reasoning, code generation, and document summarization by leveraging dependencies across extended spans of text. However, a significant portion of readily available long-text data lacks meaningful long-distance dependencies; most spans can be predicted using only local context. Training on such data is inefficient, making careful data selection crucial. Therefore, we introduce LongFilter, a framework for curating training data tailored to long-context pretraining. LongFilter measures the information gain provided by extended context by contrasting model predictions under long-context versus short-context settings, thereby identifying samples where long-range dependencies are essential. Experiments with LLaMA-3-8B, extending its context length from 8K to 64K, show that LongFilter efficiently selects high-quality data and yields substantial improvements on benchmarks such as HELMET, LongBench, and RULER.

  Human experts often struggle to select the best option from a large set of items with multiple competing objectives, a process bottlenecked by the difficulty of formalizing complex, implicit preferences. To address this, we introduce LISTEN, a framework that leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) as a zero-shot preference oracle, guided only by an expert's high-level priorities in natural language. To operate within LLM constraints like context windows and inference costs, we propose two iterative algorithms: LISTEN-U, which uses the LLM to refine a parametric utility function, and LISTEN-T, a non-parametric method that performs tournament-style selections over small batches of solutions. Evaluated on diverse tasks including flight booking, shopping, and exam scheduling, our results show LISTEN-U excels when preferences are parametrically aligned (a property we measure with a novel concordance metric), while LISTEN-T offers more robust performance. This work explores a promising direction for steering complex multi-objective decisions directly with natural language, reducing the cognitive burden of traditional preference elicitation.

  Unified vision-language models (UVLMs) must perform both understanding and generation within a single architecture, but these tasks rely on heterogeneous data and supervision, making it difficult to balance them during reinforcement learning (RL). We propose PairUni, a unified framework that reorganizes data into understanding-generation (UG) pairs and aligns optimization accordingly. We first use GPT-o3 to augment single-task data, generating captions for understanding samples and question-answer (QA) pairs for generation samples, forming aligned pairs from the same instance. Additionally, for each generation sample, we retrieve a semantically related understanding example to form a retrieved pair, linking different but related data points. These paired structures expose cross-task semantic correspondences and support consistent policy learning. To leverage this structure, we present Pair-GPRO, a pair-aware variant based on Group Relative Policy Optimization. It assigns a similarity score to each pair to modulate the advantage, strengthening learning from well-aligned examples and reducing task interference. We curate a high-quality dataset of 16K UG pairs named PairUG for RL fine-tuning and evaluate PairUni on the powerful Janus-Pro UVLMs. Our approach achieves balanced improvements on various UVLMs, outperforming strong UVLM RL baselines.

  Test-time scaling (TTS) techniques can improve the performance of large language models (LLMs) at the expense of additional computation and latency. While TTS has proven effective in formal domains such as mathematics and programming, its value in argumentative domains such as law remains underexplored. We present an empirical study of verifier-based TTS methods for legal multiple-choice QA (MCQA) across five benchmarks. Using a family of 7 reward models, we evaluate both outcome-level (Best-of-$N$) and process-level (tree search) verification under realistic low-$N$ budgets. Our analysis systematically investigates how verifier utility is affected by key properties such as domain specialization, model size, and supervision type (process-supervised PRMs vs. outcome-only ORMs), even when applied across different roles.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) are exhibiting emergent human-like abilities and are increasingly envisioned as the foundation for simulating an individual's communication style, behavioral tendencies, and personality traits. However, current evaluations of LLM-based persona simulation remain limited: most rely on synthetic dialogues, lack systematic frameworks, and lack analysis of the capability requirement. To address these limitations, we introduce TwinVoice, a comprehensive benchmark for assessing persona simulation across diverse real-world contexts. TwinVoice encompasses three dimensions: Social Persona (public social interactions), Interpersonal Persona (private dialogues), and Narrative Persona (role-based expression). It further decomposes the evaluation of LLM performance into six fundamental capabilities, including opinion consistency, memory recall, logical reasoning, lexical fidelity, persona tone, and syntactic style. Experimental results reveal that while advanced models achieve moderate accuracy in persona simulation, they still fall short of capabilities such as syntactic style and memory recall. Consequently, the average performance achieved by LLMs remains considerably below the human baseline.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Autoformalization, which translates natural language mathematics into machine-verifiable formal statements, is critical for using formal mathematical reasoning to solve math problems stated in natural language. While Large Language Models can generate syntactically correct formal statements, they often fail to preserve the original problem's semantic intent. This limitation arises from the LLM approaches' treating autoformalization as a simplistic translation task which lacks mechanisms for self-reflection and iterative refinement that human experts naturally employ. To address these issues, we propose ReForm, a Reflective Autoformalization method that tightly integrates semantic consistency evaluation into the autoformalization process. This enables the model to iteratively generate formal statements, assess its semantic fidelity, and self-correct identified errors through progressive refinement. To effectively train this reflective model, we introduce Prospective Bounded Sequence Optimization (PBSO), which employs different rewards at different sequence positions to ensure that the model develops both accurate autoformalization and correct semantic validations, preventing superficial critiques that would undermine the purpose of reflection. Extensive experiments across four autoformalization benchmarks demonstrate that ReForm achieves an average improvement of 22.6 percentage points over the strongest baselines. To further ensure evaluation reliability, we introduce ConsistencyCheck, a benchmark of 859 expert-annotated items that not only validates LLMs as judges but also reveals that autoformalization is inherently difficult: even human experts produce semantic errors in up to 38.5% of cases.

  The task of information extraction (IE) is to extract structured knowledge from text. However, it is often not straightforward to utilize IE output due to the mismatch between the IE ontology and the downstream application needs. We propose a new formulation of IE TEXT2DB that emphasizes the integration of IE output and the target database (or knowledge base). Given a user instruction, a document set, and a database, our task requires the model to update the database with values from the document set to satisfy the user instruction. This task requires understanding user instructions for what to extract and adapting to the given DB/KB schema for how to extract on the fly. To evaluate this new task, we introduce a new benchmark featuring common demands such as data infilling, row population, and column addition. In addition, we propose an LLM agent framework OPAL (Observe-PlanAnalyze LLM) which includes an Observer component that interacts with the database, the Planner component that generates a code-based plan with calls to IE models, and the Analyzer component that provides feedback regarding code quality before execution. Experiments show that OPAL can successfully adapt to diverse database schemas by generating different code plans and calling the required IE models. We also highlight difficult cases such as dealing with large databases with complex dependencies and extraction hallucination, which we believe deserve further investigation.

  Although Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents are increasingly used in financial trading, it remains unclear whether they can reason and adapt in live markets, as most studies test models instead of agents, cover limited periods and assets, and rely on unverified data. To address these gaps, we introduce Agent Market Arena (AMA), the first lifelong, real-time benchmark for evaluating LLM-based trading agents across multiple markets. AMA integrates verified trading data, expert-checked news, and diverse agent architectures within a unified trading framework, enabling fair and continuous comparison under real conditions. It implements four agents, including InvestorAgent as a single-agent baseline, TradeAgent and HedgeFundAgent with different risk styles, and DeepFundAgent with memory-based reasoning, and evaluates them across GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, Claude-3.5-haiku, Claude-sonnet-4, and Gemini-2.0-flash. Live experiments on both cryptocurrency and stock markets demonstrate that agent frameworks display markedly distinct behavioral patterns, spanning from aggressive risk-taking to conservative decision-making, whereas model backbones contribute less to outcome variation. AMA thus establishes a foundation for rigorous, reproducible, and continuously evolving evaluation of financial reasoning and trading intelligence in LLM-based agents.

  With the emergence of large language models (LLMs), there is an expectation that LLMs can effectively extract explicit information from complex real-world documents (e.g., papers, reports). However, most LLMs generate paragraph-style answers that are chaotic, disorganized, and untraceable. To bridge this gap, we introduce the Arranged and Organized Extraction Benchmark (AOE), a new bilingual benchmark with data and documents of varying lengths designed to systematically evaluate the ability of LLMs to comprehend fragmented documents and reconstruct isolated information into one organized table. Unlike conventional text-to-table tasks, which rely on fixed schema and narrow task domains, AOE includes 11 carefully crafted tasks across three diverse domains, requiring models to generate context-specific schema tailored to varied input queries. In the experiment, we evaluated both open-source and closed-source state-of-the-art LLMs. The results show that even the most advanced models struggled significantly.

  Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is a critical step in aligning large language models (LLMs) with human instructions and values, yet many aspects of SFT remain poorly understood. We trained a wide range of base models on a variety of datasets including code generation, mathematical reasoning, and general-domain tasks, resulting in 1,000+ SFT models under controlled conditions. We then identified the dataset properties that matter most and examined the layer-wise modifications introduced by SFT. Our findings reveal that some training-task synergies persist across all models while others vary substantially, emphasizing the importance of model-specific strategies. Moreover, we demonstrate that perplexity consistently predicts SFT effectiveness, often surpassing superficial similarity between the training data and the benchmark, and that mid-layer weight changes correlate most strongly with performance gains. We release these 1,000+ SFT models and benchmark results to accelerate further research. All resources are available atthis https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong potential for recommendation by framing item prediction as a token-by-token language generation task. However, existing methods treat all item tokens equally, simply pursuing likelihood maximization during both optimization and decoding. This overlooks crucial token-level differences in decisiveness-many tokens contribute little to item discrimination yet can dominate optimization or decoding. To quantify token decisiveness, we propose a novel perspective that models item generation as a decision process, measuring token decisiveness by the Information Gain (IG) each token provides in reducing uncertainty about the generated item. Our empirical analysis reveals that most tokens have low IG but often correspond to high logits, disproportionately influencing training loss and decoding, which may impair model performance. Building on these insights, we introduce an Information Gain-based Decisiveness-aware Token handling (IGD) strategy that integrates token decisiveness into both tuning and decoding. Specifically, IGD downweights low-IG tokens during tuning and rebalances decoding to emphasize tokens with high IG. In this way, IGD moves beyond pure likelihood maximization, effectively prioritizing high-decisiveness tokens. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets with two LLM backbones demonstrate that IGD consistently improves recommendation accuracy, achieving significant gains on widely used ranking metrics compared to strong baselines.

  Polite speech poses a fundamental alignment challenge for large language models (LLMs). Humans deploy a rich repertoire of linguistic strategies to balance informational and social goals -- from positive approaches that build rapport (compliments, expressions of interest) to negative strategies that minimize imposition (hedging, indirectness). We investigate whether LLMs employ a similarly context-sensitive repertoire by comparing human and LLM responses in both constrained and open-ended production tasks. We find that larger models ($\ge$70B parameters) successfully replicate key preferences from the computational pragmatics literature, and human evaluators surprisingly prefer LLM-generated responses in open-ended contexts. However, further linguistic analyses reveal that models disproportionately rely on negative politeness strategies even in positive contexts, potentially leading to misinterpretations. While modern LLMs demonstrate an impressive handle on politeness strategies, these subtle differences raise important questions about pragmatic alignment in AI systems.

  Previous research has primarily focused on the cognitive error detection capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), often prompting them to analyze mistakes in reasoning chains. However, few studies have examined the meta-cognitive abilities of LLMs (e.g., their self-awareness of step errors), which are crucial for their reliability. While studies on LLM self-evaluation present some measures, such as perplexity, which can reflect the answer correctness and be viewed as the lens of meta-cognition, they lack step-level analysis and adaptation. This paper studies the evaluation of LLM meta-cognition using the current lenses and how to improve these lenses. Specifically, we propose AutoMeco, an Automated Meta-cognition Evaluation framework for benchmarking the existing lenses. Furthermore, a training-free Markovian Intrinsic Reward Adjustment strategy, MIRA, is proposed to boost current meta-cognition lenses. Experimental results on three mathematical reasoning datasets and three LLMs show the reasonableness of AutoMeco by comparing it with Best-of-N verification. Moreover, the meta-cognition ability of LLMs can be better evaluated using MIRA.

  The increasing capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have raised concerns about their misuse in AI-generated plagiarism and social engineering. While various AI-generated text detectors have been proposed to mitigate these risks, many remain vulnerable to simple evasion techniques such as paraphrasing. However, recent detectors have shown greater robustness against such basic attacks. In this work, we introduce Adversarial Paraphrasing, a training-free attack framework that universally humanizes any AI-generated text to evade detection more effectively. Our approach leverages an off-the-shelf instruction-following LLM to paraphrase AI-generated content under the guidance of an AI text detector, producing adversarial examples that are specifically optimized to bypass detection. Extensive experiments show that our attack is both broadly effective and highly transferable across several detection systems. For instance, compared to simple paraphrasing attack--which, ironically, increases the true positive at 1% false positive (T@1%F) by 8.57% on RADAR and 15.03% on Fast-DetectGPT--adversarial paraphrasing, guided by OpenAI-RoBERTa-Large, reduces T@1%F by 64.49% on RADAR and a striking 98.96% on Fast-DetectGPT. Across a diverse set of detectors--including neural network-based, watermark-based, and zero-shot approaches--our attack achieves an average T@1%F reduction of 87.88% under the guidance of OpenAI-RoBERTa-Large. We also analyze the tradeoff between text quality and attack success to find that our method can significantly reduce detection rates, with mostly a slight degradation in text quality. Our adversarial setup highlights the need for more robust and resilient detection strategies in the light of increasingly sophisticated evasion techniques.

  We propose SPARTA ALIGNMENT, an algorithm to collectively align multiple LLMs through competition and combat. To complement a single model's lack of diversity in generation and biases in evaluation, multiple LLMs form a "sparta tribe" to compete against each other in fulfilling instructions while serving as judges for the competition of others. For each iteration, one instruction and two models are selected for a duel, the other models evaluate the two responses, and their evaluation scores are aggregated through a adapted elo-ranking based reputation system, where winners/losers of combat gain/lose weight in evaluating others. The peer-evaluated combat results then become preference pairs where the winning response is preferred over the losing one, and all models learn from these preferences at the end of each iteration. SPARTA ALIGNMENT enables the self-evolution of multiple LLMs in an iterative and collective competition process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SPARTA ALIGNMENT outperforms initial models and 4 self-alignment baselines across 10 out of 12 tasks and datasets with 7.0% average improvement. Further analysis reveals that SPARTA ALIGNMENT generalizes more effectively to unseen tasks and leverages the expertise diversity of participating models to produce more logical, direct and informative outputs.

  Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) augments Large Language Models (LLMs) with external knowledge to improve factuality. However, existing RAG systems frequently underutilize the retrieved documents, failing to extract and integrate the key clues needed to support faithful and interpretable reasoning, especially in cases where relevant evidence is implicit, scattered, or obscured by noise. To address this issue, we propose ClueAnchor, a novel framework for enhancing RAG via clue-anchored reasoning exploration and optimization. ClueAnchor extracts key clues from retrieved content and generates multiple reasoning paths based on different knowledge configurations, optimizing the model by selecting the most appropriate reasoning path for the given context through reward-based preference optimization. Experiments show that ClueAnchor significantly outperforms prior RAG baselines in the completeness and robustness of reasoning. Further analysis confirms its strong resilience to noisy or partially relevant retrieved content, as well as its capability to identify supporting evidence even in the absence of explicit clue supervision during inference.

  Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have dominated much of the artificial intelligence scene with their ability to process and generate natural languages. However, the majority of LLM research and development remains English-centric, leaving low-resource languages such as those in the Southeast Asian (SEA) region under-represented. To address this representation gap, we introduce Llama-SEA-LION-v3-8B-IT and Gemma-SEA-LION-v3-9B-IT, two cutting-edge multilingual LLMs designed for SEA languages. The SEA-LION family of LLMs supports 11 SEA languages, namely English, Chinese, Indonesian, Vietnamese, Malay, Thai, Burmese, Lao, Filipino, Tamil, and Khmer. Our work leverages large-scale multilingual continued pre-training with a comprehensive post-training regime involving multiple stages of instruction fine-tuning, alignment, and model merging. Evaluation results on multilingual benchmarks indicate that our models achieve state-of-the-art performance across LLMs supporting SEA languages. We open-source the models to benefit the wider SEA community.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  I propose a relatively simple way to deploy pre-trained large language models (LLMs) in order to extract sentiment and other useful features from text data. The method, which I refer to as prompt-based sentiment extraction, offers multiple advantages over other methods used in economics and finance. In particular, it accepts the text input as is (without pre-processing) and produces a sentiment score that has a probability interpretation. Unlike other LLM-based approaches, it does not require any fine-tuning or labeled data. I apply my prompt-based strategy to a hand-collected corpus of confidential reference letters (RLs). I show that the sentiment contents of RLs are clearly reflected in job market outcomes. Candidates with higher average sentiment in their RLs perform markedly better regardless of the measure of success chosen. Moreover, I show that sentiment dispersion among letter writers negatively affects the job market candidate's performance. I compare my sentiment extraction approach to other commonly used methods for sentiment analysis: `bag-of-words' approaches, fine-tuned language models, and querying advanced chatbots. No other method can fully reproduce the results obtained by prompt-based sentiment extraction. Finally, I slightly modify the method to obtain `gendered' sentiment scores (as in Eberhardt et al., 2023). I show that RLs written for female candidates emphasize `grindstone' personality traits, whereas male candidates' letters emphasize `standout' traits. These gender differences negatively affect women's job market outcomes.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Logical reasoning is a pivotal component in the field of artificial intelligence. Proof planning, particularly in contexts requiring the validation of explanation accuracy, continues to present challenges. The recent advancement of large language models (LLMs) has led to significant progress in natural language proof planning, evolving from one-stage generators to more complex three-stage systems that include additional searchers or verifiers. While these assisted methods improve the quality of generated results, they also introduce increased search efforts and computational costs. Furthermore, the generative process itself remains underexplored. In this study, we propose a stepwise decoding approach augmented by contrastive learning to address two common errors encountered during the LLM generator's decoding process. We fine-tune the language model using both vanilla and enhanced hard negatives to mitigate these decoding errors. Empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our strategy. Additionally, our further analysis reveals that even larger LLMs still struggle to generate rigorous logical chains.

  _Zhipeng Bao, Qianwen Li_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Despite significant advancements in recent decades, autonomous vehicles (AVs) continue to face challenges in navigating certain traffic scenarios where human drivers excel. In such situations, AVs often become immobilized, disrupting overall traffic flow. Current recovery solutions, such as remote intervention (which is costly and inefficient) and manual takeover (which excludes non-drivers and limits AV accessibility), are inadequate. This paper introduces StuckSolver, a novel Large Language Model (LLM) driven recovery framework that enables AVs to resolve immobilization scenarios through self-reasoning and/or passenger-guided decision-making. StuckSolver is designed as a plug-in add-on module that operates on top of the AV's existing perception-planning-control stack, requiring no modification to its internal architecture. Instead, it interfaces with standard sensor data streams to detect immobilization states, interpret environmental context, and generate high-level recovery commands that can be executed by the AV's native planner. We evaluate StuckSolver on the Bench2Drive benchmark and in custom-designed uncertainty scenarios. Results show that StuckSolver achieves near-state-of-the-art performance through autonomous self-reasoning alone and exhibits further improvements when passenger guidance is incorporated.

  The rapid growth of programming education has outpaced traditional assessment tools, leaving faculty with limited means to provide meaningful, scalable feedback. Conventional autograders, while efficient, act as black-box systems that simply return pass/fail results, offering little insight into student thinking or learning needs.Autograder+ is designed to shift autograding from a purely summative process to a formative learning experience. It introduces two key capabilities: automated feedback generation using a fine-tuned Large Language Model, and visualization of student code submissions to uncover learning patterns. The model is fine-tuned on curated student code and expert feedback to ensure pedagogically aligned, context-aware guidance.In evaluation across 600 student submissions from multiple programming tasks, the system produced feedback with strong semantic alignment to instructor comments. For visualization, contrastively learned code embeddings trained on 1,000 annotated submissions enable grouping solutions into meaningful clusters based on functionality and approach. The system also supports prompt-pooling, allowing instructors to guide feedback style through selected prompt templates.By integrating AI-driven feedback, semantic clustering, and interactive visualization, Autograder+ reduces instructor workload while supporting targeted instruction and promoting stronger learning outcomes.

  The prohibitive cost of evaluating large language models (LLMs) on comprehensive benchmarks necessitates the creation of small yet representative data subsets (i.e., tiny benchmarks) that enable efficient assessment while retaining predictive fidelity. Current methods for this task operate under a model-centric paradigm, selecting benchmarking items based on the collective performance of existing models. Such approaches are limited by large upfront costs, an inability to immediately handle new benchmarks (`cold-start'), and the fragile assumption that future models will share the failure patterns of their predecessors. In this work, we challenge this paradigm and propose a item-centric approach to benchmark subset selection, arguing that selection should be based on the intrinsic properties of the task items themselves, rather than on model-specific failure patterns. We instantiate this item-centric efficient benchmarking approach via a novel method, Scales++, where data selection is based on the cognitive demands of the benchmark samples. Empirically, we show Scales++ reduces the upfront selection cost by over 18x while achieving competitive predictive fidelity. On the Open LLM Leaderboard, using just a 0.5\% data subset, we predict full benchmark scores with a 2.9% mean absolute error. We demonstrate that this item-centric approach enables more efficient model evaluation without significant fidelity degradation, while also providing better cold-start performance and more interpretable benchmarking.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  There is a growing interest in Universal Multimodal Embeddings (UME), where models are required to generate task-specific representations. While recent studies show that Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) perform well on such tasks, they treat MLLMs solely as encoders, overlooking their generative capacity. However, such an encoding paradigm becomes less effective as instructions become more complex and require compositional reasoning. Inspired by the proven effectiveness of chain-of-thought reasoning, we propose a general Think-Then-Embed (TTE) framework for UME, composed of a reasoner and an embedder. The reasoner MLLM first generates reasoning traces that explain complex queries, followed by an embedder that produces representations conditioned on both the original query and the intermediate reasoning. This explicit reasoning step enables more nuanced understanding of complex multimodal instructions. Our contributions are threefold. First, by leveraging a powerful MLLM reasoner, we achieve state-of-the-art performance on the MMEB-V2 benchmark, surpassing proprietary models trained on massive in-house datasets. Second, to reduce the dependency on large MLLM reasoners, we finetune a smaller MLLM reasoner using high-quality embedding-centric reasoning traces, achieving the best performance among open-source models with a 7% absolute gain over recently proposed models. Third, we investigate strategies for integrating the reasoner and embedder into a unified model for improved efficiency without sacrificing performance.

  Reinforcement learning (RL) has proven effective for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs), significantly enhancing their reasoning abilities in domains such as mathematics and code generation. A crucial factor influencing RL fine-tuning success is the training curriculum: the order in which training problems are presented. While random curricula serve as common baselines, they remain suboptimal; manually designed curricula often rely heavily on heuristics, and online filtering methods can be computationally prohibitive. To address these limitations, we propose Self-Evolving Curriculum (SEC), an automatic curriculum learning method that learns a curriculum policy concurrently with the RL fine-tuning process. Our approach formulates curriculum selection as a non-stationary Multi-Armed Bandit problem, treating each problem category (e.g., difficulty level or problem type) as an individual arm. We leverage the absolute advantage from policy gradient methods as a proxy measure for immediate learning gain. At each training step, the curriculum policy selects categories to maximize this reward signal and is updated using the TD(0) method. Across three distinct reasoning domains: planning, inductive reasoning, and mathematics, our experiments demonstrate that SEC significantly improves models' reasoning capabilities, enabling better generalization to harder, out-of-distribution test problems. Additionally, our approach achieves better skill balance when fine-tuning simultaneously on multiple reasoning domains. These findings highlight SEC as a promising strategy for RL fine-tuning of LLMs.

  Test-time scaling (TTS) has proven effective in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Verification plays a key role in TTS, simultaneously influencing (1) reasoning performance and (2) compute efficiency, due to the quality and computational cost of verification. In this work, we challenge the conventional paradigms of verification, and make the first attempt toward systematically investigating the impact of verification granularity-that is, how frequently the verifier is invoked during generation, beyond verifying only the final output or individual generation steps. To this end, we introduce Variable Granularity Search (VG-Search), a unified algorithm that generalizes beam search and Best-of-N sampling via a tunable granularity parameter g. Extensive experiments with VG-Search under varying compute budgets, generator-verifier configurations, and task attributes reveal that dynamically selecting g can improve the compute efficiency and scaling behavior. Building on these findings, we propose adaptive VG-Search strategies that achieve accuracy gains of up to 3.1\% over Beam Search and 3.6\% over Best-of-N, while reducing FLOPs by over 52\%. We will open-source the code to support future research.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has stimulated interest in multi-agent collaboration for addressing complex medical tasks. However, the practical advantages of multi-agent collaboration approaches remain insufficiently understood. Existing evaluations often lack generalizability, failing to cover diverse tasks reflective of real-world clinical practice, and frequently omit rigorous comparisons against both single-LLM-based and established conventional methods. To address this critical gap, we introduce MedAgentBoard, a comprehensive benchmark for the systematic evaluation of multi-agent collaboration, single-LLM, and conventional approaches. MedAgentBoard encompasses four diverse medical task categories: (1) medical (visual) question answering, (2) lay summary generation, (3) structured Electronic Health Record (EHR) predictive modeling, and (4) clinical workflow automation, across text, medical images, and structured EHR data. Our extensive experiments reveal a nuanced landscape: while multi-agent collaboration demonstrates benefits in specific scenarios, such as enhancing task completeness in clinical workflow automation, it does not consistently outperform advanced single LLMs (e.g., in textual medical QA) or, critically, specialized conventional methods that generally maintain better performance in tasks like medical VQA and EHR-based prediction. MedAgentBoard offers a vital resource and actionable insights, emphasizing the necessity of a task-specific, evidence-based approach to selecting and developing AI solutions in medicine. It underscores that the inherent complexity and overhead of multi-agent collaboration must be carefully weighed against tangible performance gains.

  Aligning LLM-based judges with human preferences is a significant challenge, as they are difficult to calibrate and often suffer from rubric sensitivity, bias, and instability. Overcoming this challenge advances key applications, such as creating reliable reward models for Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and building effective routing systems that select the best-suited model for a given user query. In this work, we propose a framework for modeling diverse, persona-based preferences by learning to aggregate outputs from multiple rubric-conditioned judges. We investigate the performance of this approach against naive baselines and assess its robustness through case studies on both human and LLM-judges biases. Our primary contributions include a persona-based method for synthesizing preference labels at scale and two distinct implementations of our aggregator: Generalized Additive Model (GAM) and a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP).

  The accurate trust assessment of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) generated predictions, which can enable selective prediction and improve user confidence, is challenging due to the diverse multi-modal input paradigms. We propose Functionally Equivalent Sampling for Trust Assessment (FESTA), a multimodal input sampling technique for MLLMs, that generates an uncertainty measure based on the equivalent and complementary input samplings. The proposed task-preserving sampling approach for uncertainty quantification expands the input space to probe the consistency (through equivalent samples) and sensitivity (through complementary samples) of the model. FESTA uses only input-output access of the model (black-box), and does not require ground truth (unsupervised). The experiments are conducted with various off-the-shelf multi-modal LLMs, on both visual and audio reasoning tasks. The proposed FESTA uncertainty estimate achieves significant improvement (33.3% relative improvement for vision-LLMs and 29.6% relative improvement for audio-LLMs) in selective prediction performance, based on area-under-receiver-operating-characteristic curve (AUROC) metric in detecting mispredictions. The code implementation is open-sourced.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Agents are predominantly evaluated and optimized via task success metrics, which are coarse, rely on manual design from experts, and fail to reward intermediate emergent behaviors. We propose **AutoLibra**, a framework for agent evaluation, that transforms open-ended human feedback *e.g.* "If you find that the button is disabled, don't click it again", or "This agent has too much autonomy to decide what to do on its own" into metrics for evaluating fine-grained behaviors in agent trajectories. AutoLibra accomplishes this by grounding feedback to an agent's behavior, clustering similar positive and negative behaviors, and creating concrete metrics with clear definitions and concrete examples, which can be used for prompting LLM-as-a-Judge as evaluators. We further propose two meta metrics to evaluate the alignment of a set of (induced) metrics with open feedback: "coverage" and "redundancy". Through optimizing these meta-metrics, we experimentally demonstrate AutoLibra's ability to induce more concrete agent evaluation metrics than the ones proposed in previous agent evaluation benchmarks and discover new metrics to analyze agents. We also present two applications of AutoLibra in agent improvement: First, we show that AutoLibra serve human prompt engineers for diagonalize agent failures and improve prompts iterative. Moreover, we find that AutoLibra can induce metrics for automatic optimization for agents, which makes agents improve through self-regulation. Our results suggest that AutoLibra is a powerful task-agnostic tool for evaluating and improving language agents.

  This paper presents a comprehensive cross-platform evaluation of reasoning capabilities in contemporary foundation models, establishing an infrastructure-agnostic benchmark across three computational paradigms: HPC supercomputing (MareNostrum 5), cloud platforms (Nebius AI Studio), and university clusters (a node with eight H200 GPUs).We evaluate 15 foundation models across 79 problems spanning eight academic domains (Physics, Mathematics, Chemistry, Economics, Biology, Statistics, Calculus, and Optimization) through three experimental phases: (1) Baseline establishment: Six models (Mixtral-8x7B, Phi-3, LLaMA 3.1-8B, Gemma-2-9b, Mistral-7B, OLMo-7B) evaluated on 19 problems using MareNostrum 5, establishing methodology and reference performance; (2) Infrastructure validation: The 19-problem benchmark repeated on university cluster (seven models including Falcon-Mamba state-space architecture) and Nebius AI Studio (nine state-of-the-art models: Hermes-4 70B/405B, LLaMA 3.1-405B/3.3-70B, Qwen3 30B/235B, DeepSeek-R1, GPT-OSS 20B/120B) to confirm infrastructure-agnostic reproducibility; (3) Extended evaluation: Full 79-problem assessment on both university cluster and Nebius platforms, probing generalization at scale across architectural diversity.The findings challenge conventional scaling assumptions, establish training data quality as more critical than model size, and provide actionable guidelines for model selection across educational, production, and research contexts. The tri-infrastructure methodology and 79-problem benchmark enable longitudinal tracking of reasoning capabilities as foundation models evolve.

  We envision a new era of AI, termed agentic organization, where agents solve complex problems by working collaboratively and concurrently, enabling outcomes beyond individual intelligence. To realize this vision, we introduce asynchronous thinking (AsyncThink) as a new paradigm of reasoning with large language models, which organizes the internal thinking process into concurrently executable structures. Specifically, we propose a thinking protocol where an organizer dynamically assigns sub-queries to workers, merges intermediate knowledge, and produces coherent solutions. More importantly, the thinking structure in this protocol can be further optimized through reinforcement learning. Experiments demonstrate that AsyncThink achieves 28% lower inference latency compared to parallel thinking while improving accuracy on mathematical reasoning. Moreover, AsyncThink generalizes its learned asynchronous thinking capabilities, effectively tackling unseen tasks without additional training.

  Normative reasoning is a type of reasoning that involves normative or deontic modality, such as obligation and permission. While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across various reasoning tasks, their ability to handle normative reasoning remains underexplored. In this paper, we systematically evaluate LLMs' reasoning capabilities in the normative domain from both logical and modal perspectives. Specifically, to assess how well LLMs reason with normative modals, we make a comparison between their reasoning with normative modals and their reasoning with epistemic modals, which share a common formal structure. To this end, we introduce a new dataset covering a wide range of formal patterns of reasoning in both normative and epistemic domains, while also incorporating non-formal cognitive factors that influence human reasoning. Our results indicate that, although LLMs generally adhere to valid reasoning patterns, they exhibit notable inconsistencies in specific types of normative reasoning and display cognitive biases similar to those observed in psychological studies of human reasoning. These findings highlight challenges in achieving logical consistency in LLMs' normative reasoning and provide insights for enhancing their reliability.

  Reward models (RMs) play a critical role in aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. Yet in the domain of tool learning, the lack of RMs specifically designed for function-calling tasks has limited progress toward more capable agentic AI. We introduce ToolRM, a family of lightweight generative RMs tailored for general tool-use scenarios. To build these models, we propose a novel pipeline that constructs pairwise preference data using rule-based scoring and multidimensional sampling. This yields ToolPref-Pairwise-30K, a diverse, balanced, and challenging dataset of critique tasks that supports reinforcement learning with verifiable feedback. To evaluate tool-use RMs, we also introduce TRBench$_{BFCL}$, a benchmark built on the agentic evaluation suite BFCL. Trained on our constructed data, models from the Qwen3-4B/8B series achieve up to 14.28% higher accuracy, substantially outperforming frontier models such as Claude 4 and OpenAI o3 in pairwise reward judgments. Beyond training objectives, ToolRM generalizes to broader critique tasks, including Best-of-N sampling and self-correction. Experiments on ACEBench highlight its effectiveness and efficiency, enabling inference-time scaling and reducing output token usage by over 66%. We release data and model checkpoints to facilitate future research.

  Reinforcement learning (RL) can elicit strong reasoning in large language models (LLMs), yet most open efforts focus on math and code. We propose Reasoning Curriculum, a simple two-stage curriculum that first elicits reasoning skills in pretraining-aligned domains such as math, then adapts and refines these skills across other domains via joint RL. Stage 1 performs a brief cold start and then math-only RL with verifiable rewards to develop reasoning skills. Stage 2 runs joint RL on mixed-domain data to transfer and consolidate these skills. The curriculum is minimal and backbone-agnostic, requiring no specialized reward models beyond standard verifiability checks. Evaluated on Qwen3-4B and Llama-3.1-8B over a multi-domain suite, reasoning curriculum yields consistent gains. Ablations and a cognitive-skill analysis indicate that both stages are necessary and that math-first elicitation increases cognitive behaviors important for solving complex problems. Reasoning Curriculum provides a compact, easy-to-adopt recipe for general reasoning.

  We study how prompt-level inductive biases influence the cognitive behavior of large language models (LLMs) in instructional dialogue. We introduce a symbolic scaffolding method paired with a short-term memory schema designed to promote adaptive, structured reasoning in Socratic tutoring. Using controlled ablation across five system variants, we evaluate model outputs via expert-designed rubrics covering scaffolding, responsiveness, symbolic reasoning, and conversational memory. We present preliminary results using an LLM-based evaluation framework aligned to a cognitively grounded rubric. This enables scalable, systematic comparisons across architectural variants in early-stage experimentation. The preliminary results show that our full system consistently outperforms baseline variants. Analysis reveals that removing memory or symbolic structure degrades key cognitive behaviors, including abstraction, adaptive probing, and conceptual continuity. These findings support a processing-level account in which prompt-level cognitive scaffolds can reliably shape emergent instructional strategies in LLMs.

  Language interpretation is a compositional process, in which the meaning of more complex linguistic structures is inferred from the meaning of their parts. Large language models possess remarkable language interpretation capabilities and have been successfully applied to interpret questions by mapping them to SPARQL queries. An open question is how systematic this interpretation process is. Toward this question, in this paper, we propose a benchmark for investigating to what extent the abilities of LLMs to interpret questions are actually compositional. For this, we generate three datasets of varying difficulty based on graph patterns in DBpedia, relying on Lemon lexica for verbalization. Our datasets are created in a very controlled fashion in order to test the ability of LLMs to interpret structurally complex questions, given that they have seen the atomic building blocks. This allows us to evaluate to what degree LLMs are able to interpret complex questions for which they "understand" the atomic parts. We conduct experiments with models of different sizes using both various prompt and few-shot optimization techniques as well as fine-tuning. Our results show that performance in terms of macro $F_1$ degrades from $0.45$ over $0.26$ down to $0.09$ with increasing deviation from the samples optimized on. Even when all necessary information was provided to the model in the input, the $F_1$ scores do not exceed $0.57$ for the dataset of lowest complexity. We thus conclude that LLMs struggle to systematically and compositionally interpret questions and map them into SPARQL queries.

  We investigate the mechanisms underlying a range of list-processing tasks in LLMs, and we find that LLMs have learned to encode a compact, causal representation of a general filtering operation that mirrors the generic "filter" function of functional programming. Using causal mediation analysis on a diverse set of list-processing tasks, we find that a small number of attention heads, which we dub filter heads, encode a compact representation of the filtering predicate in their query states at certain tokens. We demonstrate that this predicate representation is general and portable: it can be extracted and reapplied to execute the same filtering operation on different collections, presented in different formats, languages, or even in tasks. However, we also identify situations where transformer LMs can exploit a different strategy for filtering: eagerly evaluating if an item satisfies the predicate and storing this intermediate result as a flag directly in the item representations. Our results reveal that transformer LMs can develop human-interpretable implementations of abstract computational operations that generalize in ways that are surprisingly similar to strategies used in traditional functional programming patterns.

  Authorizing Large Language Model driven agents to dynamically invoke tools and access protected resources introduces significant risks, since current methods for delegating authorization grant overly broad permissions and give access to tools allowing agents to operate beyond the intended task scope. We introduce and assess a delegated authorization model enabling authorization servers to semantically inspect access requests to protected resources, and issue access tokens constrained to the minimal set of scopes necessary for the agents' assigned tasks. Given the unavailability of datasets centered on delegated authorization flows, particularly including both semantically appropriate and inappropriate scope requests for a given task, we introduce ASTRA, a dataset and data generation pipeline for benchmarking semantic matching between tasks and scopes. Our experiments show both the potential and current limitations of model-based matching, particularly as the number of scopes needed for task completion increases. Our results highlight the need for further research into semantic matching techniques enabling intent-aware authorization for multi-agent and tool-augmented applications, including fine-grained control, such as Task-Based Access Control (TBAC).

  We present EdgeRunner 20B, a fine-tuned version of gpt-oss-20b optimized for military tasks. EdgeRunner 20B was trained on 1.6M high-quality records curated from military documentation and websites. We also present four new tests sets: (a) combat arms, (b) combat medic, (c) cyber operations, and (d) mil-bench-5k (general military knowledge). On these military test sets, EdgeRunner 20B matches or exceeds GPT-5 task performance with 95%+ statistical significance, except for the high reasoning setting on the combat medic test set and the low reasoning setting on the mil-bench-5k test set. Versus gpt-oss-20b, there is no statistically-significant regression on general-purpose benchmarks like ARC-C, GPQA Diamond, GSM8k, IFEval, MMLU Pro, or TruthfulQA, except for GSM8k in the low reasoning setting. We also present analyses on hyperparameter settings, cost, and throughput. These findings show that small, locally-hosted models are ideal solutions for data-sensitive operations such as in the military domain, allowing for deployment in air-gapped edge devices.

  Large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT are increasingly integrated into high-stakes decision-making, yet little is known about their susceptibility to social influence. We conducted three preregistered conformity experiments with GPT-4o in a hiring context. In a baseline study, GPT consistently favored the same candidate (Profile C), reported moderate expertise (M = 3.01) and high certainty (M = 3.89), and rarely changed its choice. In Study 1 (GPT + 8), GPT faced unanimous opposition from eight simulated partners and almost always conformed (99.9%), reporting lower certainty and significantly elevated self-reported informational and normative conformity (p < .001). In Study 2 (GPT + 1), GPT interacted with a single partner and still conformed in 40.2% of disagreement trials, reporting less certainty and more normative conformity. Across studies, results demonstrate that GPT does not act as an independent observer but adapts to perceived social consensus. These findings highlight risks of treating LLMs as neutral decision aids and underline the need to elicit AI judgments prior to exposing them to human opinions.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large reasoning models (LRMs) achieve higher task performance by allocating more inference-time compute, and prior works suggest this scaled reasoning may also strengthen safety by improving refusal. Yet we find the opposite: the same reasoning can be used to bypass safeguards. We introduce Chain-of-Thought Hijacking, a jailbreak attack on reasoning models. The attack pads harmful requests with long sequences of harmless puzzle reasoning. Across HarmBench, CoT Hijacking reaches a 99%, 94%, 100%, and 94% attack success rate (ASR) on Gemini 2.5 Pro, GPT o4 mini, Grok 3 mini, and Claude 4 Sonnet, respectively - far exceeding prior jailbreak methods for LRMs. To understand the effectiveness of our attack, we turn to a mechanistic analysis, which shows that mid layers encode the strength of safety checking, while late layers encode the verification outcome. Long benign CoT dilutes both signals by shifting attention away from harmful tokens. Targeted ablations of attention heads identified by this analysis causally decrease refusal, confirming their role in a safety subnetwork. These results show that the most interpretable form of reasoning - explicit CoT - can itself become a jailbreak vector when combined with final-answer cues. We release prompts, outputs, and judge decisions to facilitate replication.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reinforcement finetuning (RFT) is a key technique for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences and enhancing reasoning, yet its effectiveness is highly sensitive to which tasks are explored during training. Uniform task sampling is inefficient, wasting computation on tasks that are either trivial or unsolvable, while existing task selection methods often suffer from high rollout costs, poor adaptivity, or incomplete evidence. We introduce \textbf{BOTS}, a unified framework for \textbf{B}ayesian \textbf{O}nline \textbf{T}ask \textbf{S}election in LLM reinforcement finetuning. Grounded in Bayesian inference, BOTS adaptively maintains posterior estimates of task difficulty as the model evolves. It jointly incorporates \emph{explicit evidence} from direct evaluations of selected tasks and \emph{implicit evidence} inferred from these evaluations for unselected tasks, with Thompson sampling ensuring a principled balance between exploration and exploitation. To make implicit evidence practical, we instantiate it with an ultra-light interpolation-based plug-in that estimates difficulties of unevaluated tasks without extra rollouts, adding negligible overhead. Empirically, across diverse domains and LLM scales, BOTS consistently improves data efficiency and performance over baselines and ablations, providing a practical and extensible solution for dynamic task selection in RFT.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Group based reinforcement learning (RL) has shown impressive results on complex reasoning and mathematical tasks. Yet, when applied to train multi-turn, interactive LLM agents, these methods often suffer from structural blindness-the inability to exploit the underlying connectivity of the environment. This manifests in three critical challenges: (1) inefficient, unguided exploration, (2) imprecise credit assignment due to overlooking pivotal states, and (3) myopic planning caused by static reward discounting. We address these issues with Graph-Enhanced Policy Optimization (GEPO), which dynamically constructs a state-transition graph from agent experience and employs graph-theoretic centrality to provide three synergistic learning signals: (1)structured intrinsic rewards that guide exploration toward high-impact states, (2) a graph-enhanced advantage function for topology-aware credit assignment, and (3) a dynamic discount factor adapted to each state's strategic value. On the ALFWorld, WebShop, and a proprietary Workbench benchmarks, GEPO demonstrates strong performance, achieving absolute success rate gains of +4.1%, +5.3%, and +10.9% over competitive baselines. These results highlight that explicitly modeling environmental structure is a robust, generalizable strategy for advancing LLM agent training.

  With increasing urban traffic complexity, Traffic Signal Control (TSC) is essential for optimizing traffic flow and improving road safety. Large Language Models (LLMs) emerge as promising approaches for TSC. However, they are prone to hallucinations in emergencies, leading to unreliable decisions that may cause substantial delays for emergency vehicles. Moreover, diverse intersection types present substantial challenges for traffic state encoding and cross-intersection training, limiting generalization across heterogeneous intersections. Therefore, this paper proposes Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)-enhanced distributed LLM agents with Emergency response for Generalizable TSC (REG-TSC). Firstly, this paper presents an emergency-aware reasoning framework, which dynamically adjusts reasoning depth based on the emergency scenario and is equipped with a novel Reviewer-based Emergency RAG (RERAG) to distill specific knowledge and guidance from historical cases, enhancing the reliability and rationality of agents' emergency decisions. Secondly, this paper designs a type-agnostic traffic representation and proposes a Reward-guided Reinforced Refinement (R3) for heterogeneous intersections. R3 adaptively samples training experience from diverse intersections with environment feedback-based priority and fine-tunes LLM agents with a designed reward-weighted likelihood loss, guiding REG-TSC toward high-reward policies across heterogeneous intersections. On three real-world road networks with 17 to 177 heterogeneous intersections, extensive experiments show that REG-TSC reduces travel time by 42.00%, queue length by 62.31%, and emergency vehicle waiting time by 83.16%, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Millions of people take surveys every day, from market polls and academic studies to medical questionnaires and customer feedback forms. These datasets capture valuable insights, but their scale and structure present a unique challenge for large language models (LLMs), which otherwise excel at few-shot reasoning over open-ended text. Yet, their ability to process questionnaire data or lists of questions crossed with hundreds of respondent rows remains underexplored. Current retrieval and survey analysis tools (e.g., Qualtrics, SPSS, REDCap) are typically designed for humans in the workflow, limiting such data integration with LLM and AI-empowered automation. This gap leaves scientists, surveyors, and everyday users without evidence-based guidance on how to best represent questionnaires for LLM consumption. We address this by introducing QASU (Questionnaire Analysis and Structural Understanding), a benchmark that probes six structural skills, including answer lookup, respondent count, and multi-hop inference, across six serialization formats and multiple prompt strategies. Experiments on contemporary LLMs show that choosing an effective format and prompt combination can improve accuracy by up to 8.8% points compared to suboptimal formats. For specific tasks, carefully adding a lightweight structural hint through self-augmented prompting can yield further improvements of 3-4% points on average. By systematically isolating format and prompting effects, our open source benchmark offers a simple yet versatile foundation for advancing both research and real-world practice in LLM-based questionnaire analysis.

  Large language models (LLMs) are catalyzing the development of autonomous AI research agents for scientific and engineering discovery. We present FM Agent, a novel and general-purpose multi-agent framework that leverages a synergistic combination of LLM-based reasoning and large-scale evolutionary search to address complex real-world challenges. The core of FM Agent integrates several key innovations: 1) a cold-start initialization phase incorporating expert guidance, 2) a novel evolutionary sampling strategy for iterative optimization, 3) domain-specific evaluators that combine correctness, effectiveness, and LLM-supervised feedback, and 4) a distributed, asynchronous execution infrastructure built on Ray. Demonstrating broad applicability, our system has been evaluated across diverse domains, including operations research, machine learning, GPU kernel optimization, and classical mathematical problems. FM Agent reaches state-of-the-art results autonomously, without human interpretation or tuning -- 1976.3 on ALE-Bench (+5.2\%), 43.56\% on MLE-Bench (+4.0pp), up to 20x speedups on KernelBench, and establishes new state-of-the-art(SOTA) results on several classical mathematical problems. Beyond academic benchmarks, FM Agent shows considerable promise for both large-scale enterprise R\&D workflows and fundamental scientific research, where it can accelerate innovation, automate complex discovery processes, and deliver substantial engineering and scientific advances with broader societal impact.

  The inference cost of Large Language Models (LLMs) has become a critical factor in determining their commercial viability and widespread adoption. This paper introduces a quantitative ``economics of inference'' framework, treating the LLM inference process as a compute-driven intelligent production activity. We analyze its marginal cost, economies of scale, and quality of output under various performance configurations. Based on empirical data from WiNEval-3.0, we construct the first ``LLM Inference Production Frontier,'' revealing three principles: diminishing marginal cost, diminishing returns to scale, and an optimal cost-effectiveness zone. This paper not only provides an economic basis for model deployment decisions but also lays an empirical foundation for the future market-based pricing and optimization of AI inference resources.

  The rapid growth of research literature, particularly in large language models (LLMs), has made producing comprehensive and current survey papers increasingly difficult. This paper introduces autosurvey2, a multi-stage pipeline that automates survey generation through retrieval-augmented synthesis and structured evaluation. The system integrates parallel section generation, iterative refinement, and real-time retrieval of recent publications to ensure both topical completeness and factual accuracy. Quality is assessed using a multi-LLM evaluation framework that measures coverage, structure, and relevance in alignment with expert review standards. Experimental results demonstrate that autosurvey2 consistently outperforms existing retrieval-based and automated baselines, achieving higher scores in structural coherence and topical relevance while maintaining strong citation fidelity. By combining retrieval, reasoning, and automated evaluation into a unified framework, autosurvey2 provides a scalable and reproducible solution for generating long-form academic surveys and contributes a solid foundation for future research on automated scholarly writing.

  Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated transformative potential in scientific research, yet their deployment in high-stakes contexts raises significant trustworthiness concerns. Here, we introduce SciTrust 2.0, a comprehensive framework for evaluating LLM trustworthiness in scientific applications across four dimensions: truthfulness, adversarial robustness, scientific safety, and scientific ethics. Our framework incorporates novel, open-ended truthfulness benchmarks developed through a verified reflection-tuning pipeline and expert validation, alongside a novel ethics benchmark for scientific research contexts covering eight subcategories including dual-use research and bias. We evaluated seven prominent LLMs, including four science-specialized models and three general-purpose industry models, using multiple evaluation metrics including accuracy, semantic similarity measures, and LLM-based scoring. General-purpose industry models overall outperformed science-specialized models across each trustworthiness dimension, with GPT-o4-mini demonstrating superior performance in truthfulness assessments and adversarial robustness. Science-specialized models showed significant deficiencies in logical and ethical reasoning capabilities, along with concerning vulnerabilities in safety evaluations, particularly in high-risk domains such as biosecurity and chemical weapons. By open-sourcing our framework, we provide a foundation for developing more trustworthy AI systems and advancing research on model safety and ethics in scientific contexts.

  Reinforcement Learning (RL) has demonstrated significant potential in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, the success of RL for LLMs heavily relies on human-curated datasets and verifiable rewards, which limit their scalability and generality. Recent Self-Play RL methods, inspired by the success of the paradigm in games and Go, aim to enhance LLM reasoning capabilities without human-annotated data. However, their methods primarily depend on a grounded environment for feedback (e.g., a Python interpreter or a game engine); extending them to general domains remains challenging. To address these challenges, we propose Multi-Agent Evolve (MAE), a framework that enables LLMs to self-evolve in solving diverse tasks, including mathematics, reasoning, and general knowledge Q&A. The core design of MAE is based on a triplet of interacting agents (Proposer, Solver, Judge) that are instantiated from a single LLM, and applies reinforcement learning to optimize their behaviors. The Proposer generates questions, the Solver attempts solutions, and the Judge evaluates both while co-evolving. Experiments on Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct demonstrate that MAE achieves an average improvement of 4.54% on multiple benchmarks. These results highlight MAE as a scalable, data-efficient method for enhancing the general reasoning abilities of LLMs with minimal reliance on human-curated supervision.

  Scientific Large Language Models (Sci-LLMs) have emerged as a promising frontier for accelerating biological discovery. However, these models face a fundamental challenge when processing raw biomolecular sequences: the tokenization dilemma. Whether treating sequences as a specialized language, risking the loss of functional motif information, or as a separate modality, introducing formidable alignment challenges, current strategies fundamentally limit their reasoning capacity. We challenge this sequence-centric paradigm by positing that a more effective strategy is to provide Sci-LLMs with high-level structured context derived from established bioinformatics tools, thereby bypassing the need to interpret low-level noisy sequence data directly. Through a systematic comparison of leading Sci-LLMs on biological reasoning tasks, we tested three input modes: sequence-only, context-only, and a combination of both. Our findings are striking: the context-only approach consistently and substantially outperforms all other modes. Even more revealing, the inclusion of the raw sequence alongside its high-level context consistently degrades performance, indicating that raw sequences act as informational noise, even for models with specialized tokenization schemes. These results suggest that the primary strength of existing Sci-LLMs lies not in their nascent ability to interpret biomolecular syntax from scratch, but in their profound capacity for reasoning over structured, human-readable knowledge. Therefore, we argue for reframing Sci-LLMs not as sequence decoders, but as powerful reasoning engines over expert knowledge. This work lays the foundation for a new class of hybrid scientific AI agents, repositioning the developmental focus from direct sequence interpretation towards high-level knowledge synthesis.

  LLM-based agents are increasingly moving towards proactivity: rather than awaiting instruction, they exercise agency to anticipate user needs and solve them autonomously. However, evaluating proactivity is challenging; current benchmarks are constrained to localized context, limiting their ability to test reasoning across sources and longer time horizons. To address this gap, we present PROBE (Proactive Resolution Of BottlEnecks). PROBE decomposes proactivity as a pipeline of three core capabilities: (1) searching for unspecified issues, (2) identifying specific bottlenecks, and (3) executing appropriate resolutions. We apply PROBE to evaluate leading LLMs and popular agentic frameworks, showing that even state-of-the-art models struggle to solve this benchmark. Computing our consistent measurements across frontier LLMs and agents, we find that the best end-to-end performance of 40% is achieved by both GPT-5 and Claude Opus-4.1. Additionally, we demonstrate the relative capabilities of each model and analyze mutual failure modes. Our results highlight the current limitations of autonomous action in agentic systems, and expose promising future research directions.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great promise in automating data analytics tasks by interpreting natural language queries and generating multi-operation execution plans. However, existing LLM-agent-based analytics frameworks operate under the assumption of centralized data access, offering little to no privacy protection. In contrast, federated analytics (FA) enables privacy-preserving computation across distributed data sources, but lacks support for natural language input and requires structured, machine-readable queries. In this work, we present LAFA, the first system that integrates LLM-agent-based data analytics with FA. LAFA introduces a hierarchical multi-agent architecture that accepts natural language queries and transforms them into optimized, executable FA workflows. A coarse-grained planner first decomposes complex queries into sub-queries, while a fine-grained planner maps each subquery into a Directed Acyclic Graph of FA operations using prior structural knowledge. To improve execution efficiency, an optimizer agent rewrites and merges multiple DAGs, eliminating redundant operations and minimizing computational and communicational overhead. Our experiments demonstrate that LAFA consistently outperforms baseline prompting strategies by achieving higher execution plan success rates and reducing resource-intensive FA operations by a substantial margin. This work establishes a practical foundation for privacy-preserving, LLM-driven analytics that supports natural language input in the FA setting.

  Recent studies suggest that the deeper layers of Large Language Models (LLMs) contribute little to representation learning and can often be removed without significant performance loss. However, such claims are typically drawn from narrow evaluations and may overlook important aspects of model behavior. In this work, we present a systematic study of depth utilization across diverse dimensions, including evaluation protocols, task categories, and model architectures. Our analysis confirms that very deep layers are generally less effective than earlier ones, but their contributions vary substantially with the evaluation setting. Under likelihood-based metrics without generation, pruning most layers preserves performance, with only the initial few being critical. By contrast, generation-based evaluation uncovers indispensable roles for middle and deeper layers in enabling reasoning and maintaining long-range coherence. We further find that knowledge and retrieval are concentrated in shallow components, whereas reasoning accuracy relies heavily on deeper layers -- yet can be reshaped through distillation. These results highlight that depth usage in LLMs is highly heterogeneous and context-dependent, underscoring the need for task-, metric-, and model-aware perspectives in both interpreting and compressing large models.

  Graph-based Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has become a widely studied approach for improving the reasoning, accuracy, and factuality of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, many existing graph-based RAG systems overlook the high cost associated with LLM token usage during graph construction, hindering large-scale adoption. To address this, we propose TERAG, a simple yet effective framework designed to build informative graphs at a significantly lower cost. Inspired by HippoRAG, we incorporate Personalized PageRank (PPR) during the retrieval phase, and we achieve at least 80% of the accuracy of widely used graph-based RAG methods while consuming only 3%-11% of the output tokens. With its low token footprint and efficient construction pipeline, TERAG is well-suited for large-scale and cost-sensitive deployment scenarios.

  We propose Collab-REC, a multi-agent framework designed to counteract popularity bias and enhance diversity in tourism recommendations. In our setting, three LLM-based agents -- Personalization, Popularity, and Sustainability generate city suggestions from complementary perspectives. A non-LLM moderator then merges and refines these proposals via multi-round negotiation, ensuring each agent's viewpoint is incorporated while penalizing spurious or repeated responses. Experiments on European city queries show that Collab-REC improves diversity and overall relevance compared to a single-agent baseline, surfacing lesser-visited locales that often remain overlooked. This balanced, context-aware approach addresses over-tourism and better aligns with constraints provided by the user, highlighting the promise of multi-stakeholder collaboration in LLM-driven recommender systems.

In this paper, we introduce Refine-n-Judge, an automated iterative approach that leverages a single LLM as both a refiner and a judge to enhance dataset quality. Unlike existing iterative refinement methods, Refine-n-Judge employs an LLM to both generate refinements and explicitly evaluate each improvement, ensuring that every iteration meaningfully enhances the dataset without requiring additional human annotation or a separate reward model. At each step, the LLM refines a response and judges whether the refinement is an improvement over the previous answer. This process continues until the LLM prefers the initial answer over the refinement, indicating no further improvements. This produces sequences of increasing quality, preference-labeled responses ideal for fine-tuning.We demonstrate the effectiveness of Refine-n-Judge across a range of public datasets spanning five corpora, targeting tasks such as coding, math, and conversation. Models (Llama 3.1-8B and Llama 3.3-70B) fine-tuned on Refine-n-Judge-enhanced datasets were preferred by LLM judges in over 74% of comparisons against models tuned on the original dataset by GPT-4. Additionally, we report performance gains: +5% on AlpacaEval and AlpacaEval 2.0, and +19% on MT-Bench. Our results indicate that Refine-n-Judge produces high-quality datasets and scalable model improvements.

  We propose V-Droid, a mobile GUI task automation agent. Unlike previous mobile agents that utilize Large Language Models (LLMs) as generators to directly generate actions at each step, V-Droid employs LLMs as verifiers to evaluate candidate actions before making final decisions. To realize this novel paradigm, we introduce a comprehensive framework for constructing verifier-driven mobile agents: the discretized action space construction coupled with the prefilling-only workflow to accelerate the verification process, the pair-wise progress preference training to significantly enhance the verifier's decision-making capabilities, and the scalable human-agent joint annotation scheme to efficiently collect the necessary data at scale. V-Droid obtains a substantial task success rate across several public mobile task automation benchmarks: 59.5% on AndroidWorld, 38.3% on AndroidLab, and 49% on MobileAgentBench, surpassing existing agents by 5.2%, 2.1%, and 9%, respectively. Furthermore, V-Droid achieves a remarkably low latency of 4.3s per step, which is 6.1x faster compared with existing mobile agents. The source code is available atthis https URL.
