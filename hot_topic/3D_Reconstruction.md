  A well-known pitfall of molecular generative models is that they are not guaranteed to generate synthesizable molecules. There have been considerable attempts to address this problem, but given the exponentially large combinatorial space of synthesizable molecules, existing methods have shown limited coverage of the space and poor molecular optimization performance. To tackle these problems, we introduce ReaSyn, a generative framework for synthesizable projection where the model explores the neighborhood of given molecules in the synthesizable space by generating pathways that result in synthesizable analogs. To fully utilize the chemical knowledge contained in the synthetic pathways, we propose a novel perspective that views synthetic pathways akin to reasoning paths in large language models (LLMs). Specifically, inspired by chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning in LLMs, we introduce the chain-of-reaction (CoR) notation that explicitly states reactants, reaction types, and intermediate products for each step in a pathway. With the CoR notation, ReaSyn can get dense supervision in every reaction step to explicitly learn chemical reaction rules during supervised training and perform step-by-step reasoning. In addition, to further enhance the reasoning capability of ReaSyn, we propose reinforcement learning (RL)-based finetuning and goal-directed test-time compute scaling tailored for synthesizable projection. ReaSyn achieves the highest reconstruction rate and pathway diversity in synthesizable molecule reconstruction and the highest optimization performance in synthesizable goal-directed molecular optimization, and significantly outperforms previous synthesizable projection methods in synthesizable hit expansion. These results highlight ReaSyn's superior ability to navigate combinatorially-large synthesizable chemical space.

- **[A Unified Theory of Exact Inference and Learning in Exponential Family Latent Variable Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19501)**  `arXiv:2404.19501`  `cs.LG`

  Bayes' rule describes how to infer posterior beliefs about latent variables given observations, and inference is a critical step in learning algorithms for latent variable models (LVMs). Although there are exact algorithms for inference and learning for certain LVMs such as linear Gaussian models and mixture models, researchers must typically develop approximate inference and learning algorithms when applying novel LVMs. Here we study the line that separates LVMs that rely on approximation schemes from those that do not, and develop a general theory of exponential family LVMs for which inference and learning may be implemented exactly. Firstly, under mild assumptions about the exponential family form of the LVM, we derive a necessary and sufficient constraint on the parameters of the LVM under which the prior and posterior over the latent variables are in the same exponential family. We then show that a variety of well-known and novel models indeed have this constrained, exponential family form. Finally, we derive generalized inference and learning algorithms for these LVMs, and demonstrate them with a variety of examples. Our unified perspective facilitates both understanding and implementing exact inference and learning algorithms for a wide variety of models, and may guide researchers in the discovery of new models that avoid unnecessary approximations.

- **[cadrille: Multi-modal CAD Reconstruction with Online Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22914)**  `arXiv:2505.22914`  `cs.CV` `cs.LG`  
  _Maksim Kolodiazhnyi, Denis Tarasov, Dmitrii Zhemchuzhnikov, Alexander Nikulin, Ilya Zisman, Anna Vorontsova, et al._

  Computer-Aided Design (CAD) plays a central role in engineering and manufacturing, making it possible to create precise and editable 3D models. Using a variety of sensor or user-provided data as inputs for CAD reconstruction can democratize access to design applications. However, existing methods typically focus on a single input modality, such as point clouds, images, or text, which limits their generalizability and robustness. Leveraging recent advances in vision-language models (VLM), we propose a multi-modal CAD reconstruction model that simultaneously processes all three input modalities. Inspired by large language model (LLM) training paradigms, we adopt a two-stage pipeline: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on large-scale procedurally generated data, followed by reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning using online feedback, obtained programatically. Furthermore, we are the first to explore RL fine-tuning of LLMs for CAD tasks demonstrating that online RL algorithms such as Group Relative Preference Optimization (GRPO) outperform offline alternatives. In the DeepCAD benchmark, our SFT model outperforms existing single-modal approaches in all three input modalities simultaneously. More importantly, after RL fine-tuning, cadrille sets new state-of-the-art on three challenging datasets, including a real-world one.

- **[MapAnything: Universal Feed-Forward Metric 3D Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13414)**  `arXiv:2509.13414`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI` `cs.LG` `cs.RO`  
  _Nikhil Keetha, Norman M√ºller, Johannes Sch√∂nberger, Lorenzo Porzi, Yuchen Zhang, Tobias Fischer, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce MapAnything, a unified transformer-based feed-forward model that ingests one or more images along with optional geometric inputs such as camera intrinsics, poses, depth, or partial reconstructions, and then directly regresses the metric 3D scene geometry and cameras. MapAnything leverages a factored representation of multi-view scene geometry, i.e., a collection of depth maps, local ray maps, camera poses, and a metric scale factor that effectively upgrades local reconstructions into a globally consistent metric frame. Standardizing the supervision and training across diverse datasets, along with flexible input augmentation, enables MapAnything to address a broad range of 3D vision tasks in a single feed-forward pass, including uncalibrated structure-from-motion, calibrated multi-view stereo, monocular depth estimation, camera localization, depth completion, and more. We provide extensive experimental analyses and model ablations demonstrating that MapAnything outperforms or matches specialist feed-forward models while offering more efficient joint training behavior, thus paving the way toward a universal 3D reconstruction backbone.

- **[AttentionDrop: A Novel Regularization Method for Transformer Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12088)**  `arXiv:2504.12088`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI` `cs.LG`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Transformer-based architectures achieve state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of tasks in natural language processing, computer vision, and speech processing. However, their immense capacity often leads to overfitting, especially when training data is limited or noisy. In this research, a unified family of stochastic regularization techniques has been proposed, i.e. AttentionDrop with its three different variants, which operate directly on the self-attention distributions. Hard Attention Masking randomly zeroes out top-k attention logits per query to encourage diverse context utilization, Blurred Attention Smoothing applies a dynamic Gaussian convolution over attention logits to diffuse overly peaked distributions, and Consistency-Regularized AttentionDrop enforces output stability under multiple independent AttentionDrop perturbations via a KL-based consistency loss. Results achieved in the study demonstrate that AttentionDrop consistently improves accuracy, calibration, and adversarial robustness over standard Dropout, DropConnect, and R-Drop baselines

- **[See&Trek: Training-Free Spatial Prompting for Multimodal Large Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16087)**  `arXiv:2509.16087`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`  
  _Pengteng Li, Pinhao Song, Wuyang Li, Weiyu Guo, Huizai Yao, Yijie Xu, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce SEE&TREK, the first training-free prompting framework tailored to enhance the spatial understanding of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMS) under vision-only constraints. While prior efforts have incorporated modalities like depth or point clouds to improve spatial reasoning, purely visualspatial understanding remains underexplored. SEE&TREK addresses this gap by focusing on two core principles: increasing visual diversity and motion reconstruction. For visual diversity, we conduct Maximum Semantic Richness Sampling, which employs an off-the-shell perception model to extract semantically rich keyframes that capture scene structure. For motion reconstruction, we simulate visual trajectories and encode relative spatial positions into keyframes to preserve both spatial relations and temporal coherence. Our method is training&GPU-free, requiring only a single forward pass, and can be seamlessly integrated into existing MLLM'S. Extensive experiments on the VSI-B ENCH and STI-B ENCH show that S EE &T REK consistently boosts various MLLM S performance across diverse spatial reasoning tasks with the most +3.5% improvement, offering a promising path toward stronger spatial intelligence.

- **[FloorSAM: SAM-Guided Floorplan Reconstruction with Semantic-Geometric Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15750)**  `arXiv:2509.15750`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reconstructing building floor plans from point cloud data is key for indoor navigation, BIM, and precise measurements. Traditional methods like geometric algorithms and Mask R-CNN-based deep learning often face issues with noise, limited generalization, and loss of geometric details. We propose FloorSAM, a framework that integrates point cloud density maps with the Segment Anything Model (SAM) for accurate floor plan reconstruction from LiDAR data. Using grid-based filtering, adaptive resolution projection, and image enhancement, we create robust top-down density maps. FloorSAM uses SAM's zero-shot learning for precise room segmentation, improving reconstruction across diverse layouts. Room masks are generated via adaptive prompt points and multistage filtering, followed by joint mask and point cloud analysis for contour extraction and regularization. This produces accurate floor plans and recovers room topological relationships. Tests on Giblayout and ISPRS datasets show better accuracy, recall, and robustness than traditional methods, especially in noisy and complex settings. Code and materials:this http URL.

- **[CAGE: Continuity-Aware edGE Network Unlocks Robust Floorplan Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15459)**  `arXiv:2509.15459`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`  
  _Yiyi Liu, Chunyang Liu, Weiqin Jiao, Bojian Wu, Fashuai Li, Biao Xiong_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present \textbf{CAGE} (\textit{Continuity-Aware edGE}) network, a \textcolor{red}{robust} framework for reconstructing vector floorplans directly from point-cloud density maps. Traditional corner-based polygon representations are highly sensitive to noise and incomplete observations, often resulting in fragmented or implausible layouts. Recent line grouping methods leverage structural cues to improve robustness but still struggle to recover fine geometric details. To address these limitations, we propose a \textit{native} edge-centric formulation, modeling each wall segment as a directed, geometrically continuous edge. This representation enables inference of coherent floorplan structures, ensuring watertight, topologically valid room boundaries while improving robustness and reducing artifacts. Towards this design, we develop a dual-query transformer decoder that integrates perturbed and latent queries within a denoising framework, which not only stabilizes optimization but also accelerates convergence. Extensive experiments on Structured3D and SceneCAD show that \textbf{CAGE} achieves state-of-the-art performance, with F1 scores of 99.1\% (rooms), 91.7\% (corners), and 89.3\% (angles). The method also demonstrates strong cross-dataset generalization, underscoring the efficacy of our architectural innovations. Code and pretrained models will be released upon acceptance.

- **[UniMRSeg: Unified Modality-Relax Segmentation via Hierarchical Self-Supervised Compensation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16170)**  `arXiv:2509.16170`  `cs.CV`  
  _Xiaoqi Zhao, Youwei Pang, Chenyang Yu, Lihe Zhang, Huchuan Lu, Shijian Lu, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multi-modal image segmentation faces real-world deployment challenges from incomplete/corrupted modalities degrading performance. While existing methods address training-inference modality gaps via specialized per-combination models, they introduce high deployment costs by requiring exhaustive model subsets and model-modality matching. In this work, we propose a unified modality-relax segmentation network (UniMRSeg) through hierarchical self-supervised compensation (HSSC). Our approach hierarchically bridges representation gaps between complete and incomplete modalities across input, feature and output levels. %First, we adopt modality reconstruction with the hybrid shuffled-masking augmentation, encouraging the model to learn the intrinsic modality characteristics and generate meaningful representations for missing modalities through cross-modal fusion. %Next, modality-invariant contrastive learning implicitly compensates the feature space distance among incomplete-complete modality pairs. Furthermore, the proposed lightweight reverse attention adapter explicitly compensates for the weak perceptual semantics in the frozen encoder. Last, UniMRSeg is fine-tuned under the hybrid consistency constraint to ensure stable prediction under all modality combinations without large performance fluctuations. Without bells and whistles, UniMRSeg significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods under diverse missing modality scenarios on MRI-based brain tumor segmentation, RGB-D semantic segmentation, RGB-D/T salient object segmentation. The code will be released atthis https URL.

- **[RadarGaussianDet3D: An Efficient and Effective Gaussian-based 3D Detector with 4D Automotive Radars](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16119)**  `arXiv:2509.16119`  `cs.CV`  
  _Weiyi Xiong, Bing Zhu, Tao Huang, Zewei Zheng_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  4D automotive radars have gained increasing attention for autonomous driving due to their low cost, robustness, and inherent velocity measurement capability. However, existing 4D radar-based 3D detectors rely heavily on pillar encoders for BEV feature extraction, where each point contributes to only a single BEV grid, resulting in sparse feature maps and degraded representation quality. In addition, they also optimize bounding box attributes independently, leading to sub-optimal detection accuracy. Moreover, their inference speed, while sufficient for high-end GPUs, may fail to meet the real-time requirement on vehicle-mounted embedded devices. To overcome these limitations, an efficient and effective Gaussian-based 3D detector, namely RadarGaussianDet3D is introduced, leveraging Gaussian primitives and distributions as intermediate representations for radar points and bounding boxes. In RadarGaussianDet3D, a novel Point Gaussian Encoder (PGE) is designed to transform each point into a Gaussian primitive after feature aggregation and employs the 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) technique for BEV rasterization, yielding denser feature maps. PGE exhibits exceptionally low latency, owing to the optimized algorithm for point feature aggregation and fast rendering of 3DGS. In addition, a new Box Gaussian Loss (BGL) is proposed, which converts bounding boxes into 3D Gaussian distributions and measures their distance to enable more comprehensive and consistent optimization. Extensive experiments on TJ4DRadSet and View-of-Delft demonstrate that RadarGaussianDet3D achieves state-of-the-art detection accuracy while delivering substantially faster inference, highlighting its potential for real-time deployment in autonomous driving.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Generating continuous surfaces from discrete point cloud data is a fundamental task in several 3D vision applications. Real-world point clouds are inherently noisy due to various technical and environmental factors. Existing data-driven surface reconstruction algorithms rely heavily on ground truth normals or compute approximate normals as an intermediate step. This dependency makes them extremely unreliable for noisy point cloud datasets, even if the availability of ground truth training data is ensured, which is not always the case. B-spline reconstruction techniques provide compact surface representations of point clouds and are especially known for their smoothening properties. However, the complexity of the surfaces approximated using B-splines is directly influenced by the number and location of the spline control points. Existing spline-based modeling methods predict the locations of a fixed number of control points for a given point cloud, which makes it very difficult to match the complexity of its underlying surface. In this work, we develop a Dictionary-Guided Graph Convolutional Network-based surface reconstruction strategy where we simultaneously predict both the location and the number of control points for noisy point cloud data to generate smooth surfaces without the use of any point normals. We compare our reconstruction method with several well-known as well as recent baselines by employing widely-used evaluation metrics, and demonstrate that our method outperforms all of them both qualitatively and quantitatively.

- **[Minimal Semantic Sufficiency Meets Unsupervised Domain Generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15791)**  `arXiv:2509.15791`  `cs.CV`  
  _Tan Pan, Kaiyu Guo, Dongli Xu, Zhaorui Tan, Chen Jiang, Deshu Chen, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The generalization ability of deep learning has been extensively studied in supervised settings, yet it remains less explored in unsupervised scenarios. Recently, the Unsupervised Domain Generalization (UDG) task has been proposed to enhance the generalization of models trained with prevalent unsupervised learning techniques, such as Self-Supervised Learning (SSL). UDG confronts the challenge of distinguishing semantics from variations without category labels. Although some recent methods have employed domain labels to tackle this issue, such domain labels are often unavailable in real-world contexts. In this paper, we address these limitations by formalizing UDG as the task of learning a Minimal Sufficient Semantic Representation: a representation that (i) preserves all semantic information shared across augmented views (sufficiency), and (ii) maximally removes information irrelevant to semantics (minimality). We theoretically ground these objectives from the perspective of information theory, demonstrating that optimizing representations to achieve sufficiency and minimality directly reduces out-of-distribution risk. Practically, we implement this optimization through Minimal-Sufficient UDG (MS-UDG), a learnable model by integrating (a) an InfoNCE-based objective to achieve sufficiency; (b) two complementary components to promote minimality: a novel semantic-variation disentanglement loss and a reconstruction-based mechanism for capturing adequate variation. Empirically, MS-UDG sets a new state-of-the-art on popular unsupervised domain-generalization benchmarks, consistently outperforming existing SSL and UDG methods, without category or domain labels during representation learning.

- **[Camera Splatting for Continuous View Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15677)**  `arXiv:2509.15677`  `cs.CV`  
  _Gahye Lee, Hyomin Kim, Gwangjin Ju, Jooeun Son, Hyejeong Yoon, Seungyong Lee_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We propose Camera Splatting, a novel view optimization framework for novel view synthesis. Each camera is modeled as a 3D Gaussian, referred to as a camera splat, and virtual cameras, termed point cameras, are placed at 3D points sampled near the surface to observe the distribution of camera splats. View optimization is achieved by continuously and differentiably refining the camera splats so that desirable target distributions are observed from the point cameras, in a manner similar to the original 3D Gaussian splatting. Compared to the Farthest View Sampling (FVS) approach, our optimized views demonstrate superior performance in capturing complex view-dependent phenomena, including intense metallic reflections and intricate textures such as text.

  _Hao Liu_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Point cloud data represents a crucial category of information for mathematical modeling, and surface reconstruction from such data is an important task across various disciplines. However, during the scanning process, the collected point cloud data may fail to cover the entire surface due to factors such as high light-absorption rate and occlusions, resulting in incomplete datasets. Inferring surface structures in data-missing regions and successfully reconstructing the surface poses a challenge. In this paper, we present a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) based model for surface reconstruction from incomplete point cloud data. Initially, we employ PCA to estimate the normal information of the underlying surface from the available point cloud data. This estimated normal information serves as a regularizer in our model, guiding the reconstruction of the surface, particularly in areas with missing data. Additionally, we introduce an operator-splitting method to effectively solve the proposed model. Through systematic experimentation, we demonstrate that our model successfully infers surface structures in data-missing regions and well reconstructs the underlying surfaces, outperforming existing methodologies.

- **[GS-Scale: Unlocking Large-Scale 3D Gaussian Splatting Training via Host Offloading](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15645)**  `arXiv:2509.15645`  `cs.CV`  
  _Donghyun Lee, Dawoon Jeong, Jae W. Lee, Hongil Yoon_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The advent of 3D Gaussian Splatting has revolutionized graphics rendering by delivering high visual quality and fast rendering speeds. However, training large-scale scenes at high quality remains challenging due to the substantial memory demands required to store parameters, gradients, and optimizer states, which can quickly overwhelm GPU memory. To address these limitations, we propose GS-Scale, a fast and memory-efficient training system for 3D Gaussian Splatting. GS-Scale stores all Gaussians in host memory, transferring only a subset to the GPU on demand for each forward and backward pass. While this dramatically reduces GPU memory usage, it requires frustum culling and optimizer updates to be executed on the CPU, introducing slowdowns due to CPU's limited compute and memory bandwidth. To mitigate this, GS-Scale employs three system-level optimizations: (1) selective offloading of geometric parameters for fast frustum culling, (2) parameter forwarding to pipeline CPU optimizer updates with GPU computation, and (3) deferred optimizer update to minimize unnecessary memory accesses for Gaussians with zero gradients. Our extensive evaluations on large-scale datasets demonstrate that GS-Scale significantly lowers GPU memory demands by 3.3-5.6x, while achieving training speeds comparable to GPU without host offloading. This enables large-scale 3D Gaussian Splatting training on consumer-grade GPUs; for instance, GS-Scale can scale the number of Gaussians from 4 million to 18 million on an RTX 4070 Mobile GPU, leading to 23-35% LPIPS (learned perceptual image patch similarity) improvement.

- **[MS-GS: Multi-Appearance Sparse-View 3D Gaussian Splatting in the Wild](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15548)**  `arXiv:2509.15548`  `cs.CV`  
  _Deming Li, Kaiwen Jiang, Yutao Tang, Ravi Ramamoorthi, Rama Chellappa, Cheng Peng_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In-the-wild photo collections often contain limited volumes of imagery and exhibit multiple appearances, e.g., taken at different times of day or seasons, posing significant challenges to scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis. Although recent adaptations of Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have improved in these areas, they tend to oversmooth and are prone to overfitting. In this paper, we present MS-GS, a novel framework designed with Multi-appearance capabilities in Sparse-view scenarios using 3DGS. To address the lack of support due to sparse initializations, our approach is built on the geometric priors elicited from monocular depth estimations. The key lies in extracting and utilizing local semantic regions with a Structure-from-Motion (SfM) points anchored algorithm for reliable alignment and geometry cues. Then, to introduce multi-view constraints, we propose a series of geometry-guided supervision at virtual views in a fine-grained and coarse scheme to encourage 3D consistency and reduce overfitting. We also introduce a dataset and an in-the-wild experiment setting to set up more realistic benchmarks. We demonstrate that MS-GS achieves photorealistic renderings under various challenging sparse-view and multi-appearance conditions and outperforms existing approaches significantly across different datasets.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  AI generative models leave implicit traces in their generated images, which are commonly referred to as model fingerprints and are exploited for source attribution. Prior methods rely on model-specific cues or synthesis artifacts, yielding limited fingerprints that may generalize poorly across different generative models. We argue that a complete model fingerprint should reflect the causality between image provenance and model traces, a direction largely unexplored. To this end, we conceptualize the \emph{causal fingerprint} of generative models, and propose a causality-decoupling framework that disentangles it from image-specific content and style in a semantic-invariant latent space derived from pre-trained diffusion reconstruction residual. We further enhance fingerprint granularity with diverse feature representations. We validate causality by assessing attribution performance across representative GANs and diffusion models and by achieving source anonymization using counterfactual examples generated from causal fingerprints. Experiments show our approach outperforms existing methods in model attribution, indicating strong potential for forgery detection, model copyright tracing, and identity protection.

  _Jaydeep Rade, Md Hasibul Hasan Hasib, Meric Ozturk, Baboucarr Faal, Sheng Yang, Dipali G. Sashital, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  AI-based in silico methods have improved protein structure prediction but often struggle with large protein complexes (PCs) involving multiple interacting proteins due to missing 3D spatial cues. Experimental techniques like Cryo-EM are accurate but costly and time-consuming. We present ProFusion, a hybrid framework that integrates a deep learning model with Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), which provides high-resolution height maps from random orientations, naturally yielding multi-view data for 3D reconstruction. However, generating a large-scale AFM imaging data set sufficient to train deep learning models is impractical. Therefore, we developed a virtual AFM framework that simulates the imaging process and generated a dataset of ~542,000 proteins with multi-view synthetic AFM images. We train a conditional diffusion model to synthesize novel views from unposed inputs and an instance-specific Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) model to reconstruct 3D structures. Our reconstructed 3D protein structures achieve an average Chamfer Distance within the AFM imaging resolution, reflecting high structural fidelity. Our method is extensively validated on experimental AFM images of various PCs, demonstrating strong potential for accurate, cost-effective protein complex structure prediction and rapid iterative validation using AFM experiments.

- **[USCTNet: A deep unfolding nuclear-norm optimization solver for physically consistent HSI reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10651)**  `arXiv:2509.10651`  `cs.CV`  
  _Xiaoyang Ma, Yiyang Chai, Xinran Qu, Hong Sun_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reconstructing hyperspectral images (HSIs) from a single RGB image is ill-posed and can become physically inconsistent when the camera spectral sensitivity (CSS) and scene illumination are misspecified. We formulate RGB-to-HSI reconstruction as a physics-grounded inverse problem regularized by a nuclear norm in a learnable transform domain, and we explicitly estimate CSS and illumination to define the forward operator embedded in each iteration, ensuring colorimetric consistency. To avoid the cost and instability of full singular-value decompositions (SVDs) required by singular-value thresholding (SVT), we introduce a data-adaptive low-rank subspace SVT operator. Building on these components, we develop USCTNet, a deep unfolding solver tailored to HSI that couples a parameter estimation module with learnable proximal updates. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks show consistent improvements over state-of-the-art RGB-based methods in reconstruction accuracy. Code:this https URL

- **[MCGA: Mixture of Codebooks Hyperspectral Reconstruction via Grayscale-Aware Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09885)**  `arXiv:2507.09885`  `cs.CV`  
  _Zhanjiang Yang, Lijun Sun, Jiawei Dong, Xiaoxin An, Yang Liu, Meng Li_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reconstructing hyperspectral images (HSIs) from RGB inputs provides a cost-effective alternative to hyperspectral cameras, but reconstructing high-dimensional spectra from three channels is inherently ill-posed. Existing methods typically directly regress RGB-to-HSI mappings using large attention networks, which are computationally expensive and handle ill-posedness only implicitly. We propose MCGA, a Mixture-of-Codebooks with Grayscale-aware Attention framework that explicitly addresses these challenges using spectral priors and photometric consistency. MCGA first learns transferable spectral priors via a mixture-of-codebooks (MoC) from heterogeneous HSI datasets, then aligns RGB features with these priors through grayscale-aware photometric attention (GANet). Efficiency and robustness are further improved via top-K attention design and test-time adaptation (TTA). Experiments on benchmarks and real-world data demonstrate the state-of-the-art accuracy, strong cross-dataset generalization, and 4-5x faster inference. Codes will be available once acceptance atthis https URL.

- **[CADSpotting: Robust Panoptic Symbol Spotting on Large-Scale CAD Drawings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07377)**  `arXiv:2412.07377`  `cs.CV`  
  _Fuyi Yang, Jiazuo Mu, Yanshun Zhang, Mingqian Zhang, Junxiong Zhang, Yongjian Luo, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce CADSpotting, an effective method for panoptic symbol spotting in large-scale architectural CAD drawings. Existing approaches often struggle with symbol diversity, scale variations, and overlapping elements in CAD designs, and typically rely on additional features (e.g., primitive types or graphical layers) to improve performance. CADSpotting overcomes these challenges by representing primitives through densely sampled points with only coordinate attributes, using a unified 3D point cloud model for robust feature learning. To enable accurate segmentation in large drawings, we further propose a novel Sliding Window Aggregation (SWA) technique that combines weighted voting and Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS). Moreover, we introduce LS-CAD, a new large-scale dataset comprising 45 finely annotated floorplans, each covering approximately 1,000 $m^2$, significantly larger than prior benchmarks. LS-CAD will be publicly released to support future research. Experiments on FloorPlanCAD and LS-CAD demonstrate that CADSpotting significantly outperforms existing methods. We also showcase its practical value by enabling automated parametric 3D interior reconstruction directly from raw CAD inputs.
