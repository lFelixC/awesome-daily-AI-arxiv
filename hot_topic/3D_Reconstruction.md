- **[CLEAR-IR: Clarity-Enhanced Active Reconstruction of Infrared Imagery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04883)**  `arXiv:2510.04883`  `cs.RO` `cs.CV` `cs.LG`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper presents a novel approach for enabling robust robotic perception in dark environments using infrared (IR) stream. IR stream is less susceptible to noise than RGB in low-light conditions. However, it is dominated by active emitter patterns that hinder high-level tasks such as object detection, tracking and localisation. To address this, a U-Net-based architecture is proposed that reconstructs clean IR images from emitter-populated input, improving both image quality and downstream robotic performance. This approach outperforms existing enhancement techniques and enables reliable operation of vision-driven robotic systems across illumination conditions from well-lit to extreme low-light scenes.

- **[Efficient Surgical Robotic Instrument Pose Reconstruction in Real World Conditions Using Unified Feature Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03532)**  `arXiv:2510.03532`  `cs.RO` `cs.CV`

  Accurate camera-to-robot calibration is essential for any vision-based robotic control system and especially critical in minimally invasive surgical robots, where instruments conduct precise micro-manipulations. However, MIS robots have long kinematic chains and partial visibility of their degrees of freedom in the camera, which introduces challenges for conventional camera-to-robot calibration methods that assume stiff robots with good visibility. Previous works have investigated both keypoint-based and rendering-based approaches to address this challenge in real-world conditions; however, they often struggle with consistent feature detection or have long inference times, neither of which are ideal for online robot control. In this work, we propose a novel framework that unifies the detection of geometric primitives (keypoints and shaft edges) through a shared encoding, enabling efficient pose estimation via projection geometry. This architecture detects both keypoints and edges in a single inference and is trained on large-scale synthetic data with projective labeling. This method is evaluated across both feature detection and pose estimation, with qualitative and quantitative results demonstrating fast performance and state-of-the-art accuracy in challenging surgical environments.

  Model predictive control (MPC) faces significant limitations when applied to systems evolving on nonlinear manifolds, such as robotic attitude dynamics and constrained motion planning, where traditional Euclidean formulations struggle with singularities, over-parameterization, and poor convergence. To overcome these challenges, this paper introduces FactorMPC, a factor-graph based MPC toolkit that unifies system dynamics, constraints, and objectives into a modular, user-friendly, and efficient optimization structure. Our approach natively supports manifold-valued states with Gaussian uncertainties modeled in tangent spaces. By exploiting the sparsity and probabilistic structure of factor graphs, the toolkit achieves real-time performance even for high-dimensional systems with complex constraints. The velocity-extended on-manifold control barrier function (CBF)-based obstacle avoidance factors are designed for safety-critical applications. By bridging graphical models with safety-critical MPC, our work offers a scalable and geometrically consistent framework for integrated planning and control. The simulations and experimental results on the quadrotor demonstrate superior trajectory tracking and obstacle avoidance performance compared to baseline methods. To foster research reproducibility, we have provided open-source implementation offering plug-and-play factors.

  _Salim Rezvani, Ammar Jaleel Mahmood, Robin Chhabra_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Robots with internal visual self-models promise unprecedented adaptability, yet existing autonomous modeling pipelines remain fragile under realistic sensing conditions such as noisy imagery and cluttered backgrounds. This paper presents the first systematic study quantifying how visual degradations--including blur, salt-and-pepper noise, and Gaussian noise--affect robotic self-modeling. Through both simulation and physical experiments, we demonstrate their impact on morphology prediction, trajectory planning, and damage recovery in state-of-the-art pipelines. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a task-aware denoising framework that couples classical restoration with morphology-preserving constraints, ensuring retention of structural cues critical for self-modeling. In addition, we integrate semantic segmentation to robustly isolate robots from cluttered and colorful scenes. Extensive experiments show that our approach restores near-baseline performance across simulated and physical platforms, while existing pipelines degrade significantly. These contributions advance the robustness of visual self-modeling and establish practical foundations for deploying self-aware robots in unpredictable real-world environments.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We propose a framework for active mapping and exploration that leverages Gaussian splatting for constructing dense maps. Further, we develop a GPU-accelerated motion planning algorithm that can exploit the Gaussian map for real-time navigation. The Gaussian map constructed onboard the robot is optimized for both photometric and geometric quality while enabling real-time situational awareness for autonomy. We show through viewpoint selection experiments that our method yields comparable Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and similar reconstruction error to state-of-the-art approaches, while being orders of magnitude faster to compute. In closed-loop physics-based simulation and real-world experiments, our algorithm achieves better map quality (at least 0.8dB higher PSNR and more than 16% higher geometric reconstruction accuracy) than maps constructed by a state-of-the-art method, enabling semantic segmentation using off-the-shelf open-set models.

- **[KVComm: Enabling Efficient LLM Communication through Selective KV Sharing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03346)**  `arXiv:2510.03346`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI` `cs.MA`  
  _Xiangyu Shi, Marco Chiesa, Gerald Q. Maguire Jr., Dejan Kostic_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in multi-agent systems, where effective inter-model communication is crucial. Existing communication protocols either rely on natural language, incurring high inference costs and information loss, or on hidden states, which suffer from information concentration bias and inefficiency. To address these limitations, we propose KVComm, a novel communication framework that enables efficient communication between LLMs through selective sharing of KV pairs. KVComm leverages the rich information encoded in the KV pairs while avoiding the pitfalls of hidden states. We introduce a KV layer-wise selection strategy based on attention importance scores with a Gaussian prior to identify the most informative KV pairs for communication. Extensive experiments across diverse tasks and model pairs demonstrate that KVComm achieves comparable performance to the upper-bound method, which directly merges inputs to one model without any communication, while transmitting as few as 30\% of layers' KV pairs. Our study highlights the potential of KV pairs as an effective medium for inter-LLM communication, paving the way for scalable and efficient multi-agent systems.

- **[Graph-Aware Diffusion for Signal Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05036)**  `arXiv:2510.05036`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Sergio Rozada, Vimal K. B., Andrea Cavallo, Antonio G. Marques, Hadi Jamali-Rad, Elvin Isufi_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We study the problem of generating graph signals from unknown distributions defined over given graphs, relevant to domains such as recommender systems or sensor networks. Our approach builds on generative diffusion models, which are well established in vision and graph generation but remain underexplored for graph signals. Existing methods lack generality, either ignoring the graph structure in the forward process or designing graph-aware mechanisms tailored to specific domains. We adopt a forward process that incorporates the graph through the heat equation. Rather than relying on the standard formulation, we consider a time-warped coefficient to mitigate the exponential decay of the drift term, yielding a graph-aware generative diffusion model (GAD). We analyze its forward dynamics, proving convergence to a Gaussian Markov random field with covariance parametrized by the graph Laplacian, and interpret the backward dynamics as a sequence of graph-signal denoising problems. Finally, we demonstrate the advantages of GAD on synthetic data, real traffic speed measurements, and a temperature sensor network.

- **[Glocal Information Bottleneck for Time Series Imputation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04910)**  `arXiv:2510.04910`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Jie Yang, Kexin Zhang, Guibin Zhang, Philip S. Yu, Kaize Ding_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Time Series Imputation (TSI), which aims to recover missing values in temporal data, remains a fundamental challenge due to the complex and often high-rate missingness in real-world scenarios. Existing models typically optimize the point-wise reconstruction loss, focusing on recovering numerical values (local information). However, we observe that under high missing rates, these models still perform well in the training phase yet produce poor imputations and distorted latent representation distributions (global information) in the inference phase. This reveals a critical optimization dilemma: current objectives lack global guidance, leading models to overfit local noise and fail to capture global information of the data. To address this issue, we propose a new training paradigm, Glocal Information Bottleneck (Glocal-IB). Glocal-IB is model-agnostic and extends the standard IB framework by introducing a Global Alignment loss, derived from a tractable mutual information approximation. This loss aligns the latent representations of masked inputs with those of their originally observed counterparts. It helps the model retain global structure and local details while suppressing noise caused by missing values, giving rise to better generalization under high missingness. Extensive experiments on nine datasets confirm that Glocal-IB leads to consistently improved performance and aligned latent representations under missingness. Our code implementation is available inthis https URL.

- **[Distributionally Robust Causal Abstractions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04842)**  `arXiv:2510.04842`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Yorgos Felekis, Theodoros Damoulas, Paris Giampouras_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Causal Abstraction (CA) theory provides a principled framework for relating causal models that describe the same system at different levels of granularity while ensuring interventional consistency between them. Recently, several approaches for learning CAs have been proposed, but all assume fixed and well-specified exogenous distributions, making them vulnerable to environmental shifts and misspecification. In this work, we address these limitations by introducing the first class of distributionally robust CAs and their associated learning algorithms. The latter cast robust causal abstraction learning as a constrained min-max optimization problem with Wasserstein ambiguity sets. We provide theoretical results, for both empirical and Gaussian environments, leading to principled selection of the level of robustness via the radius of these sets. Furthermore, we present empirical evidence across different problems and CA learning methods, demonstrating our framework's robustness not only to environmental shifts but also to structural model and intervention mapping misspecification.

- **[Adaptive Weighted Loss for Sequential Recommendations on Sparse Domains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04375)**  `arXiv:2510.04375`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Akshay Mittal, Vinay Venkatesh, Krishna Kandi, Shalini Sudarshan_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The effectiveness of single-model sequential recommendation architectures, while scalable, is often limited when catering to "power users" in sparse or niche domains. Our previous research, PinnerFormerLite, addressed this by using a fixed weighted loss to prioritize specific domains. However, this approach can be sub-optimal, as a single, uniform weight may not be sufficient for domains with very few interactions, where the training signal is easily diluted by the vast, generic dataset.This paper proposes a novel, data-driven approach: a Dynamic Weighted Loss function with comprehensive theoretical foundations and extensive empirical validation. We introduce an adaptive algorithm that adjusts the loss weight for each domain based on its sparsity in the training data, assigning a higher weight to sparser domains and a lower weight to denser ones. This ensures that even rare user interests contribute a meaningful gradient signal, preventing them from being overshadowed.We provide rigorous theoretical analysis including convergence proofs, complexity analysis, and bounds analysis to establish the stability and efficiency of our approach. Our comprehensive empirical validation across four diverse datasets (MovieLens, Amazon Electronics, Yelp Business, LastFM Music) with state-of-the-art baselines (SIGMA, CALRec, SparseEnNet) demonstrates that this dynamic weighting system significantly outperforms all comparison methods, particularly for sparse domains, achieving substantial lifts in key metrics like Recall at 10 and NDCG at 10 while maintaining performance on denser domains and introducing minimal computational overhead.

- **[Cross-Modal Reconstruction Pretraining for Ramp Flow Prediction at Highway Interchanges](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03381)**  `arXiv:2510.03381`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Yongchao Li, Jun Chen, Zhuoxuan Li, Chao Gao, Yang Li, Chu Zhang, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Interchanges are crucial nodes for vehicle transfers between highways, yet the lack of real-time ramp detectors creates blind spots in traffic prediction. To address this, we propose a Spatio-Temporal Decoupled Autoencoder (STDAE), a two-stage framework that leverages cross-modal reconstruction pretraining. In the first stage, STDAE reconstructs historical ramp flows from mainline data, forcing the model to capture intrinsic spatio-temporal relations. Its decoupled architecture with parallel spatial and temporal autoencoders efficiently extracts heterogeneous features. In the prediction stage, the learned representations are integrated with models such as GWNet to enhance accuracy. Experiments on three real-world interchange datasets show that STDAE-GWNET consistently outperforms thirteen state-of-the-art baselines and achieves performance comparable to models using historical ramp data. This demonstrates its effectiveness in overcoming detector scarcity and its plug-and-play potential for diverse forecasting pipelines.

- **[Synthesising Counterfactual Explanations via Label-Conditional Gaussian Mixture Variational Autoencoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04855)**  `arXiv:2510.04855`  `cs.LG`  
  _Junqi Jiang, Francesco Leofante, Antonio Rago, Francesca Toni_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Counterfactual explanations (CEs) provide recourse recommendations for individuals affected by algorithmic decisions. A key challenge is generating CEs that are robust against various perturbation types (e.g. input and model perturbations) while simultaneously satisfying other desirable properties. These include plausibility, ensuring CEs reside on the data manifold, and diversity, providing multiple distinct recourse options for single inputs. Existing methods, however, mostly struggle to address these multifaceted requirements in a unified, model-agnostic manner. We address these limitations by proposing a novel generative framework. First, we introduce the Label-conditional Gaussian Mixture Variational Autoencoder (L-GMVAE), a model trained to learn a structured latent space where each class label is represented by a set of Gaussian components with diverse, prototypical centroids. Building on this, we present LAPACE (LAtent PAth Counterfactual Explanations), a model-agnostic algorithm that synthesises entire paths of CE points by interpolating from inputs' latent representations to those learned latent centroids. This approach inherently ensures robustness to input changes, as all paths for a given target class converge to the same fixed centroids. Furthermore, the generated paths provide a spectrum of recourse options, allowing users to navigate the trade-off between proximity and plausibility while also encouraging robustness against model changes. In addition, user-specified actionability constraints can also be easily incorporated via lightweight gradient optimisation through the L-GMVAE's decoder. Comprehensive experiments show that LAPACE is computationally efficient and achieves competitive performance across eight quantitative metrics.

- **[Provable Affine Identifiability of Nonlinear CCA under Latent Distributional Priors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04758)**  `arXiv:2510.04758`  `cs.LG`  
  _Zhiwei Han, Stefan Matthes, Hao Shen_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this work, we establish conditions under which nonlinear CCA recovers the ground-truth latent factors up to an orthogonal transform after whitening. Building on the classical result that linear mappings maximize canonical correlations under Gaussian priors, we prove affine identifiability for a broad class of latent distributions in the population setting. Central to our proof is a reparameterization result that transports the analysis from observation space to source space, where identifiability becomes tractable. We further show that whitening is essential for ensuring boundedness and well-conditioning, thereby underpinning identifiability. Beyond the population setting, we prove that ridge-regularized empirical CCA converges to its population counterpart, transferring these guarantees to the finite-sample regime. Experiments on a controlled synthetic dataset and a rendered image dataset validate our theory and demonstrate the necessity of its assumptions through systematic ablations.

- **[Counterfactual Credit Guided Bayesian Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04676)**  `arXiv:2510.04676`  `cs.LG`  
  _Qiyu Wei, Haowei Wang, Richard Allmendinger, Mauricio A. √Ålvarez_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Bayesian optimization has emerged as a prominent methodology for optimizing expensive black-box functions by leveraging Gaussian process surrogates, which focus on capturing the global characteristics of the objective function. However, in numerous practical scenarios, the primary objective is not to construct an exhaustive global surrogate, but rather to quickly pinpoint the global optimum. Due to the aleatoric nature of the sequential optimization problem and its dependence on the quality of the surrogate model and the initial design, it is restrictive to assume that all observed samples contribute equally to the discovery of the optimum in this context. In this paper, we introduce Counterfactual Credit Guided Bayesian Optimization (CCGBO), a novel framework that explicitly quantifies the contribution of individual historical observations through counterfactual credit. By incorporating counterfactual credit into the acquisition function, our approach can selectively allocate resources in areas where optimal solutions are most likely to occur. We prove that CCGBO retains sublinear regret. Empirical evaluations on various synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrate that CCGBO consistently reduces simple regret and accelerates convergence to the global optimum.

- **[Adaptive kernel-density approach for imbalanced binary classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04046)**  `arXiv:2510.04046`  `cs.LG`  
  _Kotaro J. Nishimura, Yuichi Sakumura, Kazushi Ikeda_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Class imbalance is a common challenge in real-world binary classification tasks, often leading to predictions biased toward the majority class and reduced recognition of the minority class. This issue is particularly critical in domains such as medical diagnosis and anomaly detection, where correct classification of minority classes is essential. Conventional methods often fail to deliver satisfactory performance when the imbalance ratio is extremely severe. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach called Kernel-density-Oriented Threshold Adjustment with Regional Optimization (KOTARO), which extends the framework of kernel density estimation (KDE) by adaptively adjusting decision boundaries according to local sample density. In KOTARO, the bandwidth of Gaussian basis functions is dynamically tuned based on the estimated density around each sample, thereby enhancing the classifier's ability to capture minority regions. We validated the effectiveness of KOTARO through experiments on both synthetic and real-world imbalanced datasets. The results demonstrated that KOTARO outperformed conventional methods, particularly under conditions of severe imbalance, highlighting its potential as a promising solution for a wide range of imbalanced classification problems

- **[ICEPool: Enhancing Graph Pooling Networks with Inter-cluster Connectivity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03987)**  `arXiv:2510.03987`  `cs.LG`  
  _Michael Yang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Hierarchical Pooling Models have demonstrated strong performance in classifying graph-structured data. While numerous innovative methods have been proposed to design cluster assignments and coarsening strategies, the relationships between clusters are often overlooked. In this paper, we introduce Inter-cluster Connectivity Enhancement Pooling (ICEPool), a novel hierarchical pooling framework designed to enhance model's understanding of inter-cluster connectivity and ability of preserving the structural integrity in the original graph. ICEPool is compatible with a wide range of pooling-based GNN models. The deployment of ICEPool as an enhancement to existing models effectively combines the strengths of the original model with ICEPool's capability to emphasize the integration of inter-cluster connectivity, resulting in a more comprehensive and robust graph-level representation. Moreover, we make theoretical analysis to ICEPool's ability of graph reconstruction to demonstrate its effectiveness in learning inter-cluster relationship that is overlooked by conventional models. Finally, the experimental results show the compatibility of ICEPool with wide varieties of models and its potential to boost the performance of existing graph neural network architectures.

- **[FieldFormer: Physics-Informed Transformers for Spatio-Temporal Field Reconstruction from Sparse Sensors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03589)**  `arXiv:2510.03589`  `cs.LG`  
  _Ankit Bhardwaj, Ananth Balashankar, Lakshminarayanan Subramanian_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Spatio-temporal sensor data is often sparse, noisy, and irregular, and existing interpolation or learning methods struggle here because they either ignore governing PDEs or do not scale. We introduce FieldFormer, a transformer-based framework for mesh-free spatio-temporal field reconstruction that combines data-driven flexibility with physics-based structure. For each query, FieldFormer gathers a local neighborhood using a learnable velocity-scaled distance metric, enabling anisotropic adaptation to different propagation regimes. Neighborhoods are built efficiently via per-batch offset recomputation, and refined in an expectation-maximization style as the velocity scales evolve. Predictions are made by a local transformer encoder, and physics consistency is enforced through autograd-based PDE residuals and boundary-specific penalties. Across three benchmarks--a scalar anisotropic heat equation, a vector-valued shallow-water system, and a realistic advection-diffusion pollution simulation--FieldFormer consistently outperforms strong baselines by more than 40%. Our results demonstrate that FieldFormer enables accurate (RMSE$<10^{-2}$), efficient, and physically consistent field reconstruction from sparse (0.4%-2%) and noisy(10%) data.

- **[Measurement-Aligned Sampling for Inverse Problem](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11893)**  `arXiv:2506.11893`  `cs.LG`  
  _Shaorong Zhang, Rob Brekelmans, Yunshu Wu, Greg Ver Steeg_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Diffusion models provide a powerful way to incorporate complex prior information for solving inverse problems. However, existing methods struggle to correctly incorporate guidance from conflicting signals in the prior and measurement, and often failed to maximizing the consistency to the measurement, especially in the challenging setting of non-Gaussian or unknown noise. To address these issues, we propose Measurement-Aligned Sampling (MAS), a novel framework for linear inverse problem solving that flexibly balances prior and measurement information. MAS unifies and extends existing approaches such as DDNM, TMPD, while generalizing to handle both known Gaussian noise and unknown or non-Gaussian noise types. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MAS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across a variety of tasks, while maintaining relatively low computational cost.

- **[Motion Blender Gaussian Splatting for Dynamic Scene Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09040)**  `arXiv:2503.09040`  `cs.CV` `cs.RO`  
  _Xinyu Zhang, Haonan Chang, Yuhan Liu, Abdeslam Boularias_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Gaussian splatting has emerged as a powerful tool for high-fidelity reconstruction of dynamic scenes. However, existing methods primarily rely on implicit motion representations, such as encoding motions into neural networks or per-Gaussian parameters, which makes it difficult to further manipulate the reconstructed motions. This lack of explicit controllability limits existing methods to replaying recorded motions only, which hinders a wider application in robotics. To address this, we propose Motion Blender Gaussian Splatting (MBGS), a novel framework that uses motion graphs as an explicit and sparse motion representation. The motion of a graph's links is propagated to individual Gaussians via dual quaternion skinning, with learnable weight painting functions that determine the influence of each link. The motion graphs and 3D Gaussians are jointly optimized from input videos via differentiable rendering. Experiments show that MBGS achieves state-of-the-art performance on the highly challenging iPhone dataset while being competitive on HyperNeRF. We demonstrate the application potential of our method in animating novel object poses, synthesizing real robot demonstrations, and predicting robot actions through visual planning.

- **[Unsupervised Active Learning via Natural Feature Progressive Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04939)**  `arXiv:2510.04939`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI` `cs.LG`  
  _Yuxi Liu, Catherine Lalman, Yimin Yang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The effectiveness of modern deep learning models is predicated on the availability of large-scale, human-annotated datasets, a process that is notoriously expensive and time-consuming. While Active Learning (AL) offers a strategic solution by labeling only the most informative and representative data, its iterative nature still necessitates significant human involvement. Unsupervised Active Learning (UAL) presents an alternative by shifting the annotation burden to a single, post-selection step. Unfortunately, prevailing UAL methods struggle to achieve state-of-the-art performance. These approaches typically rely on local, gradient-based scoring for sample importance estimation, which not only makes them vulnerable to ambiguous and noisy data but also hinders their capacity to select samples that adequately represent the full data distribution. Moreover, their use of shallow, one-shot linear selection falls short of a true UAL paradigm. In this paper, we propose the Natural Feature Progressive Framework (NFPF), a UAL method that revolutionizes how sample importance is measured. At its core, NFPF employs a Specific Feature Learning Machine (SFLM) to effectively quantify each sample's contribution to model performance. We further utilize the SFLM to define a powerful Reconstruction Difference metric for initial sample selection. Our comprehensive experiments show that NFPF significantly outperforms all established UAL methods and achieves performance on par with supervised AL methods on vision datasets. Detailed ablation studies and qualitative visualizations provide compelling evidence for NFPF's superior performance, enhanced robustness, and improved data distribution coverage.

- **[Inference-Time Search using Side Information for Diffusion-based Image Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03352)**  `arXiv:2510.03352`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI` `cs.LG`  
  _Mahdi Farahbakhsh, Vishnu Teja Kunde, Dileep Kalathil, Krishna Narayanan, Jean-Francois Chamberland_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Diffusion models have emerged as powerful priors for solving inverse problems. However, existing approaches typically overlook side information that could significantly improve reconstruction quality, especially in severely ill-posed settings. In this work, we propose a novel inference-time search algorithm that guides the sampling process using the side information in a manner that balances exploration and exploitation. This enables more accurate and reliable reconstructions, providing an alternative to the gradient-based guidance that is prone to reward-hacking artifacts. Our approach can be seamlessly integrated into a wide range of existing diffusion-based image reconstruction pipelines. Through extensive experiments on a number of inverse problems, such as box inpainting, super-resolution, and various deblurring tasks including motion, Gaussian, nonlinear, and blind deblurring, we show that our approach consistently improves the qualitative and quantitative performance of diffusion-based image reconstruction algorithms. We also show the superior performance of our approach with respect to other baselines, including reward gradient-based guidance algorithms. The code is available at \href{this https URL}{this repository}.

- **[Progressive Gaussian Transformer with Anisotropy-aware Sampling for Open Vocabulary Occupancy Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04759)**  `arXiv:2510.04759`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`  
  _Chi Yan, Dan Xu_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The 3D occupancy prediction task has witnessed remarkable progress in recent years, playing a crucial role in vision-based autonomous driving systems. While traditional methods are limited to fixed semantic categories, recent approaches have moved towards predicting text-aligned features to enable open-vocabulary text queries in real-world scenes. However, there exists a trade-off in text-aligned scene modeling: sparse Gaussian representation struggles to capture small objects in the scene, while dense representation incurs significant computational overhead. To address these limitations, we present PG-Occ, an innovative Progressive Gaussian Transformer Framework that enables open-vocabulary 3D occupancy prediction. Our framework employs progressive online densification, a feed-forward strategy that gradually enhances the 3D Gaussian representation to capture fine-grained scene details. By iteratively enhancing the representation, the framework achieves increasingly precise and detailed scene understanding. Another key contribution is the introduction of an anisotropy-aware sampling strategy with spatio-temporal fusion, which adaptively assigns receptive fields to Gaussians at different scales and stages, enabling more effective feature aggregation and richer scene information capture. Through extensive evaluations, we demonstrate that PG-Occ achieves state-of-the-art performance with a relative 14.3% mIoU improvement over the previous best performing method. Code and pretrained models will be released upon publication on our project page:this https URL

- **[Jasmine: Harnessing Diffusion Prior for Self-supervised Depth Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15905)**  `arXiv:2503.15905`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`  
  _Jiyuan Wang, Chunyu Lin, Cheng Guan, Lang Nie, Jing He, Haodong Li, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this paper, we propose Jasmine, the first Stable Diffusion (SD)-based self-supervised framework for monocular depth estimation, which effectively harnesses SD's visual priors to enhance the sharpness and generalization of unsupervised prediction. Previous SD-based methods are all supervised since adapting diffusion models for dense prediction requires high-precision supervision. In contrast, self-supervised reprojection suffers from inherent challenges (e.g., occlusions, texture-less regions, illumination variance), and the predictions exhibit blurs and artifacts that severely compromise SD's latent priors. To resolve this, we construct a novel surrogate task of hybrid image reconstruction. Without any additional supervision, it preserves the detail priors of SD models by reconstructing the images themselves while preventing depth estimation from degradation. Furthermore, to address the inherent misalignment between SD's scale and shift invariant estimation and self-supervised scale-invariant depth estimation, we build the Scale-Shift GRU. It not only bridges this distribution gap but also isolates the fine-grained texture of SD output against the interference of reprojection loss. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Jasmine achieves SoTA performance on the KITTI benchmark and exhibits superior zero-shot generalization across multiple datasets.

  Recent advancements in video diffusion models enable the generation of photorealistic videos with impressive 3D consistency and temporal coherence. However, the extent to which these AI-generated videos simulate the 3D visual world remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce Learned 3D Evaluation (L3DE), an objective, quantifiable, and interpretable method for assessing AI-generated videos' ability to simulate the real world in terms of 3D visual qualities and consistencies, without requiring manually labeled defects or quality annotations. Instead of relying on 3D reconstruction, which is prone to failure with in-the-wild videos, L3DE employs a 3D convolutional network, trained on monocular 3D cues of motion, depth, and appearance, to distinguish real from synthetic videos. Confidence scores from L3DE quantify the gap between real and synthetic videos in terms of 3D visual coherence, while a gradient-based visualization pinpoints unrealistic regions, improving interpretability. We validate L3DE through extensive experiments, demonstrating strong alignment with 3D reconstruction quality and human judgments. Our evaluations on leading generative models (e.g., Kling, Sora, and MiniMax) reveal persistent simulation gaps and subtle inconsistencies. Beyond generative video assessment, L3DE extends to broader applications: benchmarking video generation models, serving as a deepfake detector, and enhancing video synthesis by inpainting flagged inconsistencies.

  Tokenizers are a key component of state-of-the-art generative image models, extracting the most important features from the signal while reducing data dimension and redundancy. Most current tokenizers are based on KL-regularized variational autoencoders (KL-VAE), trained with reconstruction, perceptual and adversarial losses. Diffusion decoders have been proposed as a more principled alternative to model the distribution over images conditioned on the latent. However, matching the performance of KL-VAE still requires adversarial losses, as well as a higher decoding time due to iterative sampling. To address these limitations, we introduce a new pixel diffusion decoder architecture for improved scaling and training stability, benefiting from transformer components and GAN-free training. We use distillation to replicate the performance of the diffusion decoder in an efficient single-step decoder. This makes SSDD the first diffusion decoder optimized for single-step reconstruction trained without adversarial losses, reaching higher reconstruction quality and faster sampling than KL-VAE. In particular, SSDD improves reconstruction FID from $0.87$ to $0.50$ with $1.4\times$ higher throughput and preserve generation quality of DiTs with $3.8\times$ faster sampling. As such, SSDD can be used as a drop-in replacement for KL-VAE, and for building higher-quality and faster generative models.

  Generating synthetic CT (sCT) from MRI or CBCT plays a crucial role in enabling MRI-only and CBCT-based adaptive radiotherapy, improving treatment precision while reducing patient radiation exposure. To address this task, we adopt a fully 3D Flow Matching (FM) framework, motivated by recent work demonstrating FM's efficiency in producing high-quality images. In our approach, a Gaussian noise volume is transformed into an sCT image by integrating a learned FM velocity field, conditioned on features extracted from the input MRI or CBCT using a lightweight 3D encoder. We evaluated the method on the SynthRAD2025 Challenge benchmark, training separate models for MRI $\rightarrow$ sCT and CBCT $\rightarrow$ sCT across three anatomical regions: abdomen, head and neck, and thorax. Validation and testing were performed through the challenge submission system. The results indicate that the method accurately reconstructs global anatomical structures; however, preservation of fine details was limited, primarily due to the relatively low training resolution imposed by memory and runtime constraints. Future work will explore patch-based training and latent-space flow models to improve resolution and local structural fidelity.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We propose AvatarVTON, the first 4D virtual try-on framework that generates realistic try-on results from a single in-shop garment image, enabling free pose control, novel-view rendering, and diverse garment choices. Unlike existing methods, AvatarVTON supports dynamic garment interactions under single-view supervision, without relying on multi-view garment captures or physics priors. The framework consists of two key modules: (1) a Reciprocal Flow Rectifier, a prior-free optical-flow correction strategy that stabilizes avatar fitting and ensures temporal coherence; and (2) a Non-Linear Deformer, which decomposes Gaussian maps into view-pose-invariant and view-pose-specific components, enabling adaptive, non-linear garment deformations. To establish a benchmark for 4D virtual try-on, we extend existing baselines with unified modules for fair qualitative and quantitative comparisons. Extensive experiments show that AvatarVTON achieves high fidelity, diversity, and dynamic garment realism, making it well-suited for AR/VR, gaming, and digital-human applications.

  High-fidelity 3D scanning is essential for preserving cultural heritage artefacts, supporting documentation, analysis, and long-term conservation. However, conventional methods typically require specialized expertise and manual intervention to maintain optimal scanning conditions and coverage. We present an automated two-robot scanning system that eliminates the need for handheld or semi-automatic workflows by combining coordinated robotic manipulation with high-resolution 3D scanning. Our system parameterizes the scanning space into distinct regions, enabling coordinated motion planning between a scanner-equipped robot and a tray-handling robot. Optimized trajectory planning and waypoint distribution ensure comprehensive surface coverage, minimize occlusions, and balance reconstruction accuracy with system efficiency. Experimental results show that our approach achieves significantly lower Chamfer Distance and higher F-score compared to baseline methods, offering superior geometric accuracy, improved digitization efficiency, and reduced reliance on expert operators.

  4D Gaussian Splatting has emerged as a new paradigm for dynamic scene representation, enabling real-time rendering of scenes with complex motions. However, it faces a major challenge of storage overhead, as millions of Gaussians are required for high-fidelity reconstruction. While several studies have attempted to alleviate this memory burden, they still face limitations in compression ratio or visual quality. In this work, we present OMG4 (Optimized Minimal 4D Gaussian Splatting), a framework that constructs a compact set of salient Gaussians capable of faithfully representing 4D Gaussian models. Our method progressively prunes Gaussians in three stages: (1) Gaussian Sampling to identify primitives critical to reconstruction fidelity, (2) Gaussian Pruning to remove redundancies, and (3) Gaussian Merging to fuse primitives with similar characteristics. In addition, we integrate implicit appearance compression and generalize Sub-Vector Quantization (SVQ) to 4D representations, further reducing storage while preserving quality. Extensive experiments on standard benchmark datasets demonstrate that OMG4 significantly outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods, reducing model sizes by over 60% while maintaining reconstruction quality. These results position OMG4 as a significant step forward in compact 4D scene representation, opening new possibilities for a wide range of applications.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Structured illumination (SI) enhances image resolution and contrast by projecting patterned light onto a sample. In two-phase optical-sectioning SI (OS-SI), reduced acquisition time introduces residual artifacts that conventional denoising struggles to suppress. Deep learning offers an alternative to traditional methods; however, supervised training is limited by the lack of clean, optically sectioned ground-truth data. We investigate encoder-decoder networks for artifact reduction in two-phase OS-SI, using synthetic training pairs formed by applying real artifact fields to synthetic images. An asymmetrical denoising autoencoder (DAE) and a U-Net are trained on the synthetic data, then evaluated on real OS-SI images. Both networks improve image clarity, with each excelling against different artifact types. These results demonstrate that synthetic training enables supervised denoising of OS-SI images and highlight the potential of encoder-decoder networks to streamline reconstruction workflows.

  Sonar images are relevant for advancing underwater exploration, autonomous navigation, and ecosystem monitoring. However, the progress depends on data availability. The scarcity of publicly available, well-annotated sonar image datasets creates a significant bottleneck for the development of robust machine learning models. This paper presents a comprehensive and concise review of the current landscape of sonar image datasets, seeking not only to catalog existing resources but also to contextualize them, identify gaps, and provide a clear roadmap, serving as a base guide for researchers of any kind who wish to start or advance in the field of underwater acoustic data analysis. We mapped publicly accessible datasets across various sonar modalities, including Side Scan Sonar (SSS), Forward-Looking Sonar (FLS), Synthetic Aperture Sonar (SAS), Multibeam Echo Sounder (MBES), and Dual-Frequency Identification Sonar (DIDSON). An analysis was conducted on applications such as classification, detection, segmentation, and 3D reconstruction. This work focuses on state-of-the-art advancements, incorporating newly released datasets. The findings are synthesized into a master table and a chronological timeline, offering a clear and accessible comparison of characteristics, sizes, and annotation details datasets.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Modern monocular visual odometry methods typically combine pre-trained deep learning components with optimization modules, resulting in complex pipelines that rely heavily on camera calibration and hyperparameter tuning, and often struggle in unseen real-world scenarios. Recent large-scale 3D models trained on massive amounts of multi-modal data have partially alleviated these challenges, providing generalizable dense reconstruction and camera pose estimation. Still, they remain limited in handling long videos and providing accurate per-frame estimates, which are required for visual odometry. In this work, we demonstrate that monocular visual odometry can be addressed effectively in an end-to-end manner, thereby eliminating the need for handcrafted components such as bundle adjustment, feature matching, camera calibration, or dense 3D reconstruction. We introduce VoT, short for Visual odometry Transformer, which processes sequences of monocular frames by extracting features and modeling global relationships through temporal and spatial attention. Unlike prior methods, VoT directly predicts camera motion without estimating dense geometry and relies solely on camera poses for supervision. The framework is modular and flexible, allowing seamless integration of various pre-trained encoders as feature extractors. Experimental results demonstrate that VoT scales effectively with larger datasets, benefits substantially from stronger pre-trained backbones, generalizes across diverse camera motions and calibration settings, and outperforms traditional methods while running more than 3 times faster. The code will be released.

  Sparse-view novel view synthesis is fundamentally ill-posed due to severe geometric ambiguity. Current methods are caught in a trade-off: regressive models are geometrically faithful but incomplete, whereas generative models can complete scenes but often introduce structural inconsistencies. We propose OracleGS, a novel framework that reconciles generative completeness with regressive fidelity for sparse view Gaussian Splatting. Instead of using generative models to patch incomplete reconstructions, our "propose-and-validate" framework first leverages a pre-trained 3D-aware diffusion model to synthesize novel views to propose a complete scene. We then repurpose a multi-view stereo (MVS) model as a 3D-aware oracle to validate the 3D uncertainties of generated views, using its attention maps to reveal regions where the generated views are well-supported by multi-view evidence versus where they fall into regions of high uncertainty due to occlusion, lack of texture, or direct inconsistency. This uncertainty signal directly guides the optimization of a 3D Gaussian Splatting model via an uncertainty-weighted loss. Our approach conditions the powerful generative prior on multi-view geometric evidence, filtering hallucinatory artifacts while preserving plausible completions in under-constrained regions, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on datasets including Mip-NeRF 360 and NeRF Synthetic.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The scarcity of annotated data in specialized domains such as medical imaging presents significant challenges to training robust vision models. While self-supervised masked image modeling (MIM) offers a promising solution, existing approaches largely rely on random high-ratio masking, leading to inefficiency and poor semantic alignment. Moreover, region-aware variants typically depend on reconstruction heuristics or supervised signals, limiting their adaptability across tasks and modalities. We propose Mask What Matters, a controllable text-guided masking framework for self-supervised medical image analysis. By leveraging vision-language models for prompt-based region localization, our method flexibly applies differentiated masking to emphasize diagnostically relevant regions while reducing redundancy in background areas. This controllable design enables better semantic alignment, improved representation learning, and stronger cross-task generalizability. Comprehensive evaluation across multiple medical imaging modalities, including brain MRI, chest CT, and lung X-ray, shows that Mask What Matters consistently outperforms existing MIM methods (e.g., SparK), achieving gains of up to +3.1 percentage points in classification accuracy, +1.3 in box average precision (BoxAP), and +1.1 in mask average precision (MaskAP) for detection. Notably, it achieves these improvements with substantially lower overall masking ratios (e.g., 40\% vs. 70\%). This work demonstrates that controllable, text-driven masking can enable semantically aligned self-supervised learning, advancing the development of robust vision models for medical image analysis.

  Accurate and efficient dense depth reconstruction from light field imagery remains a central challenge in computer vision, underpinning applications such as augmented reality, biomedical imaging, and 3D scene reconstruction. Existing deep convolutional approaches, while effective, often incur high computational overhead and are sensitive to noise and disparity inconsistencies in real-world scenarios. This paper introduces a novel Deep Spectral Epipolar Representation (DSER) framework for dense light field reconstruction, which unifies deep spectral feature learning with epipolar-domain regularization. The proposed approach exploits frequency-domain correlations across epipolar plane images to enforce global structural coherence, thereby mitigating artifacts and enhancing depth accuracy. Unlike conventional supervised models, DSER operates efficiently with limited training data while maintaining high reconstruction fidelity. Comprehensive experiments on the 4D Light Field Benchmark and a diverse set of real-world datasets demonstrate that DSER achieves superior performance in terms of precision, structural consistency, and computational efficiency compared to state-of-the-art methods. These results highlight the potential of integrating spectral priors with epipolar geometry for scalable and noise-resilient dense light field depth estimation, establishing DSER as a promising direction for next-generation high-dimensional vision systems.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Unsupervised disentanglement of static appearance and dynamic motion in video remains a fundamental challenge, often hindered by information leakage and blurry reconstructions in existing VAE- and GAN-based approaches. We introduce DiViD, the first end-to-end video diffusion framework for explicit static-dynamic factorization. DiViD's sequence encoder extracts a global static token from the first frame and per-frame dynamic tokens, explicitly removing static content from the motion code. Its conditional DDPM decoder incorporates three key inductive biases: a shared-noise schedule for temporal consistency, a time-varying KL-based bottleneck that tightens at early timesteps (compressing static information) and relaxes later (enriching dynamics), and cross-attention that routes the global static token to all frames while keeping dynamic tokens frame-specific. An orthogonality regularizer further prevents residual static-dynamic leakage. We evaluate DiViD on real-world benchmarks using swap-based accuracy and cross-leakage metrics. DiViD outperforms state-of-the-art sequential disentanglement methods: it achieves the highest swap-based joint accuracy, preserves static fidelity while improving dynamic transfer, and reduces average cross-leakage.

  Polarization images provide rich physical information that is fundamentally absent from standard RGB images, benefiting a wide range of computer vision applications such as reflection separation and material classification. However, the acquisition of polarization images typically requires additional optical components, which increases both the cost and the complexity of the applications. To bridge this gap, we introduce a new task: RGB-to-polarization image estimation, which aims to infer polarization information directly from RGB images. In this work, we establish the first comprehensive benchmark for this task by leveraging existing polarization datasets and evaluating a diverse set of state-of-the-art deep learning models, including both restoration-oriented and generative architectures. Through extensive quantitative and qualitative analysis, our benchmark not only establishes the current performance ceiling of RGB-to-polarization estimation, but also systematically reveals the respective strengths and limitations of different model families -- such as direct reconstruction versus generative synthesis, and task-specific training versus large-scale pre-training. In addition, we provide some potential directions for future research on polarization estimation. This benchmark is intended to serve as a foundational resource to facilitate the design and evaluation of future methods for polarization estimation from standard RGB inputs.

  Dynamic scene reconstruction is a long-term challenge in 3D vision. Recent methods extend 3D Gaussian Splatting to dynamic scenes via additional deformation fields and apply explicit constraints like motion flow to guide the deformation. However, they learn motion changes from individual timestamps independently, making it challenging to reconstruct complex scenes, particularly when dealing with violent movement, extreme-shaped geometries, or reflective surfaces. To address the above issue, we design a plug-and-play module called TimeFormer to enable existing deformable 3D Gaussians reconstruction methods with the ability to implicitly model motion patterns from a learning perspective. Specifically, TimeFormer includes a Cross-Temporal Transformer Encoder, which adaptively learns the temporal relationships of deformable 3D Gaussians. Furthermore, we propose a two-stream optimization strategy that transfers the motion knowledge learned from TimeFormer to the base stream during the training phase. This allows us to remove TimeFormer during inference, thereby preserving the original rendering speed. Extensive experiments in the multi-view and monocular dynamic scenes validate qualitative and quantitative improvement brought by TimeFormer. Project Page:this https URL

  Most novel view synthesis methods-including Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF)-struggle to capture the true high dynamic range (HDR) radiance of scenes. This is primarily due to their dependence on low dynamic range (LDR) images from conventional cameras. Exposure bracketing techniques aim to address this challenge, but they introduce a considerable time burden during the acquisition process. In this work, we introduce PanDORA: PANoramic Dual-Observer Radiance Acquisition, a system designed for the casual, high quality HDR capture of indoor environments. Our approach uses two 360¬∞ cameras mounted on a portable monopod to simultaneously record two panoramic 360¬∞ videos: one with standard exposure and another at fast shutter speed. The resulting video data is processed by a proposed two-stage NeRF-based algorithm, including an algorithm for the fine alignment of the fast- and well-exposed frames, generating non-saturated HDR radiance maps. Compared to existing methods on a novel dataset of real indoor scenes captured with our apparatus and including HDR ground truth lighting, PanDORA achieves superior visual fidelity and provides a scalable solution for capturing real environments in HDR.

  Industrial 3D face assets creation typically reconstructs topology-consistent face meshes from multi-view images for downstream production. However, high-quality reconstruction usually requires manual processing or specific capture settings. Recently NeRF has shown great advantages in 3D reconstruction, by representing scenes as density and radiance fields and utilizing neural volume rendering for novel view synthesis. Inspired by this, we introduce a novel method which combines explicit mesh with neural volume rendering to optimize geometry of an artist-made template face mesh from multi-view images while keeping the topology unchanged. Our method derives density fields from meshes using distance fields as an intermediary and encodes radiance field in compact tri-planes. To improve convergence, several adaptions tailored for meshes are introduced to the volume rendering. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior reconstruction quality compared to previous approaches, validating the feasibility of integrating mesh and neural volume rendering.

  We introduce CEMTM, a context-enhanced multimodal topic model designed to infer coherent and interpretable topic structures from both short and long documents containing text and images. CEMTM builds on fine-tuned large vision language models (LVLMs) to obtain contextualized embeddings, and employs a distributional attention mechanism to weight token-level contributions to topic inference. A reconstruction objective aligns topic-based representations with the document embedding, encouraging semantic consistency across modalities. Unlike existing approaches, CEMTM can process multiple images per document without repeated encoding and maintains interpretability through explicit word-topic and document-topic distributions. Extensive experiments on six multimodal benchmarks show that CEMTM consistently outperforms unimodal and multimodal baselines, achieving a remarkable average LLM score of 2.61. Further analysis shows its effectiveness in downstream few-shot retrieval and its ability to capture visually grounded semantics in complex domains such as scientific articles.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Post-training compression of large language models (LLMs) largely relies on low-rank weight approximation, which represents each column of a weight matrix in a shared low-dimensional subspace. While this is a computationally efficient strategy, the imposed structural constraint is rigid and can lead to a noticeable model accuracy drop. In this work, we propose CoSpaDi (Compression via Sparse Dictionary Learning), a novel training-free compression framework that replaces low-rank decomposition with a more flexible structured sparse factorization in which each weight matrix is represented with a dense dictionary and a column-sparse coefficient matrix. This formulation enables a union-of-subspaces representation: different columns of the original weight matrix are approximated in distinct subspaces spanned by adaptively selected dictionary atoms, offering greater expressiveness than a single invariant basis. Crucially, CoSpaDi leverages a small calibration dataset to optimize the factorization such that the output activations of compressed projection layers closely match those of the original ones, thereby minimizing functional reconstruction error rather than mere weight approximation. This data-aware strategy preserves better model fidelity without any fine-tuning under reasonable compression ratios. Moreover, the resulting structured sparsity allows efficient sparse-dense matrix multiplication and is compatible with post-training quantization for further memory and latency gains. We evaluate CoSpaDi across multiple Llama and Qwen models under per-layer and per-group settings at 20-50\% compression ratios, demonstrating consistent superiority over state-of-the-art data-aware low-rank methods both in accuracy and perplexity. Our results establish structured sparse dictionary learning as a powerful alternative to conventional low-rank approaches for efficient LLM deployment.

  Pre-trained language models (PLMs) have driven substantial progress in natural language processing but remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks, raising concerns about their robustness in real-world applications. Previous studies have sought to mitigate the impact of adversarial attacks by introducing adversarial perturbations into the training process, either implicitly or explicitly. While both strategies enhance robustness, they often incur high computational costs. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective add-on module that enhances the adversarial robustness of PLMs by removing instance-level principal components, without relying on conventional adversarial defences or perturbing the original training data. Our approach transforms the embedding space to approximate Gaussian properties, thereby reducing its susceptibility to adversarial perturbations while preserving semantic relationships. This transformation aligns embedding distributions in a way that minimises the impact of adversarial noise on decision boundaries, enhancing robustness without requiring adversarial examples or costly training-time augmentation. Evaluations on eight benchmark datasets show that our approach improves adversarial robustness while maintaining comparable before-attack accuracy to baselines, achieving a balanced trade-off between robustness and generalisation.

  Recently, using large language models (LLMs) for data augmentation has led to considerable improvements in unsupervised sentence embedding models. However, existing methods encounter two primary challenges: limited data diversity and high data noise. Current approaches often neglect fine-grained knowledge, such as entities and quantities, leading to insufficient diversity. Besides, unsupervised data frequently lacks discriminative information, and the generated synthetic samples may introduce noise. In this paper, we propose a pipeline-based data augmentation method via LLMs and introduce the Gaussian-decayed gradient-assisted Contrastive Sentence Embedding (GCSE) model to enhance unsupervised sentence embeddings. To tackle the issue of low data diversity, our pipeline utilizes knowledge graphs (KGs) to extract entities and quantities, enabling LLMs to generate more diverse samples. To address high data noise, the GCSE model uses a Gaussian-decayed function to limit the impact of false hard negative samples, enhancing the model's discriminative capability. Experimental results show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in semantic textual similarity (STS) tasks, using fewer data samples and smaller LLMs, demonstrating its efficiency and robustness across various models.

  Bayesian Optimization (BO) has been widely used to efficiently optimize expensive black-box functions with limited evaluations. In this paper, we investigate the use of BO for prompt engineering to enhance text classification with Large Language Models (LLMs). We employ an LLM-powered Gaussian Process (GP) as the surrogate model to estimate the performance of different prompt candidates. These candidates are generated by an LLM through the expansion of a set of seed prompts and are subsequently evaluated using an Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) acquisition function in conjunction with the GP posterior. The optimization process iteratively refines the prompts based on a subset of the data, aiming to improve classification accuracy while reducing the number of API calls by leveraging the prediction uncertainty of the LLM-based GP. The proposed BO-LLM algorithm is evaluated on two datasets, and its advantages are discussed in detail in this paper.
