- **[Estimating the Joint Probability of Scenario Parameters with Gaussian Mixture Copula Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10098)**  `arXiv:2506.10098`  `cs.RO` `cs.LG`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper presents the first application of Gaussian Mixture Copula Models to the statistical modeling of driving scenarios for the safety validation of automated driving systems. Knowledge of the joint probability distribution of scenario parameters is essential for scenario-based safety assessment, where risk quantification depends on the likelihood of concrete parameter combinations. Gaussian Mixture Copula Models bring together the multimodal expressivity of Gaussian Mixture Models and the flexibility of copulas, enabling separate modeling of marginal distributions and dependencies. We benchmark Gaussian Mixture Copula Models against previously proposed approaches - Gaussian Mixture Models and Gaussian Copula Models - using real-world driving data drawn from scenarios defined in United Nations Regulation No. 157. Our evaluation across approximately 18 million scenario instances demonstrates that Gaussian Mixture Copula Models consistently surpass Gaussian Copula Models and perform better than, or at least comparably to, Gaussian Mixture Models, as measured by both log-likelihood and Sinkhorn distance. These results are promising for the adoption of Gaussian Mixture Copula Models as a statistical foundation for future scenario-based validation frameworks.

  Comprehensive visual, geometric, and semantic understanding of a 3D scene is crucial for successful execution of robotic tasks, especially in unstructured and complex environments. Additionally, to make robust decisions, it is necessary for the robot to evaluate the reliability of perceived information. While recent advances in 3D neural feature fields have enabled robots to leverage features from pretrained foundation models for tasks such as language-guided manipulation and navigation, existing methods suffer from two critical limitations: (i) they are typically scene-specific, and (ii) they lack the ability to model uncertainty in their predictions. We present UniFField, a unified uncertainty-aware neural feature field that combines visual, semantic, and geometric features in a single generalizable representation while also predicting uncertainty in each modality. Our approach, which can be applied zero shot to any new environment, incrementally integrates RGB-D images into our voxel-based feature representation as the robot explores the scene, simultaneously updating uncertainty estimation. We evaluate our uncertainty estimations to accurately describe the model prediction errors in scene reconstruction and semantic feature prediction. Furthermore, we successfully leverage our feature predictions and their respective uncertainty for an active object search task using a mobile manipulator robot, demonstrating the capability for robust decision-making.

- **[Active Next-Best-View Optimization for Risk-Averse Path Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06481)**  `arXiv:2510.06481`  `cs.RO` `cs.CV`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Safe navigation in uncertain environments requires planning methods that integrate risk aversion with active perception. In this work, we present a unified framework that refines a coarse reference path by constructing tail-sensitive risk maps from Average Value-at-Risk statistics on an online-updated 3D Gaussian-splat Radiance Field. These maps enable the generation of locally safe and feasible trajectories. In parallel, we formulate Next-Best-View (NBV) selection as an optimization problem on the SE(3) pose manifold, where Riemannian gradient descent maximizes an expected information gain objective to reduce uncertainty most critical for imminent motion. Our approach advances the state-of-the-art by coupling risk-averse path refinement with NBV planning, while introducing scalable gradient decompositions that support efficient online updates in complex environments. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework through extensive computational studies.

- **[DPL: Depth-only Perceptive Humanoid Locomotion via Realistic Depth Synthesis and Cross-Attention Terrain Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07152)**  `arXiv:2510.07152`  `cs.RO`  
  _Jingkai Sun, Gang Han, Pihai Sun, Wen Zhao, Jiahang Cao, Jiaxu Wang, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advancements in legged robot perceptive locomotion have shown promising progress. However, terrain-aware humanoid locomotion remains largely constrained to two paradigms: depth image-based end-to-end learning and elevation map-based methods. The former suffers from limited training efficiency and a significant sim-to-real gap in depth perception, while the latter depends heavily on multiple vision sensors and localization systems, resulting in latency and reduced robustness. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel framework that tightly integrates three key components: (1) Terrain-Aware Locomotion Policy with a Blind Backbone, which leverages pre-trained elevation map-based perception to guide reinforcement learning with minimal visual input; (2) Multi-Modality Cross-Attention Transformer, which reconstructs structured terrain representations from noisy depth images; (3) Realistic Depth Images Synthetic Method, which employs self-occlusion-aware ray casting and noise-aware modeling to synthesize realistic depth observations, achieving over 30\% reduction in terrain reconstruction error. This combination enables efficient policy training with limited data and hardware resources, while preserving critical terrain features essential for generalization. We validate our framework on a full-sized humanoid robot, demonstrating agile and adaptive locomotion across diverse and challenging terrains.

- **[Temporal-Prior-Guided View Planning for Periodic 3D Plant Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07028)**  `arXiv:2510.07028`  `cs.RO`  
  _Sicong Pan, Xuying Huang, Maren Bennewitz_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Periodic 3D reconstruction is essential for crop monitoring, but costly when each cycle restarts from scratch, wasting resources and ignoring information from previous captures. We propose temporal-prior-guided view planning for periodic plant reconstruction, in which a previously reconstructed model of the same plant is non-rigidly aligned to a new partial observation to form an approximation of the current geometry. To accommodate plant growth, we inflate this approximation and solve a set covering optimization problem to compute a minimal set of views. We integrated this method into a complete pipeline that acquires one additional next-best view before registration for robustness and then plans a globally shortest path to connect the planned set of views and outputs the best view sequence. Experiments on maize and tomato under hemisphere and sphere view spaces show that our system maintains or improves surface coverage while requiring fewer views and comparable movement cost compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

- **[P2 Explore: Efficient Exploration in Unknown Cluttered Environment with Floor Plan Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10878)**  `arXiv:2409.10878`  `cs.RO`  
  _Kun Song, Gaoming Chen, Masayoshi Tomizuka, Wei Zhan, Zhenhua Xiong, Mingyu Ding_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Robot exploration aims at the reconstruction of unknown environments, and it is important to achieve it with shorter paths. Traditional methods focus on optimizing the visiting order of frontiers based on current observations, which may lead to local-minimal results. Recently, by predicting the structure of the unseen environment, the exploration efficiency can be further improved. However, in a cluttered environment, due to the randomness of obstacles, the ability to predict is weak. Moreover, this inaccuracy will lead to limited improvement in exploration. Therefore, we propose FPUNet which can be efficient in predicting the layout of noisy indoor environments. Then, we extract the segmentation of rooms and construct their topological connectivity based on the predicted map. The visiting order of these predicted rooms is optimized which can provide high-level guidance for exploration. The FPUNet is compared with other network architectures which demonstrates it is the SOTA method for this task. Extensive experiments in simulations show that our method can shorten the path length by 2.18% to 34.60% compared to the baselines.

- **[Sharpness-Aware Data Generation for Zero-shot Quantization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07018)**  `arXiv:2510.07018`  `cs.LG` `cs.CV`  
  _Dung Hoang-Anh, Cuong Pham Trung Le, Jianfei Cai, Thanh-Toan Do_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Zero-shot quantization aims to learn a quantized model from a pre-trained full-precision model with no access to original real training data. The common idea in zero-shot quantization approaches is to generate synthetic data for quantizing the full-precision model. While it is well-known that deep neural networks with low sharpness have better generalization ability, none of the previous zero-shot quantization works considers the sharpness of the quantized model as a criterion for generating training data. This paper introduces a novel methodology that takes into account quantized model sharpness in synthetic data generation to enhance generalization. Specifically, we first demonstrate that sharpness minimization can be attained by maximizing gradient matching between the reconstruction loss gradients computed on synthetic and real validation data, under certain assumptions. We then circumvent the problem of the gradient matching without real validation set by approximating it with the gradient matching between each generated sample and its neighbors. Experimental evaluations on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over the state-of-the-art techniques in low-bit quantization settings.

- **[Enhancing Speech Emotion Recognition via Fine-Tuning Pre-Trained Models and Hyper-Parameter Optimisation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07052)**  `arXiv:2510.07052`  `cs.LG`  
  _Aryan Golbaghi, Shuo Zhou_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We propose a workflow for speech emotion recognition (SER) that combines pre-trained representations with automated hyperparameter optimisation (HPO). Using SpeechBrain wav2vec2-base model fine-tuned on IEMOCAP as the encoder, we compare two HPO strategies, Gaussian Process Bayesian Optimisation (GP-BO) and Tree-structured Parzen Estimators (TPE), under an identical four-dimensional search space and 15-trial budget, with balanced class accuracy (BCA) on the German EmoDB corpus as the objective. All experiments run on 8 CPU cores with 32 GB RAM. GP-BO achieves 0.96 BCA in 11 minutes, and TPE (Hyperopt implementation) attains 0.97 in 15 minutes. In contrast, grid search requires 143 trials and 1,680 minutes to exceed 0.9 BCA, and the best AutoSpeech 2020 baseline reports only 0.85 in 30 minutes on GPU. For cross-lingual generalisation, an EmoDB-trained HPO-tuned model improves zero-shot accuracy by 0.25 on CREMA-D and 0.26 on RAVDESS. Results show that efficient HPO with pre-trained encoders delivers competitive SER on commodity CPUs. Source code to this work is available at:this https URL.

- **[Vacuum Spiker: A Spiking Neural Network-Based Model for Efficient Anomaly Detection in Time Series](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06910)**  `arXiv:2510.06910`  `cs.LG`  
  _Iago Xabier V√°zquez, Javier Sedano, Muhammad Afzal, √Ångel Miguel Garc√≠a-Vico_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Anomaly detection is a key task across domains such as industry, healthcare, and cybersecurity. Many real-world anomaly detection problems involve analyzing multiple features over time, making time series analysis a natural approach for such problems. While deep learning models have achieved strong performance in this field, their trend to exhibit high energy consumption limits their deployment in resource-constrained environments such as IoT devices, edge computing platforms, and wearables. To address this challenge, this paper introduces the \textit{Vacuum Spiker algorithm}, a novel Spiking Neural Network-based method for anomaly detection in time series. It incorporates a new detection criterion that relies on global changes in neural activity rather than reconstruction or prediction error. It is trained using Spike Time-Dependent Plasticity in a novel way, intended to induce changes in neural activity when anomalies occur. A new efficient encoding scheme is also proposed, which discretizes the input space into non-overlapping intervals, assigning each to a single neuron. This strategy encodes information with a single spike per time step, improving energy efficiency compared to conventional encoding methods. Experimental results on publicly available datasets show that the proposed algorithm achieves competitive performance while significantly reducing energy consumption, compared to a wide set of deep learning and machine learning baselines. Furthermore, its practical utility is validated in a real-world case study, where the model successfully identifies power curtailment events in a solar inverter. These results highlight its potential for sustainable and efficient anomaly detection.

- **[WristWorld: Generating Wrist-Views via 4D World Models for Robotic Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07313)**  `arXiv:2510.07313`  `cs.CV` `cs.RO`  
  _Zezhong Qian, Xiaowei Chi, Yuming Li, Shizun Wang, Zhiyuan Qin, Xiaozhu Ju, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Wrist-view observations are crucial for VLA models as they capture fine-grained hand-object interactions that directly enhance manipulation performance. Yet large-scale datasets rarely include such recordings, resulting in a substantial gap between abundant anchor views and scarce wrist views. Existing world models cannot bridge this gap, as they require a wrist-view first frame and thus fail to generate wrist-view videos from anchor views alone. Amid this gap, recent visual geometry models such as VGGT emerge with geometric and cross-view priors that make it possible to address extreme viewpoint shifts. Inspired by these insights, we propose WristWorld, the first 4D world model that generates wrist-view videos solely from anchor views. WristWorld operates in two stages: (i) Reconstruction, which extends VGGT and incorporates our Spatial Projection Consistency (SPC) Loss to estimate geometrically consistent wrist-view poses and 4D point clouds; (ii) Generation, which employs our video generation model to synthesize temporally coherent wrist-view videos from the reconstructed perspective. Experiments on Droid, Calvin, and Franka Panda demonstrate state-of-the-art video generation with superior spatial consistency, while also improving VLA performance, raising the average task completion length on Calvin by 3.81% and closing 42.4% of the anchor-wrist view gap.

- **[Cluster Paths: Navigating Interpretability in Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06541)**  `arXiv:2510.06541`  `cs.CV` `cs.LG`  
  _Nicholas M. Kroeger, Vincent Bindschaedler_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  While modern deep neural networks achieve impressive performance in vision tasks, they remain opaque in their decision processes, risking unwarranted trust, undetected biases and unexpected failures. We propose cluster paths, a post-hoc interpretability method that clusters activations at selected layers and represents each input as its sequence of cluster IDs. To assess these cluster paths, we introduce four metrics: path complexity (cognitive load), weighted-path purity (class alignment), decision-alignment faithfulness (predictive fidelity), and path agreement (stability under perturbations). In a spurious-cue CIFAR-10 experiment, cluster paths identify color-based shortcuts and collapse when the cue is removed. On a five-class CelebA hair-color task, they achieve 90% faithfulness and maintain 96% agreement under Gaussian noise without sacrificing accuracy. Scaling to a Vision Transformer pretrained on ImageNet, we extend cluster paths to concept paths derived from prompting a large language model on minimal path divergences. Finally, we show that cluster paths can serve as an effective out-of-distribution (OOD) detector, reliably flagging anomalous samples before the model generates over-confident predictions. Cluster paths uncover visual concepts, such as color palettes, textures, or object contexts, at multiple network depths, demonstrating that cluster paths scale to large vision models while generating concise and human-readable explanations.

- **[HSNet: Heterogeneous Subgraph Network for Single Image Super-resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06564)**  `arXiv:2510.06564`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`  
  _Qiongyang Hu, Wenyang Liu, Wenbin Zou, Yuejiao Su, Lap-Pui Chau, Yi Wang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Existing deep learning approaches for image super-resolution, particularly those based on CNNs and attention mechanisms, often suffer from structural inflexibility. Although graph-based methods offer greater representational adaptability, they are frequently impeded by excessive computational complexity. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes the Heterogeneous Subgraph Network (HSNet), a novel framework that efficiently leverages graph modeling while maintaining computational feasibility. The core idea of HSNet is to decompose the global graph into manageable sub-components. First, we introduce the Constructive Subgraph Set Block (CSSB), which generates a diverse set of complementary subgraphs. Rather than relying on a single monolithic graph, CSSB captures heterogeneous characteristics of the image by modeling different relational patterns and feature interactions, producing a rich ensemble of both local and global graph structures. Subsequently, the Subgraph Aggregation Block (SAB) integrates the representations embedded across these subgraphs. Through adaptive weighting and fusion of multi-graph features, SAB constructs a comprehensive and discriminative representation that captures intricate interdependencies. Furthermore, a Node Sampling Strategy (NSS) is designed to selectively retain the most salient features, thereby enhancing accuracy while reducing computational overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HSNet achieves state-of-the-art performance, effectively balancing reconstruction quality with computational efficiency. The code will be made publicly available.

- **[Improving the Spatial Resolution of GONG Solar Images to GST Quality Using Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06281)**  `arXiv:2510.06281`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`  
  _Chenyang Li, Qin Li, Haimin Wang, Bo Shen_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  High-resolution (HR) solar imaging is crucial for capturing fine-scale dynamic features such as filaments and fibrils. However, the spatial resolution of the full-disk H$\alpha$ images is limited and insufficient to resolve these small-scale structures. To address this, we propose a GAN-based superresolution approach to enhance low-resolution (LR) full-disk H$\alpha$ images from the Global Oscillation Network Group (GONG) to a quality comparable with HR observations from the Big Bear Solar Observatory/Goode Solar Telescope (BBSO/GST). We employ Real-ESRGAN with Residual-in-Residual Dense Blocks and a relativistic discriminator. We carefully aligned GONG-GST pairs. The model effectively recovers fine details within sunspot penumbrae and resolves fine details in filaments and fibrils, achieving an average mean squared error (MSE) of 467.15, root mean squared error (RMSE) of 21.59, and cross-correlation (CC) of 0.7794. Slight misalignments between image pairs limit quantitative performance, which we plan to address in future work alongside dataset expansion to further improve reconstruction quality.

- **[Progressive Gaussian Transformer with Anisotropy-aware Sampling for Open Vocabulary Occupancy Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04759)**  `arXiv:2510.04759`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`  
  _Chi Yan, Dan Xu_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The 3D occupancy prediction task has witnessed remarkable progress in recent years, playing a crucial role in vision-based autonomous driving systems. While traditional methods are limited to fixed semantic categories, recent approaches have moved towards predicting text-aligned features to enable open-vocabulary text queries in real-world scenes. However, there exists a trade-off in text-aligned scene modeling: sparse Gaussian representation struggles to capture small objects in the scene, while dense representation incurs significant computational overhead. To address these limitations, we present PG-Occ, an innovative Progressive Gaussian Transformer Framework that enables open-vocabulary 3D occupancy prediction. Our framework employs progressive online densification, a feed-forward strategy that gradually enhances the 3D Gaussian representation to capture fine-grained scene details. By iteratively enhancing the representation, the framework achieves increasingly precise and detailed scene understanding. Another key contribution is the introduction of an anisotropy-aware sampling strategy with spatio-temporal fusion, which adaptively assigns receptive fields to Gaussians at different scales and stages, enabling more effective feature aggregation and richer scene information capture. Through extensive evaluations, we demonstrate that PG-Occ achieves state-of-the-art performance with a relative 14.3% mIoU improvement over the previous best performing method. Code and pretrained models will be released upon publication on our project page:this https URL

- **[MoRe: Monocular Geometry Refinement via Graph Optimization for Cross-View Consistency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07119)**  `arXiv:2510.07119`  `cs.CV`  
  _Dongki Jung, Jaehoon Choi, Yonghan Lee, Sungmin Eum, Heesung Kwon, Dinesh Manocha_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Monocular 3D foundation models offer an extensible solution for perception tasks, making them attractive for broader 3D vision applications. In this paper, we propose MoRe, a training-free Monocular Geometry Refinement method designed to improve cross-view consistency and achieve scale alignment. To induce inter-frame relationships, our method employs feature matching between frames to establish correspondences. Rather than applying simple least squares optimization on these matched points, we formulate a graph-based optimization framework that performs local planar approximation using the estimated 3D points and surface normals estimated by monocular foundation models. This formulation addresses the scale ambiguity inherent in monocular geometric priors while preserving the underlying 3D structure. We further demonstrate that MoRe not only enhances 3D reconstruction but also improves novel view synthesis, particularly in sparse view rendering scenarios.

  _Ori nizan, Oren Shrout, Ayellet Tal_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  A concept may reflect either a concrete or abstract idea. Given an input image, this paper seeks to retrieve other images that share its central concepts, capturing aspects of the underlying narrative. This goes beyond conventional retrieval or clustering methods, which emphasize visual or semantic similarity. We formally define the problem, outline key requirements, and introduce appropriate evaluation metrics. We propose a novel approach grounded in two key observations: (1) While each neighbor in the embedding space typically shares at least one concept with the query, not all neighbors necessarily share the same concept with one another. (2) Modeling this neighborhood with a bimodal Gaussian distribution uncovers meaningful structure that facilitates concept identification. Qualitative, quantitative, and human evaluations confirm the effectiveness of our approach. See the package on PyPI:this https URL

- **[Transforming Noise Distributions with Histogram Matching: Towards a Single Denoiser for All](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06757)**  `arXiv:2510.06757`  `cs.CV`  
  _Sheng Fu, Junchao Zhang, Kailun Yang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Supervised Gaussian denoisers exhibit limited generalization when confronted with out-of-distribution noise, due to the diverse distributional characteristics of different noise types. To bridge this gap, we propose a histogram matching approach that transforms arbitrary noise towards a target Gaussian distribution with known intensity. Moreover, a mutually reinforcing cycle is established between noise transformation and subsequent denoising. This cycle progressively refines the noise to be converted, making it approximate the real noise, thereby enhancing the noise transformation effect and further improving the denoising performance. We tackle specific noise complexities: local histogram matching handles signal-dependent noise, intrapatch permutation processes channel-related noise, and frequency-domain histogram matching coupled with pixel-shuffle down-sampling breaks spatial correlation. By applying these transformations, a single Gaussian denoiser gains remarkable capability to handle various out-of-distribution noises, including synthetic noises such as Poisson, salt-and-pepper and repeating pattern noises, as well as complex real-world noises. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior generalization and effectiveness of our method.

- **[SCas4D: Structural Cascaded Optimization for Boosting Persistent 4D Novel View Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06694)**  `arXiv:2510.06694`  `cs.CV`  
  _Jipeng Lyu, Jiahua Dong, Yu-Xiong Wang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Persistent dynamic scene modeling for tracking and novel-view synthesis remains challenging due to the difficulty of capturing accurate deformations while maintaining computational efficiency. We propose SCas4D, a cascaded optimization framework that leverages structural patterns in 3D Gaussian Splatting for dynamic scenes. The key idea is that real-world deformations often exhibit hierarchical patterns, where groups of Gaussians share similar transformations. By progressively refining deformations from coarse part-level to fine point-level, SCas4D achieves convergence within 100 iterations per time frame and produces results comparable to existing methods with only one-twentieth of the training iterations. The approach also demonstrates effectiveness in self-supervised articulated object segmentation, novel view synthesis, and dense point tracking tasks.

  _Jingran Xu, Yuanyuan Liu, Yanjie Zhu_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a vital clinical diagnostic tool, yet its widespread application is limited by prolonged scan times. Fast MRI reconstruction techniques effectively reduce acquisition duration by reconstructing high-fidelity MR images from undersampled k-space data. In recent years, deep learning-based methods have demonstrated remarkable progress in this field, with self-supervised and unsupervised learning approaches proving particularly valuable in scenarios where fully sampled data are difficult to obtain. This paper proposes a novel zero-shot self-supervised reconstruction framework named UnrollINR, which enables scan-specific MRI reconstruction without relying on external training data. The method adopts a physics-guided unrolled iterative reconstruction architecture and introduces Implicit Neural Representation (INR) as a regularization prior to effectively constrain the solution space. By combining a deep unrolled structure with the powerful implicit representation capability of INR, the model's interpretability and reconstruction performance are enhanced. Experimental results demonstrate that even at a high acceleration rate of 10, UnrollINR achieves superior reconstruction performance compared to the supervised learning method, validating the superiority of the proposed method.

- **[Ming-UniVision: Joint Image Understanding and Generation with a Unified Continuous Tokenizer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06590)**  `arXiv:2510.06590`  `cs.CV`  
  _Ziyuan Huang, DanDan Zheng, Cheng Zou, Rui Liu, Xiaolong Wang, Kaixiang Ji, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Visual tokenization remains a core challenge in unifying visual understanding and generation within the autoregressive paradigm. Existing methods typically employ tokenizers in discrete latent spaces to align with the tokens from large language models, where the quantization errors can limit semantic expressiveness and degrade the capability of vision-language understanding. To address this, we introduce MingTok, a new family of visual tokenizers with a continuous latent space, for unified autoregressive generation and understanding. While understanding tasks favor discriminative high-dimensional features, generation tasks prefer compact low-level codes. Thus, to reconcile these competing demands, MingTok adopts a three-stage sequential architecture involving low-level encoding, semantic expansion, and visual reconstruction. Built on top of it, Ming-UniVision eliminates the need for task-specific visual representations, and unifies diverse vision-language tasks under a single autoregrsssive prediction paradigm. By formulating both understanding and generation as next-token prediction in a shared continuous space, it seamlessly supports multi-round, in-context tasks such as iterative understanding, generation and editing. Empirically, we find that using a unified continuous visual representation reconciles the competing requirements on the tokenizers by the understanding and generation tasks, thereby leading to state-of-the-art level performance across both domains. We hope our findings will facilitate unified visual tokenization in the continuous domain. Inference code and model weights are released to benefit community.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have enabled unified understanding across text and images, yet equipping these models with robust image generation capabilities remains challenging. Existing approaches often rely on reconstruction-oriented autoencoders or complex bridging mechanisms, leading to misalignment between understanding and generation representations, or architectural complexity. In this work, we propose VUGEN, a novel framework that explicitly leverages VLM's pretrained visual understanding priors for efficient and high-quality image generation. Our approach first transforms the high-dimensional latent space of the VLM's native vision encoder into a lower-dimensional, tractable distribution that maximally preserves visual information. The VLM is then trained to sample within this reduced latent space, ensuring alignment with its visual understanding capabilities. Finally, a dedicated pixel decoder maps these generated latents back to the image space. We find that a VAE-free pixel diffusion decoder to be on par or better than commonly used complex latent diffusion decoders that internally rely on VAE latents. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VUGEN achieves superior image generation performance, improving DPG Bench from 71.17 to 74.32 and FID from 11.86 to 9.06 on COCO, while fully preserving the VLM's original understanding capabilities.

- **[VGGT-X: When VGGT Meets Dense Novel View Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25191)**  `arXiv:2509.25191`  `cs.CV`  
  _Yang Liu, Chuanchen Luo, Zimo Tang, Junran Peng, Zhaoxiang Zhang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We study the problem of applying 3D Foundation Models (3DFMs) to dense Novel View Synthesis (NVS). Despite significant progress in Novel View Synthesis powered by NeRF and 3DGS, current approaches remain reliant on accurate 3D attributes (e.g., camera poses and point clouds) acquired from Structure-from-Motion (SfM), which is often slow and fragile in low-texture or low-overlap captures. Recent 3DFMs showcase orders of magnitude speedup over the traditional pipeline and great potential for online NVS. But most of the validation and conclusions are confined to sparse-view settings. Our study reveals that naively scaling 3DFMs to dense views encounters two fundamental barriers: dramatically increasing VRAM burden and imperfect outputs that degrade initialization-sensitive 3D training. To address these barriers, we introduce VGGT-X, incorporating a memory-efficient VGGT implementation that scales to 1,000+ images, an adaptive global alignment for VGGT output enhancement, and robust 3DGS training practices. Extensive experiments show that these measures substantially close the fidelity gap with COLMAP-initialized pipelines, achieving state-of-the-art results in dense COLMAP-free NVS and pose estimation. Additionally, we analyze the causes of remaining gaps with COLMAP-initialized rendering, providing insights for the future development of 3D foundation models and dense NVS.

  Novel View Synthesis (NVS) from sparse views presents a formidable challenge in 3D reconstruction, where limited multi-view constraints lead to severe overfitting, geometric distortion, and fragmented scenes. While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) delivers real-time, high-fidelity rendering, its performance drastically deteriorates under sparse inputs, plagued by floating artifacts and structural failures. To address these challenges, we introduce HBSplat, a unified framework that elevates 3DGS by seamlessly integrating robust structural cues, virtual view constraints, and occluded region completion. Our core contributions are threefold: a Hybrid-Loss Depth Estimation module that ensures multi-view consistency by leveraging dense matching priors and integrating reprojection, point propagation, and smoothness constraints; a Bidirectional Warping Virtual View Synthesis method that enforces substantially stronger constraints by creating high-fidelity virtual views through bidirectional depth-image warping and multi-view fusion; and an Occlusion-Aware Reconstruction component that recovers occluded areas using a depth-difference mask and a learning-based inpainting model. Extensive evaluations on LLFF, Blender, and DTU benchmarks validate that HBSplat sets a new state-of-the-art, achieving up to 21.13 dB PSNR and 0.189 LPIPS, while maintaining real-time inference.

  Predicting mortality-related outcomes from images offers the prospect of accessible, noninvasive, and scalable health screening. We present a method that leverages pretrained vision transformer foundation models to estimate remaining lifespan from facial and whole-body images, alongside robust uncertainty quantification. We show that predictive uncertainty varies systematically with the true remaining lifespan, and that this uncertainty can be effectively modeled by learning a Gaussian distribution for each sample. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art mean absolute error (MAE) of 7.41 years on an established dataset, and further achieves 4.91 and 4.99 years MAE on two new, higher-quality datasets curated and published in this work. Importantly, our models provide calibrated uncertainty estimates, as demonstrated by a bucketed expected calibration error of 0.82 years on the Faces Dataset. While not intended for clinical deployment, these results highlight the potential of extracting medically relevant signals from images. We make all code and datasets available to facilitate further research.

  3D reconstruction from in-the-wild images remains a challenging task due to inconsistent lighting conditions and transient distractors. Existing methods typically rely on heuristic strategies to handle the low-quality training data, which often struggle to produce stable and consistent reconstructions, frequently resulting in visual artifacts. In this work, we propose \modelname{}, a novel framework that leverages the stochastic nature of these artifacts: they tend to vary across different training runs due to minor randomness. Specifically, our method trains two 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) models in parallel, enforcing a consistency constraint that encourages convergence on reliable scene geometry while suppressing inconsistent artifacts. To prevent the two models from collapsing into similar failure modes due to confirmation bias, we introduce a divergent masking strategy that applies two complementary masks: a multi-cue adaptive mask and a self-supervised soft mask, which leads to an asymmetric training process of the two models, reducing shared error modes. In addition, to improve the efficiency of model training, we introduce a lightweight variant called Dynamic EMA Proxy, which replaces one of the two models with a dynamically updated Exponential Moving Average (EMA) proxy, and employs an alternating masking strategy to preserve divergence. Extensive experiments on challenging real-world datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing approaches while achieving high efficiency.

  Generating stylistic text with specific attributes is a key problem in controllable text generation. Recently, diffusion models have emerged as a powerful paradigm for both visual and textual generation. Existing approaches can be broadly categorized into classifier-free guidance (CFG) and classifier guidance (CG) methods. While CFG effectively preserves semantic content, it often fails to provide effective attribute control. In contrast, CG modifies the denoising trajectory using classifier gradients, enabling better attribute alignment but incurring high computational costs during sampling and suffering from classifier generalization issues. In this work, we propose RegDiff, a regularized diffusion framework that leverages attribute features without requiring a pretrained classifier during sampling, thereby achieving controllable generation with reduced computational costs. Specifically, RegDiff employs a VAE-based encoder--decoder architecture to ensure reconstruction fidelity and a latent diffusion model trained with attribute supervision to enable controllable text generation. Attribute information is injected only during training. Experiments on five datasets spanning multiple stylistic attributes demonstrate that RegDiff outperforms strong baselines in generating stylistic texts. These results validate the effectiveness of RegDiff as an efficient solution for attribute-controllable text diffusion. Our code, datasets, and resources will be released upon publication atthis https URL.
