- **[CDE: Concept-Driven Exploration for Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08851)**  `arXiv:2510.08851`  `cs.RO`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Intelligent exploration remains a critical challenge in reinforcement learning (RL), especially in visual control tasks. Unlike low-dimensional state-based RL, visual RL must extract task-relevant structure from raw pixels, making exploration inefficient. We propose Concept-Driven Exploration (CDE), which leverages a pre-trained vision-language model (VLM) to generate object-centric visual concepts from textual task descriptions as weak, potentially noisy supervisory signals. Rather than directly conditioning on these noisy signals, CDE trains a policy to reconstruct the concepts via an auxiliary objective, using reconstruction accuracy as an intrinsic reward to guide exploration toward task-relevant objects. Because the policy internalizes these concepts, VLM queries are only needed during training, reducing dependence on external models during deployment. Across five challenging simulated visual manipulation tasks, CDE achieves efficient, targeted exploration and remains robust to noisy VLM predictions. Finally, we demonstrate real-world transfer by deploying CDE on a Franka Research 3 arm, attaining an 80\% success rate in a real-world manipulation task.

- **[DPL: Depth-only Perceptive Humanoid Locomotion via Realistic Depth Synthesis and Cross-Attention Terrain Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07152)**  `arXiv:2510.07152`  `cs.RO`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advancements in legged robot perceptive locomotion have shown promising progress. However, terrain-aware humanoid locomotion remains largely constrained to two paradigms: depth image-based end-to-end learning and elevation map-based methods. The former suffers from limited training efficiency and a significant sim-to-real gap in depth perception, while the latter depends heavily on multiple vision sensors and localization systems, resulting in latency and reduced robustness. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel framework that tightly integrates three key components: (1) Terrain-Aware Locomotion Policy with a Blind Backbone, which leverages pre-trained elevation map-based perception to guide reinforcement learning with minimal visual input; (2) Multi-Modality Cross-Attention Transformer, which reconstructs structured terrain representations from noisy depth images; (3) Realistic Depth Images Synthetic Method, which employs self-occlusion-aware ray casting and noise-aware modeling to synthesize realistic depth observations, achieving over 30\% reduction in terrain reconstruction error. This combination enables efficient policy training with limited data and hardware resources, while preserving critical terrain features essential for generalization. We validate our framework on a full-sized humanoid robot, demonstrating agile and adaptive locomotion across diverse and challenging terrains.

- **[SMapper: A Multi-Modal Data Acquisition Platform for SLAM Benchmarking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09509)**  `arXiv:2509.09509`  `cs.RO`  
  _Pedro Miguel Bastos Soares, Ali Tourani, Miguel Fernandez-Cortizas, Asier Bikandi-Noya, Holger Voos, Jose Luis Sanchez-Lopez_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Advancing research in fields such as Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) and autonomous navigation critically depends on the availability of reliable and reproducible multimodal datasets. While several influential datasets have driven progress in these domains, they often suffer from limitations in sensing modalities, environmental diversity, and the reproducibility of the underlying hardware setups. To address these challenges, this paper introduces SMapper, a novel open-hardware, multi-sensor platform designed explicitly for, though not limited to, SLAM research. The device integrates synchronized LiDAR, multi-camera, and inertial sensing, supported by a robust calibration and synchronization pipeline that ensures precise spatio-temporal alignment across modalities. Its open and replicable design allows researchers to extend its capabilities and reproduce experiments across both handheld and robot-mounted scenarios. To demonstrate its practicality, we additionally release SMapper-light, a publicly available SLAM dataset containing representative indoor and outdoor sequences. The dataset includes tightly synchronized multimodal data and ground truth trajectories derived from offline LiDAR-based SLAM with sub-centimeter accuracy, alongside dense 3D reconstructions. Furthermore, the paper contains benchmarking results on state-of-the-art LiDAR and visual SLAM frameworks using the SMapper-light dataset. By combining open-hardware design, reproducible data collection, and comprehensive benchmarking, SMapper establishes a robust foundation for advancing SLAM algorithm development, evaluation, and reproducibility. The project's documentation, including source code, CAD models, and dataset links, is publicly available atthis https URL.

- **[Robustness in Both Domains: CLIP Needs a Robust Text Encoder](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03355)**  `arXiv:2506.03355`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI` `cs.CV`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Adversarial input attacks can cause a significant shift of CLIP embeddings. This can affect the downstream robustness of models incorporating CLIP in the pipeline, such as text-to-image generative models or large vision language models. While some efforts have been done towards making the CLIP image encoders robust, the robustness of text encoders remains unexplored. In this work, we cover this gap in the literature. We propose LEAF: an efficient adversarial finetuning method for the text domain, with the ability to scale to large CLIP models. Our models significantly improve the zero-shot adversarial accuracy in the text domain, while maintaining the vision performance provided by robust image encoders. When combined with text-to-image diffusion models, we can improve the generation quality under adversarial noise. In multimodal retrieval tasks, LEAF improves the recall under adversarial noise over standard CLIP models. Finally, we show that robust text encoders facilitate better reconstruction of input text from its embedding via direct optimization. We open-source our code (this https URL) and models (this https URL).

- **[Time-Aware Feature Selection: Adaptive Temporal Masking for Stable Sparse Autoencoder Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08855)**  `arXiv:2510.08855`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI` `cs.CL`  
  _T. Ed Li, Junyu Ren_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Understanding the internal representations of large language models is crucial for ensuring their reliability and safety, with sparse autoencoders (SAEs) emerging as a promising interpretability approach. However, current SAE training methods face feature absorption, where features (or neurons) are absorbed into each other to minimize $L_1$ penalty, making it difficult to consistently identify and analyze model behaviors. We introduce Adaptive Temporal Masking (ATM), a novel training approach that dynamically adjusts feature selection by tracking activation magnitudes, frequencies, and reconstruction contributions to compute importance scores that evolve over time. ATM applies a probabilistic masking mechanism based on statistical thresholding of these importance scores, creating a more natural feature selection process. Through extensive experiments on the Gemma-2-2b model, we demonstrate that ATM achieves substantially lower absorption scores compared to existing methods like TopK and JumpReLU SAEs, while maintaining excellent reconstruction quality. These results establish ATM as a principled solution for learning stable, interpretable features in neural networks, providing a foundation for more reliable model analysis.

- **[SQS: Bayesian DNN Compression through Sparse Quantized Sub-distributions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08999)**  `arXiv:2510.08999`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Ziyi Wang, Nan Jiang, Guang Lin, Qifan Song_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Compressing large-scale neural networks is essential for deploying models on resource-constrained devices. Most existing methods adopt weight pruning or low-bit quantization individually, often resulting in suboptimal compression rates to preserve acceptable performance drops. We introduce a unified framework for simultaneous pruning and low-bit quantization via Bayesian variational learning (SQS), which achieves higher compression rates than prior baselines while maintaining comparable performance. The key idea is to employ a spike-and-slab prior to inducing sparsity and model quantized weights using Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) to enable low-bit precision. In theory, we provide the consistent result of our proposed variational approach to a sparse and quantized deep neural network. Extensive experiments on compressing ResNet, BERT-base, Llama3, and Qwen2.5 models show that our method achieves higher compression rates than a line of existing methods with comparable performance drops.

  _Junyu Xuan, Wenlong Chen, Yingzhen Li_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Bayesian Optimisation (BO) is a powerful tool for optimising expensive blackbox functions but its effectiveness diminishes in highdimensional spaces due to sparse data and poor surrogate model scalability While Variational Autoencoder (VAE) based approaches address this by learning low-dimensional latent representations the reconstructionbased objective function often brings the functional distribution mismatch between the latent space and original space leading to suboptimal optimisation performance In this paper we first analyse the reason why reconstructiononly loss may lead to distribution mismatch and then propose HiBBO a novel BO framework that introduces the space consistency into the latent space construction in VAE using HiPPO - a method for longterm sequence modelling - to reduce the functional distribution mismatch between the latent space and original space Experiments on highdimensional benchmark tasks demonstrate that HiBBO outperforms existing VAEBO methods in convergence speed and solution quality Our work bridges the gap between high-dimensional sequence representation learning and efficient Bayesian Optimisation enabling broader applications in neural architecture search materials science and beyond.

- **[Reinforcement Learning-Based Optimization of CT Acquisition and Reconstruction Parameters Through Virtual Imaging Trials](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08763)**  `arXiv:2510.08763`  `cs.LG`  
  _David Fenwick, Navid NaderiAlizadeh, Vahid Tarokh, Nicholas Felice, Darin Clark, Jayasai Rajagopal, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Protocol optimization is critical in Computed Tomography (CT) to achieve high diagnostic image quality while minimizing radiation dose. However, due to the complex interdependencies among CT acquisition and reconstruction parameters, traditional optimization methods rely on exhaustive testing of combinations of these parameters, which is often impractical. This study introduces a novel methodology that combines virtual imaging tools with reinforcement learning to optimize CT protocols more efficiently. Human models with liver lesions were imaged using a validated CT simulator and reconstructed with a novel CT reconstruction toolkit. The optimization parameter space included tube voltage, tube current, reconstruction kernel, slice thickness, and pixel size. The optimization process was performed using a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) agent, which was trained to maximize an image quality objective, specifically the detectability index (d') of liver lesions in the reconstructed images. Optimization performance was compared against an exhaustive search performed on a supercomputer. The proposed reinforcement learning approach achieved the global maximum d' across test cases while requiring 79.7% fewer steps than the exhaustive search, demonstrating both accuracy and computational efficiency. The proposed framework is flexible and can accommodate various image quality objectives. The findings highlight the potential of integrating virtual imaging tools with reinforcement learning for CT protocol management.

- **[CausalDynamics: A large-scale benchmark for structural discovery of dynamical causal models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16620)**  `arXiv:2505.16620`  `cs.LG`  
  _Benjamin Herdeanu, Juan Nathaniel, Carla Roesch, Jatan Buch, Gregor Ramien, Johannes Haux, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Causal discovery for dynamical systems poses a major challenge in fields where active interventions are infeasible. Most methods used to investigate these systems and their associated benchmarks are tailored to deterministic, low-dimensional and weakly nonlinear time-series data. To address these limitations, we present CausalDynamics, a large-scale benchmark and extensible data generation framework to advance the structural discovery of dynamical causal models. Our benchmark consists of true causal graphs derived from thousands of both linearly and nonlinearly coupled ordinary and stochastic differential equations as well as two idealized climate models. We perform a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art causal discovery algorithms for graph reconstruction on systems with noisy, confounded, and lagged dynamics. CausalDynamics consists of a plug-and-play, build-your-own coupling workflow that enables the construction of a hierarchy of physical systems. We anticipate that our framework will facilitate the development of robust causal discovery algorithms that are broadly applicable across domains while addressing their unique challenges. We provide a user-friendly implementation and documentation onthis https URL.

- **[Out-of-Distribution Detection in LiDAR Semantic Segmentation Using Epistemic Uncertainty from Hierarchical GMMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08631)**  `arXiv:2510.08631`  `cs.CV` `cs.LG`  
  _Hanieh Shojaei Miandashti, Claus Brenner_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In addition to accurate scene understanding through precise semantic segmentation of LiDAR point clouds, detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) objects, instances not encountered during training, is essential to prevent the incorrect assignment of unknown objects to known classes. While supervised OOD detection methods depend on auxiliary OOD datasets, unsupervised methods avoid this requirement but typically rely on predictive entropy, the entropy of the predictive distribution obtained by averaging over an ensemble or multiple posterior weight samples. However, these methods often conflate epistemic (model) and aleatoric (data) uncertainties, misclassifying ambiguous in distribution regions as OOD. To address this issue, we present an unsupervised OOD detection approach that employs epistemic uncertainty derived from hierarchical Bayesian modeling of Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) parameters in the feature space of a deep neural network. Without requiring auxiliary data or additional training stages, our approach outperforms existing uncertainty-based methods on the SemanticKITTI dataset, achieving an 18\% improvement in AUROC, 22\% increase in AUPRC, and 36\% reduction in FPR95 (from 76\% to 40\%), compared to the predictive entropy approach used in prior works.

- **[VisionTS++: Cross-Modal Time Series Foundation Model with Continual Pre-trained Vision Backbones](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04379)**  `arXiv:2508.04379`  `cs.CV` `cs.LG`  
  _Lefei Shen, Mouxiang Chen, Xu Liu, Han Fu, Xiaoxue Ren, Jianling Sun, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent studies have indicated that vision models pre-trained on images can serve as time series foundation models (TSFMs) by reformulating time series forecasting (TSF) as image reconstruction. However, effective cross-modal transfer from vision to time series remains challenging due to three discrepancies: (1) the data-modality gap between structured, bounded image data and unbounded, heterogeneous time series; (2) the multivariate-forecasting gap between fixed RGB-three-channel vision models and time series with arbitrary numbers of variates; and (3) the probabilistic-forecasting gap between the deterministic outputs of vision models and the requirement for uncertainty-aware probabilistic predictions. To bridge these gaps, we propose VisonTS++, a TSFM based on continual pre-training of a vision model on large-scale time series. Our approach introduces three key innovations: (1) vision-model-based filtering to identify high-quality sequences to stabilize pre-training and mitigate modality gap; (2) colorized multivariate conversion, encoding multivariate series as multi-subfigure RGB images to enhance cross-variate modeling; (3) multi-quantile forecasting, using parallel reconstruction heads to generate quantile forecasts without parametric assumptions. Experiments show that VisionTS++ achieves state-of-the-art performance in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution forecasting, outperforming specialized TSFMs by 6%-44% in MSE reduction and ranking first in GIFT-Eval benchmark which comprises 23 datasets across 7 domains. Our work demonstrates that with appropriate adaptation, vision models can effectively generalize to TSF, thus advancing the pursuit of universal TSFMs. Code is available atthis https URL.

- **[SAFER-AiD: Saccade-Assisted Foveal-peripheral vision Enhanced Reconstruction for Adversarial Defense](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08761)**  `arXiv:2510.08761`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`  
  _Jiayang Liu, Daniel Tso, Yiming Bu, Qinru Qiu_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Adversarial attacks significantly challenge the safe deployment of deep learning models, particularly in real-world applications. Traditional defenses often rely on computationally intensive optimization (e.g., adversarial training or data augmentation) to improve robustness, whereas the human visual system achieves inherent robustness to adversarial perturbations through evolved biological mechanisms. We hypothesize that attention guided non-homogeneous sparse sampling and predictive coding plays a key role in this robustness. To test this hypothesis, we propose a novel defense framework incorporating three key biological mechanisms: foveal-peripheral processing, saccadic eye movements, and cortical filling-in. Our approach employs reinforcement learning-guided saccades to selectively capture multiple foveal-peripheral glimpses, which are integrated into a reconstructed image before classification. This biologically inspired preprocessing effectively mitigates adversarial noise, preserves semantic integrity, and notably requires no retraining or fine-tuning of downstream classifiers, enabling seamless integration with existing systems. Experiments on the ImageNet dataset demonstrate that our method improves system robustness across diverse classifiers and attack types, while significantly reducing training overhead compared to both biologically and non-biologically inspired defense techniques.

- **[Learning Neural Exposure Fields for View Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08279)**  `arXiv:2510.08279`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`  
  _Michael Niemeyer, Fabian Manhardt, Marie-Julie Rakotosaona, Michael Oechsle, Christina Tsalicoglou, Keisuke Tateno, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in neural scene representations have led to unprecedented quality in 3D reconstruction and view synthesis. Despite achieving high-quality results for common benchmarks with curated data, outputs often degrade for data that contain per image variations such as strong exposure changes, present, e.g., in most scenes with indoor and outdoor areas or rooms with windows. In this paper, we introduce Neural Exposure Fields (NExF), a novel technique for robustly reconstructing 3D scenes with high quality and 3D-consistent appearance from challenging real-world captures. In the core, we propose to learn a neural field predicting an optimal exposure value per 3D point, enabling us to optimize exposure along with the neural scene representation. While capture devices such as cameras select optimal exposure per image/pixel, we generalize this concept and perform optimization in 3D instead. This enables accurate view synthesis in high dynamic range scenarios, bypassing the need of post-processing steps or multi-exposure captures. Our contributions include a novel neural representation for exposure prediction, a system for joint optimization of the scene representation and the exposure field via a novel neural conditioning mechanism, and demonstrated superior performance on challenging real-world data. We find that our approach trains faster than prior works and produces state-of-the-art results on several benchmarks improving by over 55% over best-performing baselines.

- **[Editable Noise Map Inversion: Encoding Target-image into Noise For High-Fidelity Image Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25776)**  `arXiv:2509.25776`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`  
  _Mingyu Kang, Yong Suk Choi_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Text-to-image diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in generating high-quality and diverse images. Building on these advancements, diffusion models have also demonstrated exceptional performance in text-guided image editing. A key strategy for effective image editing involves inverting the source image into editable noise maps associated with the target image. However, previous inversion methods face challenges in adhering closely to the target text prompt. The limitation arises because inverted noise maps, while enabling faithful reconstruction of the source image, restrict the flexibility needed for desired edits. To overcome this issue, we propose Editable Noise Map Inversion (ENM Inversion), a novel inversion technique that searches for optimal noise maps to ensure both content preservation and editability. We analyze the properties of noise maps for enhanced editability. Based on this analysis, our method introduces an editable noise refinement that aligns with the desired edits by minimizing the difference between the reconstructed and edited noise maps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ENM Inversion outperforms existing approaches across a wide range of image editing tasks in both preservation and edit fidelity with target prompts. Our approach can also be easily applied to video editing, enabling temporal consistency and content manipulation across frames.

- **[Vision Language Models: A Survey of 26K Papers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09586)**  `arXiv:2510.09586`  `cs.CV`  
  _Fengming Lin_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present a transparent, reproducible measurement of research trends across 26,104 accepted papers from CVPR, ICLR, and NeurIPS spanning 2023-2025. Titles and abstracts are normalized, phrase-protected, and matched against a hand-crafted lexicon to assign up to 35 topical labels and mine fine-grained cues about tasks, architectures, training regimes, objectives, datasets, and co-mentioned modalities. The analysis quantifies three macro shifts: (1) a sharp rise of multimodal vision-language-LLM work, which increasingly reframes classic perception as instruction following and multi-step reasoning; (2) steady expansion of generative methods, with diffusion research consolidating around controllability, distillation, and speed; and (3) resilient 3D and video activity, with composition moving from NeRFs to Gaussian splatting and a growing emphasis on human- and agent-centric understanding. Within VLMs, parameter-efficient adaptation like prompting/adapters/LoRA and lightweight vision-language bridges dominate; training practice shifts from building encoders from scratch to instruction tuning and finetuning strong backbones; contrastive objectives recede relative to cross-entropy/ranking and distillation. Cross-venue comparisons show CVPR has a stronger 3D footprint and ICLR the highest VLM share, while reliability themes such as efficiency or robustness diffuse across areas. We release the lexicon and methodology to enable auditing and extension. Limitations include lexicon recall and abstract-only scope, but the longitudinal signals are consistent across venues and years.

- **[Mono4DEditor: Text-Driven 4D Scene Editing from Monocular Video via Point-Level Localization of Language-Embedded Gaussians](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09438)**  `arXiv:2510.09438`  `cs.CV`  
  _Jin-Chuan Shi, Chengye Su, Jiajun Wang, Ariel Shamir, Miao Wang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Editing 4D scenes reconstructed from monocular videos based on text prompts is a valuable yet challenging task with broad applications in content creation and virtual environments. The key difficulty lies in achieving semantically precise edits in localized regions of complex, dynamic scenes, while preserving the integrity of unedited content. To address this, we introduce Mono4DEditor, a novel framework for flexible and accurate text-driven 4D scene editing. Our method augments 3D Gaussians with quantized CLIP features to form a language-embedded dynamic representation, enabling efficient semantic querying of arbitrary spatial regions. We further propose a two-stage point-level localization strategy that first selects candidate Gaussians via CLIP similarity and then refines their spatial extent to improve accuracy. Finally, targeted edits are performed on localized regions using a diffusion-based video editing model, with flow and scribble guidance ensuring spatial fidelity and temporal coherence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Mono4DEditor enables high-quality, text-driven edits across diverse scenes and object types, while preserving the appearance and geometry of unedited areas and surpassing prior approaches in both flexibility and visual fidelity.

- **[Visibility-Aware Densification for 3D Gaussian Splatting in Dynamic Urban Scenes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09364)**  `arXiv:2510.09364`  `cs.CV`  
  _Yikang Zhang, Rui Fan_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated impressive performance in synthesizing high-fidelity novel views. Nonetheless, its effectiveness critically depends on the quality of the initialized point cloud. Specifically, achieving uniform and complete point coverage over the underlying scene structure requires overlapping observation frustums, an assumption that is often violated in unbounded, dynamic urban environments. Training Gaussian models with partially initialized point clouds often leads to distortions and artifacts, as camera rays may fail to intersect valid surfaces, resulting in incorrect gradient propagation to Gaussian primitives associated with occluded or invisible geometry. Additionally, existing densification strategies simply clone and split Gaussian primitives from existing ones, incapable of reconstructing missing structures. To address these limitations, we propose VAD-GS, a 3DGS framework tailored for geometry recovery in challenging urban scenes. Our method identifies unreliable geometry structures via voxel-based visibility reasoning, selects informative supporting views through diversity-aware view selection, and recovers missing structures via patch matching-based multi-view stereo reconstruction. This design enables the generation of new Gaussian primitives guided by reliable geometric priors, even in regions lacking initial points. Extensive experiments on the Waymo and nuScenes datasets demonstrate that VAD-GS outperforms state-of-the-art 3DGS approaches and significantly improves the quality of reconstructed geometry for both static and dynamic objects. Source code will be released upon publication.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Accurate and real-time radio map (RM) generation is crucial for next-generation wireless systems, yet diffusion-based approaches often suffer from large model sizes, slow iterative denoising, and high inference latency, which hinder practical deployment. To overcome these limitations, we propose \textbf{RadioFlow}, a novel flow-matching-based generative framework that achieves high-fidelity RM generation through single-step efficient sampling. Unlike conventional diffusion models, RadioFlow learns continuous transport trajectories between noise and data, enabling both training and inference to be significantly accelerated while preserving reconstruction accuracy. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that RadioFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance with \textbf{up to 8$\times$ fewer parameters} and \textbf{over 4$\times$ faster inference} compared to the leading diffusion-based baseline (RadioDiff). This advancement provides a promising pathway toward scalable, energy-efficient, and real-time electromagnetic digital twins for future 6G networks. We release the code at \href{this https URL}{GitHub}.

- **[Polar Separable Transform for Efficient Orthogonal Rotation-Invariant Image Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09125)**  `arXiv:2510.09125`  `cs.CV`  
  _Satya P. Singh, Rashmi Chaudhry, Anand Srivastava, Jagath C. Rajapakse_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Orthogonal moment-based image representations are fundamental in computer vision, but classical methods suffer from high computational complexity and numerical instability at large orders. Zernike and pseudo-Zernike moments, for instance, require coupled radial-angular processing that precludes efficient factorization, resulting in $\mathcal{O}(n^3N^2)$ to $\mathcal{O}(n^6N^2)$ complexity and $\mathcal{O}(N^4)$ condition number scaling for the $n$th-order moments on an $N\times N$ image. We introduce \textbf{PSepT} (Polar Separable Transform), a separable orthogonal transform that overcomes the non-separability barrier in polar coordinates. PSepT achieves complete kernel factorization via tensor-product construction of Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) radial bases and Fourier harmonic angular bases, enabling independent radial and angular processing. This separable design reduces computational complexity to $\mathcal{O}(N^2 \log N)$, memory requirements to $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$, and condition number scaling to $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{N})$, representing exponential improvements over polynomial approaches. PSepT exhibits orthogonality, completeness, energy conservation, and rotation-covariance properties. Experimental results demonstrate better numerical stability, computational efficiency, and competitive classification performance on structured datasets, while preserving exact reconstruction. The separable framework enables high-order moment analysis previously infeasible with classical methods, opening new possibilities for robust image analysis applications.

  _Yao Teng, Fuyun Wang, Xian Liu, Zhekai Chen, Han Shi, Yu Wang, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As a new paradigm of visual content generation, autoregressive text-to-image models suffer from slow inference due to their sequential token-by-token decoding process, often requiring thousands of model forward passes to generate a single image. To address this inefficiency, we propose Speculative Jacobi-Denoising Decoding (SJD2), a framework that incorporates the denoising process into Jacobi iterations to enable parallel token generation in autoregressive models. Our method introduces a next-clean-token prediction paradigm that enables the pre-trained autoregressive models to accept noise-perturbed token embeddings and predict the next clean tokens through low-cost fine-tuning. This denoising paradigm guides the model towards more stable Jacobi trajectories. During inference, our method initializes token sequences with Gaussian noise and performs iterative next-clean-token-prediction in the embedding space. We employ a probabilistic criterion to verify and accept multiple tokens in parallel, and refine the unaccepted tokens for the next iteration with the denoising trajectory. Experiments show that our method can accelerate generation by reducing model forward passes while maintaining the visual quality of generated images.

- **[MultiMAE for Brain MRIs: Robustness to Missing Inputs Using Multi-Modal Masked Autoencoder](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11442)**  `arXiv:2509.11442`  `cs.CV`  
  _Ayhan Can Erdur, Christian Beischl, Daniel Scholz, Jiazhen Pan, Benedikt Wiestler, Daniel Rueckert, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Missing input sequences are common in medical imaging data, posing a challenge for deep learning models reliant on complete input data. In this work, inspired by MultiMAE [2], we develop a masked autoencoder (MAE) paradigm for multi-modal, multi-task learning in 3D medical imaging with brain MRIs. Our method treats each MRI sequence as a separate input modality, leveraging a late-fusion-style transformer encoder to integrate multi-sequence information (multi-modal) and individual decoder streams for each modality for multi-task reconstruction. This pretraining strategy guides the model to learn rich representations per modality while also equipping it to handle missing inputs through cross-sequence reasoning. The result is a flexible and generalizable encoder for brain MRIs that infers missing sequences from available inputs and can be adapted to various downstream applications. We demonstrate the performance and robustness of our method against an MAE-ViT baseline in downstream segmentation and classification tasks, showing absolute improvement of $10.1$ overall Dice score and $0.46$ MCC over the baselines with missing input sequences. Our experiments demonstrate the strength of this pretraining strategy. The implementation is made available.

- **[Unified Multimodal Model as Auto-Encoder](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09666)**  `arXiv:2509.09666`  `cs.CV`  
  _Zhiyuan Yan, Kaiqing Lin, Zongjian Li, Junyan Ye, Hui Han, Zhendong Wang, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The pursuit of unified multimodal models (UMMs) has long been hindered by a fundamental schism between multimodal understanding and generation. Current approaches typically disentangle the two and treat them as separate endeavors with disjoint objectives, missing the mutual benefits. We argue that true unification requires more than just merging two tasks. It requires a unified, foundational objective that intrinsically links them. In this paper, we introduce an insightful paradigm through the Auto-Encoder lens, i.e., regarding understanding as the encoder (I2T) that compresses images into text, and generation as the decoder (T2I) that reconstructs images from that text. To implement this, we propose UAE, where we begin by pre-training the decoder with the proposed 700k long-context image-caption pairs to direct it to "understand" the fine-grained and complex semantics from the text. We then propose Unified-GRPO via reinforcement learning (RL) to unify the two, which covers two complementary stages: (1) Generation for Understanding, where the encoder is trained to generate informative captions that maximize the decoder's reconstruction quality, enhancing its visual perception; (2) Understanding for Generation, where the decoder is refined to reconstruct from these captions, forcing it to leverage every detail and improving its long-context instruction following and generation fidelity. Our empirical results suggest that understanding can largely enhance generation (verified on GenEval), while generation, in turn, notably strengthens fine-grained visual perception like small object and color recognition (verified on MMT-Bench). This bidirectional improvement reveals a deep synergy: under the unified reconstruction objective, generation and understanding can mutually benefit each other, moving closer to truly unified multimodal intelligence.

  We present a feed-forward framework for Gaussian full-head synthesis from a single unposed image. Unlike previous work that relies on time-consuming GAN inversion and test-time optimization, our framework can reconstruct the Gaussian full-head model given a single unposed image in a single forward pass. This enables fast reconstruction and rendering during inference. To mitigate the lack of large-scale 3D head assets, we propose a large-scale synthetic dataset from trained 3D GANs and train our framework using only synthetic data. For efficient high-fidelity generation, we introduce a coarse-to-fine Gaussian head generation pipeline, where sparse points from the FLAME model interact with the image features by transformer blocks for feature extraction and coarse shape reconstruction, which are then densified for high-fidelity reconstruction. To fully leverage the prior knowledge residing in pretrained 3D GANs for effective reconstruction, we propose a dual-branch framework that effectively aggregates the structured spherical triplane feature and unstructured point-based features for more effective Gaussian head reconstruction. Experimental results show the effectiveness of our framework towards existing work. Project page at:this https URL.

  In this paper, we propose UniLIP, a unified framework that adapts CLIP for multimodal understanding, generation and editing. Although CLIP excels at understanding, it lacks reconstruction abilities required to be a unified visual encoder. However, previous CLIP-based unified methods fail to balance understanding and reconstruction, leading to semantic degradation or inconsistent reconstructions. In contrast, we introduce a novel two-stage training scheme with a self-distillation strategy that progressively endows CLIP with high-fidelity reconstruction abilities while preserving its original comprehension performance. For enhanced reasoning and consistency in generation and editing, we further develop a dual-condition architecture built upon the MetaQuery framework. Our architecture jointly utilizes multimodal hidden states for rich contextual details and learnable query embeddings to harness the powerful reasoning abilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Leveraging advanced image representation and architectural design, UniLIP demonstrates superior instruction following and edit fidelity. With only 1B and 3B parameters, UniLIP can outperform larger unified models such as BAGEL (7B) and Uniworld-V1 (12B), achieving state-of-the-art performance of 0.90 on GenEval, 0.63 on WISE, and 3.94 on ImgEdit. These results demonstrate that UniLIP successfully expands the application of CLIP, establishing its continuous features to not only serve as the optimal choice for understanding tasks but also achieve highly competitive performance in generation and editing tasks.

  We address the problem of Embodied Reference Understanding, which involves predicting the object that a person in the scene is referring to through both pointing gesture and language. Accurately identifying the referent requires multimodal understanding: integrating textual instructions, visual pointing, and scene context. However, existing methods often struggle to effectively leverage visual clues for disambiguation. We also observe that, while the referent is often aligned with the head-to-fingertip line, it occasionally aligns more closely with the wrist-to-fingertip line. Therefore, relying on a single line assumption can be overly simplistic and may lead to suboptimal performance. To address this, we propose a dual-model framework, where one model learns from the head-to-fingertip direction and the other from the wrist-to-fingertip direction. We further introduce a Gaussian ray heatmap representation of these lines and use them as input to provide a strong supervisory signal that encourages the model to better attend to pointing cues. To combine the strengths of both models, we present the CLIP-Aware Pointing Ensemble module, which performs a hybrid ensemble based on CLIP features. Additionally, we propose an object center prediction head as an auxiliary task to further enhance referent localization. We validate our approach through extensive experiments and analysis on the benchmark YouRefIt dataset, achieving an improvement of approximately 4 mAP at the 0.25 IoU threshold. We further evaluate our approach on the CAESAR and ISL Pointing datasets.

  Autoregressive image generation aims to predict the next token based on previous ones. However, this process is challenged by the bidirectional dependencies inherent in conventional image tokenizations, which creates a fundamental misalignment with the unidirectional nature of autoregressive models. To resolve this, we introduce AliTok, a novel Aligned Tokenizer that alters the dependency structure of the token sequence. AliTok employs a bidirectional encoder constrained by a causal decoder, a design that compels the encoder to produce a token sequence with both semantic richness and forward-dependency. Furthermore, by incorporating prefix tokens and employing a two-stage tokenizer training process to enhance reconstruction performance, AliTok achieves high fidelity and predictability simultaneously. Building upon AliTok, a standard decoder-only autoregressive model with just 177M parameters achieves a gFID of 1.44 and an IS of 319.5 on the ImageNet-256 benchmark. Scaling up to 662M parameters, our model reaches a gFID of 1.28, surpassing the state-of-the-art diffusion method while achieving a 10x faster sampling speed.

  A major breakthrough in 3D reconstruction is the feedforward paradigm to generate pixel-wise 3D points or Gaussian primitives from sparse, unposed images. To further incorporate semantics while avoiding the significant memory and storage costs of high-dimensional semantic features, existing methods extend this paradigm by associating each primitive with a compressed semantic feature vector. However, these methods have two major limitations: (a) the naively compressed feature compromises expressiveness, affecting the model's ability to capture fine-grained semantics, and (b) the pixel-wise primitive prediction introduces redundancy in overlapping areas, causing unnecessary memory overhead. To this end, we introduce \textbf{SpatialSplat}, a feedforward framework that produces redundancy-aware Gaussians and capitalizes on a dual-field semantic representation. Particularly, with the insight that primitives within the same instance exhibit high semantic consistency, we decompose the semantic representation into a coarse feature field that encodes uncompressed semantics with minimal primitives, and a fine-grained yet low-dimensional feature field that captures detailed inter-instance relationships. Moreover, we propose a selective Gaussian mechanism, which retains only essential Gaussians in the scene, effectively eliminating redundant primitives. Our proposed Spatialsplat learns accurate semantic information and detailed instances prior with more compact 3D Gaussians, making semantic 3D reconstruction more applicable. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate our method, demonstrating a remarkable 60\% reduction in scene representation parameters while achieving superior performance over state-of-the-art methods.

  Named entities are fundamental building blocks of knowledge in text, grounding factual information and structuring relationships within language. Despite their importance, it remains unclear how Large Language Models (LLMs) internally represent entities. Prior research has primarily examined explicit relationships, but little is known about entity representations themselves. We introduce entity mention reconstruction as a novel framework for studying how LLMs encode and manipulate entities. We investigate whether entity mentions can be generated from internal representations, how multi-token entities are encoded beyond last-token embeddings, and whether these representations capture relational knowledge. Our proposed method, leveraging _task vectors_, allows to consistently generate multi-token mentions from various entity representations derived from the LLMs hidden states. We thus introduce the _Entity Lens_, extending the _logit-lens_ to predict multi-token mentions. Our results bring new evidence that LLMs develop entity-specific mechanisms to represent and manipulate any multi-token entities, including those unseen during training. Our code is avalable atthis https URL.

  Context compression presents a promising approach for accelerating large language model (LLM) inference by compressing long contexts into compact representations. Current context compression methods predominantly rely on autoencoding tasks to train context-agnostic compression tokens to compress contextual semantics. While autoencoding tasks enable compression tokens to acquire compression capabilities, compression via autoencoding tasks creates a fundamental mismatch: the models are optimized for reconstruction that diverge from actual downstream tasks, thereby weakening the features more beneficial for real-world usage. We propose Semantic-Anchor Compression (SAC), a novel method that shifts from autoencoding task based compression to an architecture that is equipped with this compression capability \textit{a priori}. Instead of training models to compress contexts through autoencoding tasks, SAC directly selects so-called anchor tokens from the original context and aggregates contextual information into their key-value (KV) representations. By deriving representations directly from the contextual tokens, SAC eliminates the need for autoencoding training. To ensure compression performance while directly leveraging anchor tokens, SAC incorporates two key designs: (1) anchor embeddings that enable the compressor to identify critical tokens, and (2) bidirectional attention modification that allows anchor tokens to capture information from the entire context. Experimental results demonstrate that SAC consistently outperforms existing context compression methods across various compression ratios. On out-of-distribution evaluation using MRQA, SAC achieves 1 EM improvement at 5x compression over strong baselines, with increasing advantages at higher compression ratios.

  The deep-research framework orchestrates external tools to perform complex, multi-step scientific reasoning that exceeds the native limits of a single large language model. However, it still suffers from context pollution, weak evidentiary support, and brittle execution paths. To address these issues, we propose DualResearch, a retrieval and fusion framework that matches the epistemic structure of tool-intensive reasoning by jointly modeling two complementary graphs: a breadth semantic graph that encodes stable background knowledge, and a depth causal graph that captures execution provenance. Each graph has a layer-native relevance function, seed-anchored semantic diffusion for breadth, and causal-semantic path matching with reliability weighting for depth. To reconcile their heterogeneity and query-dependent uncertainty, DualResearch converts per-layer path evidence into answer distributions and fuses them in log space via an entropy-gated rule with global calibration. The fusion up-weights the more certain channel and amplifies agreement. As a complement to deep-research systems, DualResearch compresses lengthy multi-tool execution logs into a concise reasoning graph, and we show that it can reconstruct answers stably and effectively. On the scientific reasoning benchmarks HLE and GPQA, DualResearch achieves competitive performance. Using log files from the open-source system InternAgent, its accuracy improves by 7.7% on HLE and 6.06% on GPQA.
