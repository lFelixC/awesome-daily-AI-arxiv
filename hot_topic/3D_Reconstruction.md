- **[Act to See, See to Act: Diffusion-Driven Perception-Action Interplay for Adaptive Policies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25822)**  `arXiv:2509.25822`  `cs.RO`

  Existing imitation learning methods decouple perception and action, which overlooks the causal reciprocity between sensory representations and action execution that humans naturally leverage for adaptive behaviors. To bridge this gap, we introduce Action-Guided Diffusion Policy (DP-AG), a unified representation learning that explicitly models a dynamic interplay between perception and action through probabilistic latent dynamics. DP-AG encodes latent observations into a Gaussian posterior via variational inference and evolves them using an action-guided SDE, where the Vector-Jacobian Product (VJP) of the diffusion policy's noise predictions serves as a structured stochastic force driving latent updates. To promote bidirectional learning between perception and action, we introduce a cycle-consistent contrastive loss that organizes the gradient flow of the noise predictor into a coherent perception-action loop, enforcing mutually consistent transitions in both latent updates and action refinements. Theoretically, we derive a variational lower bound for the action-guided SDE, and prove that the contrastive objective enhances continuity in both latent and action trajectories. Empirically, DP-AG significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods across simulation benchmarks and real-world UR5 manipulation tasks. As a result, our DP-AG offers a promising step toward bridging biological adaptability and artificial policy learning.

  As large language models (LLMs) continue to grow in capability, there is increasing interest in incorporating them into decision-making tasks. A common pipeline for this is Decision-Pretrained Transformers (DPTs). However, existing training methods for DPTs often struggle to generalize beyond their pretraining data distribution. To explore mitigation of this limitation, we propose in-context curiosity -- a lightweight, exploration-inspired regularizer for offline pretraining -- and introduce the Prediction-Powered Transformer (PPT) framework. PPT augments DPT with an auxiliary reward predictor, using prediction error as an intrinsic curiosity signal to encourage broader exploration during training. In proof-of-concept experiments on Gaussian multi-armed bandits, PPT shows improved robustness: it moderates the performance degradation observed in DPT when test environments exhibit higher variance in reward, particularly when pretraining data has limited diversity. While the quality of offline data remain fundamental, our preliminary results suggest that curiosity-driven pretraining offers a promising direction for enhancing out-of-distribution generalization in in-context RL agents.

- **[AbsTopK: Rethinking Sparse Autoencoders For Bidirectional Features](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00404)**  `arXiv:2510.00404`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI` `cs.CL`

  Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as powerful techniques for interpretability of large language models (LLMs), aiming to decompose hidden states into meaningful semantic features. While several SAE variants have been proposed, there remains no principled framework to derive SAEs from the original dictionary learning formulation. In this work, we introduce such a framework by unrolling the proximal gradient method for sparse coding. We show that a single-step update naturally recovers common SAE variants, including ReLU, JumpReLU, and TopK. Through this lens, we reveal a fundamental limitation of existing SAEs: their sparsity-inducing regularizers enforce non-negativity, preventing a single feature from representing bidirectional concepts (e.g., male vs. female). This structural constraint fragments semantic axes into separate, redundant features, limiting representational completeness. To address this issue, we propose AbsTopK SAE, a new variant derived from the $\ell_0$ sparsity constraint that applies hard thresholding over the largest-magnitude activations. By preserving both positive and negative activations, AbsTopK uncovers richer, bidirectional conceptual representations. Comprehensive experiments across four LLMs and seven probing and steering tasks show that AbsTopK improves reconstruction fidelity, enhances interpretability, and enables single features to encode contrasting concepts. Remarkably, AbsTopK matches or even surpasses the Difference-in-Mean method, a supervised approach that requires labeled data for each concept and has been shown in prior work to outperform SAEs.

- **[Black-Box Time-Series Domain Adaptation via Cross-Prompt Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00487)**  `arXiv:2510.00487`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _M. T. Furqon, Mahardhika Pratama, Igor Skrjanc, Lin Liu, Habibullah Habibullah, Kutluyil Dogancay_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The black-box domain adaptation (BBDA) topic is developed to address the privacy and security issues where only an application programming interface (API) of the source model is available for domain adaptations. Although the BBDA topic has attracted growing research attentions, existing works mostly target the vision applications and are not directly applicable to the time-series applications possessing unique spatio-temporal characteristics. In addition, none of existing approaches have explored the strength of foundation model for black box time-series domain adaptation (BBTSDA). This paper proposes a concept of Cross-Prompt Foundation Model (CPFM) for the BBTSDA problems. CPFM is constructed under a dual branch network structure where each branch is equipped with a unique prompt to capture different characteristics of data distributions. In the domain adaptation phase, the reconstruction learning phase in the prompt and input levels is developed. All of which are built upon a time-series foundation model to overcome the spatio-temporal dynamic. Our rigorous experiments substantiate the advantage of CPFM achieving improved results with noticeable margins from its competitors in three time-series datasets of different application domains.

- **[Vicinity-Guided Discriminative Latent Diffusion for Privacy-Preserving Domain Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00478)**  `arXiv:2510.00478`  `cs.LG`

  Recent work on latent diffusion models (LDMs) has focused almost exclusively on generative tasks, leaving their potential for discriminative transfer largely unexplored. We introduce Discriminative Vicinity Diffusion (DVD), a novel LDM-based framework for a more practical variant of source-free domain adaptation (SFDA): the source provider may share not only a pre-trained classifier but also an auxiliary latent diffusion module, trained once on the source data and never exposing raw source samples. DVD encodes each source feature's label information into its latent vicinity by fitting a Gaussian prior over its k-nearest neighbors and training the diffusion network to drift noisy samples back to label-consistent representations. During adaptation, we sample from each target feature's latent vicinity, apply the frozen diffusion module to generate source-like cues, and use a simple InfoNCE loss to align the target encoder to these cues, explicitly transferring decision boundaries without source access. Across standard SFDA benchmarks, DVD outperforms state-of-the-art methods. We further show that the same latent diffusion module enhances the source classifier's accuracy on in-domain data and boosts performance in supervised classification and domain generalization experiments. DVD thus reinterprets LDMs as practical, privacy-preserving bridges for explicit knowledge transfer, addressing a core challenge in source-free domain adaptation that prior methods have yet to solve.

  _Harbir Antil, Deepanshu Verma_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Neural network training relies on gradient computation through backpropagation, yet memory requirements for storing layer activations present significant scalability challenges. We present the first adaptation of control-theoretic matrix sketching to neural network layer activations, enabling memory-efficient gradient reconstruction in backpropagation. This work builds on recent matrix sketching frameworks for dynamic optimization problems, where similar state trajectory storage challenges motivate sketching techniques. Our approach sketches layer activations using three complementary sketch matrices maintained through exponential moving averages (EMA) with adaptive rank adjustment, automatically balancing memory efficiency against approximation quality. Empirical evaluation on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and physics-informed neural networks demonstrates a controllable accuracy-memory tradeoff. We demonstrate a gradient monitoring application on MNIST showing how sketched activations enable real-time gradient norm tracking with minimal memory overhead. These results establish that sketched activation storage provides a viable path toward memory-efficient neural network training and analysis.

  Deep Gaussian processes (DGPs) enable expressive hierarchical Bayesian modeling but pose substantial challenges for posterior inference, especially over inducing variables. Denoising diffusion variational inference (DDVI) addresses this by modeling the posterior as a time-reversed diffusion from a simple Gaussian prior. However, DDVI's fixed unconditional starting distribution remains far from the complex true posterior, resulting in inefficient inference trajectories and slow convergence. In this work, we propose Diffusion Bridge Variational Inference (DBVI), a principled extension of DDVI that initiates the reverse diffusion from a learnable, data-dependent initial distribution. This initialization is parameterized via an amortized neural network and progressively adapted using gradients from the ELBO objective, reducing the posterior gap and improving sample efficiency. To enable scalable amortization, we design the network to operate on the inducing inputs, which serve as structured, low-dimensional summaries of the dataset and naturally align with the inducing variables' shape. DBVI retains the mathematical elegance of DDVI, including Girsanov-based ELBOs and reverse-time SDEs,while reinterpreting the prior via a Doob-bridged diffusion process. We derive a tractable training objective under this formulation and implement DBVI for scalable inference in large-scale DGPs. Across regression, classification, and image reconstruction tasks, DBVI consistently outperforms DDVI and other variational baselines in predictive accuracy, convergence speed, and posterior quality.

- **[Fully Heteroscedastic Count Regression with Deep Double Poisson Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09262)**  `arXiv:2406.09262`  `cs.LG`  
  _Spencer Young, Porter Jenkins, Longchao Da, Jeff Dotson, Hua Wei_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Neural networks capable of accurate, input-conditional uncertainty representation are essential for real-world AI systems. Deep ensembles of Gaussian networks have proven highly effective for continuous regression due to their ability to flexibly represent aleatoric uncertainty via unrestricted heteroscedastic variance, which in turn enables accurate epistemic uncertainty estimation. However, no analogous approach exists for count regression, despite many important applications. To address this gap, we propose the Deep Double Poisson Network (DDPN), a novel neural discrete count regression model that outputs the parameters of the Double Poisson distribution, enabling arbitrarily high or low predictive aleatoric uncertainty for count data and improving epistemic uncertainty estimation when ensembled. We formalize and prove that DDPN exhibits robust regression properties similar to heteroscedastic Gaussian models via learnable loss attenuation, and introduce a simple loss modification to control this behavior. Experiments on diverse datasets demonstrate that DDPN outperforms current baselines in accuracy, calibration, and out-of-distribution detection, establishing a new state-of-the-art in deep count regression.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Blind Image Restoration (BIR) methods have achieved remarkable success but falter when faced with Extreme Blind Image Restoration (EBIR), where inputs suffer from severe, compounded degradations beyond their training scope. Directly learning a mapping from extremely low-quality (ELQ) to high-quality (HQ) images is challenging due to the massive domain gap, often leading to unnatural artifacts and loss of detail. To address this, we propose a novel framework that decomposes the intractable ELQ-to-HQ restoration process. We first learn a projector that maps an ELQ image onto an intermediate, less-degraded LQ manifold. This intermediate image is then restored to HQ using a frozen, off-the-shelf BIR model. Our approach is grounded in information theory; we provide a novel perspective of image restoration as an Information Bottleneck problem and derive a theoretically-driven objective to train our projector. This loss function effectively stabilizes training by balancing a low-quality reconstruction term with a high-quality prior-matching term. Our framework enables Look Forward Once (LFO) for inference-time prompt refinement, and supports plug-and-play strengthening of existing image restoration models without need for finetuning. Extensive experiments under severe degradation regimes provide a thorough analysis of the effectiveness of our work.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Hierarchical classification is a crucial task in many applications, where objects are organized into multiple levels of categories. However, conventional classification approaches often neglect inherent inter-class relationships at different hierarchy levels, thus missing important supervisory signals. Thus, we propose two novel hierarchical contrastive learning (HMLC) methods. The first, leverages a Gaussian Mixture Model (G-HMLC) and the second uses an attention mechanism to capture hierarchy-specific features (A-HMLC), imitating human processing. Our approach explicitly models inter-class relationships and imbalanced class distribution at higher hierarchy levels, enabling fine-grained clustering across all hierarchy levels. On the competitive CIFAR100 and ModelNet40 datasets, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in linear evaluation, outperforming existing hierarchical contrastive learning methods by 2 percentage points in terms of accuracy. The effectiveness of our approach is backed by both quantitative and qualitative results, highlighting its potential for applications in computer vision and beyond.

- **[Measuring and Controlling the Spectral Bias for Self-Supervised Image Denoising](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00454)**  `arXiv:2510.00454`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Current self-supervised denoising methods for paired noisy images typically involve mapping one noisy image through the network to the other noisy image. However, after measuring the spectral bias of such methods using our proposed Image Pair Frequency-Band Similarity, it suffers from two practical limitations. Firstly, the high-frequency structural details in images are not preserved well enough. Secondly, during the process of fitting high frequencies, the network learns high-frequency noise from the mapped noisy images. To address these challenges, we introduce a Spectral Controlling network (SCNet) to optimize self-supervised denoising of paired noisy images. First, we propose a selection strategy to choose frequency band components for noisy images, to accelerate the convergence speed of training. Next, we present a parameter optimization method that restricts the learning ability of convolutional kernels to high-frequency noise using the Lipschitz constant, without changing the network structure. Finally, we introduce the Spectral Separation and low-rank Reconstruction module (SSR module), which separates noise and high-frequency details through frequency domain separation and low-rank space reconstruction, to retain the high-frequency structural details of images. Experiments performed on synthetic and real-world datasets verify the effectiveness of SCNet.

  Humans possess a remarkable ability to mentally explore and replay 3D environments they have previously experienced. Inspired by this mental process, we present EvoWorld: a world model that bridges panoramic video generation with evolving 3D memory to enable spatially consistent long-horizon exploration. Given a single panoramic image as input, EvoWorld first generates future video frames by leveraging a video generator with fine-grained view control, then evolves the scene's 3D reconstruction using a feedforward plug-and-play transformer, and finally synthesizes futures by conditioning on geometric reprojections from this evolving explicit 3D memory. Unlike prior state-of-the-arts that synthesize videos only, our key insight lies in exploiting this evolving 3D reconstruction as explicit spatial guidance for the video generation process, projecting the reconstructed geometry onto target viewpoints to provide rich spatial cues that significantly enhance both visual realism and geometric consistency. To evaluate long-range exploration capabilities, we introduce the first comprehensive benchmark spanning synthetic outdoor environments, Habitat indoor scenes, and challenging real-world scenarios, with particular emphasis on loop-closure detection and spatial coherence over extended trajectories. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our evolving 3D memory substantially improves visual fidelity and maintains spatial scene coherence compared to existing approaches, representing a significant advance toward long-horizon spatially consistent world modeling.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Dynamic view synthesis has seen significant advances, yet reconstructing scenes from uncalibrated, casual video remains challenging due to slow optimization and complex parameter estimation. In this work, we present Instant4D, a monocular reconstruction system that leverages native 4D representation to efficiently process casual video sequences within minutes, without calibrated cameras or depth sensors. Our method begins with geometric recovery through deep visual SLAM, followed by grid pruning to optimize scene representation. Our design significantly reduces redundancy while maintaining geometric integrity, cutting model size to under 10% of its original footprint. To handle temporal dynamics efficiently, we introduce a streamlined 4D Gaussian representation, achieving a 30x speed-up and reducing training time to within two minutes, while maintaining competitive performance across several benchmarks. Our method reconstruct a single video within 10 minutes on the Dycheck dataset or for a typical 200-frame video. We further apply our model to in-the-wild videos, showcasing its generalizability.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Self-supervised learning for inverse problems allows to train a reconstruction network from noise and/or incomplete data alone. These methods have the potential of enabling learning-based solutions when obtaining ground-truth references for training is expensive or even impossible. In this paper, we propose a new self-supervised learning strategy devised for the challenging setting where measurements are observed via a single incomplete observation model. We introduce a new definition of equivariance in the context of reconstruction networks, and show that the combination of self-supervised splitting losses and equivariant reconstruction networks results in unbiased estimates of the supervised loss. Through a series of experiments on image inpainting, accelerated magnetic resonance imaging, and compressive sensing, we demonstrate that the proposed loss achieves state-of-the-art performance in settings with highly rank-deficient forward models.

  _Xiangtao Kong, Rongyuan Wu, Shuaizheng Liu, Lingchen Sun, Lei Zhang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Most recent real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR) methods employ pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models to synthesize the high-quality image either from random Gaussian noise, which yields realistic results but is slow due to iterative denoising, or directly from the input low-quality image, which is efficient but at the price of lower output quality. These approaches train ControlNet or LoRA modules while keeping the pre-trained model fixed, which often introduces over-enhanced artifacts and hallucinations, suffering from the robustness to inputs of varying degradations. Recent visual autoregressive (AR) models, such as pre-trained Infinity, can provide strong T2I generation capabilities while offering superior efficiency by using the bitwise next-scale prediction strategy. Building upon next-scale prediction, we introduce a robust Real-ISR framework, namely Next-Scale Autoregressive Modeling (NSARM). Specifically, we train NSARM in two stages: a transformation network is first trained to map the input low-quality image to preliminary scales, followed by an end-to-end full-model fine-tuning. Such a comprehensive fine-tuning enhances the robustness of NSARM in Real-ISR tasks without compromising its generative capability. Extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate that as a pure AR model, NSARM achieves superior visual results over existing Real-ISR methods while maintaining a fast inference speed. Most importantly, it demonstrates much higher robustness to the quality of input images, showing stronger generalization performance. Project page:this https URL

- **[Multi-level Dynamic Style Transfer for NeRFs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00592)**  `arXiv:2510.00592`  `cs.CV`  
  _Zesheng Li, Shuaibo Li, Wei Ma, Jianwei Guo, Hongbin Zha_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As the application of neural radiance fields (NeRFs) in various 3D vision tasks continues to expand, numerous NeRF-based style transfer techniques have been developed. However, existing methods typically integrate style statistics into the original NeRF pipeline, often leading to suboptimal results in both content preservation and artistic stylization. In this paper, we present multi-level dynamic style transfer for NeRFs (MDS-NeRF), a novel approach that reengineers the NeRF pipeline specifically for stylization and incorporates an innovative dynamic style injection module. Particularly, we propose a multi-level feature adaptor that helps generate a multi-level feature grid representation from the content radiance field, effectively capturing the multi-scale spatial structure of the scene. In addition, we present a dynamic style injection module that learns to extract relevant style features and adaptively integrates them into the content patterns. The stylized multi-level features are then transformed into the final stylized view through our proposed multi-level cascade decoder. Furthermore, we extend our 3D style transfer method to support omni-view style transfer using 3D style references. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MDS-NeRF achieves outstanding performance for 3D style transfer, preserving multi-scale spatial structures while effectively transferring stylistic characteristics.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  How can we reconstruct 3D hand poses when large portions of the hand are heavily occluded by itself or by objects? Humans often resolve such ambiguities by leveraging contextual knowledge -- such as affordances, where an object's shape and function suggest how the object is typically grasped. Inspired by this observation, we propose a generative prior for hand pose refinement guided by affordance-aware textual descriptions of hand-object interactions (HOI). Our method employs a diffusion-based generative model that learns the distribution of plausible hand poses conditioned on affordance descriptions, which are inferred from a large vision-language model (VLM). This enables the refinement of occluded regions into more accurate and functionally coherent hand poses. Extensive experiments on HOGraspNet, a 3D hand-affordance dataset with severe occlusions, demonstrate that our affordance-guided refinement significantly improves hand pose estimation over both recent regression methods and diffusion-based refinement lacking contextual reasoning.

  _Yuanyuan Gao, Yuning Gong, Yifei Liu, Li Jingfeng, Zhihang Zhong, Dingwen Zhang, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as an efficient approach for achieving photorealistic rendering. Recent MLP-based variants further improve visual fidelity but introduce substantial decoding overhead during rendering. To alleviate computation cost, several pruning strategies and level-of-detail (LOD) techniques have been introduced, aiming to effectively reduce the number of Gaussian primitives in large-scale scenes. However, our analysis reveals that significant redundancy still remains due to the lack of occlusion awareness. In this work, we propose Proxy-GS, a novel pipeline that exploits a proxy to introduce Gaussian occlusion awareness from any view. At the core of our approach is a fast proxy system capable of producing precise occlusion depth maps at a resolution of 1000x1000 under 1ms. This proxy serves two roles: first, it guides the culling of anchors and Gaussians to accelerate rendering speed. Second, it guides the densification towards surfaces during training, avoiding inconsistencies in occluded regions, and improving the rendering quality. In heavily occluded scenarios, such as the MatrixCity Streets dataset, Proxy-GS not only equips MLP-based Gaussian splatting with stronger rendering capability but also achieves faster rendering speed. Specifically, it achieves more than 2.5x speedup over Octree-GS, and consistently delivers substantially higher rendering quality. Code will be public upon acceptance.

  _Gaole Dai, Menghang Dong, Rongyu Zhang, Ruichuan An, Shanghang Zhang, Tiejun Huang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The process through which humans perceive and learn visual representations in dynamic environments is highly complex. From a structural perspective, the human eye decouples the functions of cone and rod cells: cones are primarily responsible for color perception, while rods are specialized in detecting motion, particularly variations in light intensity. These two distinct modalities of visual information are integrated and processed within the visual cortex, thereby enhancing the robustness of the human visual system. Inspired by this biological mechanism, modern hardware systems have evolved to include not only color-sensitive RGB cameras but also motion-sensitive Dynamic Visual Systems, such as spike cameras. Building upon these advancements, this study seeks to emulate the human visual system by integrating decomposed multi-modal visual inputs with modern latent-space generative frameworks. We named it SpikeGen. We evaluate its performance across various spike-RGB tasks, including conditional image and video deblurring, dense frame reconstruction from spike streams, and high-speed scene novel-view synthesis. Supported by extensive experiments, we demonstrate that leveraging the latent space manipulation capabilities of generative models enables an effective synergistic enhancement of different visual modalities, addressing spatial sparsity in spike inputs and temporal sparsity in RGB inputs.

- **[Easi3R: Estimating Disentangled Motion from DUSt3R Without Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24391)**  `arXiv:2503.24391`  `cs.CV`  
  _Xingyu Chen, Yue Chen, Yuliang Xiu, Andreas Geiger, Anpei Chen_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in DUSt3R have enabled robust estimation of dense point clouds and camera parameters of static scenes, leveraging Transformer network architectures and direct supervision on large-scale 3D datasets. In contrast, the limited scale and diversity of available 4D datasets present a major bottleneck for training a highly generalizable 4D model. This constraint has driven conventional 4D methods to fine-tune 3D models on scalable dynamic video data with additional geometric priors such as optical flow and depths. In this work, we take an opposite path and introduce Easi3R, a simple yet efficient training-free method for 4D reconstruction. Our approach applies attention adaptation during inference, eliminating the need for from-scratch pre-training or network fine-tuning. We find that the attention layers in DUSt3R inherently encode rich information about camera and object motion. By carefully disentangling these attention maps, we achieve accurate dynamic region segmentation, camera pose estimation, and 4D dense point map reconstruction. Extensive experiments on real-world dynamic videos demonstrate that our lightweight attention adaptation significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods that are trained or finetuned on extensive dynamic datasets.

  _Moein Heidari, Reza Rezaeian, Reza Azad, Dorit Merhof, Hamid Soltanian-Zadeh, Ilker Hacihaliloglu_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Implicit Neural Representation (INR), leveraging a neural network to transform coordinate input into corresponding attributes, has recently driven significant advances in several vision-related domains. However, the performance of INR is heavily influenced by the choice of the nonlinear activation function used in its multilayer perceptron (MLP) architecture. To date, multiple nonlinearities have been investigated, but current INRs still face limitations in capturing high-frequency components and diverse signal types. We show that these challenges can be alleviated by introducing a novel approach in INR architecture. Specifically, we propose SL$^{2}$A-INR, a hybrid network that combines a single-layer learnable activation function with an MLP that uses traditional ReLU activations. Our method performs superior across diverse tasks, including image representation, 3D shape reconstruction, and novel view synthesis. Through comprehensive experiments, SL$^{2}$A-INR sets new benchmarks in accuracy, quality, and robustness for INR. Our Code is publicly available on~\href{this https URL}{\textcolor{magenta}{GitHub}}.

- **[Semi-Supervised Unconstrained Head Pose Estimation in the Wild](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02544)**  `arXiv:2404.02544`  `cs.CV`  
  _Huayi Zhou, Fei Jiang, Jin Yuan, Yong Rui, Hongtao Lu, Kui Jia_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Existing research on unconstrained in-the-wild head pose estimation suffers from the flaws of its datasets, which consist of either numerous samples by non-realistic synthesis or constrained collection, or small-scale natural images yet with plausible manual annotations. This makes fully-supervised solutions compromised due to the reliance on generous labels. To alleviate it, we propose the first semi-supervised unconstrained head pose estimation method SemiUHPE, which can leverage abundant easily available unlabeled head images. Technically, we choose semi-supervised rotation regression and adapt it to the error-sensitive and label-scarce problem of unconstrained head pose. Our method is based on the observation that the aspect-ratio invariant cropping of wild heads is superior to previous landmark-based affine alignment given that landmarks of unconstrained human heads are usually unavailable, especially for underexplored non-frontal heads. Instead of using a pre-fixed threshold to filter out pseudo labeled heads, we propose dynamic entropy based filtering to adaptively remove unlabeled outliers as training progresses by updating the threshold in multiple stages. We then revisit the design of weak-strong augmentations and improve it by devising two novel head-oriented strong augmentations, termed pose-irrelevant cut-occlusion and pose-altering rotation consistency respectively. Extensive experiments and ablation studies show that SemiUHPE outperforms its counterparts greatly on public benchmarks under both the front-range and full-range settings. Furthermore, our proposed method is also beneficial for solving other closely related problems, including generic object rotation regression and 3D head reconstruction, demonstrating good versatility and extensibility.

  Understanding the inner workings of deep learning models is crucial for advancing artificial intelligence, particularly in high-stakes fields such as healthcare, where accurate explanations are as vital as precision. This paper introduces Batch-CAM, a novel training paradigm that fuses a batch implementation of the Grad-CAM algorithm with a prototypical reconstruction loss. This combination guides the model to focus on salient image features, thereby enhancing its performance across classification tasks. Our results demonstrate that Batch-CAM achieves a simultaneous improvement in accuracy and image reconstruction quality while reducing training and inference times. By ensuring models learn from evidence-relevant information,this approach makes a relevant contribution to building more transparent, explainable, and trustworthy AI systems.
