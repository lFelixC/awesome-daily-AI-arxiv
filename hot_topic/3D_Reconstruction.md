- **[Feature-Space Adversarial Robustness Certification for Multimodal Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16200)**  `arXiv:2601.16200`  `cs.LG` `cs.CV`

  Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) exhibit strong capabilities across diverse applications, yet remain vulnerable to adversarial perturbations that distort their feature representations and induce erroneous predictions. To address this vulnerability, we propose Feature-space Smoothing (FS), a general framework that provides certified robustness guarantees at the feature representation level of MLLMs. We theoretically prove that FS converts a given feature extractor into a smoothed variant that is guaranteed a certified lower bound on the cosine similarity between clean and adversarial features under $\ell_2$-bounded perturbations. Moreover, we establish that the value of this Feature Cosine Similarity Bound (FCSB) is determined by the intrinsic Gaussian robustness score of the given encoder. Building on this insight, we introduce the Gaussian Smoothness Booster (GSB), a plug-and-play module that enhances the Gaussian robustness score of pretrained MLLMs, thereby strengthening the robustness guaranteed by FS, without requiring additional MLLM retraining. Extensive experiments demonstrate that applying the FS to various MLLMs yields strong certified feature-space robustness and consistently leads to robust task-oriented performance across diverse applications.

- **[Discrete Variational Autoencoding via Policy Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24716)**  `arXiv:2509.24716`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI` `cs.RO`  
  _Michael Drolet, Firas Al-Hafez, Aditya Bhatt, Jan Peters, Oleg Arenz_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Discrete latent bottlenecks in variational autoencoders (VAEs) offer high bit efficiency and can be modeled with autoregressive discrete distributions, enabling parameter-efficient multimodal search with transformers. However, discrete random variables do not allow for exact differentiable parameterization; therefore, discrete VAEs typically rely on approximations, such as Gumbel-Softmax reparameterization or straight-through gradient estimates, or employ high-variance gradient-free methods such as REINFORCE that have had limited success on high-dimensional tasks such as image reconstruction. Inspired by popular techniques in policy search, we propose a training framework for discrete VAEs that leverages the natural gradient of a non-parametric encoder to update the parametric encoder without requiring reparameterization. Our method, combined with automatic step size adaptation and a transformer-based encoder, scales to challenging datasets such as ImageNet and outperforms both approximate reparameterization methods and quantization-based discrete autoencoders in reconstructing high-dimensional data from compact latent spaces.

- **[Can Continuous-Time Diffusion Models Generate and Solve Globally Constrained Discrete Problems? A Study on Sudoku](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20363)**  `arXiv:2601.20363`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Mariia Drozdova_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Can standard continuous-time generative models represent distributions whose support is an extremely sparse, globally constrained discrete set? We study this question using completed Sudoku grids as a controlled testbed, treating them as a subset of a continuous relaxation space. We train flow-matching and score-based models along a Gaussian probability path and compare deterministic (ODE) sampling, stochastic (SDE) sampling, and DDPM-style discretizations derived from the same continuous-time training. Unconditionally, stochastic sampling substantially outperforms deterministic flows; score-based samplers are the most reliable among continuous-time methods, and DDPM-style ancestral sampling achieves the highest validity overall. We further show that the same models can be repurposed for guided generation: by repeatedly sampling completions under clamped clues and stopping when constraints are satisfied, the model acts as a probabilistic Sudoku solver. Although far less sample-efficient than classical solvers and discrete-geometry-aware diffusion methods, these experiments demonstrate that classic diffusion/flow formulations can assign non-zero probability mass to globally constrained combinatorial structures and can be used for constraint satisfaction via stochastic search.

- **[Smoothing the Black-Box: Signed-Distance Supervision for Black-Box Model Copying](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20773)**  `arXiv:2601.20773`  `cs.LG`  
  _Rubén Jiménez, Oriol Pujol_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Deployed machine learning systems must continuously evolve as data, architectures, and regulations change, often without access to original training data or model internals. In such settings, black-box copying provides a practical refactoring mechanism, i.e. upgrading legacy models by learning replicas from input-output queries alone. When restricted to hard-label outputs, copying turns into a discontinuous surface reconstruction problem from pointwise queries, severely limiting the ability to recover boundary geometry efficiently. We propose a distance-based copying (distillation) framework that replaces hard-label supervision with signed distances to the teacher's decision boundary, converting copying into a smooth regression problem that exploits local geometry. We develop an $\alpha$-governed smoothing and regularization scheme with Hölder/Lipschitz control over the induced target surface, and introduce two model-agnostic algorithms to estimate signed distances under label-only access. Experiments on synthetic problems and UCI benchmarks show consistent improvements in fidelity and generalization accuracy over hard-label baselines, while enabling distance outputs as uncertainty-related signals for black-box replicas.

- **[Supervised Guidance Training for Infinite-Dimensional Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20756)**  `arXiv:2601.20756`  `cs.LG`  
  _Elizabeth L. Baker, Alexander Denker, Jes Frellsen_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Score-based diffusion models have recently been extended to infinite-dimensional function spaces, with uses such as inverse problems arising from partial differential equations. In the Bayesian formulation of inverse problems, the aim is to sample from a posterior distribution over functions obtained by conditioning a prior on noisy observations. While diffusion models provide expressive priors in function space, the theory of conditioning them to sample from the posterior remains open. We address this, assuming that either the prior lies in the Cameron-Martin space, or is absolutely continuous with respect to a Gaussian measure. We prove that the models can be conditioned using an infinite-dimensional extension of Doob's $h$-transform, and that the conditional score decomposes into an unconditional score and a guidance term. As the guidance term is intractable, we propose a simulation-free score matching objective (called Supervised Guidance Training) enabling efficient and stable posterior sampling. We illustrate the theory with numerical examples on Bayesian inverse problems in function spaces. In summary, our work offers the first function-space method for fine-tuning trained diffusion models to accurately sample from a posterior.

- **[AWGformer: Adaptive Wavelet-Guided Transformer for Multi-Resolution Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20409)**  `arXiv:2601.20409`  `cs.LG`  
  _Wei Li_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Time series forecasting requires capturing patterns across multiple temporal scales while maintaining computational efficiency. This paper introduces AWGformer, a novel architecture that integrates adaptive wavelet decomposition with cross-scale attention mechanisms for enhanced multi-variate time series prediction. Our approach comprises: (1) an Adaptive Wavelet Decomposition Module (AWDM) that dynamically selects optimal wavelet bases and decomposition levels based on signal characteristics; (2) a Cross-Scale Feature Fusion (CSFF) mechanism that captures interactions between different frequency bands through learnable coupling matrices; (3) a Frequency-Aware Multi-Head Attention (FAMA) module that weights attention heads according to their frequency selectivity; (4) a Hierarchical Prediction Network (HPN) that generates forecasts at multiple resolutions before reconstruction. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that AWGformer achieves significant average improvements over state-of-the-art methods, with particular effectiveness on multi-scale and non-stationary time series. Theoretical analysis provides convergence guarantees and establishes the connection between our wavelet-guided attention and classical signal processing principles.

- **[Semi-Supervised Masked Autoencoders: Unlocking Vision Transformer Potential with Limited Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20072)**  `arXiv:2601.20072`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI` `cs.LG`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We address the challenge of training Vision Transformers (ViTs) when labeled data is scarce but unlabeled data is abundant. We propose Semi-Supervised Masked Autoencoder (SSMAE), a framework that jointly optimizes masked image reconstruction and classification using both unlabeled and labeled samples with dynamically selected pseudo-labels. SSMAE introduces a validation-driven gating mechanism that activates pseudo-labeling only after the model achieves reliable, high-confidence predictions that are consistent across both weakly and strongly augmented views of the same image, reducing confirmation bias. On CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, SSMAE consistently outperforms supervised ViT and fine-tuned MAE, with the largest gains in low-label regimes (+9.24% over ViT on CIFAR-10 with 10% labels). Our results demonstrate that when pseudo-labels are introduced is as important as how they are generated for data-efficient transformer training. Codes are available atthis https URL.

- **[Structure-constrained Language-informed Diffusion Model for Unpaired Low-dose Computed Tomography Angiography Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20304)**  `arXiv:2601.20304`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`

  The application of iodinated contrast media (ICM) improves the sensitivity and specificity of computed tomography (CT) for a wide range of clinical indications. However, overdose of ICM can cause problems such as kidney damage and life-threatening allergic reactions. Deep learning methods can generate CT images of normal-dose ICM from low-dose ICM, reducing the required dose while maintaining diagnostic power. However, existing methods are difficult to realize accurate enhancement with incompletely paired images, mainly because of the limited ability of the model to recognize specific structures. To overcome this limitation, we propose a Structure-constrained Language-informed Diffusion Model (SLDM), a unified medical generation model that integrates structural synergy and spatial intelligence. First, the structural prior information of the image is effectively extracted to constrain the model inference process, thus ensuring structural consistency in the enhancement process. Subsequently, semantic supervision strategy with spatial intelligence is introduced, which integrates the functions of visual perception and spatial reasoning, thus prompting the model to achieve accurate enhancement. Finally, the subtraction angiography enhancement module is applied, which serves to improve the contrast of the ICM agent region to suitable interval for observation. Qualitative analysis of visual comparison and quantitative results of several metrics demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in angiographic reconstruction for low-dose contrast medium CT angiography.

- **[DiffVC-RT: Towards Practical Real-Time Diffusion-based Perceptual Neural Video Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20564)**  `arXiv:2601.20564`  `cs.CV`  
  _Wenzhuo Ma, Zhenzhong Chen_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The practical deployment of diffusion-based Neural Video Compression (NVC) faces critical challenges, including severe information loss, prohibitive inference latency, and poor temporal consistency. To bridge this gap, we propose DiffVC-RT, the first framework designed to achieve real-time diffusion-based perceptual NVC. First, we introduce an Efficient and Informative Model Architecture. Through strategic module replacements and pruning, this architecture significantly reduces computational complexity while mitigating structural information loss. Second, to address generative flickering artifacts, we propose Explicit and Implicit Consistency Modeling. We enhance temporal consistency by explicitly incorporating a zero-cost Online Temporal Shift Module within the U-Net, complemented by hybrid implicit consistency constraints. Finally, we present an Asynchronous and Parallel Decoding Pipeline incorporating Mixed Half Precision, which enables asynchronous latent decoding and parallel frame reconstruction via a Batch-dimension Temporal Shift design. Experiments show that DiffVC-RT achieves 80.1% bitrate savings in terms of LPIPS over VTM-17.0 on HEVC dataset with real-time encoding and decoding speeds of 206 / 30 fps for 720p videos on an NVIDIA H800 GPU, marking a significant milestone in diffusion-based video compression.

- **[RAW-Flow: Advancing RGB-to-RAW Image Reconstruction with Deterministic Latent Flow Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20364)**  `arXiv:2601.20364`  `cs.CV`  
  _Zhen Liu, Diedong Feng, Hai Jiang, Liaoyuan Zeng, Hao Wang, Chaoyu Feng, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  RGB-to-RAW reconstruction, or the reverse modeling of a camera Image Signal Processing (ISP) pipeline, aims to recover high-fidelity RAW data from RGB images. Despite notable progress, existing learning-based methods typically treat this task as a direct regression objective and struggle with detail inconsistency and color deviation, due to the ill-posed nature of inverse ISP and the inherent information loss in quantized RGB images. To address these limitations, we pioneer a generative perspective by reformulating RGB-to-RAW reconstruction as a deterministic latent transport problem and introduce a novel framework named RAW-Flow, which leverages flow matching to learn a deterministic vector field in latent space, to effectively bridge the gap between RGB and RAW representations and enable accurate reconstruction of structural details and color information. To further enhance latent transport, we introduce a cross-scale context guidance module that injects hierarchical RGB features into the flow estimation process. Moreover, we design a dual-domain latent autoencoder with a feature alignment constraint to support the proposed latent transport framework, which jointly encodes RGB and RAW inputs while promoting stable training and high-fidelity reconstruction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RAW-Flow outperforms state-of-the-art approaches both quantitatively and visually.

- **[GVGS: Gaussian Visibility-Aware Multi-View Geometry for Accurate Surface Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20331)**  `arXiv:2601.20331`  `cs.CV`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  3D Gaussian Splatting enables efficient optimization and high-quality rendering, yet accurate surface reconstruction remains challenging. Prior methods improve surface reconstruction by refining Gaussian depth estimates, either via multi-view geometric consistency or through monocular depth priors. However, multi-view constraints become unreliable under large geometric discrepancies, while monocular priors suffer from scale ambiguity and local inconsistency, ultimately leading to inaccurate Gaussian depth supervision. To address these limitations, we introduce a Gaussian visibility-aware multi-view geometric consistency constraint that aggregates the visibility of shared Gaussian primitives across views, enabling more accurate and stable geometric supervision. In addition, we propose a progressive quadtree-calibrated Monocular depth constraint that performs block-wise affine calibration from coarse to fine spatial scales, mitigating the scale ambiguity of depth priors while preserving fine-grained surface details. Extensive experiments on DTU and TNT datasets demonstrate consistent improvements in geometric accuracy over prior Gaussian-based and implicit surface reconstruction methods.

- **[TPGDiff: Hierarchical Triple-Prior Guided Diffusion for Image Restoration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20306)**  `arXiv:2601.20306`  `cs.CV`  
  _Yanjie Tu, Qingsen Yan, Axi Niu, Jiacong Tang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  All-in-one image restoration aims to address diverse degradation types using a single unified model. Existing methods typically rely on degradation priors to guide restoration, yet often struggle to reconstruct content in severely degraded regions. Although recent works leverage semantic information to facilitate content generation, integrating it into the shallow layers of diffusion models often disrupts spatial structures (\emph{e.g.}, blurring artifacts). To address this issue, we propose a Triple-Prior Guided Diffusion (TPGDiff) network for unified image restoration. TPGDiff incorporates degradation priors throughout the diffusion trajectory, while introducing structural priors into shallow layers and semantic priors into deep layers, enabling hierarchical and complementary prior guidance for image reconstruction. Specifically, we leverage multi-source structural cues as structural priors to capture fine-grained details and guide shallow layers representations. To complement this design, we further develop a distillation-driven semantic extractor that yields robust semantic priors, ensuring reliable high-level guidance at deep layers even under severe degradations. Furthermore, a degradation extractor is employed to learn degradation-aware priors, enabling stage-adaptive control of the diffusion process across all timesteps. Extensive experiments on both single- and multi-degradation benchmarks demonstrate that TPGDiff achieves superior performance and generalization across diverse restoration scenarios.

- **[Feature Projection Learning for Better Vision-Language Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20224)**  `arXiv:2601.20224`  `cs.CV`  
  _Yi Zhang, Weicheng Lin, Liang-Jie Zhang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision-Language Pre-Trained models, notably CLIP, that utilize contrastive learning have proven highly adept at extracting generalizable visual features. To inherit the well-learned knowledge of VLP models for downstream tasks, several approaches aim to adapt them efficiently with limited supervision. However, these methods either suffer from limited performance, excessive learnable parameters, or extended training times, all of which hinder their effectiveness in adapting the CLIP model to downstream tasks. In this work, we propose a simple yet efficient and effective method called \textit{\textbf{F}eature \textbf{P}rojection \textbf{L}earning(FPL)} to address these problems. Specifically, we develop a projection model that projects class prototype features into the query image feature space and reconstructs the query image feature map. The negative average squared reconstruction error is used as the class score. In this way, we transform the classification problem into a feature projection problem. The final output of this method is a combination of the prediction from the projection model and the original pre-trained CLIP. Comprehensive empirical evaluations confirm that FPL delivers superior accuracy, surpassing the current state-of-the-art methods by a substantial margin.

- **[Fast Converging 3D Gaussian Splatting for 1-Minute Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19489)**  `arXiv:2601.19489`  `cs.CV`  
  _Ziyu Zhang, Tianle Liu, Diantao Tu, Shuhan Shen_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present a fast 3DGS reconstruction pipeline designed to converge within one minute, developed for the SIGGRAPH Asia 3DGS Fast Reconstruction Challenge. The challenge consists of an initial round using SLAM-generated camera poses (with noisy trajectories) and a final round using COLMAP poses (highly accurate). To robustly handle these heterogeneous settings, we develop a two-stage solution. In the first round, we use reverse per-Gaussian parallel optimization and compact forward splatting based on Taming-GS and Speedy-splat, load-balanced tiling, an anchor-based Neural-Gaussian representation enabling rapid convergence with fewer learnable parameters, initialization from monocular depth and partially from feed-forward 3DGS models, and a global pose refinement module for noisy SLAM trajectories. In the final round, the accurate COLMAP poses change the optimization landscape; we disable pose refinement, revert from Neural-Gaussians back to standard 3DGS to eliminate MLP inference overhead, introduce multi-view consistency-guided Gaussian splitting inspired by Fast-GS, and introduce a depth estimator to supervise the rendered depth. Together, these techniques enable high-fidelity reconstruction under a strict one-minute budget. Our method achieved the top performance with a PSNR of 28.43 and ranked first in the competition.

- **[Progressive $\mathcal{J}$-Invariant Self-supervised Learning for Low-Dose CT Denoising](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14180)**  `arXiv:2601.14180`  `cs.CV`  
  _Yichao Liu, Zongru Shao, Yueyang Teng, Junwen Guo_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Self-supervised learning has been increasingly investigated for low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) image denoising, as it alleviates the dependence on paired normal-dose CT (NDCT) data, which are often difficult to collect. However, many existing self-supervised blind-spot denoising methods suffer from training inefficiencies and suboptimal performance due to restricted receptive fields. To mitigate this issue, we propose a novel Progressive $\mathcal{J}$-invariant Learning that maximizes the use of $\mathcal{J}$-invariant to enhance LDCT denoising performance. We introduce a step-wise blind-spot denoising mechanism that enforces conditional independence in a progressive manner, enabling more fine-grained learning for denoising. Furthermore, we explicitly inject a combination of controlled Gaussian and Poisson noise during training to regularize the denoising process and mitigate overfitting. Extensive experiments on the Mayo LDCT dataset demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms existing self-supervised approaches and achieves performance comparable to, or better than, several representative supervised denoising methods.

- **[Learning Stochastic Bridges for Video Object Removal via Video-to-Video Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12066)**  `arXiv:2601.12066`  `cs.CV`  
  _Zijie Lou, Xiangwei Feng, Jiaxin Wang, Jiangtao Yao, Fei Che, Tianbao Liu, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Existing video object removal methods predominantly rely on diffusion models following a noise-to-data paradigm, where generation starts from uninformative Gaussian noise. This approach discards the rich structural and contextual priors present in the original input video. Consequently, such methods often lack sufficient guidance, leading to incomplete object erasure or the synthesis of implausible content that conflicts with the scene's physical logic. In this paper, we reformulate video object removal as a video-to-video translation task via a stochastic bridge model. Unlike noise-initialized methods, our framework establishes a direct stochastic path from the source video (with objects) to the target video (objects removed). This bridge formulation effectively leverages the input video as a strong structural prior, guiding the model to perform precise removal while ensuring that the filled regions are logically consistent with the surrounding environment. To address the trade-off where strong bridge priors hinder the removal of large objects, we propose a novel adaptive mask modulation strategy. This mechanism dynamically modulates input embeddings based on mask characteristics, balancing background fidelity with generative flexibility. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing methods in both visual quality and temporal consistency. The project page isthis https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper addresses metric 3D reconstruction of indoor scenes by exploiting their inherent geometric regularities with compact representations. Using planar 3D primitives - a well-suited representation for man-made environments - we introduce PLANA3R, a pose-free framework for metric Planar 3D Reconstruction from unposed two-view images. Our approach employs Vision Transformers to extract a set of sparse planar primitives, estimate relative camera poses, and supervise geometry learning via planar splatting, where gradients are propagated through high-resolution rendered depth and normal maps of primitives. Unlike prior feedforward methods that require 3D plane annotations during training, PLANA3R learns planar 3D structures without explicit plane supervision, enabling scalable training on large-scale stereo datasets using only depth and normal annotations. We validate PLANA3R on multiple indoor-scene datasets with metric supervision and demonstrate strong generalization to out-of-domain indoor environments across diverse tasks under metric evaluation protocols, including 3D surface reconstruction, depth estimation, and relative pose estimation. Furthermore, by formulating with planar 3D representation, our method emerges with the ability for accurate plane segmentation. The project page is available atthis https URL

  High Dynamic Range Novel View Synthesis (HDR NVS) seeks to learn an HDR 3D model from Low Dynamic Range (LDR) training images captured under conventional imaging conditions. Current methods primarily focus on static scenes, implicitly assuming all scene elements remain stationary and non-living. However, real-world scenarios frequently feature dynamic elements, such as moving objects, varying lighting conditions, and other temporal events, thereby presenting a significantly more challenging scenario. To address this gap, we propose a more realistic problem named HDR Dynamic Novel View Synthesis (HDR DNVS), where the additional dimension ``Dynamic'' emphasizes the necessity of jointly modeling temporal radiance variations alongside sophisticated 3D translation between LDR and HDR. To tackle this complex, intertwined challenge, we introduce HDR-4DGS, a Gaussian Splatting-based architecture featured with an innovative dynamic tone-mapping module that explicitly connects HDR and LDR domains, maintaining temporal radiance coherence by dynamically adapting tone-mapping functions according to the evolving radiance distributions across the temporal dimension. As a result, HDR-4DGS achieves both temporal radiance consistency and spatially accurate color translation, enabling photorealistic HDR renderings from arbitrary viewpoints and time instances. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HDR-4DGS surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative performance and visual fidelity. Source code is available atthis https URL.

  _JongMin Lee, Sungjoo Yoo_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present Dense-SfM, a novel Structure from Motion (SfM) framework designed for dense and accurate 3D reconstruction from multi-view images. Sparse keypoint matching, which traditional SfM methods often rely on, limits both accuracy and point density, especially in texture-less areas. Dense-SfM addresses this limitation by integrating dense matching with a Gaussian Splatting (GS) based track extension which gives more consistent, longer feature tracks. To further improve reconstruction accuracy, Dense-SfM is equipped with a multi-view kernelized matching module leveraging transformer and Gaussian Process architectures, for robust track refinement across multi-views. Evaluations on the ETH3D and Texture-Poor SfM datasets show that Dense-SfM offers significant improvements in accuracy and density over state-of-the-art methods. Project page:this https URL.

- **[JEPA-Reasoner: Decoupling Latent Reasoning from Token Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19171)**  `arXiv:2512.19171`  `cs.CL`  
  _Bingyang Kelvin Liu, Ziyu Patrick Chen, David P. Woodruff_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Current autoregressive language models couple high-level reasoning and low-level token generation into a single sequential process, making the reasoning trajectory vulnerable to compounding expression errors. We propose JEPA-Reasoner, a novel architectural paradigm that decouples these tasks using a Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA) for pure latent-space reasoning and a separate Talker module for linguistic reconstruction. By isolating the reasoning engine from the discrete token-sampling process, our architecture enables: (1) Error Containment, where token-level failures cannot propagate into the latent reasoning chain; (2) Continuous Guidance, providing the generator with access to the entire lossless reasoning trajectory; and (3) Representation of Uncertainty, allowing the model to maintain multiple hypotheses via mixed latent vectors. Controlled experiments on synthetic and natural language tasks demonstrate that this decoupling enables a 0.9B model to achieve a 149.5\% improvement in 8-shot GSM8K accuracy over a coupled Transformer baseline trained on identical data. This work shifts the focus from scaling coupled models to investigating decoupled architectures as a more robust foundation for complex reasoning.
