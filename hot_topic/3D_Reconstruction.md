- **[Q-learning with Posterior Sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00917)**  `arXiv:2506.00917`  `cs.LG`  
  _Priyank Agrawal, Shipra Agrawal, Azmat Azati_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Bayesian posterior sampling techniques have demonstrated superior empirical performance in many exploration-exploitation settings. However, their theoretical analysis remains a challenge, especially in complex settings like reinforcement learning. In this paper, we introduce Q-Learning with Posterior Sampling (PSQL), a simple Q-learning-based algorithm that uses Gaussian posteriors on Q-values for exploration, akin to the popular Thompson Sampling algorithm in the multi-armed bandit setting. We show that in the tabular episodic MDP setting, PSQL achieves a regret bound of $\tilde O(H^2\sqrt{SAT})$, closely matching the known lower bound of $\Omega(H\sqrt{SAT})$. Here, S, A denote the number of states and actions in the underlying Markov Decision Process (MDP), and $T=KH$ with $K$ being the number of episodes and $H$ being the planning horizon. Our work provides several new technical insights into the core challenges in combining posterior sampling with dynamic programming and TD-learning-based RL algorithms, along with novel ideas for resolving those difficulties. We hope this will form a starting point for analyzing this efficient and important algorithmic technique in even more complex RL settings.

- **[Why Knowledge Distillation Works in Generative Models: A Minimal Working Explanation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13111)**  `arXiv:2505.13111`  `cs.LG`  
  _Sungmin Cha, Kyunghyun Cho_

  Knowledge distillation (KD) is a core component in the training and deployment of modern generative models, particularly large language models (LLMs). While its empirical benefits are well documented -- enabling smaller student models to emulate the performance of much larger teachers -- the underlying mechanisms by which KD improves generative quality remain poorly understood. In this work, we present a minimal working explanation of KD in generative modeling. Using a controlled simulation with mixtures of Gaussians, we demonstrate that distillation induces a trade-off between precision and recall in the student model. As the teacher distribution becomes more selective, the student concentrates more probability mass on high-likelihood regions at the expense of coverage -- a behavior modulated by a single entropy-controlling parameter. We then validate this effect in a large-scale language modeling setup using the SmolLM2 family of models. Empirical results reveal the same precision-recall dynamics observed in simulation, where precision corresponds to sample quality and recall to distributional coverage. This precision-recall trade-off in LLMs is found to be especially beneficial in scenarios where sample quality is more important than diversity, such as instruction tuning or downstream generation. Our analysis provides a simple and general explanation for the effectiveness of KD in generative modeling.

- **[DrivingScene: A Multi-Task Online Feed-Forward 3D Gaussian Splatting Method for Dynamic Driving Scenes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24734)**  `arXiv:2510.24734`  `cs.CV` `cs.LG` `cs.RO`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Real-time, high-fidelity reconstruction of dynamic driving scenes is challenged by complex dynamics and sparse views, with prior methods struggling to balance quality and efficiency. We propose DrivingScene, an online, feed-forward framework that reconstructs 4D dynamic scenes from only two consecutive surround-view images. Our key innovation is a lightweight residual flow network that predicts the non-rigid motion of dynamic objects per camera on top of a learned static scene prior, explicitly modeling dynamics via scene flow. We also introduce a coarse-to-fine training paradigm that circumvents the instabilities common to end-to-end approaches. Experiments on nuScenes dataset show our image-only method simultaneously generates high-quality depth, scene flow, and 3D Gaussian point clouds online, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods in both dynamic reconstruction and novel view synthesis.

- **[$D^2GS$: Dense Depth Regularization for LiDAR-free Urban Scene Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25173)**  `arXiv:2510.25173`  `cs.CV`  
  _Kejing Xia, Jidong Jia, Ke Jin, Yucai Bai, Li Sun, Dacheng Tao, et al._

  Recently, Gaussian Splatting (GS) has shown great potential for urban scene reconstruction in the field of autonomous driving. However, current urban scene reconstruction methods often depend on multimodal sensors as inputs, \textit{i.e.} LiDAR and images. Though the geometry prior provided by LiDAR point clouds can largely mitigate ill-posedness in reconstruction, acquiring such accurate LiDAR data is still challenging in practice: i) precise spatiotemporal calibration between LiDAR and other sensors is required, as they may not capture data simultaneously; ii) reprojection errors arise from spatial misalignment when LiDAR and cameras are mounted at different locations. To avoid the difficulty of acquiring accurate LiDAR depth, we propose $D^2GS$, a LiDAR-free urban scene reconstruction framework. In this work, we obtain geometry priors that are as effective as LiDAR while being denser and more accurate. $\textbf{First}$, we initialize a dense point cloud by back-projecting multi-view metric depth predictions. This point cloud is then optimized by a Progressive Pruning strategy to improve the global consistency. $\textbf{Second}$, we jointly refine Gaussian geometry and predicted dense metric depth via a Depth Enhancer. Specifically, we leverage diffusion priors from a depth foundation model to enhance the depth maps rendered by Gaussians. In turn, the enhanced depths provide stronger geometric constraints during Gaussian training. $\textbf{Finally}$, we improve the accuracy of ground geometry by constraining the shape and normal attributes of Gaussians within road regions. Extensive experiments on the Waymo dataset demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, producing more accurate geometry even when compared with those using ground-truth LiDAR data.

- **[Towards Real-Time Inference of Thin Liquid Film Thickness Profiles from Interference Patterns Using Vision Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25157)**  `arXiv:2510.25157`  `cs.CV`  
  _Gautam A. Viruthagiri, Arnuv Tandon, Gerald G. Fuller, Vinny Chandran Suja_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Thin film interferometry is a powerful technique for non-invasively measuring liquid film thickness with applications in ophthalmology, but its clinical translation is hindered by the challenges in reconstructing thickness profiles from interference patterns - an ill-posed inverse problem complicated by phase periodicity, imaging noise and ambient artifacts. Traditional reconstruction methods are either computationally intensive, sensitive to noise, or require manual expert analysis, which is impractical for real-time diagnostics. To address this challenge, here we present a vision transformer-based approach for real-time inference of thin liquid film thickness profiles directly from isolated interferograms. Trained on a hybrid dataset combining physiologically-relevant synthetic and experimental tear film data, our model leverages long-range spatial correlations to resolve phase ambiguities and reconstruct temporally coherent thickness profiles in a single forward pass from dynamic interferograms acquired in vivo and ex vivo. The network demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on noisy, rapidly-evolving films with motion artifacts, overcoming limitations of conventional phase-unwrapping and iterative fitting methods. Our data-driven approach enables automated, consistent thickness reconstruction at real-time speeds on consumer hardware, opening new possibilities for continuous monitoring of pre-lens ocular tear films and non-invasive diagnosis of conditions such as the dry eye disease.

- **[Revisiting Reconstruction-based AI-generated Image Detection: A Geometric Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25141)**  `arXiv:2510.25141`  `cs.CV`  
  _Wan Jiang, Jing Yan, Ruixuan Zhang, Xiaojing Chen, Changtao Miao, Zhe Li, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The rise of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) has made detecting AI-generated images a critical challenge for ensuring authenticity. Existing reconstruction-based methods lack theoretical foundations and on empirical heuristics, limiting interpretability and reliability. In this paper, we introduce the Jacobian-Spectral Lower Bound for reconstruction error from a geometric perspective, showing that real images off the reconstruction manifold exhibit a non-trivial error lower bound, while generated images on the manifold have near-zero error. Furthermore, we reveal the limitations of existing methods that rely on static reconstruction error from a single pass. These methods often fail when some real images exhibit lower error than generated ones. This counterintuitive behavior reduces detection accuracy and requires data-specific threshold tuning, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose ReGap, a training-free method that computes dynamic reconstruction error by leveraging structured editing operations to introduce controlled perturbations. This enables measuring error changes before and after editing, improving detection accuracy by enhancing error separation. Experimental results show that our method outperforms existing baselines, exhibits robustness to common post-processing operations and generalizes effectively across diverse conditions.

  3D reconstruction of indoor and urban environments is a prominent research topic with various downstream applications. However, existing geometric priors for addressing low-texture regions in indoor and urban settings often lack global consistency. Moreover, Gaussian Splatting and implicit SDF fields often suffer from discontinuities or exhibit computational inefficiencies, resulting in a loss of detail. To address these issues, we propose an Atlanta-world guided implicit-structured Gaussian Splatting that achieves smooth indoor and urban scene reconstruction while preserving high-frequency details and rendering efficiency. By leveraging the Atlanta-world model, we ensure the accurate surface reconstruction for low-texture regions, while the proposed novel implicit-structured GS representations provide smoothness without sacrificing efficiency and high-frequency details. Specifically, we propose a semantic GS representation to predict the probability of all semantic regions and deploy a structure plane regularization with learnable plane indicators for global accurate surface reconstruction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both indoor and urban scenes, delivering superior surface reconstruction quality.

- **[Visual Diversity and Region-aware Prompt Learning for Zero-shot HOI Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25094)**  `arXiv:2510.25094`  `cs.CV`  
  _Chanhyeong Yang, Taehoon Song, Jihwan Park, Hyunwoo J. Kim_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Zero-shot Human-Object Interaction detection aims to localize humans and objects in an image and recognize their interaction, even when specific verb-object pairs are unseen during training. Recent works have shown promising results using prompt learning with pretrained vision-language models such as CLIP, which align natural language prompts with visual features in a shared embedding space. However, existing approaches still fail to handle the visual complexity of interaction, including (1) intra-class visual diversity, where instances of the same verb appear in diverse poses and contexts, and (2) inter-class visual entanglement, where distinct verbs yield visually similar patterns. To address these challenges, we propose VDRP, a framework for Visual Diversity and Region-aware Prompt learning. First, we introduce a visual diversity-aware prompt learning strategy that injects group-wise visual variance into the context embedding. We further apply Gaussian perturbation to encourage the prompts to capture diverse visual variations of a verb. Second, we retrieve region-specific concepts from the human, object, and union regions. These are used to augment the diversity-aware prompt embeddings, yielding region-aware prompts that enhance verb-level discrimination. Experiments on the HICO-DET benchmark demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance under four zero-shot evaluation settings, effectively addressing both intra-class diversity and inter-class visual entanglement.

- **[PSScreen V2: Partially Supervised Multiple Retinal Disease Screening](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22589)**  `arXiv:2510.22589`  `cs.CV`  
  _Boyi Zheng, Yalin Zheng, Hrvoje Bogunoviƒá, Qing Liu_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this work, we propose PSScreen V2, a partially supervised self-training framework for multiple retinal disease screening. Unlike previous methods that rely on fully labelled or single-domain datasets, PSScreen V2 is designed to learn from multiple partially labelled datasets with different distributions, addressing both label absence and domain shift challenges. To this end, PSScreen V2 adopts a three-branch architecture with one teacher and two student networks. The teacher branch generates pseudo labels from weakly augmented images to address missing labels, while the two student branches introduce novel feature augmentation strategies: Low-Frequency Dropout (LF-Dropout), which enhances domain robustness by randomly discarding domain-related low-frequency components, and Low-Frequency Uncertainty (LF-Uncert), which estimates uncertain domain variability via adversarially learned Gaussian perturbations of low-frequency statistics. Extensive experiments on multiple in-domain and out-of-domain fundus datasets demonstrate that PSScreen V2 achieves state-of-the-art performance and superior domain generalization ability. Furthermore, compatibility tests with diverse backbones, including the vision foundation model DINOv2, as well as evaluations on chest X-ray datasets, highlight the universality and adaptability of the proposed framework. The codes are available atthis https URL.

- **[NoisyGRPO: Incentivizing Multimodal CoT Reasoning via Noise Injection and Bayesian Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21122)**  `arXiv:2510.21122`  `cs.CV`  
  _Longtian Qiu, Shan Ning, Jiaxuan Sun, Xuming He_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise in enhancing the general Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs). However, when applied to improve general CoT reasoning, existing RL frameworks often struggle to generalize beyond the training distribution. To address this, we propose NoisyGRPO, a systematic multimodal RL framework that introduces controllable noise into visual inputs for enhanced exploration and explicitly models the advantage estimation process via a Bayesian framework. Specifically, NoisyGRPO improves RL training by: (1) Noise-Injected Exploration Policy: Perturbing visual inputs with Gaussian noise to encourage exploration across a wider range of visual scenarios; and (2) Bayesian Advantage Estimation: Formulating advantage estimation as a principled Bayesian inference problem, where the injected noise level serves as a prior and the observed trajectory reward as the likelihood. This Bayesian modeling fuses both sources of information to compute a robust posterior estimate of trajectory advantage, effectively guiding MLLMs to prefer visually grounded trajectories over noisy ones. Experiments on standard CoT quality, general capability, and hallucination benchmarks demonstrate that NoisyGRPO substantially improves generalization and robustness, especially in RL settings with small-scale MLLMs such as Qwen2.5-VL 3B.

- **[WaMaIR: Image Restoration via Multiscale Wavelet Convolutions and Mamba-based Channel Modeling with Texture Enhancement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16765)**  `arXiv:2510.16765`  `cs.CV`  
  _Shengyu Zhu, Congyi Fan, Fuxuan Zhang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Image restoration is a fundamental and challenging task in computer vision, where CNN-based frameworks demonstrate significant computational efficiency. However, previous CNN-based methods often face challenges in adequately restoring fine texture details, which are limited by the small receptive field of CNN structures and the lack of channel feature modeling. In this paper, we propose WaMaIR, which is a novel framework with a large receptive field for image perception and improves the reconstruction of texture details in restored images. Specifically, we introduce the Global Multiscale Wavelet Transform Convolutions (GMWTConvs) for expandding the receptive field to extract image features, preserving and enriching texture features in model inputs. Meanwhile, we propose the Mamba-Based Channel-Aware Module (MCAM), explicitly designed to capture long-range dependencies within feature channels, which enhancing the model sensitivity to color, edges, and texture information. Additionally, we propose Multiscale Texture Enhancement Loss (MTELoss) for image restoration to guide the model in preserving detailed texture structures effectively. Extensive experiments confirm that WaMaIR outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving better image restoration and efficient computational performance of the model.

- **[Vision-Centric 4D Occupancy Forecasting and Planning via Implicit Residual World Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16729)**  `arXiv:2510.16729`  `cs.CV`  
  _Jianbiao Mei, Yu Yang, Xuemeng Yang, Licheng Wen, Jiajun Lv, Botian Shi, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  End-to-end autonomous driving systems increasingly rely on vision-centric world models to understand and predict their environment. However, a common ineffectiveness in these models is the full reconstruction of future scenes, which expends significant capacity on redundantly modeling static backgrounds. To address this, we propose IR-WM, an Implicit Residual World Model that focuses on modeling the current state and evolution of the world. IR-WM first establishes a robust bird's-eye-view representation of the current state from the visual observation. It then leverages the BEV features from the previous timestep as a strong temporal prior and predicts only the "residual", i.e., the changes conditioned on the ego-vehicle's actions and scene context. To alleviate error accumulation over time, we further apply an alignment module to calibrate semantic and dynamic misalignments. Moreover, we investigate different forecasting-planning coupling schemes and demonstrate that the implicit future state generated by world models substantially improves planning accuracy. On the nuScenes benchmark, IR-WM achieves top performance in both 4D occupancy forecasting and trajectory planning.

- **[Depth-Aware Super-Resolution via Distance-Adaptive Variational Formulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05746)**  `arXiv:2509.05746`  `cs.CV`  
  _Tianhao Guo, Bingjie Lu, Feng Wang, Zhengyang Lu_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Single image super-resolution traditionally assumes spatially-invariant degradation models, yet real-world imaging systems exhibit complex distance-dependent effects including atmospheric scattering, depth-of-field variations, and perspective distortions. This fundamental limitation necessitates spatially-adaptive reconstruction strategies that explicitly incorporate geometric scene understanding for optimal performance. We propose a rigorous variational framework that characterizes super-resolution as a spatially-varying inverse problem, formulating the degradation operator as a pseudodifferential operator with distance-dependent spectral characteristics that enable theoretical analysis of reconstruction limits across depth ranges. Our neural architecture implements discrete gradient flow dynamics through cascaded residual blocks with depth-conditional convolution kernels, ensuring convergence to stationary points of the theoretical energy functional while incorporating learned distance-adaptive regularization terms that dynamically adjust smoothness constraints based on local geometric structure. Spectral constraints derived from atmospheric scattering theory prevent bandwidth violations and noise amplification in far-field regions, while adaptive kernel generation networks learn continuous mappings from depth to reconstruction filters. Comprehensive evaluation across five benchmark datasets demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, achieving 36.89/0.9516 and 30.54/0.8721 PSNR/SSIM at 2 and 4 scales on KITTI outdoor scenes, outperforming existing methods by 0.44dB and 0.36dB respectively. This work establishes the first theoretically-grounded distance-adaptive super-resolution framework and demonstrates significant improvements on depth-variant scenarios while maintaining competitive performance across traditional benchmarks.

- **[MILo: Mesh-In-the-Loop Gaussian Splatting for Detailed and Efficient Surface Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24096)**  `arXiv:2506.24096`  `cs.CV`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  While recent advances in Gaussian Splatting have enabled fast reconstruction of high-quality 3D scenes from images, extracting accurate surface meshes remains a challenge. Current approaches extract the surface through costly post-processing steps, resulting in the loss of fine geometric details or requiring significant time and leading to very dense meshes with millions of vertices. More fundamentally, the a posteriori conversion from a volumetric to a surface representation limits the ability of the final mesh to preserve all geometric structures captured during training. We present MILo, a novel Gaussian Splatting framework that bridges the gap between volumetric and surface representations by differentiably extracting a mesh from the 3D Gaussians. We design a fully differentiable procedure that constructs the mesh-including both vertex locations and connectivity-at every iteration directly from the parameters of the Gaussians, which are the only quantities optimized during training. Our method introduces three key technical contributions: a bidirectional consistency framework ensuring both representations-Gaussians and the extracted mesh-capture the same underlying geometry during training; an adaptive mesh extraction process performed at each training iteration, which uses Gaussians as differentiable pivots for Delaunay triangulation; a novel method for computing signed distance values from the 3D Gaussians that enables precise surface extraction while avoiding geometric erosion. Our approach can reconstruct complete scenes, including backgrounds, with state-of-the-art quality while requiring an order of magnitude fewer mesh vertices than previous methods. Due to their light weight and empty interior, our meshes are well suited for downstream applications such as physics simulations or animation.

- **[HAIF-GS: Hierarchical and Induced Flow-Guided Gaussian Splatting for Dynamic Scene](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09518)**  `arXiv:2506.09518`  `cs.CV`  
  _Jianing Chen, Zehao Li, Yujun Cai, Hao Jiang, Chengxuan Qian, Juyuan Kang, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reconstructing dynamic 3D scenes from monocular videos remains a fundamental challenge in 3D vision. While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) achieves real-time rendering in static settings, extending it to dynamic scenes is challenging due to the difficulty of learning structured and temporally consistent motion representations. This challenge often manifests as three limitations in existing methods: redundant Gaussian updates, insufficient motion supervision, and weak modeling of complex non-rigid deformations. These issues collectively hinder coherent and efficient dynamic reconstruction. To address these limitations, we propose HAIF-GS, a unified framework that enables structured and consistent dynamic modeling through sparse anchor-driven deformation. It first identifies motion-relevant regions via an Anchor Filter to suppress redundant updates in static areas. A self-supervised Induced Flow-Guided Deformation module induces anchor motion using multi-frame feature aggregation, eliminating the need for explicit flow labels. To further handle fine-grained deformations, a Hierarchical Anchor Propagation mechanism increases anchor resolution based on motion complexity and propagates multi-level transformations. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world benchmarks validate that HAIF-GS significantly outperforms prior dynamic 3DGS methods in rendering quality, temporal coherence, and reconstruction efficiency.

  Reinforcement learning (RL) can refine the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs), but critically depends on a key prerequisite: the LLM can already generate high-utility reasoning paths with non-negligible probability. For tasks beyond the LLM's current competence, such reasoning path can be hard to sample, and learning risks reinforcing familiar but suboptimal reasoning. We are motivated by the insight from cognitive science that Why is this the answer is often an easier question than What is the answer, as it avoids the heavy cognitive load of open-ended exploration, opting instead for explanatory reconstruction-systematically retracing the reasoning that links a question to its answer. We show that LLMs can similarly leverage answers to derive high-quality reasoning paths. We formalize this phenomenon and prove that conditioning on answer provably increases the expected utility of sampled reasoning paths, thereby transforming intractable problems into learnable ones. Building on this insight, we introduce RAVR (Reference-Answer-guided Variational Reasoning), an end-to-end framework that uses answer-conditioned reasoning as a variational surrogate for question-only reasoning. Experiments in both general and math domains demonstrate consistent improvements over strong baselines. We further analyze the reasoning behavior and find that RAVR reduces hesitation, strengthens conclusion consolidation, and promotes problem-specific strategies in reasoning.
