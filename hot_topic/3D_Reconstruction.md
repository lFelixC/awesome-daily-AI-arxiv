- **[PlanarMesh: Building Compact 3D Meshes from LiDAR using Incremental Adaptive Resolution Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13599)**  `arXiv:2510.13599`  `cs.RO`

  Building an online 3D LiDAR mapping system that produces a detailed surface reconstruction while remaining computationally efficient is a challenging task. In this paper, we present PlanarMesh, a novel incremental, mesh-based LiDAR reconstruction system that adaptively adjusts mesh resolution to achieve compact, detailed reconstructions in real-time. It introduces a new representation, planar-mesh, which combines plane modeling and meshing to capture both large surfaces and detailed geometry. The planar-mesh can be incrementally updated considering both local surface curvature and free-space information from sensor measurements. We employ a multi-threaded architecture with a Bounding Volume Hierarchy (BVH) for efficient data storage and fast search operations, enabling real-time performance. Experimental results show that our method achieves reconstruction accuracy on par with, or exceeding, state-of-the-art techniques-including truncated signed distance functions, occupancy mapping, and voxel-based meshing-while producing smaller output file sizes (10 times smaller than raw input and more than 5 times smaller than mesh-based methods) and maintaining real-time performance (around 2 Hz for a 64-beam sensor).

- **[DAMM-LOAM: Degeneracy Aware Multi-Metric LiDAR Odometry and Mapping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13287)**  `arXiv:2510.13287`  `cs.RO`

  LiDAR Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) systems are essential for enabling precise navigation and environmental reconstruction across various applications. Although current point-to-plane ICP algorithms perform effec- tively in structured, feature-rich environments, they struggle in scenarios with sparse features, repetitive geometric structures, and high-frequency motion. This leads to degeneracy in 6- DOF pose estimation. Most state-of-the-art algorithms address these challenges by incorporating additional sensing modalities, but LiDAR-only solutions continue to face limitations under such conditions. To address these issues, we propose a novel Degeneracy-Aware Multi-Metric LiDAR Odometry and Map- ping (DAMM-LOAM) module. Our system improves mapping accuracy through point cloud classification based on surface normals and neighborhood analysis. Points are classified into ground, walls, roof, edges, and non-planar points, enabling accurate correspondences. A Degeneracy-based weighted least squares-based ICP algorithm is then applied for accurate odom- etry estimation. Additionally, a Scan Context based back-end is implemented to support robust loop closures. DAMM-LOAM demonstrates significant improvements in odometry accuracy, especially in indoor environments such as long corridors

- **[The Omega Turn: A General Turning Template for Elongate Robots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12970)**  `arXiv:2510.12970`  `cs.RO`

  Elongate limbless robots have the potential to locomote through tightly packed spaces for applications such as search-and-rescue and industrial inspections. The capability to effectively and robustly maneuver elongate limbless robots is crucial to realize such potential. However, there has been limited research on turning strategies for such systems. To achieve effective and robust turning performance in cluttered spaces, we take inspiration from a microscopic nematode, C. elegans, which exhibits remarkable maneuverability in rheologically complex environments partially because of its ability to perform omega turns. Despite recent efforts to analyze omega turn kinematics, it remains unknown if there exists a wave equation sufficient to prescribe an omega turn, let alone its reconstruction on robot platforms. Here, using a comparative theory-biology approach, we prescribe the omega turn as a superposition of two traveling waves. With wave equations as a guideline, we design a controller for limbless robots enabling robust and effective turning behaviors in lab and cluttered field environments. Finally, we show that such omega turn controllers can also generalize to elongate multi-legged robots, demonstrating an alternative effective body-driven turning strategy for elongate robots, with and without limbs.

  Machine learning solvers for partial differential equations (PDEs) have attracted growing interest. However, most existing approaches, such as neural network solvers, rely on stochastic training, which is inefficient and typically requires a great many training epochs. Gaussian process (GP)/kernel-based solvers, while mathematical principled, suffer from scalability issues when handling large numbers of collocation points often needed for challenging or higher-dimensional PDEs.To overcome these limitations, we propose TGPS, a tensor-GP-based solver that models factor functions along each input dimension using one-dimensional GPs and combines them via tensor decomposition to approximate the full solution. This design reduces the task to learning a collection of one-dimensional GPs, substantially lowering computational complexity, and enabling scalability to massive collocation sets.For efficient nonlinear PDE solving, we use a partial freezing strategy and Newton's method to linerize the nonlinear terms. We then develop an alternating least squares (ALS) approach that admits closed-form updates, thereby substantially enhancing the training efficiency. We establish theoretical guarantees on the expressivity of our model, together with convergence proof and error analysis under standard regularity assumptions. Experiments on several benchmark PDEs demonstrate that our method achieves superior accuracy and efficiency compared to existing approaches.

  Kilometer-scale weather data is crucial for real-world applications but remains computationally intensive to produce using traditional weather simulations. An emerging solution is to use deep learning models, which offer a faster alternative for climate downscaling. However, their reliability is still in question, as they are often evaluated using standard machine learning metrics rather than insights from atmospheric and weather physics. This paper benchmarks recent state-of-the-art deep learning models and introduces physics-inspired diagnostics to evaluate their performance and reliability, with a particular focus on geographic generalization and physical consistency. Our experiments show that, despite the seemingly strong performance of models such as CorrDiff, when trained on a limited set of European geographies (e.g., central Europe), they struggle to generalize to other regions such as Iberia, Morocco in the south, or Scandinavia in the north. They also fail to accurately capture second-order variables such as divergence and vorticity derived from predicted velocity fields. These deficiencies appear even in in-distribution geographies, indicating challenges in producing physically consistent predictions. We propose a simple initial solution: introducing a power spectral density loss function that empirically improves geographic generalization by encouraging the reconstruction of small-scale physical structures.

- **[Adam or Gauss-Newton? A Comparative Study In Terms of Basis Alignment and SGD Noise](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13680)**  `arXiv:2510.13680`  `cs.LG`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Diagonal preconditioners are computationally feasible approximate to second-order optimizers, which have shown significant promise in accelerating training of deep learning models. Two predominant approaches are based on Adam and Gauss-Newton (GN) methods: the former leverages statistics of current gradients and is the de-factor optimizers for neural networks, and the latter uses the diagonal elements of the Gauss-Newton matrix and underpins some of the recent diagonal optimizers such as Sophia.In this work, we compare these two diagonal preconditioning methods through the lens of two key factors: the choice of basis in the preconditioner, and the impact of gradient noise from mini-batching. To gain insights, we analyze these optimizers on quadratic objectives and logistic regression under all four quadrants. We show that regardless of the basis, there exist instances where Adam outperforms both GN$^{-1}$ and GN$^{-1/2}$ in full-batch settings. Conversely, in the stochastic regime, Adam behaves similarly to GN$^{-1/2}$ for linear regression under a Gaussian data assumption. These theoretical results are supported by empirical studies on both convex and non-convex objectives.

- **[Rebalancing with Calibrated Sub-classes (RCS): An Enhanced Approach for Robust Imbalanced Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13656)**  `arXiv:2510.13656`  `cs.LG`  
  _Priyobrata Mondal, Faizanuddin Ansari, Swagatam Das_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The class imbalance problem refers to the insufficiency of data in certain classes, which causes a classifier to be biased toward the majority class. Distribution calibration is a technique that seeks to estimate a more accurate class distribution based on an observed or estimated one. To address this issue, we propose a distribution calibration-based method-Rebalancing with Calibrated Sub-classes (RCS): An Enhanced Approach for Robust Imbalanced Classification, which estimates the distribution parameters of the minority classes using weighted parameters derived from a mixture of Gaussian components from both the majority and intermediate classes. An encoder-decoder network is trained to preserve the structure of the imbalanced data and prevent disentanglement. After training, feature vectors extracted from the encoder are used to generate synthetic samples through our distribution calibration strategy. This approach effectively mitigates the overgeneralization problem that arises when only the distribution of the majority class is used to approximate the minority class statistics. Instead, our method calibrates the parameters by leveraging the distribution of data points in neighboring regions. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior classification performance compared to several baseline and state-of-the-art techniques across a diverse range of image, text, and tabular datasets.

- **[Manifold Decoders: A Framework for Generative Modeling from Nonlinear Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13622)**  `arXiv:2510.13622`  `cs.LG`  
  _Riddhish Thakare, Kingdom Mutala Akugri_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Classical nonlinear dimensionality reduction (NLDR) techniques like t-SNE, Isomap, and LLE excel at creating low-dimensional embeddings for data visualization but fundamentally lack the ability to map these embeddings back to the original high-dimensional space. This one-way transformation limits their use in generative applications. This paper addresses this critical gap by introducing a system- atic framework for constructing neural decoder architectures for prominent NLDR methods, enabling bidirectional mapping for the first time. We extend this framework by implementing a diffusion-based generative process that operates directly within these learned manifold spaces. Through experiments on the CelebA dataset, we evaluate the reconstruction and generative performance of our approach against autoencoder and standard diffusion model baselines. Our findings reveal a fundamental trade- off: while the decoders successfully reconstruct data, their quality is surpassed by end-to-end optimized autoencoders. Moreover, manifold-constrained diffusion yields poor-quality samples, suggesting that the discrete and sparse nature of classical NLDR embeddings is ill-suited for the continuous inter- polation required by generative models. This work highlights the inherent challenges in retrofitting generative capabilities onto NLDR methods designed primarily for visualization and analysis.

- **[Physics-augmented Multi-task Gaussian Process for Modeling Spatiotemporal Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13601)**  `arXiv:2510.13601`  `cs.LG`  
  _Xizhuo Zhang, Bing Yao_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in sensing and imaging technologies have enabled the collection of high-dimensional spatiotemporal data across complex geometric domains. However, effective modeling of such data remains challenging due to irregular spatial structures, rapid temporal dynamics, and the need to jointly predict multiple interrelated physical variables. This paper presents a physics-augmented multi-task Gaussian Process (P-M-GP) framework tailored for spatiotemporal dynamic systems. Specifically, we develop a geometry-aware, multi-task Gaussian Process (M-GP) model to effectively capture intrinsic spatiotemporal structure and inter-task dependencies. To further enhance the model fidelity and robustness, we incorporate governing physical laws through a physics-based regularization scheme, thereby constraining predictions to be consistent with governing dynamical principles. We validate the proposed P-M-GP framework on a 3D cardiac electrodynamics modeling task. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our method significantly improves prediction accuracy over existing methods by effectively incorporating domain-specific physical constraints and geometric prior.

- **[Km-scale dynamical downscaling through conformalized latent diffusion models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13301)**  `arXiv:2510.13301`  `cs.LG`  
  _Alessandro Brusaferri, Andrea Ballarino_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Dynamical downscaling is crucial for deriving high-resolution meteorological fields from coarse-scale simulations, enabling detailed analysis for critical applications such as weather forecasting and renewable energy modeling. Generative Diffusion models (DMs) have recently emerged as powerful data-driven tools for this task, offering reconstruction fidelity and more scalable sampling supporting uncertainty quantification. However, DMs lack finite-sample guarantees against overconfident predictions, resulting in miscalibrated grid-point-level uncertainty estimates hindering their reliability in operational contexts. In this work, we tackle this issue by augmenting the downscaling pipeline with a conformal prediction framework. Specifically, the DM's samples are post-processed to derive conditional quantile estimates, incorporated into a conformalized quantile regression procedure targeting locally adaptive prediction intervals with finite-sample marginal validity. The proposed approach is evaluated on ERA5 reanalysis data over Italy, downscaled to a 2-km grid. Results demonstrate grid-point-level uncertainty estimates with markedly improved coverage and stable probabilistic scores relative to the DM baseline, highlighting the potential of conformalized generative models for more trustworthy probabilistic downscaling to high-resolution meteorological fields.

- **[Information-Theoretic Criteria for Knowledge Distillation in Multimodal Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13182)**  `arXiv:2510.13182`  `cs.LG`  
  _Rongrong Xie, Yizhou Xu, Guido Sanguinetti_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The rapid increase in multimodal data availability has sparked significant interest in cross-modal knowledge distillation (KD) techniques, where richer "teacher" modalities transfer information to weaker "student" modalities during model training to improve performance. However, despite successes across various applications, cross-modal KD does not always result in improved outcomes, primarily due to a limited theoretical understanding that could inform practice. To address this gap, we introduce the Cross-modal Complementarity Hypothesis (CCH): we propose that cross-modal KD is effective when the mutual information between teacher and student representations exceeds the mutual information between the student representation and the labels. We theoretically validate the CCH in a joint Gaussian model and further confirm it empirically across diverse multimodal datasets, including image, text, video, audio, and cancer-related omics data. Our study establishes a novel theoretical framework for understanding cross-modal KD and offers practical guidelines based on the CCH criterion to select optimal teacher modalities for improving the performance of weaker modalities.

  Channel state information (CSI) prediction is a promising strategy for ensuring reliable and efficient operation of massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) systems by providing timely downlink (DL) CSI. While deep learning-based methods have advanced beyond conventional model-driven and statistical approaches, they remain limited in robustness to practical non-Gaussian noise, generalization across diverse channel conditions, and computational efficiency. This paper introduces CSI-4CAST, a hybrid deep learning architecture that integrates 4 key components, i.e., Convolutional neural network residuals, Adaptive correction layers, ShuffleNet blocks, and Transformers, to efficiently capture both local and long-range dependencies in CSI prediction. To enable rigorous evaluation, this work further presents a comprehensive benchmark, CSI-RRG for Regular, Robustness and Generalization testing, which includes more than 300,000 samples across 3,060 realistic scenarios for both TDD and FDD systems. The dataset spans multiple channel models, a wide range of delay spreads and user velocities, and diverse noise types and intensity degrees. Experimental results show that CSI-4CAST achieves superior prediction accuracy with substantially lower computational cost, outperforming baselines in 88.9% of TDD scenarios and 43.8% of FDD scenario, the best performance among all evaluated models, while reducing FLOPs by 5x and 3x compared to LLM4CP, the strongest baseline. In addition, evaluation over CSI-RRG provides valuable insights into how different channel factors affect the performance and generalization capability of deep learning models. Both the dataset (this https URL) and evaluation protocols (this https URL) are publicly released to establish a standardized benchmark and to encourage further research on robust and efficient CSI prediction.

- **[Pruning Cannot Hurt Robustness: Certified Trade-offs in Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12939)**  `arXiv:2510.12939`  `cs.LG`  
  _James Pedley, Benjamin Etheridge, Stephen J. Roberts, Francesco Quinzan_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reinforcement learning (RL) policies deployed in real-world environments must remain reliable under adversarial perturbations. At the same time, modern deep RL agents are heavily over-parameterized, raising costs and fragility concerns. While pruning has been shown to improve robustness in supervised learning, its role in adversarial RL remains poorly understood. We develop the first theoretical framework for certified robustness under pruning in state-adversarial Markov decision processes (SA-MDPs). For Gaussian and categorical policies with Lipschitz networks, we prove that element-wise pruning can only tighten certified robustness bounds; pruning never makes the policy less robust. Building on this, we derive a novel three-term regret decomposition that disentangles clean-task performance, pruning-induced performance loss, and robustness gains, exposing a fundamental performance--robustness frontier. Empirically, we evaluate magnitude and micro-pruning schedules on continuous-control benchmarks with strong policy-aware adversaries. Across tasks, pruning consistently uncovers reproducible ``sweet spots'' at moderate sparsity levels, where robustness improves substantially without harming - and sometimes even enhancing - clean performance. These results position pruning not merely as a compression tool but as a structural intervention for robust RL.

- **[RealEngine: Simulating Autonomous Driving in Realistic Context](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16902)**  `arXiv:2505.16902`  `cs.CV` `cs.RO`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Driving simulation plays a crucial role in developing reliable driving agents by providing controlled, evaluative environments. To enable meaningful assessments, a high-quality driving simulator must satisfy several key requirements: multi-modal sensing capabilities (e.g., camera and LiDAR) with realistic scene rendering to minimize observational discrepancies; closed-loop evaluation to support free-form trajectory behaviors; highly diverse traffic scenarios for thorough evaluation; multi-agent cooperation to capture interaction dynamics; and high computational efficiency to ensure affordability and scalability. However, existing simulators and benchmarks fail to comprehensively meet these fundamental criteria. To bridge this gap, this paper introduces RealEngine, a novel driving simulation framework that holistically integrates 3D scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis techniques to achieve realistic and flexible closed-loop simulation in the driving context. By leveraging real-world multi-modal sensor data, RealEngine reconstructs background scenes and foreground traffic participants separately, allowing for highly diverse and realistic traffic scenarios through flexible scene composition. This synergistic fusion of scene reconstruction and view synthesis enables photorealistic rendering across multiple sensor modalities, ensuring both perceptual fidelity and geometric accuracy. Building upon this environment, RealEngine supports three essential driving simulation categories: non-reactive simulation, safety testing, and multi-agent interaction, collectively forming a reliable and comprehensive benchmark for evaluating the real-world performance of driving agents.

- **[Backpropagation-Free Test-Time Adaptation via Probabilistic Gaussian Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15568)**  `arXiv:2508.15568`  `cs.CV` `cs.LG`  
  _Youjia Zhang, Youngeun Kim, Young-Geun Choi, Hongyeob Kim, Huiling Liu, Sungeun Hong_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Test-time adaptation (TTA) enhances the zero-shot robustness under distribution shifts by leveraging unlabeled test data during inference. Despite notable advances, several challenges still limit its broader applicability. First, most methods rely on backpropagation or iterative optimization, which limits scalability and hinders real-time deployment. Second, they lack explicit modeling of class-conditional feature distributions. This modeling is crucial for producing reliable decision boundaries and calibrated predictions, but it remains underexplored due to the lack of both source data and supervision at test time. In this paper, we propose ADAPT, an Advanced Distribution-Aware and backPropagation-free Test-time adaptation method. We reframe TTA as a Gaussian probabilistic inference task by modeling class-conditional likelihoods using gradually updated class means and a shared covariance matrix. This enables closed-form, training-free inference. To correct potential likelihood bias, we introduce lightweight regularization guided by CLIP priors and a historical knowledge bank. ADAPT requires no source data, no gradient updates, and no full access to target data, supporting both online and transductive settings. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance under a wide range of distribution shifts with superior scalability and robustness.

- **[IterMask3D: Unsupervised Anomaly Detection and Segmentation with Test-Time Iterative Mask Refinement in 3D Brain MR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04911)**  `arXiv:2504.04911`  `cs.CV` `cs.LG`  
  _Ziyun Liang, Xiaoqing Guo, Wentian Xu, Yasin Ibrahim, Natalie Voets, Pieter M Pretorius, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Unsupervised anomaly detection and segmentation methods train a model to learn the training distribution as `normal'. In the testing phase, they identify patterns that deviate from this normal distribution as `anomalies'. To learn the `normal' distribution, prevailing methodscorrupt the images and train a model to reconstruct them. During testing, the model attempts to reconstruct corrupted inputs based on the learned `normal' distribution. Deviations from this distribution lead to high reconstruction errors, which indicate potential anomalies. However, corrupting an input image inevitably causes information loss even in normal regions, leading to suboptimal reconstruction and an increased risk of false positives. To alleviate this, we propose $\rm{IterMask3D}$, an iterative spatial mask-refining strategy designed for 3D brain MRI. We iteratively spatially mask areas of the image as corruption and reconstruct them, then shrink the mask based on reconstruction error. This process iteratively unmasks `normal' areas to the model, whose information further guides reconstruction of `normal' patterns under the mask to be reconstructed accurately, reducing false positives. In addition, to achieve better reconstruction performance, we also propose using high-frequency image content as additional structural information to guide the reconstruction of the masked area. Extensive experiments on the detection of both synthetic and real-world imaging artifacts, as well as segmentation of various pathological lesions across multiple MRI sequences, consistently demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.

- **[ChA-MAEViT: Unifying Channel-Aware Masked Autoencoders and Multi-Channel Vision Transformers for Improved Cross-Channel Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19331)**  `arXiv:2503.19331`  `cs.CV` `cs.LG`  
  _Chau Pham, Juan C. Caicedo, Bryan A. Plummer_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Prior work using Masked Autoencoders (MAEs) typically relies on random patch masking based on the assumption that images have significant redundancies across different channels, allowing for the reconstruction of masked content using cross-channel correlations. However, this assumption does not hold in Multi-Channel Imaging (MCI), where channels may provide complementary information with minimal feature overlap. Thus, these MAEs primarily learn local structures within individual channels from patch reconstruction, failing to fully leverage cross-channel interactions and limiting their MCI effectiveness. In this paper, we present ChA-MAEViT, an MAE-based method that enhances feature learning across MCI channels via four key strategies: (1) dynamic channel-patch masking, which compels the model to reconstruct missing channels in addition to masked patches, thereby enhancing cross-channel dependencies and improving robustness to varying channel configurations; (2) memory tokens, which serve as long-term memory aids to promote information sharing across channels, addressing the challenges of reconstructing structurally diverse channels; (3) hybrid token fusion module, which merges fine-grained patch tokens with a global class token to capture richer representations; and (4) Channel-Aware Decoder, a lightweight decoder utilizes channel tokens to effectively reconstruct image patches. Experiments on satellite and microscopy datasets, CHAMMI, JUMP-CP, and So2Sat, show that ChA-MAEViT significantly outperforms state-of-the-art MCI-ViTs by 3.0-21.5%, highlighting the importance of cross-channel interactions in MCI.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) struggle with precise reasoning for structured visuals like charts and diagrams, as pixel-based perception lacks a mechanism for verification. To address this, we propose to leverage derendering -- the process of reverse-engineering visuals into executable code -- as a new modality for verifiable visual reasoning. Specifically, we propose RECODE, an agentic framework that first generates multiple candidate programs to reproduce the input image. It then uses a critic to select the most faithful reconstruction and iteratively refines the code. This process not only transforms an ambiguous perceptual task into a verifiable, symbolic problem, but also enables precise calculations and logical inferences later on. On various visual reasoning benchmarks such as CharXiv, ChartQA, and Geometry3K, RECODE significantly outperforms methods that do not leverage code or only use code for drawing auxiliary lines or cropping. Our work demonstrates that grounding visual perception in executable code provides a new path toward more accurate and verifiable multimodal reasoning.

- **[Modeling Cultural Bias in Facial Expression Recognition with Adaptive Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13557)**  `arXiv:2510.13557`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`  
  _David Freire-Obreg√≥n, Jos√© Salas-C√°ceres, Javier Lorenzo-Navarro, Oliverio J. Santana, Daniel Hern√°ndez-Sosa, Modesto Castrill√≥n-Santana_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Facial expression recognition (FER) must remain robust under both cultural variation and perceptually degraded visual conditions, yet most existing evaluations assume homogeneous data and high-quality imagery. We introduce an agent-based, streaming benchmark that reveals how cross-cultural composition and progressive blurring interact to shape face recognition robustness. Each agent operates in a frozen CLIP feature space with a lightweight residual adapter trained online at sigma=0 and fixed during testing. Agents move and interact on a 5x5 lattice, while the environment provides inputs with sigma-scheduled Gaussian blur. We examine monocultural populations (Western-only, Asian-only) and mixed environments with balanced (5/5) and imbalanced (8/2, 2/8) compositions, as well as different spatial contact structures. Results show clear asymmetric degradation curves between cultural groups: JAFFE (Asian) populations maintain higher performance at low blur but exhibit sharper drops at intermediate stages, whereas KDEF (Western) populations degrade more uniformly. Mixed populations exhibit intermediate patterns, with balanced mixtures mitigating early degradation, but imbalanced settings amplify majority-group weaknesses under high blur. These findings quantify how cultural composition and interaction structure influence the robustness of FER as perceptual conditions deteriorate.

  We present CAGE (Continuity-Aware edGE) network, a robust framework for reconstructing vector floorplans directly from point-cloud density maps. Traditional corner-based polygon representations are highly sensitive to noise and incomplete observations, often resulting in fragmented or implausiblethis http URLline grouping methods leverage structural cues to improve robustness but still struggle to recover fine geometric details. To address these limitations,we propose a native edge-centric formulation, modeling each wall segment as a directed, geometrically continuous edge. This representation enables inference of coherent floorplan structures, ensuring watertight, topologically valid room boundaries while improving robustness and reducing artifacts. Towards this design, we develop a dual-query transformer decoder that integrates perturbed and latent queries within a denoising framework, which not only stabilizes optimization but also accelerates convergence. Extensive experiments on Structured3D and SceneCAD show that CAGE achieves state-of-the-art performance, with F1 scores of 99.1% (rooms), 91.7% (corners), and 89.3% (angles). The method also demonstrates strong cross-dataset generalization, underscoring the efficacy of our architectural innovations.

- **[Cyclic Self-Supervised Diffusion for Ultra Low-field to High-field MRI Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13735)**  `arXiv:2510.13735`  `cs.CV`

  Synthesizing high-quality images from low-field MRI holds significant potential. Low-field MRI is cheaper, more accessible, and safer, but suffers from low resolution and poor signal-to-noise ratio. This synthesis process can reduce reliance on costly acquisitions and expand data availability. However, synthesizing high-field MRI still suffers from a clinical fidelity gap. There is a need to preserve anatomical fidelity, enhance fine-grained structural details, and bridge domain gaps in image contrast. To address these issues, we propose a \emph{cyclic self-supervised diffusion (CSS-Diff)} framework for high-field MRI synthesis from real low-field MRI data. Our core idea is to reformulate diffusion-based synthesis under a cycle-consistent constraint. It enforces anatomical preservation throughout the generative process rather than just relying on paired pixel-level supervision. The CSS-Diff framework further incorporates two novel processes. The slice-wise gap perception network aligns inter-slice inconsistencies via contrastive learning. The local structure correction network enhances local feature restoration through self-reconstruction of masked and perturbed patches. Extensive experiments on cross-field synthesis tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, achieving state-of-the-art performance (e.g., 31.80 $\pm$ 2.70 dB in PSNR, 0.943 $\pm$ 0.102 in SSIM, and 0.0864 $\pm$ 0.0689 in LPIPS). Beyond pixel-wise fidelity, our method also preserves fine-grained anatomical structures compared with the original low-field MRI (e.g., left cerebral white matter error drops from 12.1$\%$ to 2.1$\%$, cortex from 4.2$\%$ to 3.7$\%$). To conclude, our CSS-Diff can synthesize images that are both quantitatively reliable and anatomically consistent.

  We propose FlashWorld, a generative model that produces 3D scenes from a single image or text prompt in seconds, 10~100$\times$ faster than previous works while possessing superior rendering quality. Our approach shifts from the conventional multi-view-oriented (MV-oriented) paradigm, which generates multi-view images for subsequent 3D reconstruction, to a 3D-oriented approach where the model directly produces 3D Gaussian representations during multi-view generation. While ensuring 3D consistency, 3D-oriented method typically suffers poor visual quality. FlashWorld includes a dual-mode pre-training phase followed by a cross-mode post-training phase, effectively integrating the strengths of both paradigms. Specifically, leveraging the prior from a video diffusion model, we first pre-train a dual-mode multi-view diffusion model, which jointly supports MV-oriented and 3D-oriented generation modes. To bridge the quality gap in 3D-oriented generation, we further propose a cross-mode post-training distillation by matching distribution from consistent 3D-oriented mode to high-quality MV-oriented mode. This not only enhances visual quality while maintaining 3D consistency, but also reduces the required denoising steps for inference. Also, we propose a strategy to leverage massive single-view images and text prompts during this process to enhance the model's generalization to out-of-distribution inputs. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority and efficiency of our method.

  Recent advances in foundation models have driven remarkable progress in image editing, yet their extension to 3D editing remains underexplored. A natural approach is to replace the image editing modules in existing workflows with foundation models. However, their heavy computational demands and the restrictions and costs of closed-source APIs make plugging these models into existing iterative editing strategies impractical. To address this limitation, we propose EditCast3D, a pipeline that employs video generation foundation models to propagate edits from a single first frame across the entire dataset prior to reconstruction. While editing propagation enables dataset-level editing via video models, its consistency remains suboptimal for 3D reconstruction, where multi-view alignment is essential. To overcome this, EditCast3D introduces a view selection strategy that explicitly identifies consistent and reconstruction-friendly views and adopts feedforward reconstruction without requiring costly refinement. In combination, the pipeline both minimizes reliance on expensive image editing and mitigates prompt ambiguities that arise when applying foundation models independently across images. We evaluate EditCast3D on commonly used 3D editing datasets and compare it against state-of-the-art 3D editing baselines, demonstrating superior editing quality and high efficiency. These results establish EditCast3D as a scalable and general paradigm for integrating foundation models into 3D editing pipelines. The code is available atthis https URL

  Diffusion models have recently achieved significant success in various image manipulation tasks, including image super-resolution and perceptual quality enhancement. Pretrained text-to-image models, such as Stable Diffusion, have exhibited strong capabilities in synthesizing realistic image content, which makes them particularly attractive for addressing super-resolution tasks. While some existing approaches leverage these models to achieve state-of-the-art results, they often struggle when applied to diverse and highly degraded images, leading to noise amplification or incorrect content generation. To address these limitations, we propose a contextually precise image super-resolution framework that effectively maintains both local and global pixel relationships through Local-Global Context-Aware Attention, enabling the generation of high-quality images. Furthermore, we propose a distribution- and perceptual-aligned conditioning mechanism in the pixel space to enhance perceptual fidelity. This mechanism captures fine-grained pixel-level representations while progressively preserving and refining structural information, transitioning from local content details to the global structural composition. During inference, our method generates high-quality images that are structurally consistent with the original content, mitigating artifacts and ensuring realistic detail restoration. Extensive experiments on multiple super-resolution benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in producing high-fidelity, perceptually accurate reconstructions.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present a neural parametric 3D breast shape model and, based on this model, introduce a low-cost and accessible 3D surface reconstruction pipeline capable of recovering accurate breast geometry from a monocular RGB video. In contrast to widely used, commercially available yet prohibitively expensive 3D breast scanning solutions and existing low-cost alternatives, our method requires neither specialized hardware nor proprietary software and can be used with any device that is able to record RGB videos. The key building blocks of our pipeline are a state-of-the-art, off-the-shelf Structure-from-motion pipeline, paired with a parametric breast model for robust and metrically correct surface reconstruction. Our model, similarly to the recently proposed implicit Regensburg Breast Shape Model (iRBSM), leverages implicit neural representations to model breast shapes. However, unlike the iRBSM, which employs a single global neural signed distance function (SDF), our approach -- inspired by recent state-of-the-art face models -- decomposes the implicit breast domain into multiple smaller regions, each represented by a local neural SDF anchored at anatomical landmark positions. When incorporated into our surface reconstruction pipeline, the proposed model, dubbed liRBSM (short for localized iRBSM), significantly outperforms the iRBSM in terms of reconstruction quality, yielding more detailed surface reconstruction than its global counterpart. Overall, we find that the introduced pipeline is able to recover high-quality 3D breast geometry within an error margin of less than 2 mm. Our method is fast (requires less than six minutes), fully transparent and open-source, and -- together with the model -- publicly available atthis https URL.

  The rapid progress of large, pretrained models for both visual content generation and 3D reconstruction opens up new possibilities for text-to-3D generation. Intuitively, one could obtain a formidable 3D scene generator if one were able to combine the power of a modern latent text-to-video model as "generator" with the geometric abilities of a recent (feedforward) 3D reconstruction system as "decoder". We introduce VIST3A, a general framework that does just that, addressing two main challenges. First, the two components must be joined in a way that preserves the rich knowledge encoded in their weights. We revisit model stitching, i.e., we identify the layer in the 3D decoder that best matches the latent representation produced by the text-to-video generator and stitch the two parts together. That operation requires only a small dataset and no labels. Second, the text-to-video generator must be aligned with the stitched 3D decoder, to ensure that the generated latents are decodable into consistent, perceptually convincing 3D scene geometry. To that end, we adapt direct reward finetuning, a popular technique for human preference alignment. We evaluate the proposed VIST3A approach with different video generators and 3D reconstruction models. All tested pairings markedly improve over prior text-to-3D models that output Gaussian splats. Moreover, by choosing a suitable 3D base model, VIST3A also enables high-quality text-to-pointmap generation.

  Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoders (VQ-VAEs) leverage self-supervised learning through reconstruction tasks to represent continuous vectors using the closest vectors in a codebook. However, issues such as codebook collapse persist in the VQ model. To address these issues, existing approaches employ implicit static codebooks or jointly optimize the entire codebook, but these methods constrain the codebook's learning capability, leading to reduced reconstruction quality. In this paper, we propose Group-VQ, which performs group-wise optimization on the codebook. Each group is optimized independently, with joint optimization performed within groups. This approach improves the trade-off between codebook utilization and reconstruction performance. Additionally, we introduce a training-free codebook resampling method, allowing post-training adjustment of the codebook size. In image reconstruction experiments under various settings, Group-VQ demonstrates improved performance on reconstruction metrics. And the post-training codebook sampling method achieves the desired flexibility in adjusting the codebook size.

  Structure-from-Motion (SfM), a method that recovers camera poses and scene geometry from uncalibrated images, is a central component in robotic reconstruction and simulation. Despite the state-of-the-art performance of traditional SfM methods such as COLMAP and its follow-up work, GLOMAP, naive CPU-specialized implementations of bundle adjustment (BA) or global positioning (GP) introduce significant computational overhead when handling large-scale scenarios, leading to a trade-off between accuracy and speed in SfM. Moreover, the blessing of efficient C++-based implementations in COLMAP and GLOMAP comes with the curse of limited flexibility, as they lack support for various external optimization options. On the other hand, while deep learning based SfM pipelines like VGGSfM and VGGT enable feed-forward 3D reconstruction, they are unable to scale to thousands of input views at once as GPU memory consumption increases sharply as the number of input views grows. In this paper, we unleash the full potential of GPU parallel computation to accelerate each critical stage of the standard SfM pipeline. Building upon recent advances in sparse-aware bundle adjustment optimization, our design extends these techniques to accelerate both BA and GP within a unified global SfM framework. Through extensive experiments on datasets of varying scales (e.g. 5000 images where VGGSfM and VGGT run out of memory), our method demonstrates up to about 40 times speedup over COLMAP while achieving consistently comparable or even improved reconstruction accuracy.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This study introduces a Masked Degradation Classification Pre-Training method (MaskDCPT), designed to facilitate the classification of degradation types in input images, leading to comprehensive image restoration pre-training. Unlike conventional pre-training methods, MaskDCPT uses the degradation type of the image as an extremely weak supervision, while simultaneously leveraging the image reconstruction to enhance performance and robustness. MaskDCPT includes an encoder and two decoders: the encoder extracts features from the masked low-quality input image. The classification decoder uses these features to identify the degradation type, whereas the reconstruction decoder aims to reconstruct a corresponding high-quality image. This design allows the pre-training to benefit from both masked image modeling and contrastive learning, resulting in a generalized representation suited for restoration tasks. Benefit from the straightforward yet potent MaskDCPT, the pre-trained encoder can be used to address universal image restoration and achieve outstanding performance. Implementing MaskDCPT significantly improves performance for both convolution neural networks (CNNs) and Transformers, with a minimum increase in PSNR of 3.77 dB in the 5D all-in-one restoration task and a 34.8% reduction in PIQE compared to baseline in real-world degradation scenarios. It also emergences strong generalization to previously unseen degradation types and levels. In addition, we curate and release the UIR-2.5M dataset, which includes 2.5 million paired restoration samples across 19 degradation types and over 200 degradation levels, incorporating both synthetic and real-world data. The dataset, source code, and models are available atthis https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Edge Gaussian splatting (EGS), which aggregates data from distributed clients and trains a global GS model at the edge server, is an emerging paradigm for scene reconstruction. Unlike traditional edge resource management methods that emphasize communication throughput or general-purpose learning performance, EGS explicitly aims to maximize the GS qualities, rendering existing approaches inapplicable. To address this problem, this paper formulates a novel GS-oriented objective function that distinguishes the heterogeneous view contributions of different clients. However, evaluating this function in turn requires clients' images, leading to a causality dilemma. To this end, this paper further proposes a sample-then-transmit EGS (or STT-GS for short) strategy, which first samples a subset of images as pilot data from each client for loss prediction. Based on the first-stage evaluation, communication resources are then prioritized towards more valuable clients. To achieve efficient sampling, a feature-domain clustering (FDC) scheme is proposed to select the most representative data and pilot transmission time minimization (PTTM) is adopted to reduce the pilotthis http URL, we develop a joint client selection and power control (JCSPC) framework to maximize the GS-oriented function under communication resource constraints. Despite the nonconvexity of the problem, we propose a low-complexity efficient solution based on the penalty alternating majorization minimization (PAMM) algorithm. Experiments unveil that the proposed scheme significantly outperforms existing benchmarks on real-world datasets. It is found that the GS-oriented objective can be accurately predicted with low sampling ratios (e.g.,10%), and our method achieves an excellent tradeoff between view contributions and communication costs.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Infrared and visible image fusion aims to integrate complementary information from co-registered source images to produce a single, informative result. Most learning-based approaches train with a combination of structural similarity loss, intensity reconstruction loss, and a gradient-magnitude term. However, collapsing gradients to their magnitude removes directional information, yielding ambiguous supervision and suboptimal edge fidelity. We introduce a direction-aware, multi-scale gradient loss that supervises horizontal and vertical components separately and preserves their sign across scales. This axis-wise, sign-preserving objective provides clear directional guidance at both fine and coarse resolutions, promoting sharper, better-aligned edges and richer texture preservation without changing model architectures or training protocols. Experiments on open-source model and multiple public benchmarks demonstrate effectiveness of our approach.

  Despite deep learning's broad success, its abstract-reasoning bottleneck persists. We tackle Raven's Progressive Matrices (RPM), the benchmark for pattern, reasoning and problem-solving intelligence. We model the full causal chain image $\rightarrow$ attributes $\rightarrow$ progressive patterns $\rightarrow$ consistency $\rightarrow$ answer and build the baseline DIO. Yet DIO's mutual-information lower-bound objective does not embed human logic: the bound is loose and statistic-based, ignoring causal subject-object links. We therefore present three refinements. 1) Brando introduces trainable negative options to tighten the variational bound. 2) WORLD replaces generation with a Gaussian-mixture feature model that supplies infinite, weighted negatives, further tightening the bound. 3) DIEGO adds metadata supervision to rectify the "attributes $\rightarrow$ patterns" semantic gap, aligning representations with human rules. These upgrades substantially boost discriminative RPM accuracy and, for the first time, let DIO generate valid answers in open-ended RPM. The work provides causal-driven design guidelines, objective-refinement strategies and cross-modal insights for abstract-reasoning research.

  We introduce a modular framework for predicting cancer-specific survival from whole slide pathology images (WSIs) that significantly improves upon the state-of-the-art accuracy. Our method integrating four key components. Firstly, to tackle large size of WSIs, we use dynamic patch selection via quantile-based thresholding for isolating prognostically informative tissue regions. Secondly, we use graph-guided k-means clustering to capture phenotype-level heterogeneity through spatial and morphological coherence. Thirdly, we use attention mechanisms that model both intra- and inter-cluster relationships to contextualize local features within global spatial relations between various types of tissue compartments. Finally, we use an expert-guided mixture density modeling for estimating complex survival distributions using Gaussian mixture models. The proposed model achieves a concordance index of $0.712 \pm 0.028$ and Brier score of $0.254 \pm 0.018$ on TCGA-KIRC (renal cancer), and a concordance index of $0.645 \pm 0.017$ and Brier score of $0.281 \pm 0.031$ on TCGA-LUAD (lung adenocarcinoma). These results are significantly better than the state-of-art and demonstrate predictive potential of the proposed method across diverse cancer types.

  Generative diffusion models learn probability densities over diverse image datasets by estimating the score with a neural network trained to remove noise. Despite their remarkable success in generating high-quality images, the internal mechanisms of the underlying score networks are not well understood. Here, we examine the image representation that arises from score estimation in a {fully-convolutional unconditional UNet}. We show that the middle block of the UNet decomposes individual images into sparse subsets of active channels, and that the vector of spatial averages of these channels can provide a nonlinear representation of the underlying clean images. Euclidean distances in this representation space are semantically meaningful, even though no conditioning information is provided during training. We develop a novel algorithm for stochastic reconstruction of images conditioned on this representation: The synthesis using the unconditional model is "self-guided" by the representation extracted from that very same model. For a given representation, the common patterns in the set of reconstructed samples reveal the features captured in the middle block of the UNet. Together, these results show, for the first time, that a measure of semantic similarity emerges, unsupervised, solely from the denoising objective.

  The automatic assembly problem has attracted increasing interest due to its complex challenges that involve 3D representation. This paper introduces Jigsaw++, a novel generative method designed to tackle the multifaceted challenges of reconstructing complete shape for the reassembly problem. Existing approach focusing primarily on piecewise information for both part and fracture assembly, often overlooking the integration of complete object prior. Jigsaw++ distinguishes itself by learning a shape prior of complete objects. It employs the proposed "retargeting" strategy that effectively leverages the output of any existing assembly method to generate complete shape reconstructions. This capability allows it to function orthogonally to the current methods. Through extensive evaluations on Breaking Bad dataset and PartNet, Jigsaw++ has demonstrated its effectiveness, reducing reconstruction errors and enhancing the precision of shape reconstruction, which sets a new direction for future reassembly model developments.
