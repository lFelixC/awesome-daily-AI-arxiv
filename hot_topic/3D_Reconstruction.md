- **[HumanDiffusion: A Vision-Based Diffusion Trajectory Planner with Human-Conditioned Goals for Search and Rescue UAV](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14973)**  `arXiv:2601.14973`  `cs.RO` `cs.AI`

  Reliable human--robot collaboration in emergency scenarios requires autonomous systems that can detect humans, infer navigation goals, and operate safely in dynamic environments. This paper presents HumanDiffusion, a lightweight image-conditioned diffusion planner that generates human-aware navigation trajectories directly from RGB imagery. The system combines YOLO-11 based human detection with diffusion-driven trajectory generation, enabling a quadrotor to approach a target person and deliver medical assistance without relying on prior maps or computationally intensive planning pipelines. Trajectories are predicted in pixel space, ensuring smooth motion and a consistent safety margin around humans. We evaluate HumanDiffusion in simulation and real-world indoor mock-disaster scenarios. On a 300-sample test set, the model achieves a mean squared error of 0.02 in pixel-space trajectory reconstruction. Real-world experiments demonstrate an overall mission success rate of 80% across accident-response and search-and-locate tasks with partial occlusions. These results indicate that human-conditioned diffusion planning offers a practical and robust solution for human-aware UAV navigation in time-critical assistance settings.

- **[Digital twins for the design, interactive control, and deployment of modular, fiber-reinforced soft continuum arms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10121)**  `arXiv:2507.10121`  `cs.RO`

  Soft continuum arms (SCAs) promise versatile manipulation through mechanical compliance, for assistive devices, agriculture, search applications, or surgery. However, the strong nonlinear coupling between materials, morphology, and actuation renders design and control challenging, hindering real-world deployment. In this context, a modular fabrication strategy paired with reliable, interactive simulations would be highly beneficial, streamlining prototyping and control design. Here, we present a digital twin framework for modular SCAs realized using pneumatic Fiber-Reinforced Elastomeric Enclosures (FREEs). The approach models assemblies of FREE actuators through networks of Cosserat rods, favoring the accurate simulation of three-dimensional arm reconfigurations, while explicitly preserving internal modular architecture. This enables the quantitative analysis and scalable development of composite soft robot arms, overcoming limitations of current monolithic continuum models. To validate the framework, we introduce a three-dimensional reconstruction pipeline tailored to soft, slender, small-volume, and highly deformable structures, allowing reliable recovery of arm kinematics and strain distributions. Experimental results across multiple configurations and actuation regimes demonstrate close agreement with simulations. Finally, we embed the digital twins in a virtual environment to allow interactive control design and sim-to-real deployment, establishing a foundation for principled co-design and remote operation of modular soft continuum manipulators.

- **[Evaluating Adversarial Robustness of Concept Representations in Sparse Autoencoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16004)**  `arXiv:2505.16004`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI` `cs.CL`

  Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are commonly used to interpret the internal activations of large language models (LLMs) by mapping them to human-interpretable concept representations. While existing evaluations of SAEs focus on metrics such as the reconstruction-sparsity tradeoff, human (auto-)interpretability, and feature disentanglement, they overlook a critical aspect: the robustness of concept representations to input perturbations. We argue that robustness must be a fundamental consideration for concept representations, reflecting the fidelity of concept labeling. To this end, we formulate robustness quantification as input-space optimization problems and develop a comprehensive evaluation framework featuring realistic scenarios in which adversarial perturbations are crafted to manipulate SAE representations. Empirically, we find that tiny adversarial input perturbations can effectively manipulate concept-based interpretations in most scenarios without notably affecting the base LLM's activations. Overall, our results suggest that SAE concept representations are fragile and without further denoising or postprocessing they might be ill-suited for applications in model monitoring and oversight.

- **[Enhancing ECG Classification Robustness with Lightweight Unsupervised Anomaly Detection Filters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26501)**  `arXiv:2510.26501`  `cs.LG`

  Continuous electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring via wearable devices is vital for early cardiovascular disease detection. However, deploying deep learning models on resource-constrained microcontrollers faces reliability challenges, particularly from Out-of-Distribution (OOD) pathologies and noise. Standard classifiers often yield high-confidence errors on such data. Existing OOD detection methods either neglect computational constraints or address noise and unseen classes separately. This paper investigates Unsupervised Anomaly Detection (UAD) as a lightweight, upstream filtering mechanism. We perform a Neural Architecture Search (NAS) on six UAD approaches, including Deep Support Vector Data Description (Deep SVDD), input reconstruction with (Variational-)Autoencoders (AE/VAE), Masked Anomaly Detection (MAD), Normalizing Flows (NFs) and Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) under strict hardware constraints ($\leq$512k parameters), suitable for microcontrollers. Evaluating on the PTB-XL and BUT QDB datasets, we demonstrate that a NAS-optimized Deep SVDD offers the superior Pareto efficiency between detection performance and model size. In a simulated deployment, this lightweight filter improves the accuracy of a diagnostic classifier by up to 21.0 percentage points, demonstrating that optimized UAD filters can safeguard ECG analysis on wearables.

- **[GPA-VGGT:Adapting VGGT to Large scale Localization by self-Supervised learning with Geometry and Physics Aware loss](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16885)**  `arXiv:2601.16885`  `cs.CV` `cs.RO`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Transformer-based general visual geometry frameworks have shown promising performance in camera pose estimation and 3D scene understanding. Recent advancements in Visual Geometry Grounded Transformer (VGGT) models have shown great promise in camera pose estimation and 3D reconstruction. However, these models typically rely on ground truth labels for training, posing challenges when adapting to unlabeled and unseen scenes. In this paper, we propose a self-supervised framework to train VGGT with unlabeled data, thereby enhancing its localization capability in large-scale environments. To achieve this, we extend conventional pair-wise relations to sequence-wise geometric constraints for self-supervised learning. Specifically, in each sequence, we sample multiple source frames and geometrically project them onto different target frames, which improves temporal feature consistency. We formulate physical photometric consistency and geometric constraints as a joint optimization loss to circumvent the requirement for hard labels. By training the model with this proposed method, not only the local and global cross-view attention layers but also the camera and depth heads can effectively capture the underlying multi-view geometry. Experiments demonstrate that the model converges within hundreds of iterations and achieves significant improvements in large-scale localization. Our code will be released atthis https URL.

  We introduce MapAnything, a unified transformer-based feed-forward model that ingests one or more images along with optional geometric inputs such as camera intrinsics, poses, depth, or partial reconstructions, and then directly regresses the metric 3D scene geometry and cameras. MapAnything leverages a factored representation of multi-view scene geometry, i.e., a collection of depth maps, local ray maps, camera poses, and a metric scale factor that effectively upgrades local reconstructions into a globally consistent metric frame. Standardizing the supervision and training across diverse datasets, along with flexible input augmentation, enables MapAnything to address a broad range of 3D vision tasks in a single feed-forward pass, including uncalibrated structure-from-motion, calibrated multi-view stereo, monocular depth estimation, camera localization, depth completion, and more. We provide extensive experimental analyses and model ablations demonstrating that MapAnything outperforms or matches specialist feed-forward models while offering more efficient joint training behavior, thus paving the way toward a universal 3D reconstruction backbone.

  3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a powerful technique for real-time novel view synthesis. As an explicit representation optimized through gradient propagation among primitives, optimization widely accepted in deep neural networks (DNNs) is actually adopted in 3DGS, such as synchronous weight updating and Adam with the adaptive gradient. However, considering the physical significance and specific design in 3DGS, there are two overlooked details in the optimization of 3DGS: (i) update step coupling, which induces optimizer state rescaling and costly attribute updates outside the viewpoints, and (ii) gradient coupling in the moment, which may lead to under- or over-effective regularization. Nevertheless, such a complex coupling is under-explored. After revisiting the optimization of 3DGS, we take a step to decouple it and recompose the process into: Sparse Adam, Re-State Regularization and Decoupled Attribute Regularization. Taking a large number of experiments under the 3DGS and 3DGS-MCMC frameworks, our work provides a deeper understanding of these components. Finally, based on the empirical analysis, we re-design the optimization and propose AdamW-GS by re-coupling the beneficial components, under which better optimization efficiency and representation effectiveness are achieved simultaneously.

- **[Masked Modeling for Human Motion Recovery Under Occlusions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16079)**  `arXiv:2601.16079`  `cs.CV`

  Human motion reconstruction from monocular videos is a fundamental challenge in computer vision, with broad applications in AR/VR, robotics, and digital content creation, but remains challenging under frequent occlusions in real-world settings. Existing regression-based methods are efficient but fragile to missing observations, while optimization- and diffusion-based approaches improve robustness at the cost of slow inference speed and heavy preprocessing steps. To address these limitations, we leverage recent advances in generative masked modeling and present MoRo: Masked Modeling for human motion Recovery under Occlusions. MoRo is an occlusion-robust, end-to-end generative framework that formulates motion reconstruction as a video-conditioned task, and efficiently recover human motion in a consistent global coordinate system from RGB videos. By masked modeling, MoRo naturally handles occlusions while enabling efficient, end-to-end inference. To overcome the scarcity of paired video-motion data, we design a cross-modality learning scheme that learns multi-modal priors from a set of heterogeneous datasets: (i) a trajectory-aware motion prior trained on MoCap datasets, (ii) an image-conditioned pose prior trained on image-pose datasets, capturing diverse per-frame poses, and (iii) a video-conditioned masked transformer that fuses motion and pose priors, finetuned on video-motion datasets to integrate visual cues with motion dynamics for robust inference. Extensive experiments on EgoBody and RICH demonstrate that MoRo substantially outperforms state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and motion realism under occlusions, while performing on-par in non-occluded scenarios. MoRo achieves real-time inference at 70 FPS on a single H200 GPU.

  Cross-modal artificial intelligence, represented by visual language models, has achieved significant success in general image understanding. However, a fundamental cognitive inconsistency exists between general visual representation and remote sensing image interpretation: remote sensing images couple topography, terrain, and spatial structure, thereby inherently requiring models to possess deep geoscientific understanding. This cognitive difference is further amplified in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery: while SAR possesses irreplaceable all-weather, all-day observation capabilities, it is constrained by coherent imaging mechanisms, exhibiting significant modal heterogeneity with general images. To address this inconsistency, we propose FUSAR-KLIP, the first knowledge-guided general multimodal foundational model for SAR, along with reusable data and evaluation baselines. Specifically: (1) FUSAR-GEOVL-1M (the first large-scale SAR dataset with complete geographic projection attributes) was constructed, covering multiple satellite platforms, 120,000 images, and 135 cities; (2) Aligned structured text was generated through hierarchical cognitive thought chains, accurately encoding more than 1 million multidimensional semantic information from geomorphological environment and regional attributes to spatial relationships; (3) A self-consistent iterative optimization mechanism was designed to guide cross-modal learning with this knowledge information consistent with human cognition and physical laws in a self-supervised closed loop consisting of contrast, matching, and reconstruction; (4) A unified evaluation benchmark was established in 11 typical downstream tasks in the two major categories of vision and language, and compared with 15 mainstream foundation models.

- **[ToonifyGB: StyleGAN-based Gaussian Blendshapes for 3D Stylized Head Avatars](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10072)**  `arXiv:2505.10072`  `cs.CV`  
  _Rui-Yang Ju, Sheng-Yen Huang, Yi-Ping Hung_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The introduction of 3D Gaussian blendshapes has enabled the real-time reconstruction of animatable head avatars from monocular video. Toonify, a StyleGAN-based method, has become widely used for facial image stylization. To extend Toonify for synthesizing diverse stylized 3D head avatars using Gaussian blendshapes, we propose an efficient two-stage framework, ToonifyGB. In Stage 1 (stylized video generation), we adopt an improved StyleGAN to generate the stylized video from the input video frames, which overcomes the limitation of cropping aligned faces at a fixed resolution as preprocessing for normal StyleGAN. This process provides a more stable stylized video, which enables Gaussian blendshapes to better capture the high-frequency details of the video frames, facilitating the synthesis of high-quality animations in the next stage. In Stage 2 (Gaussian blendshapes synthesis), our method learns a stylized neutral head model and a set of expression blendshapes from the generated stylized video. By combining the neutral head model with expression blendshapes, ToonifyGB can efficiently render stylized avatars with arbitrary expressions. We validate the effectiveness of ToonifyGB on benchmark datasets using two representative styles: Arcane and Pixar.

- **[Efficient Multi-scale Masked Autoencoders with Hybrid-Attention Mechanism for Breast Lesion Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07157)**  `arXiv:2503.07157`  `cs.CV`

  Self-supervised learning (SSL) with Vision Transformers (ViT) has shown immense potential in medical image analysis. However, the quadratic complexity ($\mathcal{O}(N^2)$) of standard self-attention poses a severe barrier for high-resolution biomedical tasks, effectively excluding resource-constrained research labs from utilizing state-of-the-art models. To address this computational bottleneck without sacrificing diagnostic accuracy, we propose \textbf{MIRAM}, a Multi-scale Masked Autoencoder that leverages a \textbf{hybrid-attention mechanism}.Our architecture uniquely decouples semantic learning from detail reconstruction using a dual-decoder design: a standard transformer decoder captures global semantics at low resolution, while a linear-complexity decoder (comparing Linformer, Performer, and Nyströmformer) handles the computationally expensive high-resolution reconstruction. This reduces the complexity of the upscaling stage from quadratic to linear ($\mathcal{O}(N)$), enabling high-fidelity training on consumer-grade GPUs. We validate our approach on the CBIS-DDSM mammography dataset. Remarkably, our \textbf{Nyströmformer-based variant} achieves a classification accuracy of \textbf{61.0\%}, outperforming both standard MAE (58.9\%) and MoCo-v3 (60.2\%) while requiring significantly less memory. These results demonstrate that hybrid-attention architectures can democratize high-resolution medical AI, making powerful SSL accessible to researchers with limited hardware resources.

  Artificial intelligence (AI) has undergone transformative advances since 2022, particularly through generative AI, large language models (LLMs), and diffusion models, fundamentally reshaping the creative industries. However, existing reviews have not comprehensively addressed these recent breakthroughs and their integrated impact across the creative production pipeline. This paper addresses this gap by providing a systematic review of AI technologies that have emerged or matured since our 2022 review, examining their applications across content creation, information analysis, post-production enhancement, compression, and quality assessment. We document how transformers, LLMs, diffusion models, and implicit neural representations have established new capabilities in text-to-image/video generation, real-time 3D reconstruction, and unified multi-task frameworks-shifting AI from support tool to core creative technology. Beyond technological advances, we analyze the trend toward unified AI frameworks that integrate multiple creative tasks, replacing task-specific solutions. We critically examine the evolving role of human-AI collaboration, where human oversight remains essential for creative direction and mitigating AI hallucinations. Finally, we identify emerging challenges including copyright concerns, bias mitigation, computational demands, and the need for robust regulatory frameworks. This review provides researchers and practitioners with a comprehensive understanding of current AI capabilities, limitations, and future trajectories in creative applications.
