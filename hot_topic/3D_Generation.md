- **[Two-Steps Diffusion Policy for Robotic Manipulation via Genetic Denoising](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21991)**  `arXiv:2510.21991`  `cs.RO` `cs.AI`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Diffusion models, such as diffusion policy, have achieved state-of-the-art results in robotic manipulation by imitating expert demonstrations. While diffusion models were originally developed for vision tasks like image and video generation, many of their inference strategies have been directly transferred to control domains without adaptation. In this work, we show that by tailoring the denoising process to the specific characteristics of embodied AI tasks -- particularly structured, low-dimensional nature of action distributions -- diffusion policies can operate effectively with as few as 5 neural function evaluations (NFE).Building on this insight, we propose a population-based sampling strategy, genetic denoising, which enhances both performance and stability by selecting denoising trajectories with low out-of-distribution risk. Our method solves challenging tasks with only 2 NFE while improving or matching performance. We evaluate our approach across 14 robotic manipulation tasks from D4RL and Robomimic, spanning multiple action horizons and inference budgets. In over 2 million evaluations, our method consistently outperforms standard diffusion-based policies, achieving up to 20\% performance gains with significantly fewer inference steps.

  Recent advancements in multi-agent systems have demonstrated significant potential for enhancing creative task performance, such as long video generation. This study introduces three innovations to improve multi-agent collaboration. First, we propose OmniAgent, a hierarchical, graph-based multi-agent framework for long video generation that leverages a film-production-inspired architecture to enable modular specialization and scalable inter-agent collaboration. Second, inspired by context engineering, we propose hypergraph nodes that enable temporary group discussions among agents lacking sufficient context, reducing individual memory requirements while ensuring adequate contextual information. Third, we transition from directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) to directed cyclic graphs with limited retries, allowing agents to reflect and refine outputs iteratively, thereby improving earlier stages through feedback from subsequent nodes. These contributions lay the groundwork for developing more robust multi-agent systems in creative tasks.

- **[CoMo: Compositional Motion Customization for Text-to-Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23007)**  `arXiv:2510.23007`  `cs.CV`  
  _Youcan Xu, Zhen Wang, Jiaxin Shi, Kexin Li, Feifei Shao, Jun Xiao, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  While recent text-to-video models excel at generating diverse scenes, they struggle with precise motion control, particularly for complex, multi-subject motions. Although methods for single-motion customization have been developed to address this gap, they fail in compositional scenarios due to two primary challenges: motion-appearance entanglement and ineffective multi-motion blending. This paper introduces CoMo, a novel framework for $\textbf{compositional motion customization}$ in text-to-video generation, enabling the synthesis of multiple, distinct motions within a single video. CoMo addresses these issues through a two-phase approach. First, in the single-motion learning phase, a static-dynamic decoupled tuning paradigm disentangles motion from appearance to learn a motion-specific module. Second, in the multi-motion composition phase, a plug-and-play divide-and-merge strategy composes these learned motions without additional training by spatially isolating their influence during the denoising process. To facilitate research in this new domain, we also introduce a new benchmark and a novel evaluation metric designed to assess multi-motion fidelity and blending. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CoMo achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly advancing the capabilities of controllable video generation. Our project page is atthis https URL.

- **[Scaling Up Occupancy-centric Driving Scene Generation: Dataset and Method](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22973)**  `arXiv:2510.22973`  `cs.CV`  
  _Bohan Li, Xin Jin, Hu Zhu, Hongsi Liu, Ruikai Li, Jiazhe Guo, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Driving scene generation is a critical domain for autonomous driving, enabling downstream applications, including perception and planning evaluation. Occupancy-centric methods have recently achieved state-of-the-art results by offering consistent conditioning across frames and modalities; however, their performance heavily depends on annotated occupancy data, which still remains scarce. To overcome this limitation, we curate Nuplan-Occ, the largest semantic occupancy dataset to date, constructed from the widely used Nuplan benchmark. Its scale and diversity facilitate not only large-scale generative modeling but also autonomous driving downstream applications. Based on this dataset, we develop a unified framework that jointly synthesizes high-quality semantic occupancy, multi-view videos, and LiDAR point clouds. Our approach incorporates a spatio-temporal disentangled architecture to support high-fidelity spatial expansion and temporal forecasting of 4D dynamic occupancy. To bridge modal gaps, we further propose two novel techniques: a Gaussian splatting-based sparse point map rendering strategy that enhances multi-view video generation, and a sensor-aware embedding strategy that explicitly models LiDAR sensor properties for realistic multi-LiDAR simulation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior generation fidelity and scalability compared to existing approaches, and validates its practical value in downstream tasks.

- **[MAGIC-Talk: Motion-aware Audio-Driven Talking Face Generation with Customizable Identity Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22810)**  `arXiv:2510.22810`  `cs.CV`  
  _Fatemeh Nazarieh, Zhenhua Feng, Diptesh Kanojia, Muhammad Awais, Josef Kittler_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Audio-driven talking face generation has gained significant attention for applications in digital media and virtual avatars. While recent methods improve audio-lip synchronization, they often struggle with temporal consistency, identity preservation, and customization, especially in long video generation. To address these issues, we propose MAGIC-Talk, a one-shot diffusion-based framework for customizable and temporally stable talking face generation. MAGIC-Talk consists of ReferenceNet, which preserves identity and enables fine-grained facial editing via text prompts, and AnimateNet, which enhances motion coherence using structured motion priors. Unlike previous methods requiring multiple reference images or fine-tuning, MAGIC-Talk maintains identity from a single image while ensuring smooth transitions across frames. Additionally, a progressive latent fusion strategy is introduced to improve long-form video quality by reducing motion inconsistencies and flickering. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MAGIC-Talk outperforms state-of-the-art methods in visual quality, identity preservation, and synchronization accuracy, offering a robust solution for talking face generation.

  Video generation is a critical pathway toward world models, with efficient long video inference as a key capability. Toward this end, we introduce LongCat-Video, a foundational video generation model with 13.6B parameters, delivering strong performance across multiple video generation tasks. It particularly excels in efficient and high-quality long video generation, representing our first step toward world models. Key features include: Unified architecture for multiple tasks: Built on the Diffusion Transformer (DiT) framework, LongCat-Video supports Text-to-Video, Image-to-Video, and Video-Continuation tasks with a single model; Long video generation: Pretraining on Video-Continuation tasks enables LongCat-Video to maintain high quality and temporal coherence in the generation of minutes-long videos; Efficient inference: LongCat-Video generates 720p, 30fps videos within minutes by employing a coarse-to-fine generation strategy along both the temporal and spatial axes. Block Sparse Attention further enhances efficiency, particularly at high resolutions; Strong performance with multi-reward RLHF: Multi-reward RLHF training enables LongCat-Video to achieve performance on par with the latest closed-source and leading open-source models. Code and model weights are publicly available to accelerate progress in the field.

- **[Integrating Reinforcement Learning with Visual Generative Models: Foundations and Advances](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10316)**  `arXiv:2508.10316`  `cs.CV`

  Generative models have made significant progress in synthesizing visual content, including images, videos, and 3D/4D structures. However, they are typically trained with surrogate objectives such as likelihood or reconstruction loss, which often misalign with perceptual quality, semantic accuracy, or physical realism. Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a principled framework for optimizing non-differentiable, preference-driven, and temporally structured objectives. Recent advances demonstrate its effectiveness in enhancing controllability, consistency, and human alignment across generative tasks. This survey provides a systematic overview of RL-based methods for visual content generation. We review the evolution of RL from classical control to its role as a general-purpose optimization tool, and examine its integration into image, video, and 3D/4D generation. Across these domains, RL serves not only as a fine-tuning mechanism but also as a structural component for aligning generation with complex, high-level goals. We conclude with open challenges and future research directions at the intersection of RL and generative modeling.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Diffusion transformers have emerged as the mainstream paradigm for video generation models. However, the use of up to billions of parameters incurs significant computational costs. Quantization offers a promising solution by reducing memory usage and accelerating inference. Nonetheless, we observe that the joint modeling of spatial and temporal information in video diffusion models (V-DMs) leads to extremely long token sequences, which introduces high calibration variance and learning challenges. To address these issues, we propose S$^2$Q-VDiT, a post-training quantization framework for V-DMs that leverages Salient data and Sparse token distillation. During the calibration phase, we identify that quantization performance is highly sensitive to the choice of calibration data. To mitigate this, we introduce \textit{Hessian-aware Salient Data Selection}, which constructs high-quality calibration datasets by considering both diffusion and quantization characteristics unique to V-DMs. To tackle the learning challenges, we further analyze the sparse attention patterns inherent in V-DMs. Based on this observation, we propose \textit{Attention-guided Sparse Token Distillation}, which exploits token-wise attention distributions to emphasize tokens that are more influential to the model's output. Under W4A6 quantization, S$^2$Q-VDiT achieves lossless performance while delivering $3.9\times$ model compression and $1.3\times$ inference acceleration. Code will be available atthis https URL.

- **[Identity-Preserving Text-to-Video Generation Guided by Simple yet Effective Spatial-Temporal Decoupled Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04705)**  `arXiv:2507.04705`  `cs.CV`  
  _Yuji Wang, Moran Li, Xiaobin Hu, Ran Yi, Jiangning Zhang, Han Feng, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Identity-preserving text-to-video (IPT2V) generation, which aims to create high-fidelity videos with consistent human identity, has become crucial for downstream applications. However, current end-to-end frameworks suffer a critical spatial-temporal trade-off: optimizing for spatially coherent layouts of key elements (e.g., character identity preservation) often compromises instruction-compliant temporal smoothness, while prioritizing dynamic realism risks disrupting the spatial coherence of visual structures. To tackle this issue, we propose a simple yet effective spatial-temporal decoupled framework that decomposes representations into spatial features for layouts and temporal features for motion dynamics. Specifically, our paper proposes a semantic prompt optimization mechanism and stage-wise decoupled generation paradigm. The former module decouples the prompt into spatial and temporal components. Aligned with the subsequent stage-wise decoupled approach, the spatial prompts guide the text-to-image (T2I) stage to generate coherent spatial features, while the temporal prompts direct the sequential image-to-video (I2V) stage to ensure motion consistency. Experimental results validate that our approach achieves excellent spatiotemporal consistency, demonstrating outstanding performance in identity preservation, text relevance, and video quality. By leveraging this simple yet robust mechanism, our algorithm secures the runner-up position in 2025 ACM MultiMedia Challenge. Our code is available atthis https URL.
