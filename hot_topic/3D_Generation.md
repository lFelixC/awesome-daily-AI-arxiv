- **[WorldGym: World Model as An Environment for Policy Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00613)**  `arXiv:2506.00613`  `cs.RO` `cs.AI`

  Evaluating robot control policies is difficult: real-world testing is costly, and handcrafted simulators require manual effort to improve in realism and generality. We propose a world-model-based policy evaluation environment (WorldGym), an autoregressive, action-conditioned video generation model which serves as a proxy to real world environments. Policies are evaluated via Monte Carlo rollouts in the world model, with a vision-language model providing rewards. We evaluate a set of VLA-based real-robot policies in the world model using only initial frames from real robots, and show that policy success rates within the world model highly correlate with real-world success rates. Moreoever, we show that WorldGym is able to preserve relative policy rankings across different policy versions, sizes, and training checkpoints. Due to requiring only a single start frame as input, the world model further enables efficient evaluation of robot policies' generalization ability on novel tasks and environments. We find that modern VLA-based robot policies still struggle to distinguish object shapes and can become distracted by adversarial facades of objects. While generating highly realistic object interaction remains challenging, WorldGym faithfully emulates robot motions and offers a practical starting point for safe and reproducible policy evaluation before deployment.

  Prompt-driven scene synthesis allows users to generate complete 3D environments from textual descriptions. Current text-to-scene methods often struggle with complex geometries and object transformations, and tend to show weak adherence to complex instructions. We address these limitations by introducing Reason-3D, a text-to-scene model powered by large reasoning models (LRMs). Reason-3D integrates object retrieval using captions covering physical, functional, and contextual attributes. Reason-3D then places the selected objects based on implicit and explicit layout constraints, and refines their positions with collision-aware spatial reasoning. Evaluated on instructions ranging from simple to complex indoor configurations, Reason-3D significantly outperforms previous methods in human-rated visual fidelity, adherence to constraints, and asset retrieval quality. Beyond its contribution to the field of text-to-scene generation, our work showcases the advanced spatial reasoning abilities of modern LRMs. Additionally, we release the codebase to further the research in object retrieval and placement with LRMs.

- **[Scaling RL to Long Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07966)**  `arXiv:2507.07966`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI` `cs.CL`  
  _Yukang Chen, Wei Huang, Baifeng Shi, Qinghao Hu, Hanrong Ye, Ligeng Zhu, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce a full-stack framework that scales up reasoning in vision-language models (VLMs) to long videos, leveraging reinforcement learning. We address the unique challenges of long video reasoning by integrating three critical components: (1) a large-scale dataset, LongVideo-Reason, comprising 104K long video QA pairs with high-quality reasoning annotations across diverse domains such as sports, games, and vlogs; (2) a two-stage training pipeline that extends VLMs with chain-of-thought supervised fine-tuning (CoT-SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL); and (3) a training infrastructure for long video RL, named Multi-modal Reinforcement Sequence Parallelism (MR-SP), which incorporates sequence parallelism and a vLLM-based engine tailored for long video, using cached video embeddings for efficient rollout and prefilling. In our experiments, LongVILA-R1-7B achieves strong performance on video benchmarks, reaching 65.1% and 71.1% accuracy on VideoMME without and with subtitles, respectively, and consistently outperforming LongVILA-7B across multiple benchmarks. Moreover, LongVILA-R1-7B supports processing up to 8,192 video frames per video, and configurable FPS settings. Notably, our MR-SP system achieves up to 2.1x speedup on long video RL training. In addition, we release our training system for public availability that supports RL training on various modalities (video, text, and audio), various models (VILA and Qwen series), and even image and video generation models. On a single A100 node (8 GPUs), it supports RL training on hour-long videos (e.g., 3,600 frames).

- **[HumanVideo-MME: Benchmarking MLLMs for Human-Centric Video Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04909)**  `arXiv:2507.04909`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`  
  _Yuxuan Cai, Jiangning Zhang, Zhenye Gan, Qingdong He, Xiaobin Hu, Junwei Zhu, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant advances in visual understanding tasks involving both images and videos. However, their capacity to comprehend human-centric video data remains underexplored, primarily due to the absence of comprehensive and high-quality evaluation benchmarks. Existing human-centric benchmarks predominantly emphasize video generation quality and action recognition, while overlooking essential perceptual and cognitive abilities required in human-centered scenarios. Furthermore, they are often limited by single-question paradigms and overly simplistic evaluation metrics. To address above limitations, we propose a modern HV-MMBench, a rigorously curated benchmark designed to provide a more holistic evaluation of MLLMs in human-centric video understanding. Compared to existing human-centric video benchmarks, our work offers the following key features: (1) Diverse evaluation dimensions: HV-MMBench encompasses 13 tasks, ranging from basic attribute perception (e.g., age estimation, emotion recognition) to advanced cognitive reasoning (e.g., social relationship prediction, intention prediction), enabling comprehensive assessment of model capabilities; (2) Varied data types: The benchmark includes multiple-choice, fill-in-blank, true/false, and open-ended question formats, combined with diverse evaluation metrics, to more accurately and robustly reflect model performance; (3) Multi-domain video coverage: The benchmark spans 50 distinct visual scenarios, enabling comprehensive evaluation across fine-grained scene variations; (4) Temporal coverage: The benchmark covers videos from short-term (10 seconds) to long-term (up to 30min) durations, supporting systematic analysis of models temporal reasoning abilities across diverse contextual lengths.

- **[Stable Cinemetrics : Structured Taxonomy and Evaluation for Professional Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26555)**  `arXiv:2509.26555`  `cs.CV`  
  _Agneet Chatterjee, Rahim Entezari, Maksym Zhuravinskyi, Maksim Lapin, Reshinth Adithyan, Amit Raj, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in video generation have enabled high-fidelity video synthesis from user provided prompts. However, existing models and benchmarks fail to capture the complexity and requirements of professional video generation. Towards that goal, we introduce Stable Cinemetrics, a structured evaluation framework that formalizes filmmaking controls into four disentangled, hierarchical taxonomies: Setup, Event, Lighting, and Camera. Together, these taxonomies define 76 fine-grained control nodes grounded in industry practices. Using these taxonomies, we construct a benchmark of prompts aligned with professional use cases and develop an automated pipeline for prompt categorization and question generation, enabling independent evaluation of each control dimension. We conduct a large-scale human study spanning 10+ models and 20K videos, annotated by a pool of 80+ film professionals. Our analysis, both coarse and fine-grained reveal that even the strongest current models exhibit significant gaps, particularly in Events and Camera-related controls. To enable scalable evaluation, we train an automatic evaluator, a vision-language model aligned with expert annotations that outperforms existing zero-shot baselines. SCINE is the first approach to situate professional video generation within the landscape of video generative models, introducing taxonomies centered around cinematic controls and supporting them with structured evaluation pipelines and detailed analyses to guide future research.

- **[MotionRAG: Motion Retrieval-Augmented Image-to-Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26391)**  `arXiv:2509.26391`  `cs.CV`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Image-to-video generation has made remarkable progress with the advancements in diffusion models, yet generating videos with realistic motion remains highly challenging. This difficulty arises from the complexity of accurately modeling motion, which involves capturing physical constraints, object interactions, and domain-specific dynamics that are not easily generalized across diverse scenarios. To address this, we propose MotionRAG, a retrieval-augmented framework that enhances motion realism by adapting motion priors from relevant reference videos through Context-Aware Motion Adaptation (CAMA). The key technical innovations include: (i) a retrieval-based pipeline extracting high-level motion features using video encoder and specialized resamplers to distill semantic motion representations; (ii) an in-context learning approach for motion adaptation implemented through a causal transformer architecture; (iii) an attention-based motion injection adapter that seamlessly integrates transferred motion features into pretrained video diffusion models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves significant improvements across multiple domains and various base models, all with negligible computational overhead during inference. Furthermore, our modular design enables zero-shot generalization to new domains by simply updating the retrieval database without retraining any components. This research enhances the core capability of video generation systems by enabling the effective retrieval and transfer of motion priors, facilitating the synthesis of realistic motion dynamics.

- **[PatchVSR: Breaking Video Diffusion Resolution Limits with Patch-wise Video Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26025)**  `arXiv:2509.26025`  `cs.CV`  
  _Shian Du, Menghan Xia, Chang Liu, Xintao Wang, Jing Wang, Pengfei Wan, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Pre-trained video generation models hold great potential for generative video super-resolution (VSR). However, adapting them for full-size VSR, as most existing methods do, suffers from unnecessary intensive full-attention computation and fixed output resolution. To overcome these limitations, we make the first exploration into utilizing video diffusion priors for patch-wise VSR. This is non-trivial because pre-trained video diffusion models are not native for patch-level detail generation. To mitigate this challenge, we propose an innovative approach, called PatchVSR, which integrates a dual-stream adapter for conditional guidance. The patch branch extracts features from input patches to maintain content fidelity while the global branch extracts context features from the resized full video to bridge the generation gap caused by incomplete semantics of patches. Particularly, we also inject the patch's location information into the model to better contextualize patch synthesis within the global video frame. Experiments demonstrate that our method can synthesize high-fidelity, high-resolution details at the patch level. A tailor-made multi-patch joint modulation is proposed to ensure visual consistency across individually enhanced patches. Due to the flexibility of our patch-based paradigm, we can achieve highly competitive 4K VSR based on a 512x512 resolution base model, with extremely high efficiency.

- **[Wan-Alpha: High-Quality Text-to-Video Generation with Alpha Channel](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24979)**  `arXiv:2509.24979`  `cs.CV`  
  _Haotian Dong, Wenjing Wang, Chen Li, Di Lin_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  RGBA video generation, which includes an alpha channel to represent transparency, is gaining increasing attention across a wide range of applications. However, existing methods often neglect visual quality, limiting their practical usability. In this paper, we propose Wan-Alpha, a new framework that generates transparent videos by learning both RGB and alpha channels jointly. We design an effective variational autoencoder (VAE) that encodes the alpha channel into the RGB latent space. Then, to support the training of our diffusion transformer, we construct a high-quality and diverse RGBA video dataset. Compared with state-of-the-art methods, our model demonstrates superior performance in visual quality, motion realism, and transparency rendering. Notably, our model can generate a wide variety of semi-transparent objects, glowing effects, and fine-grained details such as hair strands. The released model is available on our website:this https URL.

- **[QuantSparse: Comprehensively Compressing Video Diffusion Transformer with Model Quantization and Attention Sparsification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23681)**  `arXiv:2509.23681`  `cs.CV`  
  _Weilun Feng, Chuanguang Yang, Haotong Qin, Mingqiang Wu, Yuqi Li, Xiangqi Li, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Diffusion transformers exhibit remarkable video generation capability, yet their prohibitive computational and memory costs hinder practical deployment. Model quantization and attention sparsification are two promising directions for compression, but each alone suffers severe performance degradation under aggressive compression. Combining them promises compounded efficiency gains, but naive integration is ineffective. The sparsity-induced information loss exacerbates quantization noise, leading to amplified attention shifts. To address this, we propose \textbf{QuantSparse}, a unified framework that integrates model quantization with attention sparsification. Specifically, we introduce \textit{Multi-Scale Salient Attention Distillation}, which leverages both global structural guidance and local salient supervision to mitigate quantization-induced bias. In addition, we develop \textit{Second-Order Sparse Attention Reparameterization}, which exploits the temporal stability of second-order residuals to efficiently recover information lost under sparsity. Experiments on HunyuanVideo-13B demonstrate that QuantSparse achieves 20.88 PSNR, substantially outperforming the state-of-the-art quantization baseline Q-VDiT (16.85 PSNR), while simultaneously delivering a \textbf{3.68$\times$} reduction in storage and \textbf{1.88$\times$} acceleration in end-to-end inference. Our code will be released inthis https URL.

- **[MoWM: Mixture-of-World-Models for Embodied Planning via Latent-to-Pixel Feature Modulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21797)**  `arXiv:2509.21797`  `cs.CV`  
  _Yu Shang, Yangcheng Yu, Xin Zhang, Xin Jin, Haisheng Su, Wei Wu, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Embodied action planning is a core challenge in robotics, requiring models to generate precise actions from visual observations and language instructions. While video generation world models are promising, their reliance on pixel-level reconstruction often introduces visual redundancies that hinder action decoding and generalization. Latent world models offer a compact, motion-aware representation, but overlook the fine-grained details critical for precise manipulation. To overcome these limitations, we propose MoWM, a mixture-of-world-model framework that fuses representations from hybrid world models for embodied action planning. Our approach uses motion-aware representations from a latent model as a high-level prior, which guides the extraction of fine-grained visual features from the pixel space model. This design allows MoWM to highlight the informative visual details needed for action decoding. Extensive evaluations on the CALVIN benchmark demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art task success rates and superior generalization. We also provide a comprehensive analysis of the strengths of each feature space, offering valuable insights for future research in embodied planning. The code is available at:this https URL.
