  Recent advances in foundation models highlight a clear trend toward unification and scaling, showing emergent capabilities across diverse domains. While image generation and editing have rapidly transitioned from task-specific to unified frameworks, video generation and editing remain fragmented due to architectural limitations and data scarcity. In this work, we introduce EditVerse, a unified framework for image and video generation and editing within a single model. By representing all modalities, i.e., text, image, and video, as a unified token sequence, EditVerse leverages self-attention to achieve robust in-context learning, natural cross-modal knowledge transfer, and flexible handling of inputs and outputs with arbitrary resolutions and durations. To address the lack of video editing training data, we design a scalable data pipeline that curates 232K video editing samples and combines them with large-scale image and video datasets for joint training. Furthermore, we present EditVerseBench, the first benchmark for instruction-based video editing covering diverse tasks and resolutions. Extensive experiments and user studies demonstrate that EditVerse achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing existing open-source and commercial models, while exhibiting emergent editing and generation abilities across modalities.

  Existing video generation models excel at producing photo-realistic videos from text or images, but often lack physical plausibility and 3D controllability. To overcome these limitations, we introduce PhysCtrl, a novel framework for physics-grounded image-to-video generation with physical parameters and force control. At its core is a generative physics network that learns the distribution of physical dynamics across four materials (elastic, sand, plasticine, and rigid) via a diffusion model conditioned on physics parameters and applied forces. We represent physical dynamics as 3D point trajectories and train on a large-scale synthetic dataset of 550K animations generated by physics simulators. We enhance the diffusion model with a novel spatiotemporal attention block that emulates particle interactions and incorporates physics-based constraints during training to enforce physical plausibility. Experiments show that PhysCtrl generates realistic, physics-grounded motion trajectories which, when used to drive image-to-video models, yield high-fidelity, controllable videos that outperform existing methods in both visual quality and physical plausibility.

- **[4D Driving Scene Generation With Stereo Forcing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20251)**  `arXiv:2509.20251`  `cs.CV`

  Current generative models struggle to synthesize dynamic 4D driving scenes that simultaneously support temporal extrapolation and spatial novel view synthesis (NVS) without per-scene optimization. Bridging generation and novel view synthesis remains a major challenge. We present PhiGenesis, a unified framework for 4D scene generation that extends video generation techniques with geometric and temporal consistency. Given multi-view image sequences and camera parameters, PhiGenesis produces temporally continuous 4D Gaussian splatting representations along target 3D trajectories. In its first stage, PhiGenesis leverages a pre-trained video VAE with a novel range-view adapter to enable feed-forward 4D reconstruction from multi-view images. This architecture supports single-frame or video inputs and outputs complete 4D scenes including geometry, semantics, and motion. In the second stage, PhiGenesis introduces a geometric-guided video diffusion model, using rendered historical 4D scenes as priors to generate future views conditioned on trajectories. To address geometric exposure bias in novel views, we propose Stereo Forcing, a novel conditioning strategy that integrates geometric uncertainty during denoising. This method enhances temporal coherence by dynamically adjusting generative influence based on uncertainty-aware perturbations. Our experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both appearance and geometric reconstruction, temporal generation and novel view synthesis (NVS) tasks, while simultaneously delivering competitive performance in downstream evaluations.

- **[CamPVG: Camera-Controlled Panoramic Video Generation with Epipolar-Aware Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19979)**  `arXiv:2509.19979`  `cs.CV`

  Recently, camera-controlled video generation has seen rapid development, offering more precise control over video generation. However, existing methods predominantly focus on camera control in perspective projection video generation, while geometrically consistent panoramic video generation remains challenging. This limitation is primarily due to the inherent complexities in panoramic pose representation and spherical projection. To address this issue, we propose CamPVG, the first diffusion-based framework for panoramic video generation guided by precise camera poses. We achieve camera position encoding for panoramic images and cross-view feature aggregation based on spherical projection. Specifically, we propose a panoramic Pl√ºcker embedding that encodes camera extrinsic parameters through spherical coordinate transformation. This pose encoder effectively captures panoramic geometry, overcoming the limitations of traditional methods when applied to equirectangular projections. Additionally, we introduce a spherical epipolar module that enforces geometric constraints through adaptive attention masking along epipolar lines. This module enables fine-grained cross-view feature aggregation, substantially enhancing the quality and consistency of generated panoramic videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method generates high-quality panoramic videos consistent with camera trajectories, far surpassing existing methods in panoramic video generation.

- **[OmniWorld: A Multi-Domain and Multi-Modal Dataset for 4D World Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12201)**  `arXiv:2509.12201`  `cs.CV`

  The field of 4D world modeling - aiming to jointly capture spatial geometry and temporal dynamics - has witnessed remarkable progress in recent years, driven by advances in large-scale generative models and multimodal learning. However, the development of truly general 4D world models remains fundamentally constrained by the availability of high-quality data. Existing datasets and benchmarks often lack the dynamic complexity, multi-domain diversity, and spatial-temporal annotations required to support key tasks such as 4D geometric reconstruction, future prediction, and camera-control video generation. To address this gap, we introduce OmniWorld, a large-scale, multi-domain, multi-modal dataset specifically designed for 4D world modeling. OmniWorld consists of a newly collected OmniWorld-Game dataset and several curated public datasets spanning diverse domains. Compared with existing synthetic datasets, OmniWorld-Game provides richer modality coverage, larger scale, and more realistic dynamic interactions. Based on this dataset, we establish a challenging benchmark that exposes the limitations of current state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches in modeling complex 4D environments. Moreover, fine-tuning existing SOTA methods on OmniWorld leads to significant performance gains across 4D reconstruction and video generation tasks, strongly validating OmniWorld as a powerful resource for training and evaluation. We envision OmniWorld as a catalyst for accelerating the development of general-purpose 4D world models, ultimately advancing machines' holistic understanding of the physical world.

- **[Sparse VideoGen2: Accelerate Video Generation with Sparse Attention via Semantic-Aware Permutation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18875)**  `arXiv:2505.18875`  `cs.CV`

  Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) are essential for video generation but suffer from significant latency due to the quadratic complexity of attention. By computing only critical tokens, sparse attention reduces computational costs and offers a promising acceleration approach. However, we identify that existing methods fail to approach optimal generation quality under the same computation budget for two reasons: (1) Inaccurate critical token identification: current methods cluster tokens based on position rather than semantics, leading to imprecise aggregated representations. (2) Excessive computation waste: critical tokens are scattered among non-critical ones, leading to wasted computation on GPUs, which are optimized for processing contiguous tokens. In this paper, we propose SVG2, a training-free framework that maximizes identification accuracy and minimizes computation waste, achieving a Pareto frontier trade-off between generation quality and efficiency. The core of SVG2 is semantic-aware permutation, which clusters and reorders tokens based on semantic similarity using k-means. This approach ensures both a precise cluster representation, improving identification accuracy, and a densified layout of critical tokens, enabling efficient computation without padding. Additionally, SVG2 integrates top-p dynamic budget control and customized kernel implementations, achieving up to 2.30x and 1.89x speedup while maintaining a PSNR of up to 30 and 26 on HunyuanVideo and Wan 2.1, respectively.

  Current video diffusion models achieve impressive generation quality but struggle in interactive applications due to bidirectional attention dependencies. The generation of a single frame requires the model to process the entire sequence, including the future. We address this limitation by adapting a pretrained bidirectional diffusion transformer to an autoregressive transformer that generates frames on-the-fly. To further reduce latency, we extend distribution matching distillation (DMD) to videos, distilling 50-step diffusion model into a 4-step generator. To enable stable and high-quality distillation, we introduce a student initialization scheme based on teacher's ODE trajectories, as well as an asymmetric distillation strategy that supervises a causal student model with a bidirectional teacher. This approach effectively mitigates error accumulation in autoregressive generation, allowing long-duration video synthesis despite training on short clips. Our model achieves a total score of 84.27 on the VBench-Long benchmark, surpassing all previous video generation models. It enables fast streaming generation of high-quality videos at 9.4 FPS on a single GPU thanks to KV caching. Our approach also enables streaming video-to-video translation, image-to-video, and dynamic prompting in a zero-shot manner.

  Text-driven 3D indoor scene generation is useful for gaming, the film industry, and AR/VR applications. However, existing methods cannot faithfully capture the room layout, nor do they allow flexible editing of individual objects in the room. To address these problems, we present Ctrl-Room, which can generate convincing 3D rooms with designer-style layouts and high-fidelity textures from just a text prompt. Moreover, Ctrl-Room enables versatile interactive editing operations such as resizing or moving individual furniture items. Our key insight is to separate the modeling of layouts and appearance. Our proposed method consists of two stages: a Layout Generation Stage and an Appearance Generation Stage. The Layout Generation Stage trains a text-conditional diffusion model to learn the layout distribution with our holistic scene code parameterization. Next, the Appearance Generation Stage employs a fine-tuned ControlNet to produce a vivid panoramic image of the room guided by the 3D scene layout and text prompt. We thus achieve a high-quality 3D room generation with convincing layouts and lively textures. Benefiting from the scene code parameterization, we can easily edit the generated room model through our mask-guided editing module, without expensive edit-specific training. Extensive experiments on the Structured3D dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms existing methods in producing more reasonable, view-consistent, and editable 3D rooms from natural language prompts.
