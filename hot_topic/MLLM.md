  Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have driven rapid progress in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models for robotic manipulation. Although effective in many scenarios, current approaches largely rely on explicit instructions, whereas in real-world interactions, humans rarely issue instructions directly. Effective collaboration requires robots to infer user intentions proactively. In this work, we introduce cross-modal contextual instructions, a new setting where intent is derived from spoken dialogue, environmental sounds, and visual cues rather than explicit commands. To address this new setting, we present RoboOmni, a Perceiver-Thinker-Talker-Executor framework based on end-to-end omni-modal LLMs that unifies intention recognition, interaction confirmation, and action execution. RoboOmni fuses auditory and visual signals spatiotemporally for robust intention recognition, while supporting direct speech interaction. To address the absence of training data for proactive intention recognition in robotic manipulation, we build OmniAction, comprising 140k episodes, 5k+ speakers, 2.4k event sounds, 640 backgrounds, and six contextual instruction types. Experiments in simulation and real-world settings show that RoboOmni surpasses text- and ASR-based baselines in success rate, inference speed, intention recognition, and proactive assistance.

  _Zecheng Yin, Hao Zhao, Zhen Li_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Objective-oriented navigation(ObjNav) enables robot to navigate to target object directly and autonomously in an unknown environment. Effective perception in navigation in unknown environment is critical for autonomous robots. While egocentric observations from RGB-D sensors provide abundant local information, real-time top-down maps offer valuable global context for ObjNav. Nevertheless, the majority of existing studies focus on a single source, seldom integrating these two complementary perceptual modalities, despite the fact that humans naturally attend to both. With the rapid advancement of Vision-Language Models(VLMs), we propose Hybrid Perception Navigation (HyPerNav), leveraging VLMs' strong reasoning and vision-language understanding capabilities to jointly perceive both local and global information to enhance the effectiveness and intelligence of navigation in unknown environments. In both massive simulation evaluation and real-world validation, our methods achieved state-of-the-art performance against popular baselines. Benefiting from hybrid perception approach, our method captures richer cues and finds the objects more effectively, by simultaneously leveraging information understanding from egocentric observations and the top-down map. Our ablation study further proved that either of the hybrid perception contributes to the navigation performance.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  End-to-end autonomous driving has emerged as a promising paradigm for achieving robust and intelligent driving policies. However, existing end-to-end methods still face significant challenges, such as suboptimal decision-making in complex scenarios. In this paper,we propose SimpleVSF (Simple VLM-Scoring Fusion), a novel framework that enhances end-to-end planning by leveraging the cognitive capabilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and advanced trajectory fusion techniques. We utilize the conventional scorers and the novel VLM-enhanced scorers. And we leverage a robust weight fusioner for quantitative aggregation and a powerful VLM-based fusioner for qualitative, context-aware decision-making. As the leading approach in the ICCV 2025 NAVSIM v2 End-to-End Driving Challenge, our SimpleVSF framework demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, achieving a superior balance between safety, comfort, and efficiency.

  _Alex Zook, Fan-Yun Sun, Josef Spjut, Valts Blukis, Stan Birchfield, Jonathan Tremblay_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce GRS (Generating Robotic Simulation tasks), a system addressing real-to-sim for robotic simulations. GRS creates digital twin simulations from single RGB-D observations with solvable tasks for virtual agent training. Using vision-language models (VLMs), our pipeline operates in three stages: 1) scene comprehension with SAM2 for segmentation and object description, 2) matching objects with simulation-ready assets, and 3) generating appropriate tasks. We ensure simulation-task alignment through generated test suites and introduce a router that iteratively refines both simulation and test code. Experiments demonstrate our system's effectiveness in object correspondence and task environment generation through our novel router mechanism.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has marked a significant breakthrough in Artificial Intelligence (AI), ushering in a new era of Human-centered Artificial Intelligence (HAI). HAI aims to better serve human welfare and needs, thereby placing higher demands on the intelligence level of robots, particularly in aspects such as natural language interaction, complex task planning, and execution. Intelligent agents powered by LLMs have opened up new pathways for realizing HAI. However, existing LLM-based embodied agents often lack the ability to plan and execute complex natural language control tasks online. This paper explores the implementation of intelligent robotic manipulating agents based on Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in the physical world. We propose a novel embodied agent framework for robots, which comprises a human-robot voice interaction module, a vision-language agent module and an action execution module. The vision-language agent itself includes a vision-based task planner, a natural language instruction converter, and a task performance feedback evaluator. Experimental results demonstrate that our agent achieves a 28\% higher average task success rate in both simulated and real environments compared to approaches relying solely on LLM+CLIP, significantly improving the execution success rate of high-level natural language instruction tasks.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In-context learning (ICL) enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to learn tasks from demonstration examples without parameter updates. Although it has been extensively studied in LLMs, its effectiveness in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) remains underexplored. In this work, we present a systematic study of ICL in VLMs, evaluating seven models spanning four architectures on three image captioning benchmarks. We analyze how prompt design, architectural choices, and training strategies influence multimodal ICL. To our knowledge, we are the first to analyze how attention patterns in VLMs vary with an increasing number of in-context demonstrations. Our results reveal that training on imag-text interleaved data enhances ICL performance but does not imply effective integration of visual and textual information from demonstration examples. In contrast, instruction tuning improves instruction-following but can reduce reliance on in-context demonstrations, suggesting a trade-off between instruction alignment and in-context adaptation. Attention analyses further show that current VLMs primarily focus on textual cues and fail to leverage visual information, suggesting a limited capacity for multimodal integration. These findings highlight key limitations in the ICL abilities of current VLMs and provide insights for enhancing their ability to learn from multimodal in-context examples.

  The surge of audiovisual content on streaming platforms and social media has heightened the demand for accurate and accessible subtitles. However, existing subtitle generation methods primarily speech-based transcription or OCR-based extraction suffer from several shortcomings, including poor synchronization, incorrect or harmful text, inconsistent formatting, inappropriate reading speeds, and the inability to adapt to dynamic audio-visual contexts. Current approaches often address isolated issues, leaving post-editing as a labor-intensive and time-consuming process. In this paper, we introduce V-SAT (Video Subtitle Annotation Tool), a unified framework that automatically detects and corrects a wide range of subtitle quality issues. By combining Large Language Models(LLMs), Vision-Language Models (VLMs), Image Processing, and Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), V-SAT leverages contextual cues from both audio and video. Subtitle quality improved, with the SUBER score reduced from 9.6 to 3.54 after resolving all language mode issues and F1-scores of ~0.80 for image mode issues. Human-in-the-loop validation ensures high-quality results, providing the first comprehensive solution for robust subtitle annotation.

- **[Discrete Diffusion VLA: Bringing Discrete Diffusion to Action Decoding in Vision-Language-Action Policies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20072)**  `arXiv:2508.20072`  `cs.CV` `cs.LG` `cs.RO`  
  _Zhixuan Liang, Yizhuo Li, Tianshuo Yang, Chengyue Wu, Sitong Mao, Tian Nian, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models adapt large vision-language backbones to map images and instructions into robot actions. However, prevailing VLAs either generate actions auto-regressively in a fixed left-to-right order or attach separate MLP or diffusion heads outside the backbone, leading to fragmented information pathways and specialized training requirements that hinder a unified, scalable architecture. We present Discrete Diffusion VLA, a unified-transformer policy that models discretized action chunks with discrete diffusion. The design retains diffusion's progressive refinement paradigm while remaining natively compatible with the discrete token interface of VLMs. Our method achieves an adaptive decoding order that resolves easy action elements before harder ones and uses secondary re-masking to revisit uncertain predictions across refinement rounds, which improves consistency and enables robust error correction. This unified decoder preserves pre-trained vision-language priors, supports parallel decoding, breaks the autoregressive bottleneck, and reduces the number of function evaluations. Discrete Diffusion VLA achieves 96.3% avg. success rates on LIBERO, 71.2% visual matching on SimplerEnv-Fractal and 54.2% overall on SimplerEnv-Bridge, improving over autoregressive, MLP decoder and continuous diffusion baselines. These findings indicate that discrete-diffusion VLA supports precise action modeling and consistent training, laying groundwork for scaling VLA to larger models and datasets.

- **[CAUSAL3D: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Causal Learning from Visual Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04852)**  `arXiv:2503.04852`  `cs.CV` `cs.LG`  
  _Disheng Liu, Yiran Qiao, Wuche Liu, Yiren Lu, Yunlai Zhou, Tuo Liang, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  True intelligence hinges on the ability to uncover and leverage hidden causal relations. Despite significant progress in AI and computer vision (CV), there remains a lack of benchmarks for assessing models' abilities to infer latent causality from complex visual data. In this paper, we introduce \textsc{\textbf{Causal3D}}, a novel and comprehensive benchmark that integrates structured data (tables) with corresponding visual representations (images) to evaluate causal reasoning. Designed within a systematic framework, Causal3D comprises 19 3D-scene datasets capturing diverse causal relations, views, and backgrounds, enabling evaluations across scenes of varying complexity. We assess multiple state-of-the-art methods, including classical causal discovery, causal representation learning, and large/vision-language models (LLMs/VLMs). Our experiments show that as causal structures grow more complex without prior knowledge, performance declines significantly, highlighting the challenges even advanced methods face in complex causal scenarios. Causal3D serves as a vital resource for advancing causal reasoning in CV and fostering trustworthy AI in critical domains.

- **[Latent Sketchpad: Sketching Visual Thoughts to Elicit Multimodal Reasoning in MLLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24514)**  `arXiv:2510.24514`  `cs.CV` `cs.CL`  
  _Huanyu Zhang, Wenshan Wu, Chengzu Li, Ning Shang, Yan Xia, Yangyu Huang, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at visual understanding, they often struggle in complex scenarios that require visual planning and imagination. Inspired by how humans use sketching as a form of visual thinking to develop and communicate ideas, we introduce Latent Sketchpad, a framework that equips MLLMs with an internal visual scratchpad. The internal visual representations of MLLMs have traditionally been confined to perceptual understanding. We repurpose them to support generative visual thought without compromising reasoning ability. Building on frontier MLLMs, our approach integrates visual generation directly into their native autoregressive reasoning process. It allows the model to interleave textual reasoning with the generation of visual latents. These latents guide the internal thought process and can be translated into sketch images for interpretability. To realize this, we introduce two components: a Context-Aware Vision Head autoregressively produces visual representations, and a pretrained Sketch Decoder renders these into human-interpretable images. We evaluate the framework on our new dataset MazePlanning. Experiments across various MLLMs show that Latent Sketchpad delivers comparable or even superior reasoning performance to their backbone. It further generalizes across distinct frontier MLLMs, including Gemma3 and Qwen2.5-VL. By extending model's textual reasoning to visual thinking, our framework opens new opportunities for richer human-computer interaction and broader applications.

- **[Video-SafetyBench: A Benchmark for Safety Evaluation of Video LVLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11842)**  `arXiv:2505.11842`  `cs.CV` `cs.CL`  
  _Xuannan Liu, Zekun Li, Zheqi He, Peipei Li, Shuhan Xia, Xing Cui, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The increasing deployment of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) raises safety concerns under potential malicious inputs. However, existing multimodal safety evaluations primarily focus on model vulnerabilities exposed by static image inputs, ignoring the temporal dynamics of video that may induce distinct safety risks. To bridge this gap, we introduce Video-SafetyBench, the first comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the safety of LVLMs under video-text attacks. It comprises 2,264 video-text pairs spanning 48 fine-grained unsafe categories, each pairing a synthesized video with either a harmful query, which contains explicit malice, or a benign query, which appears harmless but triggers harmful behavior when interpreted alongside the video. To generate semantically accurate videos for safety evaluation, we design a controllable pipeline that decomposes video semantics into subject images (what is shown) and motion text (how it moves), which jointly guide the synthesis of query-relevant videos. To effectively evaluate uncertain or borderline harmful outputs, we propose RJScore, a novel LLM-based metric that incorporates the confidence of judge models and human-aligned decision threshold calibration. Extensive experiments show that benign-query video composition achieves average attack success rates of 67.2%, revealing consistent vulnerabilities to video-induced attacks. We believe Video-SafetyBench will catalyze future research into video-based safety evaluation and defense strategies.

- **[ViPER: Empowering the Self-Evolution of Visual Perception Abilities in Vision-Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24285)**  `arXiv:2510.24285`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI` `cs.CL`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The limited capacity for fine-grained visual perception presents a critical bottleneck for Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in real-world applications. Addressing this is challenging due to the scarcity of high-quality data and the limitations of existing methods: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) often compromises general capabilities, while reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) prioritizes textual reasoning over visual perception. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel two-stage task that structures visual perception learning as a coarse-to-fine progressive process. Based on this task formulation, we develop ViPER, a self-bootstrapping framework specifically designed to enable iterative evolution through self-critiquing and self-prediction. By synergistically integrating image-level and instance-level reconstruction with a two-stage reinforcement learning strategy, ViPER establishes a closed-loop training paradigm, where internally synthesized data directly fuel the enhancement of perceptual ability. Applied to the Qwen2.5-VL family, ViPER produces the Qwen-Viper series. With an average gain of 1.7% on seven comprehensive benchmarks spanning various tasks and up to 6.0% on fine-grained perception, Qwen-Viper consistently demonstrates superior performance across different vision-language scenarios while maintaining generalizability. Beyond enabling self-improvement in perceptual capabilities, ViPER provides concrete evidence for the reciprocal relationship between generation and understanding, a breakthrough to developing more autonomous and capable VLMs.

- **[Seeing Symbols, Missing Cultures: Probing Vision-Language Models' Reasoning on Fire Imagery and Cultural Meaning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23311)**  `arXiv:2509.23311`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI` `cs.CL`  
  _Haorui Yu, Yang Zhao, Yijia Chu, Qiufeng Yi_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision-Language Models (VLMs) often appear culturally competent but rely on superficial pattern matching rather than genuine cultural understanding. We introduce a diagnostic framework to probe VLM reasoning on fire-themed cultural imagery through both classification and explanation analysis. Testing multiple models on Western festivals, non-Western traditions, and emergency scenes reveals systematic biases: models correctly identify prominent Western festivals but struggle with underrepresented cultural events, frequently offering vague labels or dangerously misclassifying emergencies as celebrations. These failures expose the risks of symbolic shortcuts and highlight the need for cultural evaluation beyond accuracy metrics to ensure interpretable and fair multimodal systems.

  Navigating towards fully open language goals and exploring open scenes in an intelligent way have always raised significant challenges. Recently, Vision Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities to reason with both language and visual data. Although many works have focused on leveraging VLMs for navigation in open scenes, they often require high computational cost, rely on object-centric approaches, or depend on environmental priors in detailed human instructions. We introduce Navigation with VLM (NavVLM), a training-free framework that harnesses open-source VLMs to enable robots to navigate effectively, even for human-friendly language goal such as abstract places, actions, or specific objects in open scenes. NavVLM leverages the VLM as its cognitive core to perceive environmental information and constantly provides exploration guidance achieving intelligent navigation with only a neat target rather than a detailed instruction with environment prior. We evaluated and validated NavVLM in both simulation and real-world experiments. In simulation, our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance in Success weighted by Path Length (SPL) on object-specifc tasks in richly detailed environments from Matterport 3D (MP3D), Habitat Matterport 3D (HM3D) and Gibson. With navigation episode reported, NavVLM demonstrates the capabilities to navigate towards any open-set languages. In real-world validation, we validated our framework's effectiveness in real-world robot at indoor scene.

  _Aodi Wu, Xubo Luo_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This technical report presents our solution for the RoboSense Challenge at IROS 2025, which evaluates Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on autonomous driving scene understanding across perception, prediction, planning, and corruption detection tasks. We propose a systematic framework built on four core components. First, a Mixture-of-Prompts router classifies questions and dispatches them to task-specific expert prompts, eliminating interference across diverse question types. Second, task-specific prompts embed explicit coordinate systems, spatial reasoning rules, role-playing, Chain-of-Thought/Tree-of-Thought reasoning, and few-shot examples tailored to each task. Third, a visual assembly module composes multi-view images with object crops, magenta markers, and adaptive historical frames based on question requirements. Fourth, we configure model inference parameters (temperature, top-p, message roles) per task to optimize output quality. Implemented on Qwen2.5-VL-72B, our approach achieves 70.87% average accuracy on Phase-1 (clean data) and 72.85% on Phase-2 (corrupted data), demonstrating that structured prompting and spatial grounding substantially enhance VLM performance on safety-critical autonomous driving tasks.

  _Minsuk Ji, Sanghyeok Lee, Namhyuk Ahn_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Despite their impressive realism, modern text-to-image models still struggle with compositionality, often failing to render accurate object counts, attributes, and spatial relations. To address this challenge, we present a training-free framework that combines an object-centric approach with self-refinement to improve layout faithfulness while preserving aesthetic quality. Specifically, we leverage large language models (LLMs) to synthesize explicit layouts from input prompts, and we inject these layouts into the image generation process, where a object-centric vision-language model (VLM) judge reranks multiple candidates to select the most prompt-aligned outcome iteratively. By unifying explicit layout-grounding with self-refine-based inference-time scaling, our framework achieves stronger scene alignment with prompts compared to recent text-to-image models. The code are available atthis https URL.

- **[GRAID: Enhancing Spatial Reasoning of VLMs Through High-Fidelity Data Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22118)**  `arXiv:2510.22118`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision Language Models (VLMs) achieve strong performance on many vision-language tasks but often struggle with spatial reasoning$\unicode{x2014}$a prerequisite for many applications. Empirically, we find that a dataset produced by a current training data generation pipeline has a 57.6% human validation rate. These rates stem from current limitations: single-image 3D reconstruction introduces cascading modeling errors and requires wide answer tolerances, while caption-based methods require hyper-detailed annotations and suffer from generative hallucinations. We present GRAID, built on the key insight that qualitative spatial relationships can be reliably determined from 2D geometric primitives alone. By operating exclusively on 2D bounding boxes from standard object detectors, GRAID avoids both 3D reconstruction errors and generative hallucinations, resulting in datasets that are of higher quality than existing tools that produce similar datasets as validated by human evaluations. We apply our framework to the BDD100k, NuImages, and Waymo datasets, generating over 8.5 million high-quality VQA pairs creating questions spanning spatial relations, counting, ranking, and size comparisons. We evaluate one of the datasets and find it achieves 91.16% human-validated accuracy$\unicode{x2014}$compared to 57.6% on a dataset generated by recent work. Critically, we demonstrate that when trained on GRAID data, models learn spatial reasoning concepts that generalize: models fine-tuned on 6 question types improve on over 10 held-out types, with accuracy gains of 47.5% on BDD and 37.9% on NuImages for Llama 3.2B 11B, and when trained on all questions types, achieve improvements on several existing benchmarks such as BLINK.

- **[SCOPE: Saliency-Coverage Oriented Token Pruning for Efficient Multimodel LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24214)**  `arXiv:2510.24214`  `cs.CV`  
  _Jinhong Deng, Wen Li, Joey Tianyi Zhou, Yang He_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) typically process a large number of visual tokens, leading to considerable computational overhead, even though many of these tokens are redundant. Existing visual token pruning methods primarily focus on selecting the most salient tokens based on attention scores, resulting in the semantic incompleteness of the selected tokens. In this paper, we propose a novel visual token pruning strategy, called \textbf{S}aliency-\textbf{C}overage \textbf{O}riented token \textbf{P}runing for \textbf{E}fficient MLLMs (SCOPE), to jointly model both the saliency and coverage of the selected visual tokens to better preserve semantic completeness. Specifically, we introduce a set-coverage for a given set of selected tokens, computed based on the token relationships. We then define a token-coverage gain for each unselected token, quantifying how much additional coverage would be obtained by including it. By integrating the saliency score into the token-coverage gain, we propose our SCOPE score and iteratively select the token with the highest SCOPE score. We conduct extensive experiments on multiple vision-language understanding benchmarks using the LLaVA-1.5 and LLaVA-Next models. Experimental results demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms prior approaches. Our code is available at \href{this https URL}{this https URL}.

- **[Enhancing CLIP Robustness via Cross-Modality Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24038)**  `arXiv:2510.24038`  `cs.CV`  
  _Xingyu Zhu, Beier Zhu, Shuo Wang, Kesen Zhao, Hanwang Zhang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP demonstrate strong generalization in zero-shot classification but remain highly vulnerable to adversarial perturbations. Existing methods primarily focus on adversarial fine-tuning or prompt optimization; they often overlook the gaps in CLIP's encoded features, which is shown as the text and image features lie far apart from each other. This misalignment is significantly amplified under adversarial perturbations, leading to severe degradation in classification performance. To address this problem, we propose Cross-modality Alignment, dubbed COLA, an optimal transport-based framework that explicitly addresses adversarial misalignment by restoring both global image-text alignment and local structural consistency in the feature space. (1) COLA first projects adversarial image embeddings onto a subspace spanned by class text features, effectively filtering out non-semantic distortions while preserving discriminative information. (2) It then models images and texts as discrete distributions over multiple augmented views and refines their alignment via OT, with the subspace projection seamlessly integrated into the cost computation. This design ensures stable cross-modal alignment even under adversarial conditions. COLA is training-free and compatible with existing fine-tuned models. Extensive evaluations across 14 zero-shot classification benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of COLA, especially with an average improvement of 6.7% on ImageNet and its variants under PGD adversarial attacks, while maintaining high accuracy on clean samples.

  _Andriy Myronenko, Dong Yang, Baris Turkbey, Mariam Aboian, Sena Azamat, Esra Akcicek, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown strong promise for medical image analysis, but most remain opaque, offering predictions without the transparent, stepwise reasoning clinicians rely on. We present a framework that brings chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning to chest X-ray interpretation. Inspired by reasoning-first training paradigms, our approach is designed to learn how experts reason, not just what they conclude, by aligning intermediate steps with observable image evidence and radiology workflow. Beyond accuracy, the explicit reasoning traces support clinical auditability: they reveal why a conclusion was reached, which alternatives were considered, and where uncertainty remains, enabling quality assurance, error analysis, and safer human-AI collaboration.Our model couples high-fidelity visual encoding with a two-stage training recipe: a reasoning-style supervised fine-tuning (SFT) followed by reinforcement learning (RL) that uses verifiable rewards over a list of X-ray abnormalities. The model outputs reasoning that mirrors radiologists systematic thought process, uncertainty, and differential diagnosis. In out-of-distribution evaluation, the approach achieves competitive multi-label classification while improving interpretability. In a reader study with expert radiologists, full reasoning traces increased confidence, supported error auditing, and reduced time to finalize reports. We release code and the model NV-Reason-CXR-3B to support community progress toward trustworthy, explainable AI in chest radiography and other medical imaging tasks where reasoning quality is as critical as prediction quality.

- **[PRISM-Bench: A Benchmark of Puzzle-Based Visual Tasks with CoT Error Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23594)**  `arXiv:2510.23594`  `cs.CV`  
  _Yusu Qian, Cheng Wan, Chao Jia, Yinfei Yang, Qingyu Zhao, Zhe Gan_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable progress on vision-language tasks, yet their reasoning processes remain sometimes unreliable. We introduce PRISM-Bench, a benchmark of puzzle-based visual challenges designed to evaluate not only whether models can solve problems, but how their reasoning unfolds. Unlike prior evaluations that measure only final-answer accuracy, PRISM-Bench introduces a diagnostic task: given a visual puzzle and a step-by-step chain-of-thought (CoT) containing exactly one error, models must identify the first incorrect step. This setting enables fine-grained assessment of logical consistency, error detection, and visual reasoning. The puzzles in PRISM-Bench require multi-step symbolic, geometric, and analogical reasoning, resisting shortcuts based on superficial pattern matching. Evaluations across state-of-the-art MLLMs reveal a persistent gap between fluent generation and faithful reasoning: models that produce plausible CoTs often fail to locate simple logical faults. By disentangling answer generation from reasoning verification, PRISM-Bench offers a sharper lens on multimodal reasoning competence and underscores the need for diagnostic evaluation protocols in the development of trustworthy MLLMs.

  Training vision-language models (VLMs) for complex reasoning remains a challenging task, i.a. due to the scarcity of high-quality image-text reasoning data. Conversely, text-based reasoning resources are abundant and scalable, but it is still an open question how to leveraging them for VLM reasoning. To address this problem, we propose VOLD, a framework to transfer reasoning capabilities from text-only teacher models to VLM student models. To this end, VOLD combines reinforcement learning via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with on-policy distillation, which allows the student reasoning traces to be guided by the teacher model, resulting in a significant gain over using GRPO alone. We further show that a cold-start alignment is essential for an effective transfer during the online training phase in this scenario and that without sufficient distributional alignment between teacher and student, on-policy distillation fails to provide meaningful guidance. We evaluate VOLD across diverse benchmarks including MMMU-Pro, MathVision, MathVista, and LogicVista, showing that VOLD outperforms the baseline model significantly and improves over the state of the art by a margin. Our ablation shows the importance of a cold-start alignment via SFT for on-policy distillation with a text-only teacher.

  Video anomaly detection (VAD) focuses on identifying anomalies in videos. Supervised methods demand substantial in-domain training data and fail to deliver clear explanations for anomalies. In contrast, training-free methods leverage the knowledge reserves and language interactivity of large pre-trained models to detect anomalies. However, the current fixed-length temporal window sampling approaches struggle to accurately capture anomalies with varying temporal spans. Therefore, we propose VADTree that utilizes a Hierarchical Granularityaware Tree (HGTree) structure for flexible sampling in VAD. VADTree leverages the knowledge embedded in a pre-trained Generic Event Boundary Detection (GEBD) model to characterize potential anomaly event boundaries. Specifically, VADTree decomposes the video into generic event nodes based on boundary confidence, and performs adaptive coarse-fine hierarchical structuring and redundancy removal to construct the HGTree. Then, the multi-dimensional priors are injected into the visual language models (VLMs) to enhance the node-wise anomaly perception, and anomaly reasoning for generic event nodes is achieved via large language models (LLMs). Finally, an inter-cluster node correlation method is used to integrate the multi-granularity anomaly scores. Extensive experiments on three challenging datasets demonstrate that VADTree achieves state-of-the-art performance in training-free settings while drastically reducing the number of sampled video segments. The code will be available atthis https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Video anomaly detection (VAD) is a critical yet challenging task due to the complex and diverse nature of real-world scenarios. Previous methods typically rely on domain-specific training data and manual adjustments when applying to new scenarios and unseen anomaly types, suffering from high labor costs and limited generalization. Therefore, we aim to achieve generalist VAD, \ie, automatically handle any scene and any anomaly types without training data or human involvement. In this work, we propose PANDA, an agentic AI engineer based on MLLMs. Specifically, we achieve PANDA by comprehensively devising four key capabilities: (1) self-adaptive scene-aware strategy planning, (2) goal-driven heuristic reasoning, (3) tool-augmented self-reflection, and (4) self-improving chain-of-memory. Concretely, we develop a self-adaptive scene-aware RAG mechanism, enabling PANDA to retrieve anomaly-specific knowledge for anomaly detection strategy planning. Next, we introduce a latent anomaly-guided heuristic prompt strategy to enhance reasoning precision. Furthermore, PANDA employs a progressive reflection mechanism alongside a suite of context-aware tools to iteratively refine decision-making in complex scenarios. Finally, a chain-of-memory mechanism enables PANDA to leverage historical experiences for continual performance improvement. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PANDA achieves state-of-the-art performance in multi-scenario, open-set, and complex scenario settings without training and manual involvement, validating its generalizable and robust anomaly detection capability.

  3D visual grounding has made notable progress in localizing objects within complex 3D scenes. However, grounding referring expressions beyond objects in 3D scenes remains unexplored. In this paper, we introduce Anywhere3D-Bench, a holistic 3D visual grounding benchmark consisting of 2,886 referring expression-3D bounding box pairs spanning four different grounding levels: human-activity areas, unoccupied space beyond objects, individual objects in the scene, and fine-grained object parts. We assess a range of state-of-the-art 3D visual grounding methods alongside large language models (LLMs) and multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) on Anywhere3D-Bench. Experimental results reveal that space-level and part-level visual grounding pose the greatest challenges: space-level tasks require a more comprehensive spatial reasoning ability, for example, modeling distances and spatial relations within 3D space, while part-level tasks demand fine-grained perception of object composition. Even the best-performing models, Google Gemini-2.5-Pro and OpenAI o3, achieve just around 30% accuracy on space-level tasks and around 40% on part-level tasks, significantly lower than its performance on area-level and object-level tasks. These findings underscore a critical gap in current models' capacity to understand and reason about 3D scenes beyond object-level semantics.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Understanding perspective is fundamental to human visual perception, yet the extent to which multimodal large language models (MLLMs) internalize perspective geometry remains unclear. We introduce MMPerspective, the first benchmark specifically designed to systematically evaluate MLLMs' understanding of perspective through 10 carefully crafted tasks across three complementary dimensions: Perspective Perception, Reasoning, and Robustness. Our benchmark comprises 2,711 real-world and synthetic image instances with 5,083 question-answer pairs that probe key capabilities, such as vanishing point perception and counting, perspective type reasoning, line relationship understanding in 3D space, invariance to perspective-preserving transformations, etc. Through a comprehensive evaluation of 43 state-of-the-art MLLMs, we uncover significant limitations: while models demonstrate competence on surface-level perceptual tasks, they struggle with compositional reasoning and maintaining spatial consistency under perturbations. Our analysis further reveals intriguing patterns between model architecture, scale, and perspective capabilities, highlighting both robustness bottlenecks and the benefits of chain-of-thought prompting. MMPerspective establishes a valuable testbed for diagnosing and advancing spatial understanding in vision-language systems. Resources available at:this https URL

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in vision-language tasks such as reasoning segmentation, where models generate segmentation masks based on textual queries. While prior work has primarily focused on perturbing image inputs, semantically equivalent textual paraphrases-crucial in real-world applications where users express the same intent in varied ways-remain underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce a novel adversarial paraphrasing task: generating grammatically correct paraphrases that preserve the original query meaning while degrading segmentation performance. To evaluate the quality of adversarial paraphrases, we develop a comprehensive automatic evaluation protocol validated with human studies. Furthermore, we introduce SPARTA-a black-box, sentence-level optimization method that operates in the low-dimensional semantic latent space of a text autoencoder, guided by reinforcement learning. SPARTA achieves significantly higher success rates, outperforming prior methods by up to 2x on both the ReasonSeg and LLMSeg-40k datasets. We use SPARTA and competitive baselines to assess the robustness of advanced reasoning segmentation models. We reveal that they remain vulnerable to adversarial paraphrasing-even under strict semantic and grammatical constraints. All code and data will be released publicly upon acceptance.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent progress, such as DeepSeek-R1, has shown that the GRPO algorithm, a Reinforcement Learning (RL) approach, can effectively train Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs). In this paper, we analyze three challenges of GRPO: gradient coupling between thoughts and answers, sparse reward signals caused by limited parallel sampling, and unstable advantage estimation. To mitigate these challenges, we propose GRPO-MA, a simple yet theoretically grounded method that leverages multi-answer generation from each thought process, enabling more robust and efficient optimization. Theoretically, we show that the variance of thought advantage decreases as the number of answers per thought increases. Empirically, our gradient analysis confirms this effect, showing that GRPO-MA reduces gradient spikes compared to GRPO. Experiments on math, code, and diverse multimodal tasks demonstrate that GRPO-MA substantially improves performance and training efficiency. Our ablation studies further reveal that increasing the number of answers per thought consistently enhances model performance.

  Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning is critical for improving the interpretability and reliability of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). However, existing training algorithms such as SFT, PPO, and GRPO may not generalize well across unseen reasoning tasks and heavily rely on a biased reward model. To address this challenge, we reformulate reasoning in LVLMs as posterior inference and propose a scalable training algorithm based on amortized variational inference. By leveraging diversity-seeking reinforcement learning algorithms, we introduce a novel sparse reward function for token-level learning signals that encourage diverse, high-likelihood latent CoT, overcoming deterministic sampling limitations and avoiding reward hacking. Additionally, we implement a Bayesian inference-scaling strategy that replaces costly Best-of-N and Beam Search with a marginal likelihood to efficiently rank optimal rationales and answers. We empirically demonstrate that the proposed method enhances the state-of-the-art LVLMs on seven reasoning benchmarks, in terms of effectiveness, generalization, and interpretability.

  Site-specific disease management (SSDM) in crops has advanced rapidly through machine and deep learning (ML and DL) for real-time computer vision. Research evolved from handcrafted feature extraction to large-scale automated feature learning. With foundation models (FMs), crop disease datasets are now processed in fundamentally new ways. Unlike traditional neural networks, FMs integrate visual and textual data, interpret symptoms in text, reason about symptom-management relationships, and support interactive QA for growers and educators. Adaptive and imitation learning in robotics further enables field-based disease management. This review screened approx. 40 articles on FM applications for SSDM, focusing on large-language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs), and discussing their role in adaptive learning (AL), reinforcement learning (RL), and digital twin frameworks for targeted spraying. Key findings: (a) FMs are gaining traction with surging literature in 2023-24; (b) VLMs outpace LLMs, with a 5-10x increase in publications; (c) RL and AL are still nascent for smart spraying; (d) digital twins with RL can simulate targeted spraying virtually; (e) addressing the sim-to-real gap is critical for real-world deployment; (f) human-robot collaboration remains limited, especially in human-in-the-loop approaches where robots detect early symptoms and humans validate uncertain cases; (g) multi-modal FMs with real-time feedback will drive next-gen SSDM.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The rapid progress of Large Language Models (LLMs) and their multimodal extensions (MLLMs) has enabled agentic systems capable of perceiving and acting across diverse environments. A challenging yet impactful frontier is the development of GUI agents, which must navigate complex desktop and web interfaces while maintaining robustness and generalization. Existing paradigms typically model tasks as long-chain executions, concatenating historical trajectories into the context. While approaches such as Mirage and GTA1 refine planning or introduce multi-branch action selection, they remain constrained by two persistent issues: Dependence on historical trajectories, which amplifies error propagation. And Local exploration bias, where "decision-first, observation-later" mechanisms overlook critical interface cues. We introduce the Memory-Driven GUI Agent (MGA), which reframes GUI interaction around the principle of observe first, then decide. MGA models each step as an independent, context-rich environment state represented by a triad: current screenshot, task-agnostic spatial information, and a dynamically updated structured memory. Experiments on OSworld benchmarks, real desktop applications (Chrome, VSCode, VLC), and cross-task transfer demonstrate that MGA achieves substantial gains in robustness, generalization, and efficiency compared to state-of-the-art baselines. The code is publicly available at: {this https URL}.
