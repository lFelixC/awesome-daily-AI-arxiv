  Amid growing efforts to leverage advances in large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) for robotics, Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have recently gained significant attention. By unifying vision, language, and action data at scale, which have traditionally been studied separately, VLA models aim to learn policies that generalise across diverse tasks, objects, embodiments, and environments. This generalisation capability is expected to enable robots to solve novel downstream tasks with minimal or no additional task-specific data, facilitating more flexible and scalable real-world deployment. Unlike previous surveys that focus narrowly on action representations or high-level model architectures, this work offers a comprehensive, full-stack review, integrating both software and hardware components of VLA systems. In particular, this paper provides a systematic review of VLAs, covering their strategy and architectural transition, architectures and building blocks, modality-specific processing techniques, and learning paradigms. In addition, to support the deployment of VLAs in real-world robotic applications, we also review commonly used robot platforms, data collection strategies, publicly available datasets, data augmentation methods, and evaluation benchmarks. Throughout this comprehensive survey, this paper aims to offer practical guidance for the robotics community in applying VLAs to real-world robotic systems. All references categorized by training approach, evaluation method, modality, and dataset are available in the table on our project website:this https URL.

- **[TIGeR: Tool-Integrated Geometric Reasoning in Vision-Language Models for Robotics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07181)**  `arXiv:2510.07181`  `cs.RO` `cs.AI` `cs.CV`

  Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in spatial reasoning, yet they remain fundamentally limited to qualitative precision and lack the computational precision required for real-world robotics. Current approaches fail to leverage metric cues from depth sensors and camera calibration, instead reducing geometric problems to pattern recognition tasks that cannot deliver the centimeter-level accuracy essential for robotic manipulation. We present TIGeR (Tool-Integrated Geometric Reasoning), a novel framework that transforms VLMs from perceptual estimators to geometric computers by enabling them to generate and execute precise geometric computations through external tools. Rather than attempting to internalize complex geometric operations within neural networks, TIGeR empowers models to recognize geometric reasoning requirements, synthesize appropriate computational code, and invoke specialized libraries for exact calculations. To support this paradigm, we introduce TIGeR-300K, a comprehensive tool-invocation-oriented dataset covering point transformations, pose estimation, trajectory generation, and spatial compatibility verification, complete with tool invocation sequences and intermediate computations. Through a two-stage training pipeline combining supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) with our proposed hierarchical reward design, TIGeR achieves SOTA performance on geometric reasoning benchmarks while demonstrating centimeter-level precision in real-world robotic manipulation tasks.

- **[Mitigating Cross-Modal Distraction and Ensuring Geometric Feasibility via Affordance-Guided and Self-Consistent MLLMs for Task Planning in Instruction-Following Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13055)**  `arXiv:2503.13055`  `cs.RO` `cs.AI`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We investigate the use of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) with in-context learning for closed-loop task planning in instruction-following manipulation. We identify four essential requirements for successful task planning: quantity estimation, reachability analysis, relative positioning, and collision avoidance. However, existing benchmarks fail to support holistic evaluation across all these aspects. To address this gap, we introduce \textbf{QuARC} (Quantity, Analysis, Relative positioning, Collision), a new benchmark based on a food preparation scenario that integrates all four challenges. Using QuARC, we reveal two major limitations of current MLLMs: cross-modal distraction and geometric infeasibility. To tackle these, we adapt Chain-of-Thought with Self-Consistency to mitigate reasoning loss from cross-modal distractions and incorporate an affordance predictor to guide planning based on geometric feasibility. Our comprehensive evaluation analyzes performance across multiple baselines and explains sources of improvement. Our method achieves a 76.7\% success rate on the benchmark, significantly outperforming the ViLa baseline (36.7\%), without requiring additional finetuning.

- **[SaFeR-VLM: Toward Safety-aware Fine-grained Reasoning in Multimodal Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06871)**  `arXiv:2510.06871`  `cs.LG` `cs.CV`

  Multimodal Large Reasoning Models (MLRMs) demonstrate impressive cross-modal reasoning but often amplify safety risks under adversarial or unsafe prompts, a phenomenon we call the \textit{Reasoning Tax}. Existing defenses mainly act at the output level and do not constrain the reasoning process, leaving models exposed to implicit risks. In this paper, we propose SaFeR-VLM, a safety-aligned reinforcement learning framework that embeds safety directly into multimodal reasoning. The framework integrates four components: (I) QI-Safe-10K, a curated dataset emphasizing safety-critical and reasoning-sensitive cases; (II) safety-aware rollout, where unsafe generations undergo reflection and correction instead of being discarded; (III) structured reward modeling with multi-dimensional weighted criteria and explicit penalties for hallucinations and contradictions; and (IV) GRPO optimization, which reinforces both safe and corrected trajectories. This unified design shifts safety from a passive safeguard to an active driver of reasoning, enabling scalable and generalizable safety-aware reasoning. SaFeR-VLM further demonstrates robustness against both explicit and implicit risks, supporting dynamic and interpretable safety decisions beyond surface-level filtering. SaFeR-VLM-3B achieves average performance $70.13$ and $78.97$ on safety and helpfulness across six benchmarks, surpassing both same-scale and $>10\times$ larger models such as Skywork-R1V3-38B, Qwen2.5VL-72B, and GLM4.5V-106B. Remarkably, SaFeR-VLM-7B benefits from its increased scale to surpass GPT-5-mini and Gemini-2.5-Flash by \num{6.47} and \num{16.76} points respectively on safety metrics, achieving this improvement without any degradation in helpfulness performance.

- **[HoPE: Hybrid of Position Embedding for Long Context Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20444)**  `arXiv:2505.20444`  `cs.LG` `cs.CV`

  Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have made significant progress in multimodal tasks. However, their performance often deteriorates in long-context scenarios, particularly long videos. While Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) has been widely adopted for length generalization in Large Language Models (LLMs), extending vanilla RoPE to capture the intricate spatial-temporal dependencies in videos remains an unsolved challenge. Existing methods typically allocate different frequencies within RoPE to encode 3D positional information. However, these allocation strategies mainly rely on heuristics, lacking in-depth theoretical analysis. In this paper, we first study how different allocation strategies impact the long-context capabilities of VLMs. Our analysis reveals that current multimodal RoPEs fail to reliably capture semantic similarities over extended contexts. To address this issue, we propose HoPE, a Hybrid of Position Embedding designed to improve the long-context capabilities of VLMs. HoPE introduces a hybrid frequency allocation strategy for reliable semantic modeling over arbitrarily long contexts, and a dynamic temporal scaling mechanism to facilitate robust learning and flexible inference across diverse context lengths. Extensive experiments across four video benchmarks on long video understanding and retrieval tasks demonstrate that HoPE consistently outperforms existing methods, confirming its effectiveness.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As AI models generate increasingly realistic images, growing concerns over potential misuse underscore the need for reliable detection. Traditional supervised detection methods depend on large, curated datasets for training and often fail to generalize to novel, out-of-domain image generators. As an alternative, we explore pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for zero-shot detection of AI-generated images. We evaluate VLM performance on three diverse benchmarks encompassing synthetic images of human faces, objects, and animals produced by 16 different state-of-the-art image generators. While off-the-shelf VLMs perform poorly on these datasets, we find that their reasoning can be guided effectively through simple response prefilling -- a method we call Prefill-Guided Thinking (PGT). In particular, prefilling a VLM response with the task-aligned phrase "Let's examine the style and the synthesis artifacts" improves the Macro F1 scores of three widely used open-source VLMs by up to 24%.

- **[Grounding the Ungrounded: A Spectral-Graph Framework for Quantifying Hallucinations in Multimodal LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19366)**  `arXiv:2508.19366`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Supratik Sarkar, Swagatam Das_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Hallucinations in LLMs--especially in multimodal settings--undermine reliability. We present a rigorous, information-geometric framework in diffusion dynamics that quantifies hallucination in MLLMs: model outputs are embedded spectrally on multimodal graph Laplacians, and gaps to a truth manifold define a semantic-distortion metric. We derive Courant--Fischer bounds on a temperature-dependent hallucination energy and use RKHS eigenmodes to obtain modality-aware, interpretable measures that track evolution over prompts and time. This reframes hallucination as measurable and bounded, providing a principled basis for evaluation and mitigation.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Models are susceptible to adversarially out-of-distribution (OOD) data despite large training-compute investments into their robustification. Zaremba et al. (2025) make progress on this problem at test time, showing LLM reasoning improves satisfaction of model specifications designed to thwart attacks, resulting in a correlation between reasoning effort and robustness to jailbreaks. However, this benefit of test compute fades when attackers are given access to gradients or multimodal inputs. We address this gap, clarifying that inference-compute offers benefits even in such cases. Our approach argues that compositional generalization, through which OOD data is understandable via its in-distribution (ID) components, enables adherence to defensive specifications on adversarially OOD inputs. Namely, we posit the Robustness from Inference Compute Hypothesis (RICH): inference-compute defenses profit as the model's training data better reflects the attacked data's components. We empirically support this hypothesis across vision language model and attack types, finding robustness gains from test-time compute if specification following on OOD data is unlocked by compositional generalization, while RL finetuning and protracted reasoning are not critical. For example, increasing emphasis on defensive specifications via prompting lowers the success rate of gradient-based multimodal attacks on VLMs robustified by adversarial pretraining, but this same intervention provides no such benefit to not-robustified models. This correlation of inference-compute's robustness benefit with base model robustness is the rich-get-richer dynamic of the RICH: attacked data components are more ID for robustified models, aiding compositional generalization to OOD data. Accordingly, we advise layering train-time and test-time defenses to obtain their synergistic benefit.

  Vision-language models (VLMs) trained on internet-scale data achieve remarkable zero-shot detection performance on common objects like car, truck, and pedestrian. However, state-of-the-art models still struggle to generalize to out-of-distribution classes, tasks and imaging modalities not typically found in their pre-training. Rather than simply re-training VLMs on more visual data, we argue that one should align VLMs to new concepts with annotation instructions containing a few visual examples and rich textual descriptions. To this end, we introduce Roboflow100-VL, a large-scale collection of 100 multi-modal object detection datasets with diverse concepts not commonly found in VLM pre-training. We evaluate state-of-the-art models on our benchmark in zero-shot, few-shot, semi-supervised, and fully-supervised settings, allowing for comparison across data regimes. Notably, we find that VLMs like GroundingDINO and Qwen2.5-VL achieve less than 2% zero-shot accuracy on challenging medical imaging datasets within Roboflow100-VL, demonstrating the need for few-shot concept alignment. Lastly, we discuss our recent CVPR 2025 Foundational FSOD competition and share insights from the community. Notably, the winning team significantly outperforms our baseline by 17 mAP!

- **[StaR-KVQA: Structured Reasoning Traces for Implicit-Knowledge Visual Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06638)**  `arXiv:2510.06638`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`  
  _Zhihao Wen, Wenkang Wei, Yuan Fang, Xingtong Yu, Hui Zhang, Weicheng Zhu, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Knowledge-based Visual Question Answering (KVQA) requires models to ground entities in images and reason over factual knowledge. We study its implicit-knowledge variant, IK-KVQA, where a multimodal large language model (MLLM) is the sole knowledge source, without external retrieval. Yet, MLLMs lack explicit reasoning supervision and produce inconsistent justifications, and generalize poorly after standard supervised fine-tuning (SFT). We present StaR-KVQA (Structured Reasoning Traces for IK-KVQA), which supervises structured traces - dual symbolic relation paths plus path-grounded natural-language explanations - so that reasoning becomes transparent and verifiable. With one open-source MLLM, StaR-KVQA constructs and selects path-grounded reasoning traces to form a trace-enriched dataset, then fine-tunes via structured self-distillation to align generation with supervision; no external retrievers, verifiers, or curated knowledge bases (KBs) are used, traces are built offline, and inference is a single autoregressive pass. Across benchmarks, StaR-KVQA improves both accuracy and interpretability, achieving up to +11.3% higher answer accuracy on OK-VQA over the strongest baseline while exhibiting robust cross-domain generalization.

  While Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) achieve strong performance in multimodal tasks, hallucinations continue to hinder their reliability. Among the three categories of hallucinations, which include object, attribute, and relation, relation hallucinations account for the largest proportion but have received the least attention. To address this issue, we propose ChainMPQ (Multi-Perspective Questions guided Interleaved Chain of Image and Text), a training-free method that improves relational inference in LVLMs by utilizing accumulated textual and visual memories. ChainMPQ first extracts subject and object keywords from the question to enhance the corresponding image regions. It then constructs multi-perspective questions that focus on the three core components of a relationship: the subject, the object, and the relation that links them. These questions are sequentially input to the model, with textual and visual memories from earlier steps providing supporting context for subsequent ones, thereby forming an interleaved chain of images and text that guides progressive relational reasoning. Experiments on multiple LVLMs and benchmarks show that ChainMPQ substantially reduces relation hallucinations, while ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of its three core modules.

- **[Towards a Multimodal Large Language Model with Pixel-Level Insight for Biomedicine](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09278)**  `arXiv:2412.09278`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`

  In recent years, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLM) have achieved notable advancements, demonstrating the feasibility of developing an intelligent biomedical assistant. However, current biomedical MLLMs predominantly focus on image-level understanding and restrict interactions to textual commands, thus limiting their capability boundaries and the flexibility of usage. In this paper, we introduce a novel end-to-end multimodal large language model for the biomedical domain, named MedPLIB, which possesses pixel-level understanding. Excitingly, it supports visual question answering (VQA), arbitrary pixel-level prompts (points, bounding boxes, and free-form shapes), and pixel-level grounding. We propose a novel Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) multi-stage training strategy, which divides MoE into separate training phases for a visual-language expert model and a pixel-grounding expert model, followed by fine-tuning using MoE. This strategy effectively coordinates multitask learning while maintaining the computational cost at inference equivalent to that of a single expert model. To advance the research of biomedical MLLMs, we introduce the Medical Complex Vision Question Answering Dataset (MeCoVQA), which comprises an array of 8 modalities for complex medical imaging question answering and image region understanding. Experimental results indicate that MedPLIB has achieved state-of-the-art outcomes across multiple medical visual language tasks. More importantly, in zero-shot evaluations for the pixel grounding task, MedPLIB leads the best small and large models by margins of 19.7 and 15.6 respectively on the mDice metric. The codes, data, and model checkpoints will be made publicly available atthis https URL.

  The advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has enabled significant progress in multimodal understanding, expanding their capacity to analyze video content. However, existing evaluation benchmarks for MLLMs primarily focus on abstract video comprehension, lacking a detailed assessment of their ability to understand video compositions, the nuanced interpretation of how visual elements combine and interact within highly compiled video contexts. We introduce VidComposition, a new benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the video composition understanding capabilities of MLLMs using carefully curated compiled videos and cinematic-level annotations. VidComposition includes 982 videos with 1706 multiple-choice questions, covering various compositional aspects such as camera movement, angle, shot size, narrative structure, character actions and emotions, etc. Our comprehensive evaluation of 33 open-source and proprietary MLLMs reveals a significant performance gap between human and model capabilities. This highlights the limitations of current MLLMs in understanding complex, compiled video compositions and offers insights into areas for further improvement.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Video summarization aims to create short, accurate, and cohesive summaries of longer videos. Despite the existence of various video summarization datasets, a notable limitation is their limited amount of source videos, which hampers the effective training of advanced large vision-language models (VLMs). Additionally, most existing datasets are created for video-to-video summarization, overlooking the contemporary need for multimodal video content summarization. Recent efforts have been made to expand from unimodal to multimodal video summarization, categorizing the task into three sub-tasks based on the summary's modality: video-to-video (V2V), video-to-text (V2T), and a combination of video and text summarization (V2VT). However, the textual summaries in previous multimodal datasets are inadequate. To address these issues, we introduce Instruct-V2Xum, a cross-modal video summarization dataset featuring 30,000 diverse videos sourced from YouTube, with lengths ranging from 40 to 940 seconds and an average summarization ratio of 16.39%. Each video summary in Instruct-V2Xum is paired with a textual summary that references specific frame indexes, facilitating the generation of aligned video and textual summaries. In addition, we propose a new video summarization framework named V2Xum-LLM. V2Xum-LLM, specifically V2Xum-LLaMA in this study, is the first framework that unifies different video summarization tasks into one large language model's (LLM) text decoder and achieves task-controllable video summarization with temporal prompts and task instructions. Experiments show that V2Xum-LLaMA outperforms strong baseline models on multiple video summarization tasks. Furthermore, we propose an enhanced evaluation metric for V2V and V2VT summarization tasks.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent endeavors to accelerate inference in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have primarily focused on visual token compression. The effectiveness of these methods is typically assessed by measuring the accuracy drop on established benchmarks, comparing model performance before and after compression. However, these benchmarks are originally designed to assess the perception and reasoning capabilities of MLLMs, rather than to evaluate compression techniques. As a result, directly applying them to visual token compression introduces a task mismatch. Strikingly, our investigation reveals that simple image downsampling consistently outperforms many advanced compression methods across multiple widely used benchmarks. Through extensive experiments, we make the following observations: (i) Current benchmarks are noisy for the visual token compression task. (ii) Down-sampling is able to serve as a data filter to evaluate the difficulty of samples in the visual token compression task. Motivated by these findings, we introduce VTC-Bench, an evaluation framework that incorporates a data filtering mechanism to denoise existing benchmarks, thereby enabling fairer and more accurate assessment of visual token compression methods.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Remote Sensing Vision-Language Models (RSVLMs) have shown remarkable potential thanks to large-scale pretraining, achieving strong zero-shot performance on various tasks. However, their ability to generalize in low-data regimes, such as few-shot learning, remains insufficiently explored. In this work, we present the first structured benchmark for evaluating few-shot adaptation methods on RSVLMs. We conduct comprehensive experiments across ten remote sensing scene classification datasets, applying five widely used few-shot adaptation strategies to three state-of-the-art RSVLMs with varying backbones. Our findings reveal that models with similar zero-shot performance can exhibit markedly different behavior under few-shot adaptation, with some RSVLMs being inherently more amenable to such adaptation than others. The variability of performance and the absence of a clear winner among existing methods highlight the need for the development of more robust methods for few-shot adaptation tailored to RS. To facilitate future research, we provide a reproducible benchmarking framework and open-source code to systematically evaluate RSVLMs under few-shot conditions.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Generating captions for long and complex videos is both critical and challenging, with significant implications for the growing fields of text-to-video generation and multi-modal understanding. One key challenge in long video captioning is accurately recognizing the same individuals who appear in different frames, which we refer to as the ID-Matching problem. Few prior works have focused on this important issue. Those that have, usually suffer from limited generalization and depend on point-wise matching, which limits their overall effectiveness. In this paper, unlike previous approaches, we build upon LVLMs to leverage their powerful priors. We aim to unlock the inherent ID-Matching capabilities within LVLMs themselves to enhance the ID-Matching performance of captions. Specifically, we first introduce a new benchmark for assessing the ID-Matching capabilities of video captions. Using this benchmark, we investigate LVLMs containing GPT-4o, revealing key insights that the performance of ID-Matching can be improved through two methods: 1) enhancing the usage of image information and 2) increasing the quantity of information of individual descriptions. Based on these insights, we propose a novel video captioning method called Recognizing Identities for Captioning Effectively (RICE). Extensive experiments including assessments of caption quality and ID-Matching performance, demonstrate the superiority of our approach. Notably, when implemented on GPT-4o, our RICE improves the precision of ID-Matching from 50% to 90% and improves the recall of ID-Matching from 15% to 80% compared to baseline. RICE makes it possible to continuously track different individuals in the captions of long videos.

  Existing methods for extracting reward signals in Reinforcement Learning typically rely on labeled data and dedicated training splits, a setup that contrasts with how humans learn directly from their environment. In this work, we propose TTRV to enhance vision language understanding by adapting the model on the fly at inference time, without the need for any labeled data. Concretely, we enhance the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) framework by designing rewards based on the frequency of the base model's output, while inferring on each test sample multiple times. Further, we also propose to control the diversity of the model's output by simultaneously rewarding the model for obtaining low entropy of the output empirical distribution. Our approach delivers consistent gains across both object recognition and visual question answering (VQA), with improvements of up to 52.4% and 29.8%, respectively, and average boosts of 24.6% and 10.0% across 16this http URL, on image recognition, TTRV applied to InternVL 8B surpasses GPT-4o by an average of 2.3% over 8 benchmarks, while remaining highly competitive on VQA, demonstrating that test-time reinforcement learning can match or exceed the strongest proprietary models. Finally, we find many interesting properties of test-time RL for VLMs: for example, even in extremely data-constrained scenarios, where adaptation is performed on a single randomly chosen unlabeled test example, TTRV still yields non-trivial improvements of up to 5.5% in recognition tasks.

  Recent advancements in instruction-based image editing and subject-driven generation have garnered significant attention, yet both tasks still face limitations in meeting practical user needs. Instruction-based editing relies solely on language instructions, which often fail to capture specific editing details, making reference images necessary. Meanwhile, subject-driven generation is limited to combining concrete objects or people, overlooking broader, abstract concepts. To address these challenges, we propose two novel tasks: multimodal instruction-based editing and generation. These tasks support both text and image instructions and extend the scope to include both concrete and abstract concepts, greatly enhancing their practical applications. We introduce DreamOmni2, tackling two primary challenges: data creation and model framework design. Our data synthesis pipeline consists of three steps: (1) using a feature mixing method to create extraction data for both abstract and concrete concepts, (2) generating multimodal instruction-based editing training data using the editing and extraction models, and (3) further applying the extraction model to create training data for multimodal instruction-based editing. For the framework, to handle multi-image input, we propose an index encoding and position encoding shift scheme, which helps the model distinguish images and avoid pixel confusion. Additionally, we introduce joint training with the VLM and our generation/editing model to better process complex instructions. In addition, we have proposed comprehensive benchmarks for these two new tasks to drive their development. Experiments show that DreamOmni2 has achieved impressive results. Models and codes will be released.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have enabled unified understanding across text and images, yet equipping these models with robust image generation capabilities remains challenging. Existing approaches often rely on reconstruction-oriented autoencoders or complex bridging mechanisms, leading to misalignment between understanding and generation representations, or architectural complexity. In this work, we propose VUGEN, a novel framework that explicitly leverages VLM's pretrained visual understanding priors for efficient and high-quality image generation. Our approach first transforms the high-dimensional latent space of the VLM's native vision encoder into a lower-dimensional, tractable distribution that maximally preserves visual information. The VLM is then trained to sample within this reduced latent space, ensuring alignment with its visual understanding capabilities. Finally, a dedicated pixel decoder maps these generated latents back to the image space. We find that a VAE-free pixel diffusion decoder to be on par or better than commonly used complex latent diffusion decoders that internally rely on VAE latents. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VUGEN achieves superior image generation performance, improving DPG Bench from 71.17 to 74.32 and FID from 11.86 to 9.06 on COCO, while fully preserving the VLM's original understanding capabilities.

  Leading Vision-Language Models (VLMs) show strong results in visual perception and general reasoning, but their ability to understand and predict physical dynamics remains unclear. We benchmark six frontier VLMs on three physical simulation datasets - CLEVRER, Physion, and Physion++ - where the evaluation tasks test whether a model can predict outcomes or hypothesize about alternative situations. To probe deeper, we design diagnostic subtests that isolate perception (objects, colors, occluders) from physics reasoning (motion prediction, spatial relations). Intuitively, stronger diagnostic performance should support higher evaluation accuracy. Yet our analysis reveals weak correlations: models that excel at perception or physics reasoning do not consistently perform better on predictive or counterfactual evaluation. This counterintuitive gap exposes a central limitation of current VLMs: perceptual and physics skills remain fragmented and fail to combine into causal understanding, underscoring the need for architectures that bind perception and reasoning more tightly.

  Recent multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) often struggle to generate personalized image captions, even when trained on high-quality captions. In this work, we observe that such limitations persist in existing post-training-based MLLM personalization methods. Specifically, despite being post-tuned with large-scale caption data through supervised fine-tuning (SFT), these models frequently fail to produce faithful descriptions in real-world scenarios, such as multi-concept image captioning. However, acquiring large-scale, high-quality captions for such complex settings is both costly and difficult. To address the data-centric nature of SFT, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL)-based post-training framework. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first RL-based approach to post-train MLLMs for personalized image captioning. Our method significantly enhances both visual recognition and personalized generation capabilities of MLLMs, and consistently outperforms existing SFT-based baselines, especially in the challenging multi-concept image captioning task.

  Understanding perspective is fundamental to human visual perception, yet the extent to which multimodal large language models (MLLMs) internalize perspective geometry remains unclear. We introduce MMPerspective, the first benchmark specifically designed to systematically evaluate MLLMs' understanding of perspective through 10 carefully crafted tasks across three complementary dimensions: Perspective Perception, Reasoning, and Robustness. Our benchmark comprises 2,711 real-world and synthetic image instances with 5,083 question-answer pairs that probe key capabilities, such as vanishing point perception and counting, perspective type reasoning, line relationship understanding in 3D space, invariance to perspective-preserving transformations, etc. Through a comprehensive evaluation of 43 state-of-the-art MLLMs, we uncover significant limitations: while models demonstrate competence on surface-level perceptual tasks, they struggle with compositional reasoning and maintaining spatial consistency under perturbations. Our analysis further reveals intriguing patterns between model architecture, scale, and perspective capabilities, highlighting both robustness bottlenecks and the benefits of chain-of-thought prompting. MMPerspective establishes a valuable testbed for diagnosing and advancing spatial understanding in vision-language systems. Resources available at:this https URL

  _Yolo Yunlong Tang, Gen Zhan, Li Yang, Yiting Liao, Chenliang Xu_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Video saliency prediction aims to identify the regions in a video that attract human attention and gaze, driven by bottom-up features from the video and top-down processes like memory and cognition. Among these top-down influences, language plays a crucial role in guiding attention by shaping how visual information is interpreted. Existing methods primarily focus on modeling perceptual information while neglecting the reasoning process facilitated by language, where ranking cues are crucial outcomes of this process and practical guidance for saliency prediction. In this paper, we propose CaRDiff (Caption, Rank, and generate with Diffusion), a framework that imitates the process by integrating a multimodal large language model (MLLM), a grounding module, and a diffusion model, to enhance video saliency prediction. Specifically, we introduce a novel prompting method VSOR-CoT (Video Salient Object Ranking Chain of Thought), which utilizes an MLLM with a grounding module to caption video content and infer salient objects along with their rankings and positions. This process derives ranking maps that can be sufficiently leveraged by the diffusion model to decode the saliency maps for the given video accurately. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of VSOR-CoT in improving the performance of video saliency prediction. The proposed CaRDiff performs better than state-of-the-art models on the MVS dataset and demonstrates cross-dataset capabilities on the DHF1k dataset through zero-shot evaluation.

  Cognitive science research treats visual perception, the ability to understand and make sense of a visual input, as one of the early developmental signs of intelligence. Its TVPS-4 framework categorizes and tests human perception into seven skills such as visual discrimination, and form constancy. Do Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) match up to humans in basic perception? Even though there are many benchmarks that evaluate MLLMs on advanced reasoning and knowledge skills, there is limited research that focuses evaluation on simple perception. In response, we introduce Percept-V, a dataset containing 6000 program-generated uncontaminated images divided into 30 domains, where each domain tests one or more TVPS-4 skills. Our focus is on perception, so we make our domains quite simple and the reasoning and knowledge required for solving them are minimal. Since modern-day MLLMs can solve much more complex tasks, our a-priori expectation is that they will solve these domains very easily. Contrary to our belief, our experiments show a weak performance of SoTA proprietary and open-source MLLMs compared to very high human performance on Percept-V. We find that as number of objects in the image increases, performance goes down rather fast. Our experiments also identify the perception skills that are considerably harder for all models.

  Referring Expression Comprehension and Segmentation are critical tasks for assessing the integration of language understanding and image comprehension, serving as benchmarks for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) capabilities. To address these challenges, we propose a new strategy, CoT Referring, which enhances model reasoning across modalities through a structured, chain-of-thought training data structure. Our approach systematically parses textual structures to a sequential referring step, where in each step it identifies relationships and ensures consistent reference alignment, thereby improving accuracy in complex query scenarios. We restructure the training data to enforce a new output form, providing new annotations for existing datasets and compiling an evaluation benchmark from existing resources. This benchmark is designed explicitly for complex referring cases. We also integrate detection and segmentation capabilities into a unified MLLM framework, training it with a novel adaptive weighted loss to optimize performance. Experimental results on our curated benchmark and RefCOCO/+/g demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, with a notable increase of 2.5%+ over baseline models.

  Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in domains such as visual understanding and mathematical reasoning. However, their application in the medical domain is constrained by two key challenges: (1) multimodal medical datasets are scarce and often contain sparse information, limiting reasoning depth; and (2) Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), though effective in general domains, cannot reliably improve model performance in the medical domain. To overcome these challenges, during the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage, we incorporate high-quality textual reasoning data and general multimodal data alongside multimodal medical data to efficiently enhance foundational medical capabilities and restore the base model's reasoning ability. Moreover, considering that there are some multimodal medical datasets with sparse information, we further synthesize reflective-pattern-injected chain-of-thought (CoT) in addition to general CoT samples, equipping the model with initial reflective reasoning capabilities that provide a structured foundation for subsequent RLVR training. Finally, we introduce our InfiMed-Series models, InfiMed-SFT-3B and InfiMed-RL-3B, both of which deliver state-of-the-art performance across seven multimodal medical benchmarks. Notably, InfiMed-RL-3B achieves an average accuracy of 59.2%, outperforming even larger models like InternVL3-8B, which achieves 57.3%. Specifically, during the SFT phase, we utilized 188K samples, while the RLVR phase incorporated 36K samples, demonstrating the efficacy of both training strategies in achieving superior performance. We also conducted a series of extensive experiments, which provide valuable insights that contribute to advancing the performance of MLLMs in medical scenarios.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Table Visual Question Answering (Table VQA) is typically addressed by large vision-language models (VLMs). While such models can answer directly from images, they often miss fine-grained details unless scaled to very large sizes, which are computationally prohibitive, especially for mobile deployment. A lighter alternative is to have a small VLM perform OCR and then use a large language model (LLM) to reason over structured outputs such as Markdown tables. However, these representations are not naturally optimized for LLMs and still introduce substantial errors. We propose TALENT (Table VQA via Augmented Language-Enhanced Natural-text Transcription), a lightweight framework that leverages dual representations of tables. TALENT prompts a small VLM to produce both OCR text and natural language narration, then combines them with the question for reasoning by an LLM. This reframes Table VQA as an LLM-centric multimodal reasoning task, where the VLM serves as a perception-narration module rather than a monolithic solver. Additionally, we construct ReTabVQA, a more challenging Table VQA dataset requiring multi-step quantitative reasoning over table images. Experiments show that TALENT enables a small VLM-LLM combination to match or surpass a single large VLM at significantly lower computational cost on both public datasets and ReTabVQA.

  Agents utilizing tools powered by large language models (LLMs) or vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable progress in diverse tasks across text and visual modalities. Unlike traditional tools such as calculators, which give deterministic outputs, neural tools perform uncertainly across task scenarios. While different tools for a task may excel in varied scenarios, existing agents typically rely on fixed tools, thus limiting the flexibility in selecting the most suitable tool for specific tasks. In contrast, humans snowball their understanding of the capabilities of different tools by interacting with them, and apply this knowledge to select the optimal tool when solving a future task. To build agents that similarly benefit from this process, we propose ToolMem that enables agents to develop memories of tool capabilities from previous interactions, by summarizing their strengths and weaknesses and storing them in memory; at inference, the agent can retrieve relevant entries from ToolMem, and select the best tool to solve individual tasks more accurately. We evaluate ToolMem on learning varied text generation and text-to-image generation neural tools. Compared to no-memory, generic agents, we find ToolMem-augmented agents predict tool performance 14.8% and 28.7% more accurately across text and multimodal generation scenarios. Moreover, ToolMem facilitates optimal tool selection among multiple choices by 21% and 24% absolute increases in respective scenarios.

  With the rapid growth of academic publications, peer review has become an essential yet time-consuming responsibility within the research community. Large Language Models (LLMs) have increasingly been adopted to assist in the generation of review comments; however, current LLM-based review tasks lack a unified evaluation benchmark to rigorously assess the models' ability to produce comprehensive, accurate, and human-aligned assessments, particularly in scenarios involving multimodal content such as figures and tables. To address this gap, we propose \textbf{MMReview}, a comprehensive benchmark that spans multiple disciplines and modalities. MMReview includes multimodal content and expert-written review comments for 240 papers across 17 research domains within four major academic disciplines: Artificial Intelligence, Natural Sciences, Engineering Sciences, and Social Sciences. We design a total of 13 tasks grouped into four core categories, aimed at evaluating the performance of LLMs and Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) in step-wise review generation, outcome formulation, alignment with human preferences, and robustness to adversarial input manipulation. Extensive experiments conducted on 16 open-source models and 5 advanced closed-source models demonstrate the thoroughness of the benchmark. We envision MMReview as a critical step toward establishing a standardized foundation for the development of automated peer review systems.

  Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have exhibited remarkable advancements in integrating different modalities, excelling in complex understanding and generation tasks. Despite their success, MLLMs remain vulnerable to conversational adversarial inputs. In this paper, we systematically study gaslighting negation attacks: a phenomenon where models, despite initially providing correct answers, are persuaded by user-provided negations to reverse their outputs, often fabricating justifications. We conduct extensive evaluations of state-of-the-art MLLMs across diverse benchmarks and observe substantial performance drops when negation is introduced. Notably, we introduce the first benchmark GaslightingBench, specifically designed to evaluate the vulnerability of MLLMs to negation arguments. GaslightingBench consists of multiple-choice questions curated from existing datasets, along with generated negation prompts across 20 diverse categories. Throughout extensive evaluation, we find that proprietary models such as Gemini-1.5-flash and GPT-4o demonstrate better resilience compared to open-source counterparts like Qwen2-VL and LLaVA, though even advanced reasoning-oriented models like Gemini-2.5-Pro remain susceptible. Our category-level analysis further shows that subjective or socially nuanced domains (e.g., Social Relation, Image Emotion) are especially fragile, while more objective domains (e.g., Geography) exhibit relatively smaller but still notable drops. Overall, all evaluated MLLMs struggle to maintain logical consistency under gaslighting negation attack. These findings highlight a fundamental robustness gap and provide insights for developing more reliable and trustworthy multimodal AI systems. Project website:this https URL.

  Procedural mistake detection (PMD) is a challenging problem of classifying whether a human user (observed through egocentric video) has successfully executed a task (specified by a procedural text). Despite significant recent efforts, machine performance in the wild remains nonviable, and the reasoning processes underlying this performance are opaque. As such, we extend PMD to require generating visual self-dialog rationales to inform decisions. Given the impressive, mature image understanding capabilities observed in recent vision-and-language models (VLMs), we curate a suitable benchmark dataset for PMD based on individual frames. As our reformulation enables unprecedented transparency, we leverage a natural language inference (NLI) model to formulate two automated metrics for the coherence of generated rationales. We establish baselines for this reframed task, showing that VLMs struggle off-the-shelf, but with some trade-offs, their accuracy, coherence, and efficiency can be improved by incorporating these metrics into common inference and fine-tuning methods. Lastly, our multi-faceted metrics visualize common outcomes, highlighting areas for further improvement.

  Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) strive to achieve a profound, human-like understanding of and interaction with the physical world, but often exhibit a shallow and incoherent integration when acquiring information (Perception) and conducting reasoning (Cognition). This disconnect leads to a spectrum of reasoning failures, with hallucination being the most prominent. Collectively, these issues expose a fundamental challenge: the ability to process pixels does not yet confer the ability to construct a coherent, credible internal world model. To systematically dissect and address this challenge, this survey introduces a novel and unified analytical framework: ``From Perception to Cognition." We deconstruct the complex process of vision-language interactive understanding into two interdependent layers: Perception, the foundational ability to accurately extract visual information and achieve fine-grained alignment with textual instructions; and Cognition, the higher-order capability for proactive, multi-step, goal-oriented reasoning built upon this perceptual foundation, the core of which is the formation of a dynamic observe-think-verify reasoning loop. Guided by this framework, this paper systematically analyzes the key bottlenecks of current MLLMs at both layers. It surveys the landscape of cutting-edge methods designed to address these challenges, spanning from techniques that enhance low-level visual representations to those that improve high-level reasoning paradigms. Furthermore, we review critical benchmarks and delineate future research directions. This survey aims to provide the research community with a clear, structured perspective for understanding the intrinsic limitations of current MLLMs and to illuminate the path toward building next-generation models capable of deep reasoning and a genuine understanding of the world.
