  Despite the prevalence of transparent object interactions in human everyday life, transparent robotic manipulation research remains limited to short-horizon tasks and basic graspingthis http URLsome methods have partially addressed these issues, most of them have limitations in generalizability to novel objects and are insufficient for precise long-horizon robot manipulation. To address this limitation, we propose DeLTa (Demonstration and Language-Guided Novel Transparent Object Manipulation), a novel framework that integrates depth estimation, 6D pose estimation, and vision-language planning for precise long-horizon manipulation of transparent objects guided by natural task instructions. A key advantage of our method is its single-demonstration approach, which generalizes 6D trajectories to novel transparent objects without requiring category-level priors or additional training. Additionally, we present a task planner that refines the VLM-generated plan to account for the constraints of a single-arm, eye-in-hand robot for long-horizon object manipulation tasks. Through comprehensive evaluation, we demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing transparent object manipulation approaches, particularly in long-horizon scenarios requiring precise manipulation capabilities.

  Motion planning involves determining a sequence of robot configurations to reach a desired pose, subject to movement and safety constraints. Traditional motion planning finds collision-free paths, but this is overly restrictive in clutter, where it may not be possible for a robot to accomplish a task without contact. In addition, contacts range from relatively benign (e.g. brushing a soft pillow) to more dangerous (e.g. toppling a glass vase), making it difficult to characterize which may be acceptable. In this paper, we propose IMPACT, a novel motion planning framework that uses Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to infer environment semantics, identifying which parts of the environment can best tolerate contact based on object properties and locations. Our approach generates an anisotropic cost map that encodes directional push safety. We pair this map with a contact-aware A* planner to find stable contact-rich paths. We perform experiments using 20 simulation and 10 real-world scenes and assess using task success rate, object displacements, and feedback from human evaluators. Our results over 3200 simulation and 200 real-world trials suggest that IMPACT enables efficient contact-rich motion planning in cluttered settings while outperforming alternative methods and ablations.

- **[Medical Vision Language Models as Policies for Robotic Surgery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06064)**  `arXiv:2510.06064`  `cs.CV` `cs.LG`  
  _Akshay Muppidi, Martin Radfar_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision-based Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) struggles with visual observation-based robotic laparoscopic surgical tasks due to the high-dimensional nature of visual input, the sparsity of rewards in surgical environments, and the difficulty of extracting task-relevant features from raw visual data. We introduce a simple approach integrating MedFlamingo, a medical domain-specific Vision-Language Model, with PPO. Our method is evaluated on five diverse laparoscopic surgery task environments in LapGym, using only endoscopic visual observations. MedFlamingo PPO outperforms and converges faster compared to both standard vision-based PPO and OpenFlamingo PPO baselines, achieving task success rates exceeding 70% across all environments, with improvements ranging from 66.67% to 1114.29% compared to baseline. By processing task observations and instructions once per episode to generate high-level planning tokens, our method efficiently combines medical expertise with real-time visual feedback. Our results highlight the value of specialized medical knowledge in robotic surgical planning and decision-making.

- **[Can Video Large Multimodal Models Think Like Doubters-or Double-Down: A Study on Defeasible Video Entailment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22385)**  `arXiv:2506.22385`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI` `cs.CL`

  Video Large Multimodal Models (VLMMs) have made impressive strides in understanding video content, but they often struggle with abstract and adaptive reasoning-the ability to revise their interpretations when new information emerges. In reality, conclusions are rarely set in stone; additional context can strengthen or weaken an initial inference. To address this, we introduce Defeasible Video Entailment (DVidE), a new task that challenges models to think like doubters, constantly updating their reasoning based on evolving evidence. In DVidE, given a video premise and a textual hypothesis, models must determine whether a new update strengthens or weakens the hypothesis (classification version) or generate a coherent update that modifies the entailment relationship (generation version). For solving the classification task, we propose the Chain of Counterfactual Thought framework, utilizing counterfactual reasoning, ASR-enhanced video content, and rationale refinement to reduce inference bias. For the generation task, we develop a framework that combines ASR output with a Large Language Model (LLM) to produce coherent, contextually relevant updates aligned with the intended strengthener or weakener goals. Additionally, we introduce a novel benchmark dataset, with strengthener/weakener annotations and an LLM-based evaluation metric specifically designed for assessing generative performance. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements, highlighting our proposed method in enhancing dynamic reasoning capabilities of VLMMs.

- **[EgoNight: Towards Egocentric Vision Understanding at Night with a Challenging Benchmark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06218)**  `arXiv:2510.06218`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`  
  _Deheng Zhang, Yuqian Fu, Runyi Yang, Yang Miao, Tianwen Qian, Xu Zheng, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Most existing benchmarks for egocentric vision understanding focus primarily on daytime scenarios, overlooking the low-light conditions that are inevitable in real-world applications. To investigate this gap, we present EgoNight, the first comprehensive benchmark for nighttime egocentric vision, with visual question answering (VQA) as the core task. A key feature of EgoNight is the introduction of day-night aligned videos, which enhance night annotation quality using the daytime data and reveal clear performance gaps between lighting conditions. To achieve this, we collect both synthetic videos rendered by Blender and real-world recordings, ensuring that scenes and actions are visually and temporally aligned. Leveraging these paired videos, we construct EgoNight-VQA, supported by a novel day-augmented night auto-labeling engine and refinement through extensive human verification. Each QA pair is double-checked by annotators for reliability. In total, EgoNight-VQA contains 3658 QA pairs across 90 videos, spanning 12 diverse QA types, with more than 300 hours of human work. Evaluations of state-of-the-art multimodal large language models (MLLMs) reveal substantial performance drops when transferring from day to night, underscoring the challenges of reasoning under low-light conditions. Beyond VQA, EgoNight also introduces two auxiliary tasks, day-night correspondence retrieval and egocentric depth estimation at night, that further explore the boundaries of existing models. We believe EgoNight-VQA provides a strong foundation for advancing application-driven egocentric vision research and for developing models that generalize across illumination domains. All the data and code will be made available upon acceptance.

- **[Discrete Diffusion Models with MLLMs for Unified Medical Multimodal Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06131)**  `arXiv:2510.06131`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`

  Recent advances in generative medical models are constrained by modality-specific scenarios that hinder the integration of complementary evidence from imaging, pathology, and clinical notes. This fragmentation limits their evolution into foundation models that can learn and reason across the full spectrum of biomedical data. We propose MeDiM, the first medical discrete diffusion model that learns shared distributions across modalities without modality-specific components. MeDiM unifies multiple generative tasks: translating between images and text, and jointly producing image-report pairs across domains in response to prompts. Built on a discrete diffusion framework, MeDiM bridges vision and language representations through a shared probabilistic space. To enable unified and flexible medical generation, we employ a multimodal large language model (MLLM) as the diffusion backbone, leveraging its prior knowledge and cross-modal reasoning. Two key designs are introduced: (1) removing the causal attention mask for bidirectional context, and (2) injecting continuous timestep embeddings for diffusion awareness. Experiments demonstrate high-fidelity medical generation (FID 16.60 on MIMIC-CXR and FID 24.19 on PathGen) and accurate report generation (METEOR 0.2650 and 0.2580). Jointly generated image-report pairs further enhance downstream performance (plus6.43 percent BLEU-1, plus18.57 percent BLEU-2, plus31.58 percent BLEU-3, plus4.80 percent METEOR), showing that MeDiM supports coherent and clinically grounded multimodal outputs.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  CAPTCHA, originally designed to distinguish humans from robots, has evolved into a real-world benchmark for assessing the spatial reasoning capabilities of vision-language models. In this work, we first show that step-by-step reasoning is crucial for vision-language models (VLMs) to solve CAPTCHAs, which represent high-difficulty spatial reasoning tasks, and that current commercial vision-language models still struggle with such reasoning. In particular, we observe that most commercial VLMs (e.g., Gemini, Claude, GPT, etc.) fail to effectively solve CAPTCHAs and thus achieve low accuracy (around 21.9 percent). However, our findings indicate that requiring the model to perform step-by-step reasoning before generating the final coordinates can significantly enhance its solving accuracy, underscoring the severity of the gap. To systematically study this issue, we introduce CAPTCHA-X, the first real-world CAPTCHA benchmark with reasoning, covering seven categories of CAPTCHAs (such as Gobang, hCaptcha, etc.) with step-by-step action solutions and grounding annotations. We further define five reasoning-oriented metrics that enable a comprehensive evaluation of models reasoning capabilities. To validate the effectiveness of reasoning, we also propose a general agentic VLM-based framework that incorporates the models inherent reasoning abilities. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across five high-difficulty CAPTCHA types, with an average solving accuracy of 83.9 percent, substantially surpassing existing baselines. These results reveal the limitations of current models and highlight the importance of reasoning in advancing visual-spatial challenges in the future.

- **[HOI-R1: Exploring the Potential of Multimodal Large Language Models for Human-Object Interaction Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05609)**  `arXiv:2510.05609`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`  
  _Junwen Chen, Peilin Xiong, Keiji Yanai_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent Human-object interaction detection (HOID) methods highly require prior knowledge from VLMs to enhance the interaction recognition capabilities. The training strategies and model architectures for connecting the knowledge from VLMs to the HOI instance representations from the object detector are challenging, and the whole framework is complex for further development or application. On the other hand, the inherent reasoning abilities of MLLMs on human-object interaction detection are under-explored. Inspired by the recent success of training MLLMs with reinforcement learning (RL) methods, we propose HOI-R1 and first explore the potential of the language model on the HOID task without any additional detection modules. We introduce an HOI reasoning process and HOID reward functions to solve the HOID task by pure text. The results on the HICO-DET dataset show that HOI-R1 achieves 2x the accuracy of the baseline with great generalization ability. The source code is available atthis https URL.

- **[Seeing the Big Picture: Evaluating Multimodal LLMs' Ability to Interpret and Grade Handwritten Student Work](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05538)**  `arXiv:2510.05538`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`  
  _Owen Henkel, Bill Roberts, Doug Jaffe, Laurence Holt_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) raise the question of their potential for grading, analyzing, and offering feedback on handwritten student classwork. This capability would be particularly beneficial in elementary and middle-school mathematics education, where most work remains handwritten, because seeing students' full working of a problem provides valuable insights into their learning processes, but is extremely time-consuming to grade. We present two experiments investigating MLLM performance on handwritten student mathematics classwork. Experiment A examines 288 handwritten responses from Ghanaian middle school students solving arithmetic problems with objective answers. In this context, models achieved near-human accuracy (95%, k = 0.90) but exhibited occasional errors that human educators would be unlikely to make. Experiment B evaluates 150 mathematical illustrations from American elementary students, where the drawings are the answer to the question. These tasks lack single objective answers and require sophisticated visual interpretation as well as pedagogical judgment in order to analyze and evaluate them. We attempted to separate MLLMs' visual capabilities from their pedagogical abilities by first asking them to grade the student illustrations directly, and then by augmenting the image with a detailed human description of the illustration. We found that when the models had to analyze the student illustrations directly, they struggled, achieving only k = 0.20 with ground truth scores, but when given human descriptions, their agreement levels improved dramatically to k = 0.47, which was in line with human-to-human agreement levels. This gap suggests MLLMs can "see" and interpret arithmetic work relatively well, but still struggle to "see" student mathematical illustrations.

- **[See the past: Time-Reversed Scene Reconstruction from Thermal Traces Using Visual Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05408)**  `arXiv:2510.05408`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recovering the past from present observations is an intriguing challenge with potential applications in forensics and scene analysis. Thermal imaging, operating in the infrared range, provides access to otherwise invisible information. Since humans are typically warmer (37 C -98.6 F) than their surroundings, interactions such as sitting, touching, or leaning leave residual heat traces. These fading imprints serve as passive temporal codes, allowing for the inference of recent events that exceed the capabilities of RGB cameras. This work proposes a time-reversed reconstruction framework that uses paired RGB and thermal images to recover scene states from a few seconds earlier. The proposed approach couples Visual-Language Models (VLMs) with a constrained diffusion process, where one VLM generates scene descriptions and another guides image reconstruction, ensuring semantic and structural consistency. The method is evaluated in three controlled scenarios, demonstrating the feasibility of reconstructing plausible past frames up to 120 seconds earlier, providing a first step toward time-reversed imaging from thermal traces.

- **[Flow4Agent: Long-form Video Understanding via Motion Prior from Optical Flow](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05836)**  `arXiv:2510.05836`  `cs.CV`  
  _Ruyang Liu, Shangkun Sun, Haoran Tang, Ge Li, Wei Gao_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Long-form video understanding has always been a challenging problem due to the significant redundancy in both temporal and spatial contents. This challenge is further exacerbated by the limited context length of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). To address this issue, many previous works have attempted to extract key video information, where the "key" is typically semantic-aware and heavily dependent on the CLIP model as prior. In this paper, we propose Flow4Agent, a novel framework that pioneeringly incorporates motion priors from optical flow to facilitate LLM-based long video understanding. Flow4Agent mitigates the redundancy in long videos at both temporal and spatial levels through two core modules: Temporal Granularity Optimization (TGO) adaptively refines framelevel hierarchies, which first leverages coarse flow priors to group similar visual contents and then applies semantic priors to filter out highly irrelevant scene information. Motion Token Pruning (MTP) further refines the intra-frame visual representations, pruning high-redundancy video tokens using fine-grained optical flow information. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our Flow4Agent outperforms existing methods across a wide range of video MLLM benchmarks, especially for hour-level video understanding tasks, achieving 64.7% on Video-MME, 71.4% on MLVU and 60.4% on LongVideoBench.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Generating enough and diverse data through augmentation offers an efficient solution to the time-consuming and labour-intensive process of collecting and annotating pixel-wise images. Traditional data augmentation techniques often face challenges in manipulating high-level semantic attributes, such as materials and textures. In contrast, diffusion models offer a robust alternative, by effectively utilizing text-to-image or image-to-image transformation. However, existing diffusion-based methods are either computationally expensive or compromise on performance. To address this issue, we introduce a novel training-free pipeline that integrates pretrained ControlNet and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to generate synthetic images paired with pixel-level labels. This approach eliminates the need for manual annotations and significantly improves downstream tasks. To improve the fidelity and diversity, we add a Multi-way Prompt Generator, Mask Generator and High-quality Image Selection module. Our results on PASCAL-5i and COCO-20i present promising performance and outperform concurrent work for one-shot semantic segmentation.

- **[Context Matters: Learning Global Semantics for Visual Reasoning and Comprehension](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05674)**  `arXiv:2510.05674`  `cs.CV`  
  _Jike Zhong, Yuxiang Lai, Xiaofeng Yang, Konstantinos Psounis_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in language modeling have witnessed the rise of highly desirable emergent capabilities, such as reasoning and in-context learning. However, vision models have yet to exhibit comparable progress in these areas. In this paper, we argue that this gap could stem from the lack of semantic and contextual guidance in current vision transformer (ViT) training schemes, and such a gap can be narrowed through the design of a semantic-grounded objective. Specifically, we notice that individual words in natural language are inherently semantic, and modeling directly on word tokens naturally learns a realistic distribution. In contrast, ViTs rely on spatial patchification, which inevitably lacks semantic information. To bridge this gap, we propose to directly model "object" as the visual equivalence of "word," pushing the model to learn the global context and semantics among visual elements. We investigate our hypotheses via masked image modeling (MIM), a framework where our approach can be readily tested by applying masks to visual objects rather than random patches. Considerable evidence from qualitative and quantitative evaluations reveals a key finding: object-level representation alone helps to learn a real-world distribution, whereas pixel-averaging shortcuts are often learned without it. Moreover, further evaluations with multimodal LLMs (MLLM) on visual question answering (VQA, GQA, ScienceQA) tasks demonstrate the strong reasoning and contextual understanding gained with this simple objective. We hope our study highlights the effectiveness of object-level encoding and provides a plausible direction for developing stronger vision encoders and tokenizers. Code and model will be publicly released. Keywords: Semantic Visual Tokenizer, Vision Reasoning, In-context Learning, Multimodal Reasoning

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Existing Visual Language Models (VLMs) suffer structural limitations where a few low contribution tokens may excessively capture global semantics, dominating the information aggregation process and suppressing the discriminative features in text-driven image retrieval tasks. To address this, we introduce \textbf{CalibCLIP}, a training-free method designed to calibrate the suppressive effect of dominant tokens. Specifically, in the visual space, we propose the Contrastive Visual Enhancer (CVE), which decouples visual features into target and low information regions. Subsequently, it identifies dominant tokens and dynamically suppresses theirthis http URLthe textual space, we introduce the Discriminative Concept Calibrator (DCC), which aims to differentiate between general and discriminative concepts within the text query. By mitigating the challenges posed by generic concepts and improving the representations of discriminative concepts, DCC strengthens the differentiation among similar samples. Finally, extensive experiments demonstrate consistent improvements across seven benchmarks spanning three image retrieval tasks, underscoring the effectiveness of CalibCLIP.

- **[Self-Evolving Vision-Language Models for Image Quality Assessment via Voting and Ranking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25787)**  `arXiv:2509.25787`  `cs.CV`  
  _Wen Wen, Tianwu Zhi, Kanglong Fan, Yang Li, Xinge Peng, Yabin Zhang, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Improving vision-language models (VLMs) in the post-training stage typically relies on supervised fine-tuning or reinforcement learning, methods that necessitate costly, human-annotated data. While self-supervised techniques such as self-consistency have proven effective for enhancing reasoning capabilities, their application to perceptual domains such as image quality assessment (IQA) remains largely unexplored. In this work, we introduce EvoQuality, a novel framework that enables a VLM to autonomously refine its quality perception capabilities without any ground-truth labels. EvoQuality adapts the principle of self-consistency to the ranking-based nature of IQA. It generates pseudo-labels by performing pairwise majority voting on the VLM's own outputs to establish a consensus on relative quality. These pseudo-rankings are then formulated into a fidelity reward that guides the model's iterative evolution through group relative policy optimization (GRPO). By iteratively leveraging its own predictions, EvoQuality progressively refines the VLM's perceptual capability. Extensive experiments show that EvoQuality boosts the base VLM's zero-shot performance by 31.8\% on PLCC across diverse IQA benchmarks. Remarkably, despite being entirely self-supervised, EvoQuality achieves performance that is competitive with, or even surpasses, state-of-the-art supervised VLM-based IQA models, outperforming these models on 5 out of 7 IQA benchmarks.

  _Xu Jia_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel in vision-language reasoning but often struggle with structured perception tasks requiring precise localization and robustness. We propose a reinforcement learning framework that augments Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with curriculum-based data scheduling and difficulty-aware filtering. This approach stabilizes optimization under sparse, noisy rewards and enables progressive adaptation to complex samples. Evaluations on autonomous driving benchmarks demonstrate substantial improvements in detection accuracy and robustness. Ablation studies confirm the importance of reward design, KL regularization, and curriculum pacing for convergence stability and generalization. Our findings highlight reinforcement-driven optimization with structured data curricula as a scalable path toward robust and interpretable multimodal detection.

  _Younggun Kim, Sirnam Swetha, Fazil Kagdi, Mubarak Shah_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in vision-language tasks. However, these models often infer and reveal sensitive biometric attributes such as race, gender, age, body weight, and eye color; even when such information is not explicitly requested. This raises critical concerns, particularly in real-world applications and socially-sensitive domains. Despite increasing awareness, no publicly available dataset or benchmark exists to comprehensively evaluate or mitigate biometric leakage in MLLMs. To address this gap, we introduce PRISM (Privacy-aware Evaluation of Responses in Sensitive Modalities), a new benchmark designed to assess MLLMs on two fronts: (1) refuse biometric-related queries and (2) implicit biometric leakage in general responses while maintaining semantic faithfulness. Further, we conduct a detailed audit of the widely used LLaVA datasets and uncover extensive biometric leakage across pretraining and instruction data. To address this, we present Safe-LLaVA dataset, the first privacy-preserving MLLM training dataset constructed by systematically removing explicit and implicit biometric information from LLaVA dataset. Our evaluations on PRISM reveal biometric leakages across MLLMs for different attributes, highlighting the detailed privacy-violations. We also fine-tune a model on Safe-LLaVA dataset and show that it substantially reduces the biometric leakages. Together, Safe-LLaVA and PRISM set a new standard for privacy-aligned development and evaluation of MLLMs.

  _Ziyang Gong, Wenhao Li, Oliver Ma, Songyuan Li, Zhaokai Wang, Songyuan Li, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in various multimodal tasks. To pursue higher intelligence in space, MLLMs require integrating multiple spatial capabilities, even for handling simple and normal tasks. However, existing benchmarks struggle to comprehensively evaluate the spatial intelligence of common MLLMs from the atomic level to the compositional level. To fill this gap, we present SpaCE-10, a comprehensive benchmark for compositional spatial evaluations. In SpaCE-10, we define 10 atomic spatial capabilities, which are combined to form 8 compositional capabilities. Based on these definitions, we propose a novel hierarchical annotation pipeline to generate high-quality and diverse question-answer (QA) pairs. With over 150+ hours of human expert effort, we obtain over 5k QA pairs for 811 real indoor scenes in SpaCE-10, which covers various evaluation settings like point cloud input and multi-choice QA. We conduct an extensive evaluation of common MLLMs on SpaCE-10 and find that even the most advanced MLLM still lags behind humans by large margins. Through our careful study, we also draw several significant findings that benefit the MLLM community. For example, we reveal that the shortcoming of counting capability greatly limits the compositional spatial capabilities of existing MLLMs.

  _Ke Zhang, Cihan Xiao, Jiacong Xu, Yiqun Mei, Vishal M. Patel_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent video diffusion models have demonstrated their great capability in generating visually-pleasing results, while synthesizing the correct physical effects in generated videos remains challenging. The complexity of real-world motions, interactions, and dynamics introduce great difficulties when learning physics from data. In this work, we propose DiffPhy, a generic framework that enables physically-correct and photo-realistic video generation by fine-tuning a pre-trained video diffusion model. Our method leverages large language models (LLMs) to infer rich physical context from the text prompt. To incorporate this context into the video diffusion model, we use a multimodal large language model (MLLM) to verify intermediate latent variables against the inferred physical rules, guiding the gradient updates of model accordingly. Textual output of LLM is transformed into continuous signals. We then formulate a set of training objectives that jointly ensure physical accuracy and semantic alignment with the input text. Additionally, failure facts of physical phenomena are corrected via attention injection. We also establish a high-quality physical video dataset containing diverse phyiscal actions and events to facilitate effective finetuning. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks demonstrate that DiffPhy is able to produce state-of-the-art results across diverse physics-related scenarios.

- **[Inference-Time Text-to-Video Alignment with Diffusion Latent Beam Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19252)**  `arXiv:2501.19252`  `cs.CV`  
  _Yuta Oshima, Masahiro Suzuki, Yutaka Matsuo, Hiroki Furuta_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The remarkable progress in text-to-video diffusion models enables the generation of photorealistic videos, although the content of these generated videos often includes unnatural movement or deformation, reverse playback, and motionless scenes. Recently, an alignment problem has attracted huge attention, where we steer the output of diffusion models based on some measure of the content's goodness. Because there is a large room for improvement of perceptual quality along the frame direction, we should address which metrics we should optimize and how we can optimize them in the video generation. In this paper, we propose diffusion latent beam search with lookahead estimator, which can select a better diffusion latent to maximize a given alignment reward at inference time. We then point out that improving perceptual video quality with respect to alignment to prompts requires reward calibration by weighting existing metrics. This is because when humans or vision language models evaluate outputs, many previous metrics to quantify the naturalness of video do not always correlate with the evaluation. We demonstrate that our method improves the perceptual quality evaluated on the calibrated reward, VLMs, and human assessment, without model parameter update, and outputs the best generation compared to greedy search and best-of-N sampling under much more efficient computational cost. The experiments highlight that our method is beneficial to many capable generative models, and provide a practical guideline: we should prioritize the inference-time compute allocation into enabling the lookahead estimator and increasing the search budget, rather than expanding the denoising steps.

- **[Activation-Informed Pareto-Guided Low-Rank Compression for Efficient LLM/VLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05544)**  `arXiv:2510.05544`  `cs.CL` `cs.LG`  
  _Ryan Solgi, Parsa Madinei, Jiayi Tian, Rupak Swaminathan, Jing Liu, Nathan Susanj, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLM) and vision-language models (VLM) have achieved state-of-the-art performance, but they impose significant memory and computing challenges in deployment. We present a novel low-rank compression framework to address this challenge. First, we upper bound the change of network loss via layer-wise activation-based compression errors, filling a theoretical gap in the literature. We then formulate low-rank model compression as a bi-objective optimization and prove that a single uniform tolerance yields surrogate Pareto-optimal heterogeneous ranks. Based on our theoretical insights, we propose Pareto-Guided Singular Value Decomposition (PGSVD), a zero-shot pipeline that improves activation-aware compression via Pareto-guided rank selection and alternating least-squares implementation. We apply PGSVD to both LLM and VLM, showing better accuracy at the same compression levels and inference speedup.

  When thinking with images, humans rarely rely on a single glance: they revisit visual information repeatedly during reasoning. However, existing models typically process images only once and thereafter generate reasoning entirely in text, lacking mechanisms to re-access or ground inference in visual representations. We empirically confirm this: as reasoning chains lengthen, models progressively lose focus on relevant regions. In response, we introduce v1, a lightweight extension that enables active visual referencing through a simple point-and-copy approach. This allows the model to identify relevant image patches and copy their embeddings back into the reasoning stream, ensuring that evolving hypotheses remain grounded in perceptual evidence. Crucially, our pointing strategy lets the MLLM directly select image patches using their semantic representations as keys, keeping perceptual evidence embedded in the same space as the model's reasoning. To train this capability, we construct v1g, a dataset of 300K multimodal reasoning traces with interleaved visual grounding annotations. Across various multimodal mathematical reasoning benchmarks, v1 consistently outperforms comparable baselines, establishing point-and-copy as a practical mechanism for grounded reasoning. The model checkpoint and dataset are available atthis http URL.

- **[The Mirage of Performance Gains: Why Contrastive Decoding Fails to Mitigate Object Hallucinations in MLLMs?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10020)**  `arXiv:2504.10020`  `cs.CL` `cs.AI` `cs.CV`

  Contrastive decoding strategies are widely used to reduce object hallucinations in multimodal large language models (MLLMs). These methods work by constructing contrastive samples to induce hallucinations and then suppressing them in the output distribution. However, this paper demonstrates that such approaches fail to effectively mitigate the hallucination problem. The performance improvements observed on POPE Benchmark are largely driven by two misleading factors: (1) crude, unidirectional adjustments to the model's output distribution and (2) the adaptive plausibility constraint, which reduces the sampling strategy to greedy search. To further illustrate these issues, we introduce a series of spurious improvement methods and evaluate their performance against contrastive decoding techniques. Experimental results reveal that the observed performance gains in contrastive decoding are entirely unrelated to its intended goal of mitigating hallucinations. Our findings challenge common assumptions about the effectiveness of contrastive decoding strategies and pave the way for developing genuinely effective solutions to hallucinations in MLLMs.

  Implicit Attribute Value Extraction (AVE) is essential for accurately representing products in e-commerce, as it infers lantent attributes from multimodal data. Despite advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs), implicit AVE remains challenging due to the complexity of multidimensional data and gaps in vision-text understanding. In this work, we introduce \textsc{\modelname}, a multi-agent debate framework that employs multiple MLLM agents to iteratively refine inferences. Through a series of debate rounds, agents verify and update each other's responses, thereby improving inference performance and robustness. Experiments on the ImplicitAVE dataset demonstrate that even a few rounds of debate significantly boost accuracy, especially for attributes with initially low performance. We systematically evaluate various debate configurations, including identical or different MLLM agents, and analyze how debate rounds affect convergence dynamics. Our findings highlight the potential of multi-agent debate strategies to address the limitations of single-agent approaches and offer a scalable solution for implicit AVE in multimodal e-commerce.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The emergence of Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) presents new opportunities for chart understanding. However, due to the fine-grained nature of these tasks, applying MLLMs typically requires large, high-quality datasets for task-specific fine-tuning, leading to high data collection and training costs. To address this, we propose ChartCards, a unified chart-metadata generation framework for multi-task chart understanding. ChartCards systematically synthesizes various chart information, including data tables, visualization code, visual elements, and multi-dimensional semantic captions. By structuring this information into organized metadata, ChartCards enables a single chart to support multiple downstream tasks, such as text-to-chart retrieval, chart summarization, chart-to-table conversion, chart description, and chart question answering. Using ChartCards, we further construct MetaChart, a large-scale high-quality dataset containing 10,862 data tables, 85K charts, and 170 K high-quality chart captions. We validate the dataset through qualitative crowdsourcing evaluations and quantitative fine-tuning experiments across various chart understanding tasks. Fine-tuning six different models on MetaChart resulted in an average performance improvement of 5% across all tasks. The most notable improvements are seen in text-to-chart retrieval and chart-to-table tasks, with Long-CLIP and Llama 3.2-11B achieving improvements of 17% and 28%, respectively.

  Despite rapid advances in multimodal large language models, agricultural applications remain constrained by the scarcity of domain-tailored models, curated vision-language corpora, and rigorous evaluation. To address these challenges, we present the AgriGPT-VL Suite, a unified multimodal framework for agriculture. Our contributions are threefold. First, we introduce Agri-3M-VL, the largest vision-language corpus for agriculture to our knowledge, curated by a scalable multi-agent data generator; it comprises 1M image-caption pairs, 2M image-grounded VQA pairs, 50K expert-level VQA instances, and 15K GRPO reinforcement learning samples. Second, we develop AgriGPT-VL, an agriculture-specialized vision-language model trained via a progressive curriculum of textual grounding, multimodal shallow/deep alignment, and GRPO refinement. This method achieves strong multimodal reasoning while preserving text-only capability. Third, we establish AgriBench-VL-4K, a compact yet challenging evaluation suite with open-ended and image-grounded questions, paired with multi-metric evaluation and an LLM-as-a-judge framework. Experiments show that AgriGPT-VL outperforms leading general-purpose VLMs on AgriBench-VL-4K, achieving higher pairwise win rates in the LLM-as-a-judge evaluation. Meanwhile, it remains competitive on the text-only AgriBench-13K with no noticeable degradation of language ability. Ablation studies further confirm consistent gains from our alignment and GRPO refinement stages. We will open source all of the resources to support reproducible research and deployment in low-resource agricultural settings.

  Multimodal reasoning models have recently shown promise on challenging domains such as olympiad-level geometry, yet their evaluation remains dominated by aggregate accuracy, a single score that obscures where and how models are improving. We introduce MathLens, a benchmark designed to disentangle the subskills of multimodal reasoning while preserving the complexity of textbook-style geometry problems. The benchmark separates performance into three components: Perception: extracting information from raw inputs, Reasoning: operating on available information, and Integration: selecting relevant perceptual evidence and applying it within reasoning. To support each test, we provide annotations: visual diagrams, textual descriptions to evaluate reasoning in isolation, controlled questions that require both modalities, and probes for fine-grained perceptual skills, all derived from symbolic specifications of the problems to ensure consistency and robustness. Our analysis reveals that different training approaches have uneven effects: First, reinforcement learning chiefly strengthens perception, especially when supported by textual supervision, while textual SFT indirectly improves perception through reflective reasoning. Second, reasoning improves only in tandem with perception. Third, integration remains the weakest capacity, with residual errors concentrated there once other skills advance. Finally, robustness diverges: RL improves consistency under diagram variation, whereas multimodal SFT reduces it through overfitting. We will release all data and experimental logs.

  With the rapid growth of academic publications, peer review has become an essential yet time-consuming responsibility within the research community. Large Language Models (LLMs) have increasingly been adopted to assist in the generation of review comments; however, current LLM-based review tasks lack a unified evaluation benchmark to rigorously assess the models' ability to produce comprehensive, accurate, and human-aligned assessments, particularly in scenarios involving multimodal content such as figures and tables. To address this gap, we propose \textbf{MMReview}, a comprehensive benchmark that spans multiple disciplines and modalities. MMReview includes multimodal content and expert-written review comments for 240 papers across 17 research domains within four major academic disciplines: Artificial Intelligence, Natural Sciences, Engineering Sciences, and Social Sciences. We design a total of 13 tasks grouped into four core categories, aimed at evaluating the performance of LLMs and Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) in step-wise review generation, outcome formulation, alignment with human preferences, and robustness to adversarial input manipulation. Extensive experiments conducted on 16 open-source models and 5 advanced closed-source models demonstrate the thoroughness of the benchmark. We envision MMReview as a critical step toward establishing a standardized foundation for the development of automated peer review systems.

  Process Reward Models (PRMs) provide step-level supervision that improves the reliability of reasoning in large language models. While PRMs have been extensively studied in text-based domains, their extension to Vision Language Models (VLMs) remains limited. Existing Vision-Language PRMs (VL-PRMs) rely on Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for data construction, which can often produce noisy supervision signals and limit generalization across tasks. In this work, we aim to elucidate the design space of VL-PRMs by exploring diverse strategies for dataset construction, training, and test-time scaling. First, we introduce a hybrid data synthesis framework that combines MCTS with judgments from a strong VLM, producing more accurate step-level labels. Second, we propose perception-focused supervision, enabling our PRM to explicitly detect errors at the visual grounding stage of reasoning. Third, we systematically evaluate multiple test-time scaling strategies, showing that our PRMs can reliably guide VLMs toward more accurate solutions. Our experiments covering five diverse multimodal benchmarks (MMMU, PuzzleVQA, AlgoPuzzleVQA, MathVista, and MathVision) reveal several key insights: (i) VL-PRMs when used as Outcome Reward Models (ORMs) during test-time scaling (TTS) can outperform VL-PRM guided process step selection, (ii) smaller VL-PRMs can match or even surpass larger ones in detecting process errors, (iii) VL-PRMs uncover latent reasoning abilities in stronger VLM backbones, (iv) perception-level supervision leads to significant gains in test-time scaling, and (v) TTS performance of different policies improve on advanced math reasoning datasets despite not training VL-PRMs on such datasets. We hope our work will motivate further research and support the advancement of VLMs.

  Aligning multimodal large language models (MLLMs) with human preferences often relies on single-signal, model-based reward methods. Such monolithic rewards often lack confidence calibration across domain-specific tasks, fail to capture diverse aspects of human preferences, and require extensive data annotation and reward model training. In this work, we propose a hybrid reward modeling framework that integrates complementary reward paradigms: (i) model-based rewards, where a learned reward model predicts scalar or vector scores from synthetic and human feedback, and (ii) rule-based rewards, where domain-specific heuristics provide explicit correctness signals with confidence. Beyond accuracy, we further incorporate multi-aspect rewards to enforce instruction adherence and introduce a generalized length-penalty reward to stabilize training and improve performance. The proposed framework provides a flexible and effective approach to aligning MLLMs through reinforcement learning policy optimization. Our experiments show consistent improvements across different multimodal benchmarks when applying hybrid and multi-aspect reward modeling. Our best performing model in the 3B family achieves an overall average improvement of ~9.5% across general and math reasoning tasks. Focusing specifically on mathematical benchmarks, the model achieves a significant average improvement of ~16%, highlighting its effectiveness in mathematical reasoning and problem solving.
