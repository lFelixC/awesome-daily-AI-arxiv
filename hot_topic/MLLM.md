- **[Contrastive Representation Regularization for Vision-Language-Action Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01711)**  `arXiv:2510.01711`  `cs.RO` `cs.LG`

  Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have shown its capabilities in robot manipulation by leveraging rich representations from pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs). However, their representations arguably remain suboptimal, lacking sensitivity to robotic signals such as control actions and proprioceptive states. To address the issue, we introduce Robot State-aware Contrastive Loss (RS-CL), a simple and effective representation regularization for VLA models, designed to bridge the gap between VLM representations and robotic signals. In particular, RS-CL aligns the representations more closely with the robot's proprioceptive states, by using relative distances between the states as soft supervision. Complementing the original action prediction objective, RS-CL effectively enhances control-relevant representation learning, while being lightweight and fully compatible with standard VLA training pipeline. Our empirical results demonstrate that RS-CL substantially improves the manipulation performance of state-of-the-art VLA models; it pushes the prior art from 30.8% to 41.5% on pick-and-place tasks in RoboCasa-Kitchen, through more accurate positioning during grasping and placing, and boosts success rates from 45.0% to 58.3% on challenging real-robot manipulation tasks.

  3D indoor layout synthesis is crucial for creating virtual environments. Traditional methods struggle with generalization due to fixed datasets. While recent LLM and VLM-based approaches offer improved semantic richness, they often lack robust and flexible refinement, resulting in suboptimal layouts. We develop DisCo-Layout, a novel framework that disentangles and coordinates physical and semantic refinement. For independent refinement, our Semantic Refinement Tool (SRT) corrects abstract object relationships, while the Physical Refinement Tool (PRT) resolves concrete spatial issues via a grid-matching algorithm. For collaborative refinement, a multi-agent framework intelligently orchestrates these tools, featuring a planner for placement rules, a designer for initial layouts, and an evaluator for assessment. Experiments demonstrate DisCo-Layout's state-of-the-art performance, generating realistic, coherent, and generalizable 3D indoor layouts. Our code will be publicly available.

  Robots must adapt to diverse human instructions and operate safely in unstructured, open-world environments. Recent Vision-Language models (VLMs) offer strong priors for grounding language and perception, but remain difficult to steer for navigation due to differences in action spaces and pretraining objectives that hamper transferability to robotics tasks. Towards addressing this, we introduce VENTURA, a vision-language navigation system that finetunes internet-pretrained image diffusion models for path planning. Instead of directly predicting low-level actions, VENTURA generates a path mask (i.e. a visual plan) in image space that captures fine-grained, context-aware navigation behaviors. A lightweight behavior-cloning policy grounds these visual plans into executable trajectories, yielding an interface that follows natural language instructions to generate diverse robot behaviors. To scale training, we supervise on path masks derived from self-supervised tracking models paired with VLM-augmented captions, avoiding manual pixel-level annotation or highly engineered data collection setups. In extensive real-world evaluations, VENTURA outperforms state-of-the-art foundation model baselines on object reaching, obstacle avoidance, and terrain preference tasks, improving success rates by 33% and reducing collisions by 54% across both seen and unseen scenarios. Notably, we find that VENTURA generalizes to unseen combinations of distinct tasks, revealing emergent compositional capabilities. Videos, code, and additional materials:this https URL

- **[Poutine: Vision-Language-Trajectory Pre-Training and Reinforcement Learning Post-Training Enable Robust End-to-End Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11234)**  `arXiv:2506.11234`  `cs.RO` `cs.CV`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Maintaining good driving behavior in out-of-distribution scenarios remains a critical challenge in autonomous driving. A promising direction is to leverage the generalist knowledge and reasoning capabilities of large-language models by treating unusual driving scenarios as a logical reasoning task. In this work, we present Poutine, a method that uses an off-the-shelf 3B-parameter vision-language model (VLM) - without any additional components - to achieve robust end-to-end autonomous driving via a simple and scalable training recipe. To learn strong base driving capabilities, we first train Poutine-Base using self-supervised next-token prediction over vision, language, and trajectory (VLT) tokens, leveraging both nominal and long-tail driving data. In the second stage, we fine-tune Poutine-Base using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with a small set of human preference-labeled examples. We evaluated our approach on the Waymo end-to-end driving benchmark curated for long-tail scenarios. The final Poutine model achieves an RFS of 7.99 on the test set, placing 1st in the 2025 Waymo Vision-Based End-to-End Driving Challenge by a significant margin. Our results suggest that handcrafted tokenizers or custom architectural components added to base VLMs in prior work are not necessary to achieve strong driving performance. Instead, this work highlights the potential of scalable VLT pretraining combined with lightweight RL fine-tuning to enable robust and generalizable autonomous driving.

- **[Nav-EE: Navigation-Guided Early Exiting for Efficient Vision-Language Models in Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01795)**  `arXiv:2510.01795`  `cs.RO` `cs.AI`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly applied in autonomous driving for unified perception and reasoning, but high inference latency hinders real-time deployment. Early-exit reduces latency by terminating inference at intermediate layers, yet its task-dependent nature limits generalization across diverse scenarios. We observe that this limitation aligns with autonomous driving: navigation systems can anticipate upcoming contexts (e.g., intersections, traffic lights), indicating which tasks will be required. We propose Nav-EE, a navigation-guided early-exit framework that precomputes task-specific exit layers offline and dynamically applies them online based on navigation priors. Experiments on CODA, Waymo, and BOSCH show that Nav-EE achieves accuracy comparable to full inference while reducing latency by up to 63.9%. Real-vehicle integration with Autoware Universe further demonstrates reduced inference latency (600ms to 300ms), supporting faster decision-making in complex scenarios. These results suggest that coupling navigation foresight with early-exit offers a viable path toward efficient deployment of large models in autonomous systems.

- **[VL-KnG: Visual Scene Understanding for Navigation Goal Identification using Spatiotemporal Knowledge Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01483)**  `arXiv:2510.01483`  `cs.RO` `cs.AI`  
  _Mohamad Al Mdfaa, Svetlana Lukina, Timur Akhtyamov, Arthur Nigmatzyanov, Dmitrii Nalberskii, Sergey Zagoruyko, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown potential for robot navigation but encounter fundamental limitations: they lack persistent scene memory, offer limited spatial reasoning, and do not scale effectively with video duration for real-time application. We present VL-KnG, a Visual Scene Understanding system that tackles these challenges using spatiotemporal knowledge graph construction and computationally efficient query processing for navigation goal identification. Our approach processes video sequences in chunks utilizing modern VLMs, creates persistent knowledge graphs that maintain object identity over time, and enables explainable spatial reasoning through queryable graph structures. We also introduce WalkieKnowledge, a new benchmark with about 200 manually annotated questions across 8 diverse trajectories spanning approximately 100 minutes of video data, enabling fair comparison between structured approaches and general-purpose VLMs. Real-world deployment on a differential drive robot demonstrates practical applicability, with our method achieving 77.27% success rate and 76.92% answer accuracy, matching Gemini 2.5 Pro performance while providing explainable reasoning supported by the knowledge graph, computational efficiency for real-time deployment across different tasks, such as localization, navigation and planning. Code and dataset will be released after acceptance.

- **[FailSafe: Reasoning and Recovery from Failures in Vision-Language-Action Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01642)**  `arXiv:2510.01642`  `cs.RO`  
  _Zijun Lin, Jiafei Duan, Haoquan Fang, Dieter Fox, Ranjay Krishna, Cheston Tan, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in robotic manipulation have integrated low-level robotic control into Vision-Language Models (VLMs), extending them into Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models. Although state-of-the-art VLAs achieve strong performance in downstream robotic applications, supported by large-scale crowd-sourced robot training data, they still inevitably encounter failures during execution. Enabling robots to reason about and recover from unpredictable and abrupt failures remains a critical challenge. Existing robotic manipulation datasets, collected in either simulation or the real world, primarily provide only ground-truth trajectories, leaving robots unable to recover once failures occur. Moreover, the few datasets that address failure detection typically offer only textual explanations, which are difficult to utilize directly in VLA models. To address this gap, we introduce FailSafe, a novel failure generation and recovery system that automatically produces diverse failure cases paired with executable recovery actions. FailSafe can be seamlessly applied to any manipulation task in any simulator, enabling scalable creation of failure-action data. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we fine-tune LLaVa-OneVision-7B (LLaVa-OV-7B) to build FailSafe-VLM. Experimental results show that FailSafe-VLM successfully helps robotic arm detect and recover from potential failures, improving the performance of three state-of-the-art VLA models pi0-FAST, OpenVLA, OpenVLA-OFT) by up to 22.6% on average across several tasks in Maniskill. Furthermore, FailSafe-VLM could generalize across different spatial configurations, camera viewpoints, and robotic embodiments. We plan to release the FailSafe code to the community.

- **[CRAFT: Coaching Reinforcement Learning Autonomously using Foundation Models for Multi-Robot Coordination Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14380)**  `arXiv:2509.14380`  `cs.RO`  
  _Seoyeon Choi, Kanghyun Ryu, Jonghoon Ock, Negar Mehr_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) provides a powerful framework for learning coordination in multi-agent systems. However, applying MARL to robotics still remains challenging due to high-dimensional continuous joint action spaces, complex reward design, and non-stationary transitions inherent to decentralized settings. On the other hand, humans learn complex coordination through staged curricula, where long-horizon behaviors are progressively built upon simpler skills. Motivated by this, we propose CRAFT: Coaching Reinforcement learning Autonomously using Foundation models for multi-robot coordination Tasks, a framework that leverages the reasoning capabilities of foundation models to act as a "coach" for multi-robot coordination. CRAFT automatically decomposes long-horizon coordination tasks into sequences of subtasks using the planning capability of Large Language Models (LLMs). In what follows, CRAFT trains each subtask using reward functions generated by LLM, and refines them through a Vision Language Model (VLM)-guided reward-refinement loop. We evaluate CRAFT on multi-quadruped navigation and bimanual manipulation tasks, demonstrating its capability to learn complex coordination behaviors. In addition, we validate the multi-quadruped navigation policy in real hardware experiments.

- **[Physics-Constrained Robot Grasp Planning for Dynamic Tool Use](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01399)**  `arXiv:2505.01399`  `cs.RO`  
  _Noah Trupin, Zixing Wang, Ahmed H. Qureshi_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Tool use requires not only selecting appropriate tools but also generating grasps and motions that remain stable under dynamic interactions. Existing approaches largely focus on high-level tool grounding or quasi-static manipulation, overlooking stability in dynamic and cluttered regimes. We introduce iTuP (inverse Tool-use Planning), a framework that outputs robot grasps explicitly tailored for tool use. iTuP integrates a physics-constrained grasp generator with a task-conditional scoring function to produce grasps that remain stable during dynamic tool interactions. These grasps account for manipulation trajectories, torque requirements, and slip prevention, enabling reliable execution of real-world tasks. Experiments across hammering, sweeping, knocking, and reaching tasks demonstrate that iTuP outperforms geometry-based and vision-language model (VLM)-based baselines in grasp stability and task success. Our results underscore that physics-constrained grasping is essential for robust robot tool use in quasi-static, dynamic, and cluttered environments.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) open new possibilities for constructing realistic and interpretable macroeconomic simulations. We present SimCity, a multi-agent framework that leverages LLMs to model an interpretable macroeconomic system with heterogeneous agents and rich interactions. Unlike classical equilibrium models that limit heterogeneity for tractability, or traditional agent-based models (ABMs) that rely on hand-crafted decision rules, SimCity enables flexible, adaptive behavior with transparent natural-language reasoning. Within SimCity, four core agent types (households, firms, a central bank, and a government) deliberate and participate in a frictional labor market, a heterogeneous goods market, and a financial market. Furthermore, a Vision-Language Model (VLM) determines the geographic placement of new firms and renders a mapped virtual city, allowing us to study both macroeconomic regularities and urban expansion dynamics within a unified environment. To evaluate the framework, we compile a checklist of canonical macroeconomic phenomena, including price elasticity of demand, Engel's Law, Okun's Law, the Phillips Curve, and the Beveridge Curve, and show that SimCity naturally reproduces these empirical patterns while remaining robust across simulation runs.

- **[Understanding Adversarial Transfer: Why Representation-Space Attacks Fail Where Data-Space Attacks Succeed](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01494)**  `arXiv:2510.01494`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The field of adversarial robustness has long established that adversarial examples can successfully transfer between image classifiers and that text jailbreaks can successfully transfer between language models (LMs). However, a pair of recent studies reported being unable to successfully transfer image jailbreaks between vision-language models (VLMs). To explain this striking difference, we propose a fundamental distinction regarding the transferability of attacks against machine learning models: attacks in the input data-space can transfer, whereas attacks in model representation space do not, at least not without geometric alignment of representations. We then provide theoretical and empirical evidence of this hypothesis in four different settings. First, we mathematically prove this distinction in a simple setting where two networks compute the same input-output map but via different representations. Second, we construct representation-space attacks against image classifiers that are as successful as well-known data-space attacks, but fail to transfer. Third, we construct representation-space attacks against LMs that successfully jailbreak the attacked models but again fail to transfer. Fourth, we construct data-space attacks against VLMs that successfully transfer to new VLMs, and we show that representation space attacks \emph{can} transfer when VLMs' latent geometries are sufficiently aligned in post-projector space. Our work reveals that adversarial transfer is not an inherent property of all attacks but contingent on their operational domain - the shared data-space versus models' unique representation spaces - a critical insight for building more robust models.

- **[Accelerating Attention with Basis Decomposition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01718)**  `arXiv:2510.01718`  `cs.LG`  
  _Jialin Zhao_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Attention is a core operation in large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs). We present BD Attention (BDA), the first lossless algorithmic reformulation of attention. BDA is enabled by a simple matrix identity from Basis Decomposition (BD), which restructures multi-head projections into a compact form while preserving exact outputs. Unlike I/O-aware system optimizations such as FlashAttention, BDA provides a mathematically guaranteed acceleration that is architecture-agnostic. On DeepSeek-V2-Lite (16B, FP16), BDA requires only 4s of offline preparation with no retraining required and, on modern GPUs, achieves 32% faster key/value projections and 25% smaller weights, while increasing end-to-end perplexity (PPL) by just 0.02% (FP16) or 0.0004% (FP32), a negligible effect on model performance. These results position BDA as the first theoretically exact method for lossless attention acceleration that is complementary to existing engineering-level optimizations.

- **[Inferring Dynamic Physical Properties from Video Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02311)**  `arXiv:2510.02311`  `cs.CV` `cs.LG`  
  _Guanqi Zhan, Xianzheng Ma, Weidi Xie, Andrew Zisserman_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We study the task of predicting dynamic physical properties from videos. More specifically, we consider physical properties that require temporal information to be inferred: elasticity of a bouncing object, viscosity of a flowing liquid, and dynamic friction of an object sliding on a surface. To this end, we make the following contributions: (i) We collect a new video dataset for each physical property, consisting of synthetic training and testing splits, as well as a real split for real world evaluation. (ii) We explore three ways to infer the physical property from videos: (a) an oracle method where we supply the visual cues that intrinsically reflect the property using classical computer vision techniques; (b) a simple read out mechanism using a visual prompt and trainable prompt vector for cross-attention on pre-trained video generative and self-supervised models; and (c) prompt strategies for Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs). (iii) We show that video foundation models trained in a generative or self-supervised manner achieve a similar performance, though behind that of the oracle, and MLLMs are currently inferior to the other models, though their performance can be improved through suitable prompting.

- **[VidGuard-R1: AI-Generated Video Detection and Explanation via Reasoning MLLMs and RL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02282)**  `arXiv:2510.02282`  `cs.CV` `cs.LG`  
  _Kyoungjun Park, Yifan Yang, Juheon Yi, Shicheng Zheng, Yifei Shen, Dongqi Han, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  With the rapid advancement of AI-generated videos, there is an urgent need for effective detection tools to mitigate societal risks such as misinformation and reputational harm. In addition to accurate classification, it is essential that detection models provide interpretable explanations to ensure transparency for regulators and end users. To address these challenges, we introduce VidGuard-R1, the first video authenticity detector that fine-tunes a multi-modal large language model (MLLM) using group relative policy optimization (GRPO). Our model delivers both highly accurate judgments and insightful reasoning. We curate a challenging dataset of 140k real and AI-generated videos produced by state-of-the-art generation models, carefully designing the generation process to maximize discrimination difficulty. We then fine-tune Qwen-VL using GRPO with two specialized reward models that target temporal artifacts and generation complexity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VidGuard-R1 achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on existing benchmarks, with additional training pushing accuracy above 95%. Case studies further show that VidGuard-R1 produces precise and interpretable rationales behind its predictions. The code is publicly available atthis https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent attempts to transfer features from 2D Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to 3D semantic segmentation expose a persistent trade-off. Directly projecting 2D features into 3D yields noisy and fragmented predictions, whereas enforcing geometric coherence necessitates costly training pipelines and large-scale annotated 3D data. We argue that this limitation stems from the dominant segmentation-and-matching paradigm, which fails to reconcile 2D semantics with 3D geometric structure. The geometric cues are not eliminated during the 2D-to-3D transfer but remain latent within the noisy and view-aggregated features. To exploit this property, we propose GeoPurify that applies a small Student Affinity Network to purify 2D VLM-generated 3D point features using geometric priors distilled from a 3D self-supervised teacher model. During inference, we devise a Geometry-Guided Pooling module to further denoise the point cloud and ensure the semantic and structural consistency. Benefiting from latent geometric information and the learned affinity network, GeoPurify effectively mitigates the trade-off and achieves superior data efficiency. Extensive experiments on major 3D benchmarks demonstrate that GeoPurify achieves or surpasses state-of-the-art performance while utilizing only about 1.5% of the training data.

  _Krishna Teja Chitty-Venkata, Murali Emani_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We develop ImageNet-Think, a multimodal reasoning dataset designed to aid the development of Vision Language Models (VLMs) with explicit reasoning capabilities. Our dataset is built on 250,000 images from ImageNet21k dataset, providing structured thinking tokens and corresponding answers. Our synthetic dataset is generated by two state-of-the-art VLMs: GLM-4.1V-9B-Thinking and Kimi-VL-A3B-Thinking-2506. Each image is accompanied by two pairs of thinking-answer sequences, creating a resource for training and evaluating multimodal reasoning models. We capture the step-by-step reasoning process of VLMs and the final descriptive answers. Our goal with this dataset is to enable the development of more robust VLMs while contributing to the broader understanding of multimodal reasoning mechanisms. The dataset and evaluation benchmarks will be publicly available to aid research in reasoning/thinking multimodal VLMs.

- **[Growing Visual Generative Capacity for Pre-Trained MLLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01546)**  `arXiv:2510.01546`  `cs.CV` `cs.LG`  
  _Hanyu Wang, Jiaming Han, Ziyan Yang, Qi Zhao, Shanchuan Lin, Xiangyu Yue, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) extend the success of language models to visual understanding, and recent efforts have sought to build unified MLLMs that support both understanding and generation. However, constructing such models remains challenging: hybrid approaches combine continuous embeddings with diffusion or flow-based objectives, producing high-quality images but breaking the autoregressive paradigm, while pure autoregressive approaches unify text and image prediction over discrete visual tokens but often face trade-offs between semantic alignment and pixel-level fidelity. In this work, we present Bridge, a pure autoregressive unified MLLM that augments pre-trained visual understanding models with generative ability through a Mixture-of-Transformers architecture, enabling both image understanding and generation within a single next-token prediction framework. To further improve visual generation fidelity, we propose a semantic-to-pixel discrete representation that integrates compact semantic tokens with fine-grained pixel tokens, achieving strong language alignment and precise description of visual details with only a 7.9% increase in sequence length. Extensive experiments across diverse multimodal benchmarks demonstrate that Bridge achieves competitive or superior results in both understanding and generation benchmarks, while requiring less training data and reduced training time compared to prior unified MLLMs.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Data-efficient learning aims to eliminate redundancy in large training datasets by training models on smaller subsets of the most informative examples. While data selection has been extensively explored for vision models and large language models (LLMs), it remains underexplored for Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). Notably, none of existing methods can outperform random selection at different subset sizes. In this work, we propose the first principled method for data-efficient instruction tuning of LVLMs. We prove that examples with similar cross-modal attention matrices during instruction tuning have similar gradients. Thus, they influence model parameters in a similar manner and convey the same information to the model during training. Building on this insight, we propose XMAS, which clusters examples based on the trajectories of the top singular values of their attention matrices obtained from fine-tuning a small proxy LVLM. By sampling a balanced subset from these clusters, XMAS effectively removes redundancy in large-scale LVLM training data. Extensive experiments show that XMAS can discard 50% of the LLaVA-665k dataset and 85% of the Vision-Flan dataset while fully preserving performance of LLaVA-1.5-7B on 10 downstream benchmarks and speeding up its training by 1.2x. This is 30% more data reduction compared to the best baseline for LLaVA-665k. The project's website can be found atthis https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP and SigLIP, have found remarkable success in classification, retrieval, and generative tasks. For this, VLMs deterministically map images and text descriptions to a joint latent space in which their similarity is assessed using the cosine similarity. However, a deterministic mapping of inputs fails to capture uncertainties over concepts arising from domain shifts when used in downstream tasks. In this work, we propose post-hoc uncertainty estimation in VLMs that does not require additional training. Our method leverages a Bayesian posterior approximation over the last layers in VLMs and analytically quantifies uncertainties over cosine similarities. We demonstrate its effectiveness for uncertainty quantification and support set selection in active learning. Compared to baselines, we obtain improved and well-calibrated predictive uncertainties, interpretable uncertainty estimates, and sample-efficient active learning. Our results show promise for safety-critical applications of large-scale models.

- **[Efficient Whole Slide Pathology VQA via Token Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14497)**  `arXiv:2507.14497`  `cs.CV` `cs.CL`  
  _Weimin Lyu, Qingqiao Hu, Kehan Qi, Zhan Shi, Wentao Huang, Saumya Gupta, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Whole-slide images (WSIs) in pathology can reach up to 10,000 x 10,000 pixels, posing significant challenges for multimodal large language model (MLLM) due to long context length and high computational demands. Previous methods typically focus on patch-level analysis or slide-level classification using CLIP-based models with multi-instance learning, but they lack the generative capabilities needed for visual question answering (VQA). More recent MLLM-based approaches address VQA by feeding thousands of patch tokens directly into the language model, which leads to excessive resource consumption. To address these limitations, we propose Token Compression Pathology LLaVA (TCP-LLaVA), the first MLLM architecture to perform WSI VQA via token compression. TCP-LLaVA introduces a set of trainable compression tokens that aggregate visual and textual information through a modality compression module, inspired by the [CLS] token mechanism in BERT. Only the compressed tokens are forwarded to the LLM for answer generation, significantly reducing input length and computational cost. Experiments on ten TCGA tumor subtypes show that TCP-LLaVA outperforms existing MLLM baselines in VQA accuracy while reducing training resource consumption by a substantial margin.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision language models (VLMs) perform well on many tasks but often fail at spatial reasoning, which is essential for navigation and interaction with physical environments. Many spatial reasoning tasks depend on fundamental two-dimensional (2D) skills, yet our evaluation shows that state-of-the-art VLMs give implausible or incorrect answers to composite spatial problems, including simple pathfinding tasks that humans solve effortlessly. To address this, we enhance 2D spatial reasoning in VLMs by training them only on basic spatial capabilities. We first disentangle 2D spatial reasoning into three core components: direction comprehension, distance estimation, and localization. We hypothesize that mastering these skills substantially improves performance on complex spatial tasks that require advanced reasoning and combinatorial problem solving, while also generalizing to real-world scenarios. To test this, we introduce Sparkle, a framework that generates synthetic data to provide targeted supervision across these three capabilities and yields an instruction dataset for each. Experiments show that VLMs fine-tuned with \emph{Sparkle} improve not only on basic tasks but also on composite and out-of-distribution real-world spatial reasoning tasks.

  Video understanding in multimodal language models remains limited by context length: models often miss key transition frames and struggle to maintain coherence across long time scales. To address this, we adapt Native Sparse Attention (NSA) to video-language models. Our method, VideoNSA, adapts Qwen2.5-VL through end-to-end training on a 216K video instruction dataset. We employ a hardware-aware hybrid approach to attention, preserving dense attention for text, while employing NSA for video. Compared to token-compression and training-free sparse baselines, VideoNSA achieves improved performance on long-video understanding, temporal reasoning, and spatial benchmarks. Further ablation analysis reveals four key findings: (1) reliable scaling to 128K tokens; (2) an optimal global-local attention allocation at a fixed budget; (3) task-dependent branch usage patterns; and (4) the learnable combined sparse attention help induce dynamic attention sinks.

  Drag-based image editing has long suffered from distortions in the target region, largely because the priors of earlier base models, Stable Diffusion, are insufficient to project optimized latents back onto the natural image manifold. With the shift from UNet-based DDPMs to more scalable DiT with flow matching (e.g., SD3.5, FLUX), generative priors have become significantly stronger, enabling advances across diverse editing tasks. However, drag-based editing has yet to benefit from these stronger priors. This work proposes the first framework to effectively harness FLUX's rich prior for drag-based editing, dubbed DragFlow, achieving substantial gains over baselines. We first show that directly applying point-based drag editing to DiTs performs poorly: unlike the highly compressed features of UNets, DiT features are insufficiently structured to provide reliable guidance for point-wise motion supervision. To overcome this limitation, DragFlow introduces a region-based editing paradigm, where affine transformations enable richer and more consistent feature supervision. Additionally, we integrate pretrained open-domain personalization adapters (e.g., IP-Adapter) to enhance subject consistency, while preserving background fidelity through gradient mask-based hard constraints. Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are further employed to resolve task ambiguities. For evaluation, we curate a novel Region-based Dragging benchmark (ReD Bench) featuring region-level dragging instructions. Extensive experiments on DragBench-DR and ReD Bench show that DragFlow surpasses both point-based and region-based baselines, setting a new state-of-the-art in drag-based image editing. Code and datasets will be publicly available upon publication.

  Spatial intelligence spans a rich suite of abilities, including visualising and transforming shapes, mentally rotating objects, judging relational positions and containment, and estimating numerosity. However, it still remains a critical unresolved challenge for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs).To fill this gap, we propose to treat Euclidean geometry problem-solving as a surrogate task. Specifically, we meticulously constructed a curated multimodal dataset, called Euclid30K, comprising approximately 30K plane and solid geometry problems. To enable the model to acquire and apply Euclidean principles from these geometry problems, we employed Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to finetune the Qwen2.5VL family and RoboBrain2.0 family, inspiring the models to identify shapes, count, and relate entities, and perform multi-step deductive reasoning using Euclidean principles. Our experiments demonstrate that the resulting models achieve substantial zero-shot gains across four spatial reasoning benchmarks (Super-CLEVR, Omni3DBench, VSI-Bench, and MindCube) without any task-specific adaptations. Notably, after training on the Euclid30K, the mean VSI-Bench accuracy of all evaluated models rose from 34.5% to 40.5%, improving by 5.5 percentage points. Among them, RoboBrain2.0-Euclid-7B achieves 49.6\% accuracy, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art model,this http URLour knowledge, this is the first systematic study showing that geometry-centric fine-tuning can confer vision-language models with broadly transferable spatial skills.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Unsupervised adaptation of CLIP-based vision-language models (VLMs) for fine-grained image classification requires sensitivity to microscopic local cues. While CLIP exhibits strong zero-shot transfer, its reliance on coarse global features restricts its performance on fine-grained classification tasks. Prior efforts inject fine-grained knowledge by aligning large language model (LLM) descriptions with the CLIP $\texttt{[CLS]}$ token; however, this approach overlooks spatial precision. We propose $\textbf{microCLIP}$, a self-training framework that jointly refines CLIP's visual and textual representations using fine-grained cues. At its core is Saliency-Oriented Attention Pooling (SOAP) within a lightweight TokenFusion module, which builds a saliency-guided $\texttt{[FG]}$ token from patch embeddings and fuses it with the global $\texttt{[CLS]}$ token for coarse-fine alignment. To stabilize adaptation, we introduce a two-headed LLM-derived classifier: a frozen classifier that, via multi-view alignment, provides a stable text-based prior for pseudo-labeling, and a learnable classifier initialized from LLM descriptions and fine-tuned with TokenFusion. We further develop Dynamic Knowledge Aggregation, which convexly combines fixed LLM/CLIP priors with TokenFusion's evolving logits to iteratively refine pseudo-labels. Together, these components uncover latent fine-grained signals in CLIP, yielding a consistent $2.90\%$ average accuracy gain across 13 fine-grained benchmarks while requiring only light adaptation.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Fine-grained visual reasoning remains a core challenge for multimodal large language models (MLLMs). The recently introduced ReasonMap highlights this gap by showing that even advanced MLLMs struggle with spatial reasoning in structured and information-rich settings such as transit maps, a task of clear practical and scientific importance. However, standard reinforcement learning (RL) on such tasks is impeded by sparse rewards and unstable optimization. To address this, we first construct ReasonMap-Plus, an extended dataset that introduces dense reward signals through Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks, enabling effective cold-start training of fine-grained visual understanding skills. Next, we propose RewardMap, a multi-stage RL framework designed to improve both visual understanding and reasoning capabilities of MLLMs. RewardMap incorporates two key designs. First, we introduce a difficulty-aware reward design that incorporates detail rewards, directly tackling the sparse rewards while providing richer supervision. Second, we propose a multi-stage RL scheme that bootstraps training from simple perception to complex reasoning tasks, offering a more effective cold-start strategy than conventional Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). Experiments on ReasonMap and ReasonMap-Plus demonstrate that each component of RewardMap contributes to consistent performance gains, while their combination yields the best results. Moreover, models trained with RewardMap achieve an average improvement of 3.47% across 6 benchmarks spanning spatial reasoning, fine-grained visual reasoning, and general tasks beyond transit maps, underscoring enhanced visual understanding and reasoning capabilities.

  Prompting has emerged as a practical way to adapt frozen vision-language models (VLMs) for video anomaly detection (VAD). Yet, existing prompts are often overly abstract, overlooking the fine-grained human-object interactions or action semantics that define complex anomalies in surveillance videos. We propose ASK-Hint, a structured prompting framework that leverages action-centric knowledge to elicit more accurate and interpretable reasoning from frozen VLMs. Our approach organizes prompts into semantically coherent groups (e.g. violence, property crimes, public safety) and formulates fine-grained guiding questions that align model predictions with discriminative visual cues. Extensive experiments on UCF-Crime and XD-Violence show that ASK-Hint consistently improves AUC over prior baselines, achieving state-of-the-art performance compared to both fine-tuned and training-free methods. Beyond accuracy, our framework provides interpretable reasoning traces towards anomaly and demonstrates strong generalization across datasets and VLM backbones. These results highlight the critical role of prompt granularity and establish ASK-Hint as a new training-free and generalizable solution for explainable video anomaly detection.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at many multimodal tasks, yet they frequently struggle with tasks requiring precise understanding and handling of fine-grained visual elements. This is mainly due to information loss during image encoding or insufficient attention to critical regions. Recent work has shown promise by incorporating pixel-level visual information into the reasoning process, enabling VLMs to access high-resolution visual details during their thought process. However, this pixel-level information is often overused, leading to inefficiency and distraction from irrelevant visual details. To address these challenges, we propose the first framework for adaptive pixel reasoning that dynamically determines necessary pixel-level operations based on the input query. Specifically, we first apply operation-aware supervised fine-tuning to establish baseline competence in textual reasoning and visual operations, then design a novel rollout-guided reinforcement learning framework relying on feedback of the model's own responses, which enables the VLM to determine when pixel operations should be invoked based on query difficulty. Experiments on extensive multimodal reasoning benchmarks show that our model achieves superior performance while significantly reducing unnecessary visual operations. Impressively, our model achieves 73.4\% accuracy on HR-Bench 4K while maintaining a tool usage ratio of only 20.1\%, improving accuracy and simultaneously reducing tool usage by 66.5\% compared to the previous methods.

  Worldwide visual geo-localization seeks to determine the geographic location of an image anywhere on Earth using only its visual content. Learned representations of geography for visual geo-localization remain an active research topic despite much progress. We formulate geo-localization as aligning the visual representation of the query image with a learned geographic representation. Our novel geographic representation explicitly models the world as a hierarchy of geographic embeddings. Additionally, we introduce an approach to efficiently fuse the appearance features of the query image with its semantic segmentation map, forming a robust visual representation. Our main experiments demonstrate improved all-time bests in 22 out of 25 metrics measured across five benchmark datasets compared to prior state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods and recent Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). Additional ablation studies support the claim that these gains are primarily driven by the combination of geographic and visual representations.

  The accurate interpretation of chest radiographs using automated methods is a critical task in medical imaging. This paper presents a comparative analysis between a supervised lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a state-of-the-art, zero-shot medical Vision-Language Model (VLM), BiomedCLIP, across two distinct diagnostic tasks: pneumonia detection on the PneumoniaMNIST benchmark and tuberculosis detection on the Shenzhen TB dataset. Our experiments show that supervised CNNs serve as highly competitive baselines in both cases. While the default zero-shot performance of the VLM is lower, we demonstrate that its potential can be unlocked via a simple yet crucial remedy: decision threshold calibration. By optimizing the classification threshold on a validation set, the performance of BiomedCLIP is significantly boosted across both datasets. For pneumonia detection, calibration enables the zero-shot VLM to achieve a superior F1-score of 0.8841, surpassing the supervised CNN's 0.8803. For tuberculosis detection, calibration dramatically improves the F1-score from 0.4812 to 0.7684, bringing it close to the supervised baseline's 0.7834. This work highlights a key insight: proper calibration is essential for leveraging the full diagnostic power of zero-shot VLMs, enabling them to match or even outperform efficient, task-specific supervised models.

  Reasoning has emerged as a pivotal capability in Large Language Models (LLMs). Through Reinforcement Learning (RL), typically Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), these models are able to solve complex tasks such as mathematics and code generation. Building on these advances, recent research has sought to extend reasoning to Vision-Language Models (VLMs), yielding promising results across diverse visual tasks. Despite this progress, our study uncovers the dual nature of multimodal reasoning: while it substantially enhances logical inference and facilitates performance on challenging problems, it may gradually impair perceptual grounding, leading to recognition failures on otherwise basic visual questions. Through further analysis, we attribute this phenomenon to visual forgetting, wherein prolonged reasoning causes the model to increasingly disregard visual input. To address this, we propose Vision-Anchored Policy Optimization (VAPO), a simple yet effective method that explicitly steers the reasoning process toward visually grounded trajectories. Our result model, VAPO-Thinker-7B, significantly strengthens the model's reliance on visual information and achieves new state-of-the-art results on a wide range of established benchmarks.

  Video Large Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable results on a variety of vision language tasks, yet their practical use is limited by the "needle in a haystack" problem: the massive number of visual tokens produced from raw video frames exhausts the model's context window. Existing solutions alleviate this issue by selecting a sparse set of frames, thereby reducing token count, but such frame-wise selection discards essential temporal dynamics, leading to suboptimal reasoning about motion and event continuity. In this work we systematically explore the impact of temporal information and demonstrate that extending selection from isolated key frames to key clips, which are short, temporally coherent segments, improves video understanding. To maintain a fixed computational budget while accommodating the larger token footprint of clips, we propose an adaptive resolution strategy that dynamically balances spatial resolution and clip length, ensuring a constant token count per video. Experiments on three long-form video benchmarks demonstrate that our training-free approach, F2C, outperforms uniform sampling up to 8.1%, 5.6%, and 10.3% on Video-MME, LongVideoBench and MLVU benchmarks, respectively. These results highlight the importance of preserving temporal coherence in frame selection and provide a practical pathway for scaling Video LLMs to real world video understanding applications.

  Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have advanced rapidly in recent years. However, existing approaches for vision tasks often rely on indirect representations, such as generating coordinates as text for detection, which limits performance and prevents dense prediction tasks like segmentation. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Patch-as-Decodable Token (PaDT), a unified paradigm that enables MLLMs to directly generate both textual and diverse visual outputs. Central to PaDT are Visual Reference Tokens (VRTs), derived from visual patch embeddings of query images and interleaved seamlessly with LLM's output textual tokens. A lightweight decoder then transforms LLM's outputs into detection, segmentation, and grounding predictions. Unlike prior methods, PaDT processes VRTs independently at each forward pass and dynamically expands the embedding table, thus improving localization and differentiation among similar objects. We further tailor a training strategy for PaDT by randomly selecting VRTs for supervised fine-tuning and introducing a robust per-token cross-entropy loss. Our empirical studies across four visual perception and understanding tasks suggest PaDT consistently achieving state-of-the-art performance, even compared with significantly larger MLLM models.

  Medical Image Quality Assessment (IQA) serves as the first-mile safety gate for clinical AI, yet existing approaches remain constrained by scalar, score-based metrics and fail to reflect the descriptive, human-like reasoning process central to expert evaluation. To address this gap, we introduce MedQ-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark that establishes a perception-reasoning paradigm for language-based evaluation of medical image quality with Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs). MedQ-Bench defines two complementary tasks: (1) MedQ-Perception, which probes low-level perceptual capability via human-curated questions on fundamental visual attributes; and (2) MedQ-Reasoning, encompassing both no-reference and comparison reasoning tasks, aligning model evaluation with human-like reasoning on image quality. The benchmark spans five imaging modalities and over forty quality attributes, totaling 2,600 perceptual queries and 708 reasoning assessments, covering diverse image sources including authentic clinical acquisitions, images with simulated degradations via physics-based reconstructions, and AI-generated images. To evaluate reasoning ability, we propose a multi-dimensional judging protocol that assesses model outputs along four complementary axes. We further conduct rigorous human-AI alignment validation by comparing LLM-based judgement with radiologists. Our evaluation of 14 state-of-the-art MLLMs demonstrates that models exhibit preliminary but unstable perceptual and reasoning skills, with insufficient accuracy for reliable clinical use. These findings highlight the need for targeted optimization of MLLMs in medical IQA. We hope that MedQ-Bench will catalyze further exploration and unlock the untapped potential of MLLMs for medical image quality evaluation.

  As Vision-Language Models (VLMs) move into interactive, multi-turn use, new safety risks arise that single-turn or single-modality moderation misses. In Multimodal Multi-Turn (MMT) dialogues, malicious intent can be spread across turns and images, while context-sensitive replies may still advance harmful content. To address this challenge, we present the first systematic definition and study of MMT dialogue safety. Building on this formulation, we introduce the Multimodal Multi-turn Dialogue Safety (MMDS) dataset. We further develop an automated multimodal multi-turn red-teaming framework based on Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to generate unsafe multimodal multi-turn dialogues for MMDS. MMDS contains 4,484 annotated multimodal dialogue samples with fine-grained safety ratings, policy dimension labels, and evidence-based rationales for both users and assistants. Leveraging MMDS, we present LLaVAShield, a powerful tool that jointly detects and assesses risk in user inputs and assistant responses. Across comprehensive experiments, LLaVAShield consistently outperforms strong baselines on MMT content moderation tasks and under dynamic policy configurations, establishing new state-of-the-art results. We will publicly release the dataset and model to support future research.

To address this gap, we develop \textbf{EyePCR}, a large-scale benchmark for ophthalmic surgery analysis, grounded in structured clinical knowledge to evaluate cognition across \textit{Perception}, \textit{Comprehension} and \textit{Reasoning}. EyePCR offers a richly annotated corpus with more than 210k VQAs, which cover 1048 fine-grained attributes for multi-view perception, medical knowledge graph of more than 25k triplets for comprehension, and four clinically grounded reasoning tasks. The rich annotations facilitate in-depth cognitive analysis, simulating how surgeons perceive visual cues and combine them with domain knowledge to make decisions, thus greatly improving models' cognitive ability. In particular, \textbf{EyePCR-MLLM}, a domain-adapted variant of Qwen2.5-VL-7B, achieves the highest accuracy on MCQs for \textit{Perception} among compared models and outperforms open-source models in \textit{Comprehension} and \textit{Reasoning}, rivalling commercial models like GPT-4.1.

  Preference optimization for diffusion models aims to align them with human preferences for images. Previous methods typically use Vision-Language Models (VLMs) as pixel-level reward models to approximate human preferences. However, when used for step-level preference optimization, these models face challenges in handling noisy images of different timesteps and require complex transformations into pixel space. In this work, we show that pre-trained diffusion models are naturally suited for step-level reward modeling in the noisy latent space, as they are explicitly designed to process latent images at various noise levels. Accordingly, we propose the Latent Reward Model (LRM), which repurposes components of the diffusion model to predict preferences of latent images at arbitrary timesteps. Building on LRM, we introduce Latent Preference Optimization (LPO), a step-level preference optimization method conducted directly in the noisy latent space. Experimental results indicate that LPO significantly improves the model's alignment with general, aesthetic, and text-image alignment preferences, while achieving a 2.5-28x training speedup over existing preference optimization methods.

  Vision-Language Models (VLMs) show promise in medical image analysis, yet their capacity for structured reasoning in complex domains like dermatology is often limited by data scarcity and the high computational cost of advanced training techniques. To address these challenges, we introduce DermIQ-VLM, a VLM developed through a multi-stage, resource-efficient methodology designed to emulate a dermatologist's diagnostic process. Our primary contribution is a modified version of Grouped Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), called GRPO++, which stabilizes the powerful but data-intensive GRPO framework. Our proposed training pipeline first employs GRPO++ for reasoning-oriented disease recognition, followed by supervised fine-tuning for conversational ability. To mitigate factual errors introduced during this step, we then align the model using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), leveraging a Knowledge Graph-based system as a scalable proxy for expert preference. A preliminary evaluation on a curated dermatological dataset demonstrates that our proposed methodology yields notable performance gains over standard fine-tuning approaches. These findings validate the potential of our pipeline as a feasible pathway for developing specialized, reliable VLMs in resource-constrained environments.

  State-of-the-art vision-and-language models consist of many parameters and learn from enormous datasets, surpassing the amounts of linguistic data that children are exposed to as they acquire a language. This paper presents our approach to the multimodal track of the BabyLM challenge addressing this discrepancy. We develop language-only and multimodal models in low-resource settings using developmentally plausible datasets, with our multimodal models outperforming previous BabyLM baselines. One finding in the multimodal language model literature is that these models tend to underperform in \textit{language-only} tasks. Therefore, we focus on maintaining language-only abilities in multimodal models. To this end, we experiment with \textit{model merging}, where we fuse the parameters of multimodal models with those of language-only models using weighted linear interpolation. Our results corroborate the findings that multimodal models underperform in language-only benchmarks that focus on grammar, and model merging with text-only models can help alleviate this problem to some extent, while maintaining multimodal performance.

  Multimodal Dialogue Summarization (MDS) is a critical task with wide-ranging applications. To support the development of effective MDS models, robust automatic evaluation methods are essential for reducing both cost and human effort. However, such methods require a strong meta-evaluation benchmark grounded in human annotations. In this work, we introduce MDSEval, the first meta-evaluation benchmark for MDS, consisting image-sharing dialogues, corresponding summaries, and human judgments across eight well-defined quality aspects. To ensure data quality and richfulness, we propose a novel filtering framework leveraging Mutually Exclusive Key Information (MEKI) across modalities. Our work is the first to identify and formalize key evaluation dimensions specific to MDS. We benchmark state-of-the-art modal evaluation methods, revealing their limitations in distinguishing summaries from advanced MLLMs and their susceptibility to various bias.

  Mobile-use agents powered by vision-language models (VLMs) have shown great potential in interpreting natural language instructions and generating corresponding actions based on mobile graphical user interface. Recent studies suggest that incorporating chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning tends to improve the execution accuracy. However, existing evaluations emphasize execution accuracy while neglecting whether CoT reasoning aligns with ground-truth actions. This oversight fails to assess potential reasoning-execution gaps, which in turn foster over-trust: users relying on seemingly plausible CoTs may unknowingly authorize harmful actions, potentially resulting in financial loss or trust crisis. In this work, we introduce a new evaluation framework to diagnose reasoning-execution gaps. At its core lies Ground-Truth Alignment (GTA), which measures whether the action implied by a CoT matches the ground-truth action. By combining GTA with the standard Exact Match (EM) metric, we jointly assess both the reasoning accuracy and execution accuracy. This joint perspective reveals two types of reasoning-execution gaps: (i) Execution Gap (EG), where the reasoning correctly identifies the correct action but execution fails, and (ii) Reasoning Gap (RG), where execution succeeds but reasoning process conflicts with the actual execution. Experimental results across a wide range of mobile interaction tasks reveal that reasoning-execution gaps are prevalent, with execution gaps occurring more frequently than reasoning gaps. Moreover, while scaling up model size reduces the overall gap, sizable execution gaps persist even in the largest models. Further analysis shows that our framework reliably reflects systematic EG/RG patterns in state-of-the-art models. These findings offer concrete diagnostics and support the development of more trustworthy mobile-use agents.

  Multimodal reasoning models have recently shown promise on challenging domains such as olympiad-level geometry, yet their evaluation remains dominated by aggregate accuracy, a single score that obscures where and how models are improving. We introduce MathLens, a benchmark designed to disentangle the subskills of multimodal reasoning while preserving the complexity of textbook-style geometry problems. The benchmark separates performance into three components: Perception: extracting information from raw inputs, Reasoning: operating on available information, and Integration: selecting relevant perceptual evidence and applying it within reasoning. To support each test, we provide annotations: visual diagrams, textual descriptions to evaluate reasoning in isolation, controlled questions that require both modalities, and probes for fine-grained perceptual skills, all derived from symbolic specifications of the problems to ensure consistency and robustness. Our analysis reveals that different training approaches have uneven effects: First, reinforcement learning chiefly strengthens perception, especially when supported by textual supervision, while textual SFT indirectly improves perception through reflective reasoning. Second, reasoning improves only in tandem with perception. Third, integration remains the weakest capacity, with residual errors concentrated there once other skills advance. Finally, robustness diverges: RL improves consistency under diagram variation, whereas multimodal SFT reduces it through overfitting. We will release all data and experimental logs.

  Preference finetuning methods like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) with AI-generated feedback have shown promise in aligning Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) with human preferences. However, existing techniques overlook the prevalence of noise in synthetic preference annotations in the form of stylistic and length biases. To this end, we introduce a hard-negative response generation framework based on LLM-guided response editing, that produces rejected responses with targeted errors, maintaining stylistic and length similarity to the accepted ones. Using this framework, we develop the VaPR dataset, comprising 30K high-quality samples, to finetune three LVLM families: LLaVA-V1.5, Qwen2VL & Qwen2.5VL (2B-13B sizes). Our VaPR models deliver significant performance improvements across ten benchmarks, achieving average gains of 6.5% (LLaVA), 4.0% (Qwen2VL), and 1.5% (Qwen2.5VL), with notable improvements on reasoning tasks. A scaling analysis shows that performance consistently improves with data size, with LLaVA models benefiting even at smaller scales. Moreover, VaPR reduces the tendency to answer "Yes" in binary questions - addressing a common failure mode in LVLMs like LLaVA. Lastly, we show that the framework generalizes to open-source LLMs as editors, with models trained on VaPR-OS achieving ~99% of the performance of models trained on \name, which is synthesized using GPT-4o.

  Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) improves reasoning in large language models (LLMs) but struggles with exploration, an issue that still persists for multimodal LLMs (MLLMs). Current methods treat the visual input as a fixed, deterministic condition, overlooking a critical source of ambiguity and struggling to build policies robust to plausible visual variations. We introduce $\textbf{VOGUE (Visual Uncertainty Guided Exploration)}$, a novel method that shifts exploration from the output (text) to the input (visual) space. By treating the image as a stochastic context, VOGUE quantifies the policy's sensitivity to visual perturbations using the symmetric KL divergence between a "raw" and "noisy" branch, creating a direct signal for uncertainty-aware exploration. This signal shapes the learning objective via an uncertainty-proportional bonus, which, combined with a token-entropy bonus and an annealed sampling schedule, effectively balances exploration and exploitation. Implemented within GRPO on two model scales (Qwen2.5-VL-3B/7B), VOGUE boosts pass@1 accuracy by an average of 2.6% on three visual math benchmarks and 3.7% on three general-domain reasoning benchmarks, while simultaneously increasing pass@4 performance and mitigating the exploration decay commonly observed in RL fine-tuning. Our work shows that grounding exploration in the inherent uncertainty of visual inputs is an effective strategy for improving multimodal reasoning.

  Although current large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have advanced in multimodal understanding and reasoning, their fundamental perceptual and reasoning abilities remain limited. Specifically, even on simple jigsaw tasks, existing VLMs perform near randomly, revealing deficiencies in core perception and reasoning capabilities. While high-quality vision-language data can enhance these capabilities, its scarcity and limited scalability impose significant constraints. To address this, we propose AGILE, an Agentic jiGsaw Interaction Learning for Enhancing visual perception and reasoning in VLMs. AGILE formulates jigsaw solving as an interactive process, enabling the model to progressively engage with the environment. At each step, the model generates executable code to perform an action based on the current state, while the environment provides fine-grained visual feedback to guide task completion. Through this iterative cycle of observation and interaction, the model incrementally improves its perceptual and reasoning capabilities via exploration and feedback. Experimental results show that AGILE not only substantially boosts performance on jigsaw tasks of varying complexity (e.g., increasing accuracy from 9.5% to 82.8% under the 2 $\times$ 2 setting) but also demonstrates strong generalization across 9 general vision tasks, achieving an average improvement of 3.1%. These results indicate notable enhancements in both perceptual and reasoning abilities. This work opens a new avenue for advancing reasoning and generalization in multimodal models and provides an efficient, scalable solution to the scarcity of multimodal reinforcement learning data. The code and datasets is available atthis https URL.

  As we consider entrusting Large Language Models (LLMs) with key societal and decision-making roles, measuring their alignment with human cognition becomes critical. This requires methods that can assess how these systems represent information and facilitate comparisons with human understanding across diverse tasks. To meet this need, we adapted Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA), a method that uses pairwise similarity ratings to quantify alignment between AIs and humans. We tested this approach on semantic alignment across text and image modalities, measuring how different Large Language and Vision Language Model (LLM and VLM) similarity judgments aligned with human responses at both group and individual levels. GPT-4o showed the strongest alignment with human performance among the models we tested, particularly when leveraging its text processing capabilities rather than image processing, regardless of the input modality. However, no model we studied adequately captured the inter-individual variability observed among human participants, and only moderately aligned with any individual human's responses. This method helped uncover certain hyperparameters and prompts that could steer model behavior to have more or less human-like qualities at an inter-individual or group level. Pairwise ratings and RSA enable the efficient and flexible quantification of human-AI alignment, which complements existing accuracy-based benchmark tasks. We demonstrate the utility of this approach across multiple modalities (words, sentences, images) for understanding how LLMs encode knowledge and for examining representational alignment with human cognition.
