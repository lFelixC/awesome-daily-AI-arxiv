- **[BEV-VLM: Trajectory Planning via Unified BEV Abstraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25249)**  `arXiv:2509.25249`  `cs.RO` `cs.AI`  
  _Guancheng Chen, Sheng Yang, Tong Zhan, Jian Wang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper introduces BEV-VLM, a novel framework for trajectory planning in autonomous driving that leverages Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with Bird's-Eye View (BEV) feature maps as visual inputs. Unlike conventional approaches that rely solely on raw visual data such as camera images, our method utilizes highly compressed and informative BEV representations, which are generated by fusing multi-modal sensor data (e.g., camera and LiDAR) and aligning them with HD Maps. This unified BEV-HD Map format provides a geometrically consistent and rich scene description, enabling VLMs to perform accurate trajectory planning. Experimental results on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate 44.8% improvements in planning accuracy and complete collision avoidance. Our work highlights that VLMs can effectively interpret processed visual representations like BEV features, expanding their applicability beyond raw images in trajectory planning.

  Vision-language-action models (VLAs) have shown generalization capabilities in robotic manipulation tasks by inheriting from vision-language models (VLMs) and learning action generation. Most VLA models focus on interpreting vision and language to generate actions, whereas robots must perceive and interact within the spatial-physical world. This gap highlights the need for a comprehensive understanding of robotic-specific multisensory information, which is crucial for achieving complex and contact-rich control. To this end, we introduce a multisensory language-action (MLA) model that collaboratively perceives heterogeneous sensory modalities and predicts future multisensory objectives to facilitate physical world modeling. Specifically, to enhance perceptual representations, we propose an encoder-free multimodal alignment scheme that innovatively repurposes the large language model itself as a perception module, directly interpreting multimodal cues by aligning 2D images, 3D point clouds, and tactile tokens through positional correspondence. To further enhance MLA's understanding of physical dynamics, we design a future multisensory generation post-training strategy that enables MLA to reason about semantic, geometric, and interaction information, providing more robust conditions for action generation. For evaluation, the MLA model outperforms the previous state-of-the-art 2D and 3D VLA methods by 12% and 24% in complex, contact-rich real-world tasks, respectively, while also demonstrating improved generalization to unseen configurations.

- **[Reinforced Embodied Planning with Verifiable Reward for Real-World Robotic Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25852)**  `arXiv:2509.25852`  `cs.RO`  
  _Zitong Bo, Yue Hu, Jinming Ma, Mingliang Zhou, Junhui Yin, Yachen Kang, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Enabling robots to execute long-horizon manipulation tasks from free-form language instructions remains a fundamental challenge in embodied AI. While vision-language models (VLMs) have shown promise as high-level planners, their deployment in the real world is hindered by two gaps: (i) the scarcity of large-scale, sequential manipulation data that couples natural language with multi-step action plans, and (ii) the absence of dense, interpretable rewards for fine-tuning VLMs on planning objectives. To address these issues, we propose REVER, a framework that empowers VLMs to generate and validate long-horizon manipulation plans from natural language instructions in real-world scenarios. Under REVER we train and release RoboFarseer, a VLM incentivized to emit chain-of-thought that perform temporal and spatial reasoning, ensuring physically plausible and logically coherent plans. To obtain training data, we leverage the Universal Manipulation Interface framework to capture hardware-agnostic demonstrations of atomic skills. An automated annotation engine converts each demonstration into vision-instruction-plan triplet. We introduce a verifiable reward that scores the generated plan by its ordered bipartite matching overlap with the ground-truth skill sequence. At run time, the fine-tuned VLM functions both as a planner and as a monitor, verifying step-wise completion. RoboFarseer matches or exceeds the performance of proprietary models that are orders of magnitude larger, while on open-ended planning it surpasses the best baseline by more than 40%. In real-world, long-horizon tasks, the complete system boosts overall success by roughly 60% compared with the same low-level controller without the planner. We will open-source both the dataset and the trained model upon publication.

- **[Simple yet Effective Semi-supervised Knowledge Distillation from Vision-Language Models via Dual-Head Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07675)**  `arXiv:2505.07675`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI` `cs.CV`  
  _Seongjae Kang, Dong Bok Lee, Hyungjoon Jang, Sung Ju Hwang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Semi-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a practical solution for addressing data scarcity challenges by leveraging unlabeled data. Recently, vision-language models (VLMs), pre-trained on massive image-text pairs, have demonstrated remarkable zero-/few-shot performance that often surpasses SSL approaches due to their exceptional generalization capabilities. This gap motivates us to question: how can we effectively harness the powerful generalization capabilities of VLMs into task-specific models? Knowledge distillation (KD) offers a natural framework for transferring VLM capabilities, but we identify that it suffers from gradient conflicts between supervised and distillation losses. To address this challenge, we propose Dual-Head Optimization (DHO), which introduces dual prediction heads for each distinct signal. We observe that DHO resolves gradient conflicts, enabling improved feature learning compared to single-head KD baselines, with practical benefits of minimal computational overhead and test-time hyperparameter tuning without retraining. Extensive experiments across 15 datasets show that DHO consistently outperforms KD baselines, often outperforming teacher models with smaller student models. DHO also achieves new state-of-the-art performance on both in-distribution ImageNet semi-supervised learning and out-of-distribution generalization across ImageNet variants. We publicly release our code and model checkpoints to facilitate future research atthis https URL.

- **[Expert Merging: Model Merging with Unsupervised Expert Alignment and Importance-Guided Layer Chunking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25712)**  `arXiv:2509.25712`  `cs.LG`  
  _Dengming Zhang, Xiaowen Ma, Zhenliang Ni, Zhenkai Wu, Han Shu, Xin Jiang, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Model merging, which combines multiple domain-specialized experts into a single model, offers a practical path to endow Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) with broad capabilities without the cost of joint training or serving many models. However, training-free methods rely on hand-tuned coefficients, whereas training-based methods primarily align parameters rather than downstream task behavior and typically treat all layers uniformly, ignoring inter-layer heterogeneity. We introduce Expert Merging, a training-light method that learns a small set of layer-wise coefficients using only unlabeled calibration data. The coefficients are optimized to explicitly align the merged model's hidden states and logits with those of the corresponding experts, with a coefficient regularizer for stability and task-weighted losses for controllable trade-offs. To capture inter-layer variation, Expert Merging++ augments this design with importance-guided chunking: a normalized layer-importance metric, derived from learned coefficients, task-vector magnitudes, and parameter counts, allocates more chunk-wise coefficients to high-importance layers while keeping low-importance layers lightweight. The result is a label-free, parameter-efficient, and scalable approach to multi-expert model merging across LLMs and MLLMs. Across MLLM backbones (InternVL and Qwen2-VL) and the LLM backbone (Mistral), our method surpasses strong training-free and training-based merging baselines, with Expert Merging++ delivering further gains and, in some cases, even exceeding supervised Mixture Training.

- **[Logo-VGR: Visual Grounded Reasoning for Open-world Logo Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25811)**  `arXiv:2509.25811`  `cs.CV` `cs.LG`  
  _Zichen Liang, Jingjing Fei, Jie Wang, Zheming Yang, Changqing Li, Pei Wu, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have been primarily evaluated on general-purpose benchmarks, while their applications in domain-specific scenarios, such as intelligent product moderation, remain underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce an open-world logo recognition benchmark, a core challenge in product moderation. Unlike traditional logo recognition methods that rely on memorizing representations of tens of thousands of brands-an impractical approach in real-world settings-our proposed method, Logo-VGR, enables generalization to large-scale brand recognition with supervision from only a small subset of brands. Specifically, we reformulate logo recognition as a comparison-based task, requiring the model to match product images with candidate logos rather than directly generating brand labels. We further observe that existing models tend to overfit by memorizing brand distributions instead of learning robust multimodal reasoning, which results in poor performance on unseen brands. To overcome this limitation, Logo-VGR introduces a new paradigm of domain-specific multimodal reasoning: Logo Perception Grounding injects domain knowledge, and Logo-Guided Visual Grounded Reasoning enhances the model's reasoning capability. Experimental results show that Logo-VGR outperforms strong baselines by nearly 10 points in OOD settings, demonstrating superior generalization.

- **[ProfVLM: A Lightweight Video-Language Model for Multi-View Proficiency Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26278)**  `arXiv:2509.26278`  `cs.CV` `cs.CL`  
  _Edoardo Bianchi, Jacopo Staiano, Antonio Liotta_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Existing approaches to skill proficiency estimation often rely on black-box video classifiers, ignoring multi-view context and lacking explainability. We present ProfVLM, a compact vision-language model that reformulates this task as generative reasoning: it jointly predicts skill level and generates expert-like feedback from egocentric and exocentric videos. Central to our method is an AttentiveGatedProjector that dynamically fuses multi-view features, projected from a frozen TimeSformer backbone into a language model tuned for feedback generation. Trained on EgoExo4D with expert commentaries, ProfVLM surpasses state-of-the-art methods while using up to 20x fewer parameters and reducing training time by up to 60%. Our approach not only achieves superior accuracy across diverse activities, but also outputs natural language critiques aligned with performance, offering transparent reasoning. These results highlight generative vision-language modeling as a powerful new direction for skill assessment.

- **[VLM-FO1: Bridging the Gap Between High-Level Reasoning and Fine-Grained Perception in VLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25916)**  `arXiv:2509.25916`  `cs.CV` `cs.CL`  
  _Peng Liu, Haozhan Shen, Chunxin Fang, Zhicheng Sun, Jiajia Liao, Tiancheng Zhao_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at high-level scene understanding but falter on fine-grained perception tasks requiring precise localization. This failure stems from a fundamental mismatch, as generating exact numerical coordinates is a challenging task for language-centric architectures. In this paper, we introduce VLM-FO1, a novel framework that overcomes this limitation by reframing object-centric perception from a brittle coordinate generation problem into a robust feature retrieval task. Our method operates as a plug-and-play module that integrates with any pre-trained VLM. It leverages a Hybrid Fine-grained Region Encoder (HFRE), featuring a dual vision encoder, to generate powerful region tokens rich in both semantic and spatial detail. A token-based referencing system then enables the LLM to seamlessly reason about and ground language in these specific visual regions. Experiments show that VLM-FO1 achieves state-of-the-art performance across a diverse suite of benchmarks, demonstrating exceptional capabilities in object grounding, region generational understanding, and visual region reasoning. Crucially, our two-stage training strategy ensures that these perception gains are achieved without compromising the base model's general visual understanding capabilities. VLM-FO1 establishes an effective and flexible paradigm for building perception-aware VLMs, bridging the gap between high-level reasoning and fine-grained visual grounding.

- **[A Multimodal LLM Approach for Visual Question Answering on Multiparametric 3D Brain MRI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25889)**  `arXiv:2509.25889`  `cs.CV` `cs.CL`  
  _Arvind Murari Vepa, Yannan Yu, Jingru Gan, Anthony Cuturrufo, Weikai Li, Wei Wang, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce mpLLM, a prompt-conditioned hierarchical mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture for visual question answering over multi-parametric 3D brain MRI (mpMRI). mpLLM routes across modality-level and token-level projection experts to fuse multiple interrelated 3D modalities, enabling efficient training without image--report pretraining. To address limited image-text paired supervision, mpLLM integrates a synthetic visual question answering (VQA) protocol that generates medically relevant VQA from segmentation annotations, and we collaborate with medical experts for clinical validation. mpLLM outperforms strong medical VLM baselines by 5.3% on average across multiple mpMRI datasets. Our study features three main contributions: (1) the first clinically validated VQA dataset for 3D brain mpMRI, (2) a novel multimodal LLM that handles multiple interrelated 3D modalities, and (3) strong empirical results that demonstrate the medical utility of our methodology. Ablations highlight the importance of modality-level and token-level experts and prompt-conditioned routing. We have included our source code in the supplementary materials and will release our dataset upon publication.

- **[ReLoop: "Seeing Twice and Thinking Backwards" via Closed-loop Training to Mitigate Hallucinations in Multimodal understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04943)**  `arXiv:2507.04943`  `cs.CV` `cs.CL`  
  _Jianjiang Yang, Yanshu li, Ziyan Huang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in open-ended visual question answering, they remain vulnerable to hallucinations. These are outputs that contradict or misrepresent input semantics, posing a critical challenge to the reliability and factual consistency. Existing methods often rely on external verification or post-hoc correction, lacking an internal mechanism to validate outputs directly during training. To bridge this gap, we propose ReLoop, a unified closed-loop training framework that encourages multimodal consistency for cross-modal understanding in MLLMs. ReLoop adopts a ring-shaped structure that integrates three complementary consistency feedback mechanisms, obliging MLLMs to "seeing twice and thinking backwards". Specifically, ReLoop employs the frozen Consistency Feedback Plugin (CFP), comprising semantic reconstruction, visual description, and an attention supervision module for attention alignment. These components collectively enforce semantic reversibility, visual consistency, and interpretable attention, enabling the model to correct its outputs during training. Extensive evaluations and analyses demonstrate the effectiveness of ReLoop in reducing hallucination rates across multiple benchmarks, establishing a robust method for hallucination mitigation in MLLMs. We will release our source code and data in the camera-ready version.

- **[LLM-RG: Referential Grounding in Outdoor Scenarios using Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25528)**  `arXiv:2509.25528`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI` `cs.RO`  
  _Pranav Saxena, Avigyan Bhattacharya, Ji Zhang, Wenshan Wang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Referential grounding in outdoor driving scenes is challenging due to large scene variability, many visually similar objects, and dynamic elements that complicate resolving natural-language references (e.g., "the black car on the right"). We propose LLM-RG, a hybrid pipeline that combines off-the-shelf vision-language models for fine-grained attribute extraction with large language models for symbolic reasoning. LLM-RG processes an image and a free-form referring expression by using an LLM to extract relevant object types and attributes, detecting candidate regions, generating rich visual descriptors with a VLM, and then combining these descriptors with spatial metadata into natural-language prompts that are input to an LLM for chain-of-thought reasoning to identify the referent's bounding box. Evaluated on the Talk2Car benchmark, LLM-RG yields substantial gains over both LLM and VLM-based baselines. Additionally, our ablations show that adding 3D spatial cues further improves grounding. Our results demonstrate the complementary strengths of VLMs and LLMs, applied in a zero-shot manner, for robust outdoor referential grounding.

- **[EditReward: A Human-Aligned Reward Model for Instruction-Guided Image Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26346)**  `arXiv:2509.26346`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI` `cs.CL`  
  _Keming Wu, Sicong Jiang, Max Ku, Ping Nie, Minghao Liu, Wenhu Chen_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recently, we have witnessed great progress in image editing with natural language instructions. Several closed-source models like GPT-Image-1, Seedream, and Google-Nano-Banana have shown highly promising progress. However, the open-source models are still lagging. The main bottleneck is the lack of a reliable reward model to scale up high-quality synthetic training data. To address this critical bottleneck, we built \mname, trained with our new large-scale human preference dataset, meticulously annotated by trained experts following a rigorous protocol containing over 200K preference pairs. \mname demonstrates superior alignment with human preferences in instruction-guided image editing tasks. Experiments show that \mname achieves state-of-the-art human correlation on established benchmarks such as GenAI-Bench, AURORA-Bench, ImagenHub, and our new \benchname, outperforming a wide range of VLM-as-judge models. Furthermore, we use \mname to select a high-quality subset from the existing noisy ShareGPT-4o-Image dataset. We train Step1X-Edit on the selected subset, which shows significant improvement over training on the full set. This demonstrates \mname's ability to serve as a reward model to scale up high-quality training data for image editing. Furthermore, its strong alignment suggests potential for advanced applications like reinforcement learning-based post-training and test-time scaling of image editing models. \mname with its training dataset will be released to help the community build more high-quality image editing training datasets.

- **[VELA: An LLM-Hybrid-as-a-Judge Approach for Evaluating Long Image Captions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25818)**  `arXiv:2509.25818`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI` `cs.CL`  
  _Kazuki Matsuda, Yuiga Wada, Shinnosuke Hirano, Seitaro Otsuki, Komei Sugiura_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this study, we focus on the automatic evaluation of long and detailed image captions generated by multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Most existing automatic evaluation metrics for image captioning are primarily designed for short captions and are not suitable for evaluating long captions. Moreover, recent LLM-as-a-Judge approaches suffer from slow inference due to their reliance on autoregressive inference and early fusion of visual information. To address these limitations, we propose VELA, an automatic evaluation metric for long captions developed within a novel LLM-Hybrid-as-a-Judge framework. Furthermore, we propose LongCap-Arena, a benchmark specifically designed for evaluating metrics for long captions. This benchmark comprises 7,805 images, the corresponding human-provided long reference captions and long candidate captions, and 32,246 human judgments from three distinct perspectives: Descriptiveness, Relevance, and Fluency. We demonstrated that VELA outperformed existing metrics and achieved superhuman performance on LongCap-Arena.

- **[V-HUB: A Visual-Centric Humor Understanding Benchmark for Video LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25773)**  `arXiv:2509.25773`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI` `cs.CL`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  AI models capable of comprehending humor hold real-world promise -- for example, enhancing engagement in human-machine interactions. To gauge and diagnose the capacity of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for humor understanding, we introduce v-HUB, a novel visual-centric video humor understanding benchmark. v-HUB comprises a curated collection of minimally verbal short videos, sourced from classic silent films and online resources, and reflecting real-world scenarios where humor can be appreciated purely through visual cues. Each video clip is paired with rich annotations, including captions, descriptions, and explanations, supporting evaluation tasks like caption matching and humor explanation. To broaden its applicability, we further construct an open-ended video QA task, making it readily integrable into existing video understanding benchmarks. We evaluate a diverse set of MLLMs, from specialized Video-LLMs to versatile OmniLLMs that can process audio, covering both open-source and proprietary domains. The experimental results expose the difficulties MLLMs face in comprehending humor from visual cues alone. For example, all models exhibit a marked performance drop on caption matching when moving from text-based to video-based evaluation (without audio). Our findings also demonstrate that incorporating audio helps with video humor understanding, highlighting the informativeness of sound and the promise of integrating richer modalities for complex video understanding tasks.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The fusion of language and vision in large vision-language models (LVLMs) has revolutionized deep learning-based object detection by enhancing adaptability, contextual reasoning, and generalization beyond traditional architectures. This in-depth review presents a structured exploration of the state-of-the-art in LVLMs, systematically organized through a three-step research review process. First, we discuss the functioning of vision language models (VLMs) for object detection, describing how these models harness natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV) techniques to revolutionize object detection and localization. We then explain the architectural innovations, training paradigms, and output flexibility of recent LVLMs for object detection, highlighting how they achieve advanced contextual understanding for object detection. The review thoroughly examines the approaches used in integration of visual and textual information, demonstrating the progress made in object detection using VLMs that facilitate more sophisticated object detection and localization strategies. This review presents comprehensive visualizations demonstrating LVLMs' effectiveness in diverse scenarios including localization and segmentation, and then compares their real-time performance, adaptability, and complexity to traditional deep learning systems. Based on the review, its is expected that LVLMs will soon meet or surpass the performance of conventional methods in object detection. The review also identifies a few major limitations of the current LVLM modes, proposes solutions to address those challenges, and presents a clear roadmap for the future advancement in this field. We conclude, based on this study, that the recent advancement in LVLMs have made and will continue to make a transformative impact on object detection and robotic applications in the future.

- **[Scaling RL to Long Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07966)**  `arXiv:2507.07966`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI` `cs.CL`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce a full-stack framework that scales up reasoning in vision-language models (VLMs) to long videos, leveraging reinforcement learning. We address the unique challenges of long video reasoning by integrating three critical components: (1) a large-scale dataset, LongVideo-Reason, comprising 104K long video QA pairs with high-quality reasoning annotations across diverse domains such as sports, games, and vlogs; (2) a two-stage training pipeline that extends VLMs with chain-of-thought supervised fine-tuning (CoT-SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL); and (3) a training infrastructure for long video RL, named Multi-modal Reinforcement Sequence Parallelism (MR-SP), which incorporates sequence parallelism and a vLLM-based engine tailored for long video, using cached video embeddings for efficient rollout and prefilling. In our experiments, LongVILA-R1-7B achieves strong performance on video benchmarks, reaching 65.1% and 71.1% accuracy on VideoMME without and with subtitles, respectively, and consistently outperforming LongVILA-7B across multiple benchmarks. Moreover, LongVILA-R1-7B supports processing up to 8,192 video frames per video, and configurable FPS settings. Notably, our MR-SP system achieves up to 2.1x speedup on long video RL training. In addition, we release our training system for public availability that supports RL training on various modalities (video, text, and audio), various models (VILA and Qwen series), and even image and video generation models. On a single A100 node (8 GPUs), it supports RL training on hour-long videos (e.g., 3,600 frames).

  Vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in understanding and reasoning about visual content, but significant challenges persist in tasks requiring cross-viewpoint understanding and spatial reasoning. We identify a critical limitation: current VLMs excel primarily at egocentric spatial reasoning (from the camera's perspective) but fail to generalize to allocentric viewpoints when required to adopt another entity's spatial frame of reference. We introduce ViewSpatial-Bench, the first comprehensive benchmark designed specifically for multi-viewpoint spatial localization recognition evaluation across five distinct task types, supported by an automated 3D annotation pipeline that generates precise directional labels. Comprehensive evaluation of diverse VLMs on ViewSpatial-Bench reveals a significant performance disparity: models demonstrate reasonable performance on camera-perspective tasks but exhibit reduced accuracy when reasoning from a human viewpoint. By fine-tuning VLMs on our multi-perspective spatial dataset, we achieve an overall performance improvement of 46.24% across tasks, highlighting the efficacy of our approach. Our work establishes a crucial benchmark for spatial intelligence in embodied AI systems and provides empirical evidence that modeling 3D spatial relationships enhances VLMs' corresponding spatial comprehension capabilities.

- **[LFTR: Learning-Free Token Reduction for Multimodal Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17391)**  `arXiv:2501.17391`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI` `cs.CL`  
  _Zihui Zhao, Yingxin Li, Yang Li_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated exceptional success in various multimodal tasks, yet their deployment is frequently limited by substantial computational demands and prolonged inference times. Given that the vision modality typically contains more comprehensive information than the text modality, resulting in encoded representations comprising an extensive number of tokens, leading to significant computational overhead due to the quadratic complexity of the attention mechanism. Current token reduction methods are typically restricted to specific model architectures and often necessitate extensive retraining or fine-tuning, restricting their applicability to many state-of-the-art models. In this paper, we introduce a learning-free token reduction (LFTR) method designed for MLLMs. LFTR can be seamlessly integrated into most open-source MLLM architectures without requiring additional fine-tuning. By capitalizing on the redundancy in visual representations, our approach effectively reduces tokens while preserving the general inference performance of MLLMs. We conduct experiments on multiple MLLM architectures (LLaVA, MiniGPT, QwenVL), and our results show that LFTR achieves up to a $16\times$ reduction of visual tokens while maintaining or even enhancing performance on mainstream vision question-answering benchmarks, all in a learning-free setting. Additionally, LFTR is complementary to other acceleration techniques, such as vision encoder compression and post-training quantization, further promoting the efficient deployment of MLLMs. Our project is available atthis https URL.

- **[TimeScope: Towards Task-Oriented Temporal Grounding In Long Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26360)**  `arXiv:2509.26360`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`  
  _Xiangrui Liu, Minghao Qin, Yan Shu, Zhengyang Liang, Yang Tian, Chen Jason Zhang, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Identifying key moments in long videos is essential for downstream understanding and reasoning tasks. In this paper, we introduce a new problem, Taskoriented Temporal Grounding ToTG, which aims to localize time intervals containing the necessary information based on a task's natural description. Along with the definition, we also present ToTG Bench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating the performance on ToTG. ToTG is particularly challenging for traditional approaches due to their limited generalizability and difficulty in handling long videos. To address these challenges, we propose TimeScope, a novel framework built upon progressive reasoning. TimeScope first identifies a coarse-grained temporal scope in the long video that likely contains the key moments, and then refines this scope through finegrained moment partitioning. Additionally, we curate a highquality dataset, namely ToTG Pile, to enhance TimeScope's ability to perform progressive temporal grounding effectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TimeScope consistently outperforms both existing temporalgrounding methods and popular MLLMs across various settings, highlighting its effectiveness in addressing this new challenging problem.

- **[More Thought, Less Accuracy? On the Dual Nature of Reasoning in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25848)**  `arXiv:2509.25848`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`  
  _Xinyu Tian, Shu Zou, Zhaoyuan Yang, Mengqi He, Fabian Waschkowski, Lukas Wesemann, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reasoning has emerged as a pivotal capability in Large Language Models (LLMs). Through Reinforcement Learning (RL), typically Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), these models are able to solve complex tasks such as mathematics and code generation. Building on these advances, recent research has sought to extend reasoning to Vision-Language Models (VLMs), yielding promising results across diverse visual tasks. Despite this progress, our study uncovers the dual nature of multimodal reasoning: while it substantially enhances logical inference and facilitates performance on challenging problems, it may gradually impair perceptual grounding, leading to recognition failures on otherwise basic visual questions. Through further analysis, we attribute this phenomenon to visual forgetting, wherein prolonged reasoning causes the model to increasingly disregard visual input. To address this, we propose Vision-Anchored Policy Optimization (VAPO), a simple yet effective method that explicitly steers the reasoning process toward visually grounded trajectories. Our result model, VAPO-Thinker-7B, significantly strengthens the model's reliance on visual information and achieves new state-of-the-art results on a wide range of established benchmarks.

  Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive world knowledge across a wide range of tasks, making them promising candidates for embodied reasoning applications. However, existing benchmarks primarily evaluate the embodied reasoning ability of VLMs through multiple-choice questions based on image annotations -- for example, selecting which trajectory better describes an event in the image. In this work, we introduce the Point-It-Out (PIO) benchmark, a novel benchmark designed to systematically assess the embodied reasoning abilities of VLMs through precise visual grounding. We propose a hierarchical evaluation protocol spanning three stages (S1: referred-object localization, S2: task-driven pointing, and S3: visual trace prediction), with data collected from critical domains for embodied intelligence, including indoor, kitchen, driving, and robotic manipulation scenarios. Extensive experiments with over ten state-of-the-art VLMs reveal several interesting findings. For example, strong general-purpose models such as GPT-4o, while excelling on many benchmarks (e.g., language, perception, and reasoning), underperform compared to some open-source models in precise visual grounding; models such as MoLMO perform well in S1 and S2 but struggle in S3, where requires grounding combined with visual trace planning.

  Although reinforcement learning (RL) can effectively enhance the reasoning capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs), current methods remain heavily dependent on labor-intensive datasets that require extensive manual construction and verification, leading to extremely high training costs and consequently constraining the practical deployment of VLMs. To address this challenge, we propose Vision-Zero, a domain-agnostic framework enabling VLM self-improvement through competitive visual games generated from arbitrary image pairs. Specifically, Vision-Zero encompasses three main attributes: (1) Strategic Self-Play Framework: Vision-Zero trains VLMs in "Who Is the Spy"-style games, where the models engage in strategic reasoning and actions across multiple roles. Through interactive gameplay, models autonomously generate their training data without human annotation. (2) Gameplay from Arbitrary Images: Unlike existing gamified frameworks, Vision-Zero can generate games from arbitrary images, thereby enhancing the model's reasoning ability across diverse domains and showing strong generalization to different tasks. We demonstrate this versatility using three distinct types of image datasets: CLEVR-based synthetic scenes, charts, and real-world images. (3) Sustainable Performance Gain: We introduce Iterative Self-Play Policy Optimization (Iterative-SPO), a novel training algorithm that alternates between Self-Play and reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), mitigating the performance plateau often seen in self-play-only training and achieving sustained long-term improvements. Despite using label-free data, Vision-Zero achieves state-of-the-art performance on reasoning, chart question answering, and vision-centric understanding tasks, surpassing other annotation-based methods.

  As Vision Language Models (VLMs) are deployed across safety-critical applications, understanding and controlling their behavioral patterns has become increasingly important. Existing behavioral control methods face significant limitations: system prompting approaches could easily be overridden by user instructions, while applying activation-based steering vectors requires invasive runtime access to model internals, precluding deployment with API-based services and closed-source models. Finding steering methods that transfer across multiple VLMs is still an open area of research. To this end, we introduce universal visual input based steering for output redirection (VISOR++), to achieve behavioral control through optimized visual inputs alone. We demonstrate that a single VISOR++ image can be generated for an ensemble of VLMs to emulate each of their steering vectors. By crafting universal visual inputs that induce target activation patterns, VISOR++ eliminates the need for runtime model access while remaining deployment-agnostic. This means that when an underlying model supports multimodal capability, model behaviors can be steered by inserting an image input replacing runtime steering vector based interventions. We first demonstrate the effectiveness of the VISOR++ images on open-access models such as LLaVA-1.5-7B and IDEFICS2-8B along three alignment directions: refusal, sycophancy and survival instinct. Both the model-specific steering images and the jointly optimized images achieve performance parity closely following that of steering vectors for both positive and negative steering tasks. We also show the promise of VISOR++ images in achieving directional behavioral shifts for unseen models including both open-access and closed-access ones. Furthermore, VISOR++ images are able to preserve 99.9% performance on 14,000 unrelated MMLU evaluation tasks.

  We present SpinBench, a cognitively grounded diagnostic benchmark for evaluating spatial reasoning in vision language models (VLMs). SpinBench is designed around the core challenge of spatial reasoning: perspective taking, the ability to reason about how scenes and object relations change under viewpoint transformation. Since perspective taking requires multiple cognitive capabilities, such as recognizing objects across views, relative positions grounding, and mentally simulating transformations, SpinBench introduces a set of fine-grained diagnostic categories. Our categories target translation, rotation, object relative pose, and viewpoint change, and are progressively structured so that single-object simpler tasks scaffold toward the most demanding multi-object perspective-taking setting. We evaluate 37 state-of-the-art VLMs, both proprietary and open source. Results reveal systematic weaknesses: strong egocentric bias, poor rotational understanding, and inconsistencies under symmetrical and syntactic reformulations. Scaling analysis shows both smooth improvements and emergent capabilities. While human subjects achieve high accuracy (91.2\%), task difficulty as measured by human response time shows strong correlation with VLM accuracy, indicating that SpinBench captures spatial reasoning challenges shared across humans and VLMs. We believe SpinBench provides critical insights into spatial reasoning in VLMs and highlights key gaps in their ability to reason about physical space.

  Visual personalization is essential in user-facing AI systems such as smart homes and healthcare, where aligning model behavior with user-centric concepts is critical. However, recent large Vision-Language Models (VLMs), despite their broad applicability, remain underexplored in their ability to adapt to individual users. In this paper, we introduce MMPB, the first extensive benchmark for evaluating VLMs on personalization. MMPB comprises 10k image-query pairs and includes 111 personalizable concepts across four categories: humans, animals, objects, and characters, with the human category enriched with preference-grounded queries. We structure personalization into three main task types, each highlighting a different key property of VLMs. Using 23 widely used VLMs including both open- and closed-source models, we evaluate personalization performance via a three-stage protocol: concept injection, multi-turn dialogue, and personalized querying. Our findings indicate that most VLMs (including some closed-source models) struggle with personalization, particularly in maintaining consistency over dialogue, handling user preferences, and adapting to visual cues. Our analysis reveals that the challenges in VLM personalization (such as refusal behaviors and long-context forgetting) highlight substantial room for improvement. By identifying these limitations and offering a scalable benchmark, MMPB offers valuable insights and a solid foundation for future research toward truly personalized multi-modal AI.

  Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant advances in visual understanding tasks involving both images and videos. However, their capacity to comprehend human-centric video data remains underexplored, primarily due to the absence of comprehensive and high-quality evaluation benchmarks. Existing human-centric benchmarks predominantly emphasize video generation quality and action recognition, while overlooking essential perceptual and cognitive abilities required in human-centered scenarios. Furthermore, they are often limited by single-question paradigms and overly simplistic evaluation metrics. To address above limitations, we propose a modern HV-MMBench, a rigorously curated benchmark designed to provide a more holistic evaluation of MLLMs in human-centric video understanding. Compared to existing human-centric video benchmarks, our work offers the following key features: (1) Diverse evaluation dimensions: HV-MMBench encompasses 13 tasks, ranging from basic attribute perception (e.g., age estimation, emotion recognition) to advanced cognitive reasoning (e.g., social relationship prediction, intention prediction), enabling comprehensive assessment of model capabilities; (2) Varied data types: The benchmark includes multiple-choice, fill-in-blank, true/false, and open-ended question formats, combined with diverse evaluation metrics, to more accurately and robustly reflect model performance; (3) Multi-domain video coverage: The benchmark spans 50 distinct visual scenarios, enabling comprehensive evaluation across fine-grained scene variations; (4) Temporal coverage: The benchmark covers videos from short-term (10 seconds) to long-term (up to 30min) durations, supporting systematic analysis of models temporal reasoning abilities across diverse contextual lengths.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision-Language Models (VLMs) show promise as zero-shot goal-conditioned value functions, but their frozen pre-trained representations limit generalization and temporal reasoning. We introduce VITA, a zero-shot value function learning method that enhances both capabilities via test-time adaptation. At inference, a lightweight adaptation module is updated via a gradient step on a meta-learned self-supervised loss, such that each test-time update improves value estimation. By updating sequentially over a trajectory, VITA encodes history into its parameters, addressing the temporal reasoning limitations. To mitigate shortcut learning, we propose a dissimilarity-based sampling strategy that selects semantically diverse segments of the trajectory during training. In real-world robotic manipulation tasks, VITA generalizes from a single training environment to diverse out-of-distribution tasks, environments, and embodiments, outperforming the state-of-the-art zero-shot method using autoregressive VLMs. Furthermore, we demonstrate that VITA's zero-shot value estimates can be utilized for reward shaping in offline reinforcement learning, resulting in multi-task policies on the Meta-World benchmark that exceed the performance of those trained with the simulation's fuzzy-logic dense rewards.

  Unified Multimodal Models (UMMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in text-to-image generation (T2I) and editing (TI2I), whether instantiated as assembled unified frameworks which couple powerful vision-language model (VLM) with diffusion-based generator, or as naive Unified Multimodal Models with an early fusion of understanding and generation modalities. We contend that in current unified frameworks, the crucial capability of multimodal generative reasoning which encompasses instruction understanding, grounding, and image referring for identity preservation and faithful reconstruction, is intrinsically entangled with high-fidelity synthesis. In this work, we introduce Query-Kontext, a novel approach that bridges the VLM and diffusion model via a multimodal ``kontext'' composed of semantic cues and coarse-grained image conditions encoded from multimodal inputs. This design delegates the complex ability of multimodal generative reasoning to powerful VLM while reserving diffusion model's role for high-quality visual synthesis. To achieve this, we propose a three-stage progressive training strategy. First, we connect the VLM to a lightweight diffusion head via multimodal kontext tokens to unleash the VLM's generative reasoning ability. Second, we scale this head to a large, pre-trained diffusion model to enhance visual detail and realism. Finally, we introduce a low-level image encoder to improve image fidelity and perform instruction tuning on downstream tasks. Furthermore, we build a comprehensive data pipeline integrating real, synthetic, and open-source datasets, covering diverse multimodal reference-to-image scenarios, including image generation, instruction-driven editing, customized generation, and multi-subject composition. Experiments show that our approach matches strong unified baselines and even outperforms task-specific state-of-the-art methods in several cases.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Video anomaly detection (VAD) is a critical yet challenging task due to the complex and diverse nature of real-world scenarios. Previous methods typically rely on domain-specific training data and manual adjustments when applying to new scenarios and unseen anomaly types, suffering from high labor costs and limited generalization. Therefore, we aim to achieve generalist VAD, i.e., automatically handle any scene and any anomaly types without training data or human involvement. In this work, we propose PANDA, an agentic AI engineer based on MLLMs. Specifically, we achieve PANDA by comprehensively devising four key capabilities: (1) self-adaptive scene-aware strategy planning, (2) goal-driven heuristic reasoning, (3) tool-augmented self-reflection, and (4) self-improving chain-of-memory. Concretely, we develop a self-adaptive scene-aware RAG mechanism, enabling PANDA to retrieve anomaly-specific knowledge for anomaly detection strategy planning. Next, we introduce a latent anomaly-guided heuristic prompt strategy to enhance reasoning precision. Furthermore, PANDA employs a progressive reflection mechanism alongside a suite of context-aware tools to iteratively refine decision-making in complex scenarios. Finally, a chain-of-memory mechanism enables PANDA to leverage historical experiences for continual performance improvement. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PANDA achieves state-of-the-art performance in multi-scenario, open-set, and complex scenario settings without training and manual involvement, validating its generalizable and robust anomaly detection capability.

  Recent advances in Visually-rich Document Understanding rely on large Vision-Language Models like Donut, which perform document-level Visual Question Answering without Optical Character Recognition. Despite their effectiveness, these models are too costly for real-time or resource-constrained applications. We investigate model compression through knowledge distillation, training compact student models from a larger teacher. We leverage mechanistic interpretability to drive student architecture design within this framework. By analyzing internal computations, we identify essential subcomponents to retain, while having a clear view of which subcomponents should be approximated, skipped, or reparametrized based on their function. This approach yields Donut-MINT (Mechanistic Interpretability-based Network Trimming), a pruned Donut variant that reduces inference time and memory usage while maintaining strong performance on DocVQA, a standard benchmark for document Visual Question Answering. Our method reframes compression as circuit discovery, bridging interpretability research and practical Vision-Language Model deployment.

  Ensuring precise multimodal alignment between diffusion-generated images and input prompts has been a long-standing challenge. Earlier works finetune diffusion weight using high-quality preference data, which tends to be limited and difficult to scale up. Recent editing-based methods further refine local regions of generated images but may compromise overall image quality. In this work, we propose Implicit Multimodal Guidance (IMG), a novel re-generation-based multimodal alignment framework that requires no extra data or editing operations. Specifically, given a generated image and its prompt, IMG a) utilizes a multimodal large language model (MLLM) to identify misalignments; b) introduces an Implicit Aligner that manipulates diffusion conditioning features to reduce misalignments and enable re-generation; and c) formulates the re-alignment goal into a trainable objective, namely Iteratively Updated Preference Objective. Extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations on SDXL, SDXL-DPO, and FLUX show that IMG outperforms existing alignment methods. Furthermore, IMG acts as a flexible plug-and-play adapter, seamlessly enhancing prior finetuning-based alignment methods. Our code will be available atthis https URL.

  Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant advances in visual understanding tasks. However, their capacity to comprehend human-centric scenes has rarely been explored, primarily due to the absence of comprehensive evaluation benchmarks that take into account both the human-oriented granular level and higher-dimensional causal reasoning ability. Such high-quality evaluation benchmarks face tough obstacles, given the physical complexity of the human body and the difficulty of annotating granular structures. In this paper, we propose Human-MME, a curated benchmark designed to provide a more holistic evaluation of MLLMs in human-centric scene understanding. Compared with other existing benchmarks, our work provides three key features: 1. Diversity in human scene, spanning 4 primary visual domains with 15 secondary domains and 43 sub-fields to ensure broad scenario coverage. 2. Progressive and diverse evaluation dimensions, evaluating the human-based activities progressively from the human-oriented granular perception to the higher-dimensional reasoning, consisting of eight dimensions with 19,945 real-world image question pairs and an evaluation suite. 3. High-quality annotations with rich data paradigms, constructing the automated annotation pipeline and human-annotation platform, supporting rigorous manual labeling to facilitate precise and reliable model assessment. Our benchmark extends the single-target understanding to the multi-person and multi-image mutual understanding by constructing the choice, short-answer, grounding, ranking and judgment question components, and complex questions of their combination. The extensive experiments on 17 state-of-the-art MLLMs effectively expose the limitations and guide future MLLMs research toward better human-centric image understanding.

  Image quality assessment (IQA) is inherently complex, as it reflects both the quantification and interpretation of perceptual quality rooted in the human visual system. Conventional approaches typically rely on fixed models to output scalar scores, limiting their adaptability to diverse distortions, user-specific queries, and interpretability needs. Furthermore, scoring and interpretation are often treated as independent processes, despite their interdependence: interpretation identifies perceptual degradations, while scoring abstracts them into a compact metric. To address these limitations, we propose AgenticIQA, a modular agentic framework that integrates vision-language models (VLMs) with traditional IQA tools in a dynamic, query-aware manner. AgenticIQA decomposes IQA into four subtasks -- distortion detection, distortion analysis, tool selection, and tool execution -- coordinated by a planner, executor, and summarizer. The planner formulates task-specific strategies, the executor collects perceptual evidence via tool invocation, and the summarizer integrates this evidence to produce accurate scores with human-aligned explanations. To support training and evaluation, we introduce AgenticIQA-200K, a large-scale instruction dataset tailored for IQA agents, and AgenticIQA-Eval, the first benchmark for assessing the planning, execution, and summarization capabilities of VLM-based IQA agents. Extensive experiments across diverse IQA datasets demonstrate that AgenticIQA consistently surpasses strong baselines in both scoring accuracy and explanatory alignment.

  As Vision-Language Models (VLMs) move into interactive, multi-turn use, new safety risks arise that single-turn or single-modality moderation misses. In Multimodal Multi-Turn (MMT) dialogues, malicious intent can be spread across turns and images, while context-sensitive replies may still advance harmful content. To address this challenge, we present the first systematic definition and study of MMT dialogue safety. Building on this formulation, we introduce the Multimodal Multi-turn Dialogue Safety (MMDS) dataset. We further develop an automated multimodal multi-turn red-teaming framework based on Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to generate unsafe multimodal multi-turn dialogues for MMDS. MMDS contains 4,484 annotated multimodal dialogue samples with fine-grained safety ratings, policy dimension labels, and evidence-based rationales for both users and assistants. Leveraging MMDS, we present LLaVAShield, a powerful tool that jointly detects and assesses risk in user inputs and assistant responses. Across comprehensive experiments, LLaVAShield consistently outperforms strong baselines on MMT content moderation tasks and under dynamic policy configurations, establishing new state-of-the-art results. We will publicly release the dataset and model to support future research.

  The "thinking with images" paradigm represents a pivotal shift in the reasoning of Vision Language Models (VLMs), moving from text-dominant chain-of-thought to image-interactive reasoning. By invoking visual tools or generating intermediate visual representations, VLMs can iteratively attend to fine-grained regions, enabling deeper image understanding and more faithful multimodal reasoning. As an emerging paradigm, however, it still leaves substantial room for exploration in data construction accuracy, structural design, and broader application scenarios, which offer rich opportunities for advancing multimodal reasoning. To further advance this line of work, we present DeepSketcher, a comprehensive suite comprising both an image-text interleaved dataset and a self-contained model. The dataset contains 31k chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning trajectories with diverse tool calls and resulting edited images, covering a wide range of data types and manipulation instructions with high annotation accuracy. Building on this resource, we design a model that performs interleaved image-text reasoning and natively generates "visual thoughts" by operating directly in the visual embedding space, rather than invoking external tools and repeatedly re-encoding generated images. This design enables tool-free and more flexible "thinking with images". Extensive experiments on multimodal reasoning benchmarks demonstrate strong performance, validating both the utility of the dataset and the effectiveness of the model design.

  Prompt learning has emerged as a promising paradigm for adapting pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) to few-shot whole slide image (WSI) classification by aligning visual features with textual representations, thereby reducing annotation cost and enhancing model generalization. Nevertheless, existing methods typically rely on slide-level prompts and fail to capture the subtype-specific phenotypic variations of histological entities (\emph{e.g.,} nuclei, glands) that are critical for cancer diagnosis. To address this gap, we propose Multi-scale Attribute-enhanced Prompt Learning (\textbf{MAPLE}), a hierarchical framework for few-shot WSI classification that jointly integrates multi-scale visual semantics and performs prediction at both the entity and slide levels. Specifically, we first leverage large language models (LLMs) to generate entity-level prompts that can help identify multi-scale histological entities and their phenotypic attributes, as well as slide-level prompts to capture global visual descriptions. Then, an entity-guided cross-attention module is proposed to generate entity-level features, followed by aligning with their corresponding subtype-specific attributes for fine-grained entity-level prediction. To enrich entity representations, we further develop a cross-scale entity graph learning module that can update these representations by capturing their semantic correlations within and across scales. The refined representations are then aggregated into a slide-level representation and aligned with the corresponding prompts for slide-level prediction. Finally, we combine both entity-level and slide-level outputs to produce the final prediction results. Results on three cancer cohorts confirm the effectiveness of our approach in addressing few-shot pathology diagnosis tasks.

  Multimodal symbolic logical reasoning, which aims to deduce new facts from multimodal input via formal logic, is critical in high-stakes applications such as autonomous driving and medical diagnosis, as its rigorous, deterministic reasoning helps prevent serious consequences. To evaluate such capabilities of current state-of-the-art vision language models (VLMs), we introduce the first benchmark MuSLR for multimodal symbolic logical reasoning grounded in formal logical rules. MuSLR comprises 1,093 instances across 7 domains, including 35 atomic symbolic logic and 976 logical combinations, with reasoning depths ranging from 2 to 9. We evaluate 7 state-of-the-art VLMs on MuSLR and find that they all struggle with multimodal symbolic reasoning, with the best model, GPT-4.1, achieving only 46.8%. Thus, we propose LogiCAM, a modular framework that applies formal logical rules to multimodal inputs, boosting GPT-4.1's Chain-of-Thought performance by 14.13%, and delivering even larger gains on complex logics such as first-order logic. We also conduct a comprehensive error analysis, showing that around 70% of failures stem from logical misalignment between modalities, offering key insights to guide future improvements.

  Improving vision-language models (VLMs) in the post-training stage typically relies on supervised fine-tuning or reinforcement learning, methods that necessitate costly, human-annotated data. While self-supervised techniques such as self-consistency have proven effective for enhancing reasoning capabilities, their application to perceptual domains such as image quality assessment (IQA) remains largely unexplored. In this work, we introduce EvoQuality, a novel framework that enables a VLM to autonomously refine its quality perception capabilities without any ground-truth labels. EvoQuality adapts the principle of self-consistency to the ranking-based nature of IQA. It generates pseudo-labels by performing pairwise majority voting on the VLM's own outputs to establish a consensus on relative quality. These pseudo-rankings are then formulated into a fidelity reward that guides the model's iterative evolution through group relative policy optimization (GRPO). By iteratively leveraging its own predictions, EvoQuality progressively refines the VLM's perceptual capability. Extensive experiments show that EvoQuality boosts the base VLM's zero-shot performance by 31.8\% on PLCC across diverse IQA benchmarks. Remarkably, despite being entirely self-supervised, EvoQuality achieves performance that is competitive with, or even surpasses, state-of-the-art supervised VLM-based IQA models, outperforming these models on 5 out of 7 IQA benchmarks.

  Automated textual description of remote sensing images is crucial for unlocking their full potential in diverse applications, from environmental monitoring to urban planning and disaster management. However, existing studies in remote sensing image captioning primarily focus on the image level, lacking object-level fine-grained interpretation, which prevents the full utilization and transformation of the rich semantic and structural information contained in remote sensing images. To address this limitation, we propose Geo-DLC, a novel task of object-level fine-grained image captioning for remote sensing. To support this task, we construct DE-Dataset, a large-scale dataset contains 25 categories and 261,806 annotated instances with detailed descriptions of object attributes, relationships, and contexts. Furthermore, we introduce DE-Benchmark, a LLM-assisted question-answering based evaluation suite designed to systematically measure model capabilities on the Geo-DLC task. We also present DescribeEarth, a Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) architecture explicitly designed for Geo-DLC, which integrates a scale-adaptive focal strategy and a domain-guided fusion module leveraging remote sensing vision-language model features to encode high-resolution details and remote sensing category priors while maintaining global context. Our DescribeEarth model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art general MLLMs on DE-Benchmark, demonstrating superior factual accuracy, descriptive richness, and grammatical soundness, particularly in capturing intrinsic object features and surrounding environmental attributes across simple, complex, and even out-of-distribution remote sensing scenarios.

  Vision-threatening eye diseases pose a major global health burden, with timely diagnosis limited by workforce shortages and restricted access to specialized care. While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) show promise for medical image interpretation, advancing MLLMs for ophthalmology is hindered by the lack of comprehensive benchmark datasets suitable for evaluating generative models. We present a large-scale multimodal ophthalmology benchmark comprising 32,633 instances with multi-granular annotations across 12 common ophthalmic conditions and 5 imaging modalities. The dataset integrates imaging, anatomical structures, demographics, and free-text annotations, supporting anatomical structure recognition, disease screening, disease staging, and demographic prediction for bias evaluation. This work extends our preliminary LMOD benchmark with three major enhancements: (1) nearly 50% dataset expansion with substantial enlargement of color fundus photography; (2) broadened task coverage including binary disease diagnosis, multi-class diagnosis, severity classification with international grading standards, and demographic prediction; and (3) systematic evaluation of 24 state-of-the-art MLLMs. Our evaluations reveal both promise and limitations. Top-performing models achieved ~58% accuracy in disease screening under zero-shot settings, and performance remained suboptimal for challenging tasks like disease staging. We will publicly release the dataset, curation pipeline, and leaderboard to potentially advance ophthalmic AI applications and reduce the global burden of vision-threatening diseases.

  Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive cross-domain capabilities, yet their proficiency in specialized scientific fields like marine biology remains underexplored. In this work, we systematically evaluate state-of-the-art MLLMs and reveal significant limitations in their ability to perform fine-grained recognition of fish species, with the best open-source models achieving less than 10\% accuracy. This task is critical for monitoring marine ecosystems under anthropogenic pressure. To address this gap and investigate whether these failures stem from a lack of domain knowledge, we introduce FishNet++, a large-scale, multimodal benchmark. FishNet++ significantly extends existing resources with 35,133 textual descriptions for multimodal learning, 706,426 key-point annotations for morphological studies, and 119,399 bounding boxes for detection. By providing this comprehensive suite of annotations, our work facilitates the development and evaluation of specialized vision-language models capable of advancing aquatic science.

  Detecting AI-generated images with multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has gained increasing attention, due to their rich world knowledge, common-sense reasoning, and potential for explainability. However, naively applying those MLLMs for detection often leads to suboptimal performance. We argue that the root of this failure lies in a fundamental mismatch: MLLMs are asked to reason about fakes before they can truly see them. First, they do not really see: existing MLLMs' vision encoders are primarily optimized for semantic-oriented recognition rather than the perception of low-level signals, leaving them insensitive to subtle forgery traces. Without access to reliable perceptual evidence, the model grounds its judgment on incomplete and limited visual observations. Second, existing finetuning data for detection typically uses narrow, instruction-style formats, which diverge sharply from the diverse, heterogeneous distributions seen in pretraining. In the absence of meaningful visual cues, the model therefore exploits these linguistic shortcuts, resulting in catastrophic forgetting of pretrained knowledge (even the basic dialogue capabilities). In response, we advocate for a new paradigm: seeing before reasoning. We propose that MLLMs should first be trained to perceive artifacts-strengthening their artifact-aware visual perception-so that subsequent reasoning is grounded in actual observations. We therefore propose Forensic-Chat, a generalizable, explainable, and still-conversational (for multi-round dialogue) assistant for fake image detection. We also propose ExplainFake-Bench, a benchmark tailored for the evaluation of the MLLM's explainability for image forensics from five key aspects. Extensive experiments show its superiority of generalization and genuinely reliable explainability.

  Vision language models (VLMs) can flexibly address various vision tasks through text interactions. Although successful in semantic understanding, state-of-the-art VLMs including GPT-5 still struggle in understanding 3D from 2D inputs. On the other hand, expert pure vision models achieve super-human accuracy in metric depth estimation, a key 3D understanding task. However, they require task-specific architectures and losses. Such difference motivates us to ask: Can VLMs reach expert-level accuracy without architecture or loss change? We take per-pixel metric depth estimation as the representative task and show that the answer is yes! Surprisingly, comprehensive analysis shows that text-based supervised-finetuning with sparse labels is sufficient for VLMs to unlock strong 3D understanding, no dense prediction head or complex regression/regularization loss is needed. The bottleneck for VLMs lies actually in pixel reference and cross-dataset camera ambiguity, which we address through visual prompting and intrinsic-conditioned augmentation. With much smaller models, our method DepthLM surpasses the accuracy of most advanced VLMs by over 2x, making VLMs for the first time comparable with pure vision models. Interestingly, without explicit enforcement during training, VLMs trained with DepthLM naturally avoids over-smoothing, having much fewer flying points at boundary regions than pure vision models. The simplicity of DepthLM also enables a single VLM to cover various 3D tasks beyond metric depth. Our code and model will be released at the link below.

  While Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved substantial progress in video understanding, their application to long video reasoning is hindered by uniform frame sampling and static textual reasoning, which are inefficient and struggle to handle visually intensive video tasks. To overcome these challenges, in this paper, we introduce the concept of thinking with long videos and propose a novel framework FrameThinker. Within this framework, LVLMs are able to iteratively interrogate video content. Developing such video reasoning capabilities in LVLMs presents notable challenges, particularly in adapting the model to new video actions (e.g. select frame), and designing reward functions to guide LVLMs to adopt the newly introduced action. To solve these challenges, we propose a two-phase training strategy, first employing Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to instill fundamental action capabilities, followed by Reinforcement Learning (RL) to optimize a strategic decision-making policy. Notably, in this RL phase, we conduct an in-depth and comprehensive exploration of the reward design for each action and format reward. Extensive experiments on reasoning benchmarks like Video-Holmes, LongVideo-Reason, and long-video understanding benchmarks such as LongVideoBench, MLVU, VideoMME, and LVBench, demonstrate that FrameThinker achieves a significant average improvement of +10.4% over baselines while drastically reducing the number of processed frames. Most notably, our 7B model, FrameThinker establishes a new state-of-the-art on LongVideo-Reason, achieving 76.1% accuracy using an average of only 20.6 frames. This not only outperforms the competitive LongVILA-R1 (72.0%) but does so with over 20x fewer frames (vs. 512), demonstrating unparalleled efficiency and effectiveness.

  Unified video modeling that combines generation and understanding capabilities is increasingly important but faces two key challenges: maintaining semantic faithfulness during flow-based generation due to text-visual token imbalance and the limitations of uniform cross-modal attention across the flow trajectory, and efficiently extending image-centric MLLMs to video without costly retraining. We present UniVid, a unified architecture that couples an MLLM with a diffusion decoder through a lightweight adapter, enabling both video understanding and generation. We introduce Temperature Modality Alignment to improve prompt adherence and Pyramid Reflection for efficient temporal reasoning via dynamic keyframe selection. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, achieving a 2.2% improvement on VBench-Long total score compared to EasyAnimateV5.1, and 1.0% and 3.3% accuracy gains on MSVD-QA and ActivityNet-QA, respectively, compared with the best prior 7B baselines.

  Instruction-guided image editing has achieved remarkable progress, yet current models still face challenges with complex instructions and often require multiple samples to produce a desired result. Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers a promising solution, but its adoption in image editing has been severely hindered by the lack of a high-fidelity, efficient reward signal. In this work, we present a comprehensive methodology to overcome this barrier, centered on the development of a state-of-the-art, specialized reward model. We first introduce EditReward-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark to systematically evaluate reward models on editing quality. Building on this benchmark, we develop EditScore, a series of reward models (7B-72B) for evaluating the quality of instruction-guided image editing. Through meticulous data curation and filtering, EditScore effectively matches the performance of learning proprietary VLMs. Furthermore, coupled with an effective self-ensemble strategy tailored for the generative nature of EditScore, our largest variant even surpasses GPT-5 in the benchmark. We then demonstrate that a high-fidelity reward model is the key to unlocking online RL for image editing. Our experiments show that, while even the largest open-source VLMs fail to provide an effective learning signal, EditScore enables efficient and robust policy optimization. Applying our framework to a strong base model, OmniGen2, results in a final model that shows a substantial and consistent performance uplift. Overall, this work provides the first systematic path from benchmarking to reward modeling to RL training in image editing, showing that a high-fidelity, domain-specialized reward model is the key to unlocking the full potential of RL in this domain.

  Despite significant advances in Vision Language Models (VLMs), they remain constrained by the complexity and redundancy of visual input. When images contain large amounts of irrelevant information, VLMs are susceptible to interference, thus generating excessive task-irrelevant reasoning processes or even hallucinations. This limitation stems from their inability to discover and process the required regions during reasoning precisely. To address this limitation, we present the Chain of Foresight-Focus Thought (CoFFT), a novel training-free approach that enhances VLMs' visual reasoning by emulating human visual cognition. Each Foresight-Focus Thought consists of three stages: (1) Diverse Sample Generation: generates diverse reasoning samples to explore potential reasoning paths, where each sample contains several reasoning steps; (2) Dual Foresight Decoding: rigorously evaluates these samples based on both visual focus and reasoning progression, adding the first step of optimal sample to the reasoning process; (3) Visual Focus Adjustment: precisely adjust visual focus toward regions most beneficial for future reasoning, before returning to stage (1) to generate subsequent reasoning samples until reaching the final answer. These stages function iteratively, creating an interdependent cycle where reasoning guides visual focus and visual focus informs subsequent reasoning. Empirical results across multiple benchmarks using Qwen2.5-VL, InternVL-2.5, and Llava-Next demonstrate consistent performance improvements of 3.1-5.8\% with controllable increasing computational overhead.

  Understanding 3D spatial relationships remains a major limitation of current Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Prior work has addressed this issue by creating spatial question-answering (QA) datasets based on single images or indoor videos. However, real-world embodied AI agents such as robots and self-driving cars typically rely on ego-centric, multi-view observations. To this end, we introduce Ego3D-Bench, a new benchmark designed to evaluate the spatial reasoning abilities of VLMs using ego-centric, multi-view outdoor data. Ego3D-Bench comprises over 8,600 QA pairs, created with significant involvement from human annotators to ensure quality and diversity. We benchmark 16 SOTA VLMs, including GPT-4o, Gemini1.5-Pro, InternVL3, and Qwen2.5-VL. Our results reveal a notable performance gap between human level scores and VLM performance, highlighting that current VLMs still fall short of human level spatial understanding. To bridge this gap, we propose Ego3D-VLM, a post-training framework that enhances 3D spatial reasoning of VLMs. Ego3D-VLM generates cognitive map based on estimated global 3D coordinates, resulting in 12% average improvement on multi-choice QA and 56% average improvement on absolute distance estimation. Ego3D-VLM is modular and can be integrated with any existing VLM. Together, Ego3D-Bench and Ego3D-VLM offer valuable tools for advancing toward human level spatial understanding in real-world, multi-view environments.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Hallucination remains a major challenge in multimodal large language models (MLLMs). To address this, various contrastive decoding (CD) methods have been proposed that contrasts original logits with hallucinated logits generated from perturbed inputs. While CD has shown promise in vision-language models (VLMs), it is not well-suited for AV-LLMs, where hallucinations often emerge from both unimodal and cross-modal combinations involving audio, video, and language. These intricate interactions call for a more adaptive and modality-aware decoding strategy. In this paper, we propose Audio-Visual Contrastive Decoding (AVCD)-a novel, training-free decoding framework designed to model trimodal interactions and suppress modality-induced hallucinations in AV-LLMs. Unlike previous CD methods in VLMs that corrupt a fixed modality, AVCD leverages attention distributions to dynamically identify less dominant modalities and applies attentive masking to generate perturbed output logits. To support CD in a trimodal setting, we also reformulate the original CD framework to jointly handle audio, visual, and textual inputs. Finally, to improve efficiency, we introduce entropy-guided adaptive decoding, which selectively skips unnecessary decoding steps based on the model's confidence in its predictions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AVCD consistently outperforms existing decoding methods. Especially, on the AVHBench dataset, it improves accuracy by 2% for VideoLLaMA2 and 7% for video-SALMONN, demonstrating strong robustness and generalizability. Our code is available atthis https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Despite significant advancements in Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs), a gap remains, particularly regarding their interpretability and how they locate and interpret textual information within images. In this paper, we explore various LVLMs to identify the specific heads responsible for recognizing text from images, which we term the Optical Character Recognition Head (OCR Head). Our findings regarding these heads are as follows: (1) Less Sparse: Unlike previous retrieval heads, a large number of heads are activated to extract textual information from images. (2) Qualitatively Distinct: OCR heads possess properties that differ significantly from general retrieval heads, exhibiting low similarity in their characteristics. (3) Statically Activated: The frequency of activation for these heads closely aligns with their OCR scores. We validate our findings in downstream tasks by applying Chain-of-Thought (CoT) to both OCR and conventional retrieval heads and by masking these heads. We also demonstrate that redistributing sink-token values within the OCR heads improves performance. These insights provide a deeper understanding of the internal mechanisms LVLMs employ in processing embedded textual information in images.

  Generalist models have achieved remarkable success in both language and vision-language tasks, showcasing the potential of unified modeling. However, effectively integrating fine-grained perception tasks like detection and segmentation into these models remains a significant challenge. This is primarily because these tasks often rely heavily on task-specific designs and architectures that can complicate the modeling process. To address this challenge, we present \ours, a framework that \textbf{U}nifies \textbf{F}ine-grained visual perception tasks through an \textbf{O}pen-ended language interface. By transforming all perception targets into the language space, \ours unifies object-level detection, pixel-level segmentation, and image-level vision-language tasks into a single model. Additionally, we introduce a novel embedding retrieval approach that relies solely on the language interface to support segmentation tasks. Our framework bridges the gap between fine-grained perception and vision-language tasks, significantly simplifying architectural design and training strategies while achieving comparable or superior performance to methods with intricate task-specific designs. After multi-task training on five standard visual perception datasets, \ours outperforms the previous state-of-the-art generalist models by 12.3 mAP on COCO instance segmentation and 3.3 mIoU on ADE20K semantic segmentation. Furthermore, our method seamlessly integrates with existing MLLMs, effectively combining fine-grained perception capabilities with their advanced language abilities, thereby enabling more challenging tasks such as reasoning segmentation.

  Fine-tuning pre-trained models with custom data leads to numerous expert models on specific tasks. Merging models into one universal model to empower multi-task ability refraining from data leakage has gained popularity. With the expansion in data and model size, parameter-efficient tuning becomes the common practice for obtaining task-specific models efficiently. However, few methods are dedicated to efficient merging, and existing methods designed for full fine-tuning merging fail under efficient merging. To address the issue, we analyze from low-rank decomposition and reveal that direction robustness during merging is crucial for merging efficient modules. We furthermore uncover that compensating for the gap between stark singular values contributes to direction robustness. Therefore, we propose RobustMerge, a training-free parameter-efficient merging method with complementary parameter adaptation to maintain direction robustness. Specifically, we (1) prune parameters and scale coefficients from inter-parameter relation for singular values to maintain direction stability away from task interference, and (2) perform cross-task normalization to enhance unseen task generalization. We establish a benchmark consisting of diverse multimodal tasks, on which we conduct experiments to certify the outstanding performance and generalizability of our method. Additional studies and extensive analyses further showcase the effectiveness. Code is available atthis https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Dyslexia, a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by persistent reading difficulties, is often linked to reduced activity of the visual word form area in the ventral occipito-temporal cortex. Traditional approaches to studying dyslexia, such as behavioral and neuroimaging methods, have provided valuable insights but remain limited in their ability to test causal hypotheses about the underlying mechanisms of reading impairments. In this study, we use large-scale vision-language models (VLMs) to simulate dyslexia by functionally identifying and perturbing artificial analogues of word processing. Using stimuli from cognitive neuroscience, we identify visual-word-form-selective units within VLMs and demonstrate that targeted ablation of these units, unlike ablation of random units, leads to selective impairments in reading tasks while general visual and language comprehension abilities remain intact. In particular, the resulting model matches dyslexic humans' phonological deficits without a significant change in orthographic processing. Taken together, our modeling results replicate key characteristics of dyslexia and establish a computational framework for investigating reading disorders.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  When thinking with images, humans rarely rely on a single glance: they revisit visual information repeatedly during reasoning. However, existing models typically process images only once and thereafter generate reasoning entirely in text, lacking mechanisms to re-access or ground inference in visual representations. We empirically confirm this: as reasoning chains lengthen, models progressively lose focus on relevant regions. In response, we introduce v1, a lightweight extension that enables active visual referencing through a simple point-and-copy approach. This allows the model to identify relevant image patches and copy their embeddings back into the reasoning stream, ensuring that evolving hypotheses remain grounded in perceptual evidence. Crucially, our pointing strategy lets the MLLM directly select image patches using their semantic representations as keys, keeping perceptual evidence embedded in the same space as the model's reasoning. To train this capability, we construct v1g, a dataset of 300K multimodal reasoning traces with interleaved visual grounding annotations. Across various multimodal mathematical reasoning benchmarks, v1 consistently outperforms comparable baselines, establishing dynamic visual access based on point-and-copy as a practical mechanism for grounded reasoning. The model checkpoint and dataset are available atthis http URL.

  Humans continuously infer the states, goals, and behaviors of others by perceiving their surroundings in dynamic, real-world social interactions. However, most Theory of Mind (ToM) benchmarks only evaluate static, text-based scenarios, which have a significant gap compared to real interactions. We propose the SoMi-ToM benchmark, designed to evaluate multi-perspective ToM in embodied multi-agent complex social interactions. This benchmark is based on rich multimodal interaction data generated by the interaction environment SoMi, covering diverse crafting goals and social relationships. Our framework supports multi-level evaluation: (1) first-person evaluation provides multimodal (visual, dialogue, action, etc.) input from a first-person perspective during a task for real-time state inference, (2) third-person evaluation provides complete third-person perspective video and text records after a task for goal and behavior inference. This evaluation method allows for a more comprehensive examination of a model's ToM capabilities from both the subjective immediate experience and the objective global observation. We constructed a challenging dataset containing 35 third-person perspective videos, 363 first-person perspective images, and 1225 expert-annotated multiple-choice questions (three options). On this dataset, we systematically evaluated the performance of human subjects and several state-of-the-art large vision-language models (LVLMs). The results show that LVLMs perform significantly worse than humans on SoMi-ToM: the average accuracy gap between humans and models is 40.1% in first-person evaluation and 26.4% in third-person evaluation. This indicates that future LVLMs need to further improve their ToM capabilities in embodied, complex social interactions.

  We introduce OceanGym, the first comprehensive benchmark for ocean underwater embodied agents, designed to advance AI in one of the most demanding real-world environments. Unlike terrestrial or aerial domains, underwater settings present extreme perceptual and decision-making challenges, including low visibility, dynamic ocean currents, making effective agent deployment exceptionally difficult. OceanGym encompasses eight realistic task domains and a unified agent framework driven by Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), which integrates perception, memory, and sequential decision-making. Agents are required to comprehend optical and sonar data, autonomously explore complex environments, and accomplish long-horizon objectives under these harsh conditions. Extensive experiments reveal substantial gaps between state-of-the-art MLLM-driven agents and human experts, highlighting the persistent difficulty of perception, planning, and adaptability in ocean underwater environments. By providing a high-fidelity, rigorously designed platform, OceanGym establishes a testbed for developing robust embodied AI and transferring these capabilities to real-world autonomous ocean underwater vehicles, marking a decisive step toward intelligent agents capable of operating in one of Earth's last unexplored frontiers.

  Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are known to struggle with spatial reasoning and visual alignment. To help overcome these limitations, we introduce iVISPAR, an interactive multimodal benchmark designed to evaluate the spatial reasoning capabilities of VLMs acting as agents. \mbox{iVISPAR} is based on a variant of the sliding tile puzzle, a classic problem that demands logical planning, spatial awareness, and multi-step reasoning. The benchmark supports visual 3D, 2D, and text-based input modalities, enabling comprehensive assessments of VLMs' planning and reasoning skills. We evaluate a broad suite of state-of-the-art open-source and closed-source VLMs, comparing their performance while also providing optimal path solutions and a human baseline to assess the task's complexity and feasibility for humans. Results indicate that while VLMs perform better on 2D tasks compared to 3D or text-based settings, they struggle with complex spatial configurations and consistently fall short of human performance, illustrating the persistent challenge of visual alignment. This underscores critical gaps in current VLM capabilities, highlighting their limitations in achieving human-level cognition. Project website:this https URL

  Text-based person search (TBPS) enables the retrieval of person images from large-scale databases using natural language descriptions, offering critical value in surveillance applications. However, a major challenge lies in the labor-intensive process of obtaining high-quality textual annotations, which limits scalability and practical deployment. To address this, we introduce two complementary modules: Multi-Turn Text Generation (MTG) and Multi-Turn Text Interaction (MTI). MTG generates rich pseudo-labels through simulated dialogues with MLLMs, producing fine-grained and diverse visual descriptions without manual supervision. MTI refines user queries at inference time through dynamic, dialogue-based reasoning, enabling the system to interpret and resolve vague, incomplete, or ambiguous descriptions - characteristics often seen in real-world search scenarios. Together, MTG and MTI form a unified and annotation-free framework that significantly improves retrieval accuracy, robustness, and usability. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our method achieves competitive or superior results while eliminating the need for manual captions, paving the way for scalable and practical deployment of TBPS systems.

  Generalist multimodal AI systems such as large language models (LLMs) and vision language models (VLMs) are increasingly accessed by clinicians and patients alike for medical image interpretation through widely available consumer-facing chatbots. Most evaluations claiming expert level performance are on public datasets containing common pathologies. Rigorous evaluation of frontier models on difficult diagnostic cases remains limited. We developed a pilot benchmark of 50 expert-level "spot diagnosis" cases across multiple imaging modalities to evaluate the performance of frontier AI models against board-certified radiologists and radiology trainees. To mirror real-world usage, the reasoning modes of five popular frontier AI models were tested through their native web interfaces, viz. OpenAI o3, OpenAI GPT-5, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Grok-4, and Claude Opus 4.1. Accuracy was scored by blinded experts, and reproducibility was assessed across three independent runs. GPT-5 was additionally evaluated across various reasoning modes. Reasoning quality errors were assessed and a taxonomy of visual reasoning errors was defined. Board-certified radiologists achieved the highest diagnostic accuracy (83%), outperforming trainees (45%) and all AI models (best performance shown by GPT-5: 30%). Reliability was substantial for GPT-5 and o3, moderate for Gemini 2.5 Pro and Grok-4, and poor for Claude Opus 4.1. These findings demonstrate that advanced frontier models fall far short of radiologists in challenging diagnostic cases. Our benchmark highlights the present limitations of generalist AI in medical imaging and cautions against unsupervised clinical use. We also provide a qualitative analysis of reasoning traces and propose a practical taxonomy of visual reasoning errors by AI models for better understanding their failure modes, informing evaluation standards and guiding more robust model development.

Two major forms of deception dominate: human-crafted misinformation (e.g., rumors and misleading posts) and AI-generated content produced by image synthesis models or vision-language models (VLMs). Although both share deceptive intent, they are typically studied in isolation. NLP research focuses on human-written misinformation, while the CV community targets AI-generated artifacts. As a result, existing models are often specialized for only one type of fake content. In real-world scenarios, however, the type of a multimodal post is usually unknown, limiting the effectiveness of such specialized systems. To bridge this gap, we construct the Omnibus Dataset for Multimodal News Deception (OmniFake), a comprehensive benchmark of 127K samples that integrates human-curated misinformation from existing resources with newly synthesized AI-generated examples. Based on this dataset, we propose Unified Multimodal Fake Content Detection (UMFDet), a framework designed to handle both forms of deception. UMFDet leverages a VLM backbone augmented with a Category-aware Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Adapter to capture category-specific cues, and an attribution chain-of-thought mechanism that provides implicit reasoning guidance for locating salient deceptive signals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UMFDet achieves robust and consistent performance across both misinformation types, outperforming specialized baselines and offering a practical solution for real-world multimodal deception detection.

  Automated model discovery is the process of automatically searching and identifying the most appropriate model for a given dataset over a large combinatorial search space. Existing approaches, however, often face challenges in balancing the capture of fine-grained details with ensuring generalizability beyond training data regimes with a reasonable model complexity. In this paper, we present a multi-modal \& multi-step pipeline for effective automated model discovery. Our approach leverages two vision-language-based modules (VLM), AnalyzerVLM and EvaluatorVLM, for effective model proposal and evaluation in an agentic way. AnalyzerVLM autonomously plans and executes multi-step analyses to propose effective candidate models. EvaluatorVLM assesses the candidate models both quantitatively and perceptually, regarding the fitness for local details and the generalibility for overall trends. Our results demonstrate that our pipeline effectively discovers models that capture fine details and ensure strong generalizability. Additionally, extensive ablation studies show that both multi-modality and multi-step reasoning play crucial roles in discovering favorable models.

  Understanding risk in autonomous driving requires not only perception and prediction, but also high-level reasoning about agent behavior and context. Current Vision Language Models (VLMs)-based methods primarily ground agents in static images and provide qualitative judgments, lacking the spatio-temporal reasoning needed to capture how risks evolve over time. To address this gap, we propose NuRisk, a comprehensive Visual Question Answering (VQA) dataset comprising 2,900 scenarios and 1.1 million agent-level samples, built on real-world data from nuScenes and Waymo, supplemented with safety-critical scenarios from the CommonRoad simulator. The dataset provides Bird-Eye-View (BEV) based sequential images with quantitative, agent-level risk annotations, enabling spatio-temporal reasoning. We benchmark well-known VLMs across different prompting techniques and find that they fail to perform explicit spatio-temporal reasoning, resulting in a peak accuracy of 33% at high latency. To address these shortcomings, our fine-tuned 7B VLM agent improves accuracy to 41% and reduces latency by 75%, demonstrating explicit spatio-temporal reasoning capabilities that proprietary models lacked. While this represents a significant step forward, the modest accuracy underscores the profound challenge of the task, establishing NuRisk as a critical benchmark for advancing spatio-temporal reasoning in autonomous driving.

  Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) strive to achieve a profound, human-like understanding of and interaction with the physical world, but often exhibit a shallow and incoherent integration when acquiring information (Perception) and conducting reasoning (Cognition). This disconnect leads to a spectrum of reasoning failures, with hallucination being the most prominent. Collectively, these issues expose a fundamental challenge: the ability to process pixels does not yet confer the ability to construct a coherent, credible internal world model. To systematically dissect and address this challenge, this survey introduces a novel and unified analytical framework: ``From Perception to Cognition." We deconstruct the complex process of vision-language interactive understanding into two interdependent layers: Perception, the foundational ability to accurately extract visual information and achieve fine-grained alignment with textual instructions; and Cognition, the higher-order capability for proactive, multi-step, goal-oriented reasoning built upon this perceptual foundation, the core of which is the formation of a dynamic observe-think-verify reasoning loop. Guided by this framework, this paper systematically analyzes the key bottlenecks of current MLLMs at both layers. It surveys the landscape of cutting-edge methods designed to address these challenges, spanning from techniques that enhance low-level visual representations to those that improve high-level reasoning paradigms. Furthermore, we review critical benchmarks and delineate future research directions. This survey aims to provide the research community with a clear, structured perspective for understanding the intrinsic limitations of current MLLMs and to illuminate the path toward building next-generation models capable of deep reasoning and a genuine understanding of the world.

  Geometric Problem Solving (GPS) poses a unique challenge for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), requiring not only the joint interpretation of text and diagrams but also iterative visuospatial reasoning. While existing approaches process diagrams as static images, they lack the capacity for dynamic manipulation - a core aspect of human geometric reasoning involving auxiliary line construction and affine transformations. We present GeoSketch, a neural-symbolic framework that recasts geometric reasoning as an interactive perception-reasoning-action loop. GeoSketch integrates: (1) a Perception module that abstracts diagrams into structured logic forms, (2) a Symbolic Reasoning module that applies geometric theorems to decide the next deductive step, and (3) a Sketch Action module that executes operations such as drawing auxiliary lines or applying transformations, thereby updating the diagram in a closed loop. To train this agent, we develop a two-stage pipeline: supervised fine-tuning on 2,000 symbolic-curated trajectories followed by reinforcement learning with dense, symbolic rewards to enhance robustness and strategic exploration. To evaluate this paradigm, we introduce the GeoSketch Benchmark, a high-quality set of 390 geometry problems requiring auxiliary construction or affine transformations. Experiments on strong MLLM baselines demonstrate that GeoSketch significantly improves stepwise reasoning accuracy and problem-solving success over static perception methods. By unifying hierarchical decision-making, executable visual actions, and symbolic verification, GeoSketch advances multimodal reasoning from static interpretation to dynamic, verifiable interaction, establishing a new foundation for solving complex visuospatial problems.

  Recent advancements in Vision Language Models (VLMs) have expanded their capabilities to interactive agent tasks, yet existing benchmarks remain limited to single-agent or text-only environments. In contrast, real-world scenarios often involve multiple agents interacting within rich visual and textual contexts, posing challenges with both multimodal observations and strategic interactions. To bridge this gap, we introduce Visual Strategic Bench (VS-Bench), a multimodal benchmark that evaluates VLMs for strategic abilities in multi-agent environments. VS-Bench comprises ten vision-grounded environments that cover cooperative, competitive, and mixed-motive interactions. The performance of VLM agents is evaluated across three dimensions: perception measured by element recognition accuracy; strategic reasoning measured by next-action prediction accuracy; and decision-making measured by normalized episode return. Extensive experiments on fifteen leading VLMs show that, although current models exhibit strong perception abilities, there remains a significant gap to optimal performance in reasoning and decision-making, with the best-performing model attaining 46.6% prediction accuracy and 31.4% normalized return. We further analyze the key factors influencing performance, conduct human experiments, and examine failure modes to provide a deeper understanding of VLMs' strategic abilities. By standardizing the evaluation and highlighting the limitations of existing models, we envision VS-Bench as a foundation for future research on strategic multimodal agents.
