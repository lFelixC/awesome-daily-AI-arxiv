- **[Work Zones challenge VLM Trajectory Planning: Toward Mitigation and Robust Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02803)**  `arXiv:2510.02803`  `cs.RO` `cs.AI` `cs.CV`

  Visual Language Models (VLMs), with powerful multimodal reasoning capabilities, are gradually integrated into autonomous driving by several automobile manufacturers to enhance planning capability in challenging environments. However, the trajectory planning capability of VLMs in work zones, which often include irregular layouts, temporary traffic control, and dynamically changing geometric structures, is still unexplored. To bridge this gap, we conduct the \textit{first} systematic study of VLMs for work zone trajectory planning, revealing that mainstream VLMs fail to generate correct trajectories in $68.0%$ of cases. To better understand these failures, we first identify candidate patterns via subgraph mining and clustering analysis, and then confirm the validity of $8$ common failure patterns through human verification. Building on these findings, we propose REACT-Drive, a trajectory planning framework that integrates VLMs with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Specifically, REACT-Drive leverages VLMs to convert prior failure cases into constraint rules and executable trajectory planning code, while RAG retrieves similar patterns in new scenarios to guide trajectory generation. Experimental results on the ROADWork dataset show that REACT-Drive yields a reduction of around $3\times$ in average displacement error relative to VLM baselines under evaluation with Qwen2.5-VL. In addition, REACT-Drive yields the lowest inference time ($0.58$s) compared with other methods such as fine-tuning ($17.90$s). We further conduct experiments using a real vehicle in 15 work zone scenarios in the physical world, demonstrating the strong practicality of REACT-Drive.

  Cross-modal drone navigation remains a challenging task in robotics, requiring efficient retrieval of relevant images from large-scale databases based on natural language descriptions. The RoboSense 2025 Track 4 challenge addresses this challenge, focusing on robust, natural language-guided cross-view image retrieval across multiple platforms (drones, satellites, and ground cameras). Current baseline methods, while effective for initial retrieval, often struggle to achieve fine-grained semantic matching between text queries and visual content, especially in complex aerial scenes. To address this challenge, we propose a two-stage retrieval refinement method: Caption-Guided Retrieval System (CGRS) that enhances the baseline coarse ranking through intelligent reranking. Our method first leverages a baseline model to obtain an initial coarse ranking of the top 20 most relevant images for each query. We then use Vision-Language-Model (VLM) to generate detailed captions for these candidate images, capturing rich semantic descriptions of their visual content. These generated captions are then used in a multimodal similarity computation framework to perform fine-grained reranking of the original text query, effectively building a semantic bridge between the visual content and natural language descriptions. Our approach significantly improves upon the baseline, achieving a consistent 5\% improvement across all key metrics (Recall@1, Recall@5, and Recall@10). Our approach win TOP-2 in the challenge, demonstrating the practical value of our semantic refinement strategy in real-world robotic navigation scenarios.

- **[Understanding Adversarial Transfer: Why Representation-Space Attacks Fail Where Data-Space Attacks Succeed](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01494)**  `arXiv:2510.01494`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Isha Gupta, Rylan Schaeffer, Joshua Kazdan, Ken Ziyu Liu, Sanmi Koyejo_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The field of adversarial robustness has long established that adversarial examples can successfully transfer between image classifiers and that text jailbreaks can successfully transfer between language models (LMs). However, a pair of recent studies reported being unable to successfully transfer image jailbreaks between vision-language models (VLMs). To explain this striking difference, we propose a fundamental distinction regarding the transferability of attacks against machine learning models: attacks in the input data-space can transfer, whereas attacks in model representation space do not, at least not without geometric alignment of representations. We then provide theoretical and empirical evidence of this hypothesis in four different settings. First, we mathematically prove this distinction in a simple setting where two networks compute the same input-output map but via different representations. Second, we construct representation-space attacks against image classifiers that are as successful as well-known data-space attacks, but fail to transfer. Third, we construct representation-space attacks against LMs that successfully jailbreak the attacked models but again fail to transfer. Fourth, we construct data-space attacks against VLMs that successfully transfer to new VLMs, and we show that representation space attacks can transfer when VLMs' latent geometries are sufficiently aligned in post-projector space. Our work reveals that adversarial transfer is not an inherent property of all attacks but contingent on their operational domain - the shared data-space versus models' unique representation spaces - a critical insight for building more robust models.

- **[Grounding the Ungrounded: A Spectral-Graph Framework for Quantifying Hallucinations in multimodal LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19366)**  `arXiv:2508.19366`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Supratik Sarkar, Swagatam Das_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Hallucinations in large language models (LLMs) remain a fundamental obstacle to trustworthy AI, particularly in high-stakes multimodal domains such as medicine, law, and finance. Existing evaluation techniques are largely heuristic -- anchored in qualitative benchmarking or ad-hoc empirical mitigation -- providing neither principled quantification nor actionable theoretical guarantees. This gap leaves a critical blind spot in understanding how hallucinations arise, propagate, and interact across modalities. We introduce the first (to our knowledge) rigorous information geometric framework in diffusion dynamics for quantifying hallucinations in multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), advancing the field from qualitative detection to mathematically grounded measurement. Our approach represents MLLM outputs as the spectral embeddings over multimodal graph Laplacians and characterizes the manifold gaps of truth vs inconsistencies as the semantic distortion, enabling the tight Rayleigh--Ritz bounds on the multimodal hallucination energy as a functional of time-dependent temperature profiles. By leveraging eigenmode decompositions in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) embeddings, our framework delivers modality-aware, theoretically interpretable metrics that capture the evolution of hallucinations across time and input prompts through temperature annealing. This work establishes a principled foundation for quantifying and bounding hallucinations, transforming them from a qualitative risk to a tractable, analyzable phenomenon.

  _Sheng Yang, Tong Zhan, Guancheng Chen, Yanfeng Lu, Jian Wang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this work, we reconceptualize autonomous driving as a generalized language and formulate the trajectory planning task as next waypoint prediction. We introduce Max-V1, a novel framework for one-stage end-to-end autonomous driving. Our framework presents a single-pass generation paradigm that aligns with the inherent sequentiality of driving. This approach leverages the generative capacity of the VLM (Vision-Language Model) to enable end-to-end trajectory prediction directly from front-view camera input. The efficacy of this method is underpinned by a principled supervision strategy derived from statistical modeling. This provides a well-defined learning objective, which makes the framework highly amenable to master complex driving policies through imitation learning from large-scale expert demonstrations. Empirically, our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the nuScenes dataset, delivers an overall improvement of over 30% compared to prior baselines. Furthermore, it exhibits superior generalization performance on cross-domain datasets acquired from diverse vehicles, demonstrating notable potential for cross-vehicle robustness and adaptability. Due to these empirical strengths, this work introduces a model enabling fundamental driving behaviors, laying the foundation for the development of more capable self-driving agents. Code will be available upon publication.

- **[CBVLM: Training-free Explainable Concept-based Large Vision Language Models for Medical Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12266)**  `arXiv:2501.12266`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI` `cs.CL`  
  _Cristiano Patr√≠cio, Isabel Rio-Torto, Jaime S. Cardoso, Lu√≠s F. Teixeira, Jo√£o C. Neves_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The main challenges limiting the adoption of deep learning-based solutions in medical workflows are the availability of annotated data and the lack of interpretability of such systems. Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) tackle the latter by constraining the model output on a set of predefined and human-interpretable concepts. However, the increased interpretability achieved through these concept-based explanations implies a higher annotation burden. Moreover, if a new concept needs to be added, the whole system needs to be retrained. Inspired by the remarkable performance shown by Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) in few-shot settings, we propose a simple, yet effective, methodology, CBVLM, which tackles both of the aforementioned challenges. First, for each concept, we prompt the LVLM to answer if the concept is present in the input image. Then, we ask the LVLM to classify the image based on the previous concept predictions. Moreover, in both stages, we incorporate a retrieval module responsible for selecting the best examples for in-context learning. By grounding the final diagnosis on the predicted concepts, we ensure explainability, and by leveraging the few-shot capabilities of LVLMs, we drastically lower the annotation cost. We validate our approach with extensive experiments across four medical datasets and twelve LVLMs (both generic and medical) and show that CBVLM consistently outperforms CBMs and task-specific supervised methods without requiring any training and using just a few annotated examples.

- **[Improving GUI Grounding with Explicit Position-to-Coordinate Mapping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03230)**  `arXiv:2510.03230`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`  
  _Suyuchen Wang, Tianyu Zhang, Ahmed Masry, Christopher Pal, Spandana Gella, Bang Liu, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  GUI grounding, the task of mapping natural-language instructions to pixel coordinates, is crucial for autonomous agents, yet remains difficult for current VLMs. The core bottleneck is reliable patch-to-pixel mapping, which breaks when extrapolating to high-resolution displays unseen during training. Current approaches generate coordinates as text tokens directly from visual features, forcing the model to infer complex position-to-pixel mappings implicitly; as a result, accuracy degrades and failures proliferate on new resolutions. We address this with two complementary innovations. First, RULER tokens serve as explicit coordinate markers, letting the model reference positions similar to gridlines on a map and adjust rather than generate coordinates from scratch. Second, Interleaved MRoPE (I-MRoPE) improves spatial encoding by ensuring that width and height dimensions are represented equally, addressing the asymmetry of standard positional schemes. Experiments on ScreenSpot, ScreenSpot-V2, and ScreenSpot-Pro show consistent gains in grounding accuracy, with the largest improvements on high-resolution interfaces. By providing explicit spatial guidance rather than relying on implicit learning, our approach enables more reliable GUI automation across diverse resolutions and platforms.

  _Ming Zhao, Wenhui Dong, Yang Zhang, Xiang Zheng, Zhonghao Zhang, Zian Zhou, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Spine disorders affect 619 million people globally and are a leading cause of disability, yet AI-assisted diagnosis remains limited by the lack of level-aware, multimodal datasets. Clinical decision-making for spine disorders requires sophisticated reasoning across X-ray, CT, and MRI at specific vertebral levels. However, progress has been constrained by the absence of traceable, clinically-grounded instruction data and standardized, spine-specific benchmarks. To address this, we introduce SpineMed, an ecosystem co-designed with practicing spine surgeons. It features SpineMed-450k, the first large-scale dataset explicitly designed for vertebral-level reasoning across imaging modalities with over 450,000 instruction instances, and SpineBench, a clinically-grounded evaluation framework. SpineMed-450k is curated from diverse sources, including textbooks, guidelines, open datasets, and ~1,000 de-identified hospital cases, using a clinician-in-the-loop pipeline with a two-stage LLM generation method (draft and revision) to ensure high-quality, traceable data for question-answering, multi-turn consultations, and report generation. SpineBench evaluates models on clinically salient axes, including level identification, pathology assessment, and surgical planning. Our comprehensive evaluation of several recently advanced large vision-language models (LVLMs) on SpineBench reveals systematic weaknesses in fine-grained, level-specific reasoning. In contrast, our model fine-tuned on SpineMed-450k demonstrates consistent and significant improvements across all tasks. Clinician assessments confirm the diagnostic clarity and practical utility of our model's outputs.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reliable risk assessment for carotid atheromatous disease remains a major clinical challenge, as it requires integrating diverse clinical and imaging information in a manner that is transparent and interpretable to clinicians. This study investigates the potential of state-of-the-art and recent large vision-language models (LVLMs) for multimodal carotid plaque assessment by integrating ultrasound imaging (USI) with structured clinical, demographic, laboratory, and protein biomarker data. A framework that simulates realistic diagnostic scenarios through interview-style question sequences is proposed, comparing a range of open-source LVLMs, including both general-purpose and medically tuned models. Zero-shot experiments reveal that even if they are very powerful, not all LVLMs can accurately identify imaging modality and anatomy, while all of them perform poorly in accurate risk classification. To address this limitation, LLaVa-NeXT-Vicuna is adapted to the ultrasound domain using low-rank adaptation (LoRA), resulting in substantial improvements in stroke risk stratification. The integration of multimodal tabular data in the form of text further enhances specificity and balanced accuracy, yielding competitive performance compared to prior convolutional neural network (CNN) baselines trained on the same dataset. Our findings highlight both the promise and limitations of LVLMs in ultrasound-based cardiovascular risk prediction, underscoring the importance of multimodal integration, model calibration, and domain adaptation for clinical translation.

  _Derek Shi, Ruben Glatt, Christine Klymko, Shubham Mohole, Hongjun Choi, Shashank Kushwaha, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in large video-language models (VLMs) rely on extensive fine-tuning techniques that strengthen alignment between textual and visual comprehension. Leading pipelines typically pair supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with reinforcement learning from preference data to enhance video comprehension. However, as VLMs scale in parameter size, so does the cost of gathering enough human feedback. To make fine-tuning more cost-effective, recent frameworks explore reinforcement learning with AI feedback (RLAIF), which replace human preference with AI as a judge. Current RLAIF frameworks rely on a specialized reward model trained with video narratives to create calibrated scalar rewards-- an expensive and restrictive pipeline. We propose Oracle-RLAIF, a novel framework that replaces the trained reward model with a more general Oracle ranker which acts as a drop-in model ranking candidate model responses rather than scoring them. Alongside Oracle-RLAIF, we introduce $GRPO_{rank}$, a novel rank-based loss function based on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) that directly optimizes ordinal feedback with rank-aware advantages. Empirically, we demonstrate that Oracle-RLAIF consistently outperforms leading VLMs using existing fine-tuning methods when evaluated across various video comprehension benchmarks. Oracle-RLAIF paves the path to creating flexible and data-efficient frameworks for aligning large multi-modal video models with reinforcement learning from rank rather than score.

- **[LEAML: Label-Efficient Adaptation to Out-of-Distribution Visual Tasks for Multimodal Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03232)**  `arXiv:2510.03232`  `cs.CV`  
  _Ci-Siang Lin, Min-Hung Chen, Yu-Yang Sheng, Yu-Chiang Frank Wang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved strong performance on general visual benchmarks but struggle with out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks in specialized domains such as medical imaging, where labeled data is limited and expensive. We introduce LEAML, a label-efficient adaptation framework that leverages both scarce labeled VQA samples and abundant unlabeled images. Our approach generates domain-relevant pseudo question-answer pairs for unlabeled data using a QA generator regularized by caption distillation. Importantly, we selectively update only those neurons most relevant to question-answering, enabling the QA Generator to efficiently acquire domain-specific knowledge during distillation. Experiments on gastrointestinal endoscopy and sports VQA demonstrate that LEAML consistently outperforms standard fine-tuning under minimal supervision, highlighting the effectiveness of our proposed LEAML framework.

- **[Zero-Shot Robustness of Vision Language Models Via Confidence-Aware Weighting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02913)**  `arXiv:2510.02913`  `cs.CV`  
  _Nikoo Naghavian, Mostafa Tavassolipour_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision-language models like CLIP demonstrate impressive zero-shot generalization but remain highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks. In this work, we propose Confidence-Aware Weighting (CAW) to enhance zero-shot robustness in vision-language models. CAW consists of two components: (1) a Confidence-Aware loss that prioritizes uncertain adversarial examples by scaling the KL divergence between clean and adversarial predictions, and (2) a feature alignment regularization that preserves semantic consistency by minimizing the distance between frozen and fine-tuned image encoder features on adversarial inputs. These components work jointly to improve both clean and robust accuracy without sacrificing generalization. Extensive experiments on TinyImageNet and 14 additional datasets show that CAW outperforms recent methods such as PMG-AFT and TGA-ZSR under strong attacks like AutoAttack, while using less memory.

- **[Don't Just Chase "Highlighted Tokens" in MLLMs: Revisiting Visual Holistic Context Retention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02912)**  `arXiv:2510.02912`  `cs.CV`  
  _Xin Zou, Di Lu, Yizhou Wang, Yibo Yan, Yuanhuiyi Lyu, Xu Zheng, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Despite their powerful capabilities, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) suffer from considerable computational overhead due to their reliance on massive visual tokens. Recent studies have explored token pruning to alleviate this problem, which typically uses text-vision cross-attention or [\texttt{CLS}] attention to assess and discard redundant visual tokens. In this work, we identify a critical limitation of such attention-first pruning approaches, i.e., they tend to preserve semantically similar tokens, resulting in pronounced performance drops under high pruning ratios. To this end, we propose {HoloV}, a simple yet effective, plug-and-play visual token pruning framework for efficient inference. Distinct from previous attention-first schemes, HoloV rethinks token retention from a holistic perspective. By adaptively distributing the pruning budget across different spatial crops, HoloV ensures that the retained tokens capture the global visual context rather than isolated salient features. This strategy minimizes representational collapse and maintains task-relevant information even under aggressive pruning. Experimental results demonstrate that our HoloV achieves superior performance across various tasks, MLLM architectures, and pruning ratios compared to SOTA methods. For instance, LLaVA1.5 equipped with HoloV preserves 95.8\% of the original performance after pruning 88.9\% of visual tokens, achieving superior efficiency-accuracy trade-offs.

  _Prahitha Movva_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at many multimodal tasks, yet their cognitive processes remain opaque on complex lateral thinking challenges like rebus puzzles. While recent work has demonstrated these models struggle significantly with rebus puzzle solving, the underlying reasoning processes and failure patterns remain largely unexplored. We address this gap through a comprehensive explainability analysis that moves beyond performance metrics to understand how VLMs approach these complex lateral thinking challenges. Our study contributes a systematically annotated dataset of 221 rebus puzzles across six cognitive categories, paired with an evaluation framework that separates reasoning quality from answer correctness. We investigate three prompting strategies designed to elicit different types of explanatory processes and reveal critical insights into VLM cognitive processes. Our findings demonstrate that reasoning quality varies dramatically across puzzle categories, with models showing systematic strengths in visual composition while exhibiting fundamental limitations in absence interpretation and cultural symbolism. We also discover that prompting strategy substantially influences both cognitive approach and problem-solving effectiveness, establishing explainability as an integral component of model performance rather than a post-hoc consideration.

- **[AdaRD-key: Adaptive Relevance-Diversity Keyframe Sampling for Long-form Video understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02778)**  `arXiv:2510.02778`  `cs.CV`  
  _Xian Zhang, Zexi Wu, Zinuo Li, Hongming Xu, Luqi Gong, Farid Boussaid, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Understanding long-form videos remains a significant challenge for vision--language models (VLMs) due to their extensive temporal length and high information density. Most current multimodal large language models (MLLMs) rely on uniform sampling, which often overlooks critical moments, leading to incorrect responses to queries. In parallel, many keyframe selection approaches impose rigid temporal spacing: once a frame is chosen, an exclusion window suppresses adjacent timestamps to reduce redundancy. While effective at limiting overlap, this strategy frequently misses short, fine-grained cues near important events. Other methods instead emphasize visual diversity but neglect query relevance. We propose AdaRD-Key, a training-free keyframe sampling module for query-driven long-form video understanding. AdaRD-Key maximizes a unified Relevance--Diversity Max-Volume (RD-MV) objective, combining a query-conditioned relevance score with a log-determinant diversity component to yield informative yet non-redundant frames. To handle broad queries with weak alignment to the video, AdaRD-Key employs a lightweight relevance-aware gating mechanism; when the relevance distribution indicates weak alignment, the method seamlessly shifts into a diversity-only mode, enhancing coverage without additional supervision. Our pipeline is training-free, computationally efficient (running in real time on a single GPU), and compatible with existing VLMs in a plug-and-play manner. Extensive experiments on LongVideoBench and Video-MME demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, particularly on long-form videos. Code available atthis https URL.

- **[Bayesian Test-time Adaptation for Object Recognition and Detection with Vision-language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02750)**  `arXiv:2510.02750`  `cs.CV`  
  _Lihua Zhou, Mao Ye, Shuaifeng Li, Nianxin Li, Jinlin Wu, Xiatian Zhu, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP and Grounding DINO have achieved remarkable success in object recognition and detection. However, their performance often degrades under real-world distribution shifts. Test-time adaptation (TTA) aims to mitigate this issue by adapting models during inference. Existing methods either rely on computationally expensive backpropagation, which hinders real-time deployment, or focus solely on likelihood adaptation, which overlooks the critical role of the prior. Our prior work, Bayesian Class Adaptation (BCA), addressed these shortcomings for object recognition by introducing a training-free framework that incorporates adaptive priors. Building upon this foundation, we now present Bayesian Class Adaptation plus (BCA+), a unified, training-free framework for TTA for both object recognition and detection. BCA+ introduces a dynamic cache that adaptively stores and updates class embeddings, spatial scales (for detection), and, crucially, adaptive class priors derived from historical predictions. We formulate adaptation as a Bayesian inference problem, where final predictions are generated by fusing the initial VLM output with a cache-based prediction. This cache-based prediction combines a dynamically updated likelihood (measuring feature and scale similarity) and a prior (reflecting the evolving class distribution). This dual-adaptation mechanism, coupled with uncertainty-guided fusion, enables BCA+ to correct both the model's semantic understanding and its contextual confidence. As a training-free method requiring no backpropagation, BCA+ is highly efficient. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BCA+ achieves state-of-the-art performance on both recognition and detection benchmarks.

  _Lanyun Zhu, Deyi Ji, Tianrun Chen, Haiyang Wu, Shiqi Wang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The success of DeepSeek-R1 demonstrates the immense potential of using reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance LLMs' reasoning capabilities. This paper introduces Retrv-R1, the first R1-style MLLM specifically designed for multimodal universal retrieval, achieving higher performance by employing step-by-step reasoning to produce more accurate retrieval results. We find that directly applying the methods of DeepSeek-R1 to retrieval tasks is not feasible, mainly due to (1) the high computational cost caused by the large token consumption required for multiple candidates with reasoning processes, and (2) the instability and suboptimal results when directly applying RL to train for retrieval tasks. To address these issues, Retrv-R1 introduces an information compression module with a details inspection mechanism, which enhances computational efficiency by reducing the number of tokens while ensuring that critical information for challenging candidates is preserved. Furthermore, a new training paradigm is proposed, including an activation stage using a retrieval-tailored synthetic CoT dataset for more effective optimization, followed by RL with a novel curriculum reward to improve both performance and efficiency. Incorporating these novel designs, Retrv-R1 achieves SOTA performance, high efficiency, and strong generalization ability, as demonstrated by experiments across multiple benchmarks and tasks.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We investigate OCR-augmented generation with Vision Language Models (VLMs), exploring tasks in Korean and English toward multilingualism. To support research in this domain, we train and release KLOCR, a strong bilingual OCR baseline trained on 100M instances to augment VLMs with OCR ability. To complement existing VQA benchmarks, we curate KOCRBench for Korean VQA, and analyze different prompting methods. Extensive experiments show that OCR-extracted text significantly boosts performance across open source and commercial models. Our work offers new insights into OCR-augmented generation for bilingual VQA. Model, code, and data are available atthis https URL.

  _Ziqing Wang, Chengsheng Mao, Xiaole Wen, Yuan Luo, Kaize Ding_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Medical Multimodal Large Language Models (Med-MLLMs) have shown great promise in medical visual question answering (Med-VQA). However, when deployed in low-resource settings where abundant labeled data are unavailable, existing Med-MLLMs commonly fail due to their medical reasoning capability bottlenecks: (i) the intrinsic reasoning bottleneck that ignores the details from the medical image; (ii) the extrinsic reasoning bottleneck that fails to incorporate specialized medical knowledge. To address those limitations, we propose AMANDA, a training-free agentic framework that performs medical knowledge augmentation via LLM agents. Specifically, our intrinsic medical knowledge augmentation focuses on coarse-to-fine question decomposition for comprehensive diagnosis, while extrinsic medical knowledge augmentation grounds the reasoning process via biomedical knowledge graph retrieval. Extensive experiments across eight Med-VQA benchmarks demonstrate substantial improvements in both zero-shot and few-shot Med-VQA settings. The code is available atthis https URL.

- **[Pre-training Limited Memory Language Models with Internal and External Knowledge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15962)**  `arXiv:2505.15962`  `cs.CL` `cs.AI` `cs.LG`  
  _Linxi Zhao, Sofian Zalouk, Christian K. Belardi, Justin Lovelace, Jin Peng Zhou, Ryan Thomas Noonan, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Neural language models are black-boxes--both linguistic patterns and factual knowledge are distributed across billions of opaque parameters. This entangled encoding makes it difficult to reliably inspect, verify, or update specific facts. We introduce Limited Memory Language Models (LMLM), a new class of language models that externalizes factual knowledge to external database during pre-training rather than memorizing them. Our pre-training approach strategically masks externally retrieved factual values from the training loss, thereby teaching the model to perform targeted lookups rather than relying on memorization in model weights. Our experiments demonstrate that LMLMs achieve competitive performance compared to significantly larger LLMs on standard benchmarks, while offering the advantages of explicit, editable, and verifiable knowledge bases.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Obtaining large-scale, high-quality reasoning data is crucial for improving the geometric reasoning capabilities of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs). However, existing data generation methods, whether based on predefined tem plates or constrained symbolic provers, inevitably face diversity and numerical generalization limitations. To address these limitations, we propose NeSyGeo, a novel neuro-symbolic framework for generating geometric reasoning data. First, we propose a domain-specific language grounded in the entity-attributes-relations paradigm to comprehensively represent all components of plane geometry, along with generative actions defined within this symbolic space. We then design a symbolic-visual-text pipeline that synthesizes symbolic sequences, maps them to visual and textual representations and generates reasoning path with reverse search and forward validation. Based on this framework, we construct NeSyGeo CoT and NeSyGeo-Caption datasets, containing 100k samples, and release a new benchmark NeSyGeo-Test for evaluating geometric reasoning abilities in MLLMs. Experiments demonstrate that the proposal significantly and consistently improves the performance of multiple MLLMs under both reinforcement and supervised fine-tuning. With only 4k samples and two epochs of reinforcement fine-tuning, base models achieve improvements of up to +15.8% on MathVision, +8.4% on MathVerse, and +7.3% on GeoQA. Notably, a 4B model can be improved to outperform an 8B model from the same series on geometric reasoning tasks.s

  Recent advancements in self-improvement for Large Language Models (LLMs) have efficiently enhanced model capabilities without significantly increasing costs, particularly in terms of human effort. While this area is still relatively young, its extension to the multimodal domain holds immense potential for leveraging diverse data sources and developing more general self-improving models. This survey is the first to provide a comprehensive overview of self-improvement in Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs). We provide a structured overview of the current literature and discuss methods from three perspectives: 1) data collection, 2) data organization, and 3) model optimization, to facilitate the further development of self-improvement in MLLMs. We also include commonly used evaluations and downstream applications. Finally, we conclude by outlining open challenges and future research directions.

  Vision-Language models (VLMs) show impressive abilities to answer questions on visual inputs (e.g., counting objects in an image), yet demonstrate higher accuracies when performing an analogous task on text (e.g., counting words in a text). We investigate this accuracy gap by identifying and comparing the \textit{circuits} - the task-specific computational sub-graphs - in different modalities. We show that while circuits are largely disjoint between modalities, they implement relatively similar functionalities: the differences lie primarily in processing modality-specific data positions (an image or a text sequence). Zooming in on the image data representations, we observe they become aligned with the higher-performing analogous textual representations only towards later layers, too late in processing to effectively influence subsequent positions. To overcome this, we patch the representations of visual data tokens from later layers back into earlier layers. In experiments with multiple tasks and models, this simple intervention closes a third of the performance gap between the modalities, on average. Our analysis sheds light on the multi-modal performance gap in VLMs and suggests a training-free approach for reducing it.

  As vision-language models (VLMs) gain prominence, their multimodal interfaces also introduce new safety vulnerabilities, making the safety evaluation challenging and critical. Existing red-teaming efforts are either restricted to a narrow set of adversarial patterns or depend heavily on manual engineering, lacking scalable exploration of emerging real-world VLM vulnerabilities. To bridge this gap, we propose ARMs, an adaptive red-teaming agent that systematically conducts comprehensive risk assessments for VLMs. Given a target harmful behavior or risk definition, ARMs automatically optimizes diverse red-teaming strategies with reasoning-enhanced multi-step orchestration, to effectively elicit harmful outputs from target VLMs. We propose 11 novel multimodal attack strategies, covering diverse adversarial patterns of VLMs (e.g., reasoning hijacking, contextual cloaking), and integrate 17 red-teaming algorithms into ARMs via model context protocol (MCP). To balance the diversity and effectiveness of the attack, we design a layered memory with an epsilon-greedy attack exploration algorithm. Extensive experiments on instance- and policy-based benchmarks show that ARMs achieves SOTA attack success rates, exceeding baselines by an average of 52.1% and surpassing 90% on Claude-4-Sonnet. We show that the diversity of red-teaming instances generated by ARMs is significantly higher, revealing emerging vulnerabilities in VLMs. Leveraging ARMs, we construct ARMs-Bench, a large-scale multimodal safety dataset comprising over 30K red-teaming instances spanning 51 diverse risk categories, grounded in both real-world multimodal threats and regulatory risks. Safety fine-tuning with ARMs-Bench substantially improves the robustness of VLMs while preserving their general utility, providing actionable guidance to improve multimodal safety alignment against emerging threats.

  Graphical User Interface (GUI) Agents powered by Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) show significant potential for automating tasks. However, they often struggle with long-horizon tasks, leading to frequent failures. Process Reward Models (PRMs) are a promising solution, as they can guide these agents with crucial process signals during inference. Nevertheless, their application to the GUI domain presents unique challenges. When processing dense artificial inputs with long history data, PRMs suffer from a "lost in the middle" phenomenon, where the overwhelming historical context compromises the evaluation of the current step. Furthermore, standard PRMs lacks GUI changing awareness, providing static evaluations that are disconnected from the dynamic consequences of actions, a critical mismatch with the inherently dynamic nature of GUI tasks. In response to these challenges, we introduce GUI-PRA (Process Reward Agent for GUI Tasks), a judge agent designed to better provide process reward than standard PRM by intelligently processing historical context and actively perceiving UI state changes. Specifically, to directly combat the ``lost in the middle'' phenomenon, we introduce a dynamic memory mechanism consisting of two core components: a Relevance-based Retrieval Module to actively fetch pertinent information from long histories and a Progressive Summarization Module to dynamically condense growing interaction data, ensuring the model focuses on relevant context. Moreover, to address the lack of UI changing awareness, we introduce an Aadaptive UI Perception mechanism. This mechanism enables the agent to reason about UI state changes and dynamically select the most appropriate tool to gather grounded visual evidence, ensuring its evaluation is always informed by the current UI context.

  Embodied agents operating in household environments must interpret ambiguous and under-specified human instructions. A capable household robot should recognize ambiguity and ask relevant clarification questions to infer the user intent accurately, leading to more effective task execution. To study this problem, we introduce the Ask-to-Act task, where an embodied agent is tasked with a single or multi-object rearrangement task using an under-specified instruction in a home environment. The agent must strategically ask minimal, yet relevant, clarification questions to resolve ambiguity while navigating under partial observability. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach that fine-tunes multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) as vision-language-action (VLA) policies using online reinforcement learning (RL) with LLM-generated rewards. Our method eliminates the need for large-scale human demonstrations or manually engineered rewards for training such agents. We benchmark against strong zero-shot baselines including GPT-4o as well as supervised fine-tuned MLLMs on our task. Our results show that our RL-finetuned MLLM outperforms all baselines by a significant margin (10.4-16.5%), generalizing well to novel scenes and tasks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of adapting MLLMs as VLA agents that can act and ask for help using LLM-generated rewards with online RL.

  Detecting bias in multimodal news requires models that reason over text--image pairs, not just classify text. In response, we present ViLBias, a VQA-style benchmark and framework for detecting and reasoning about bias in multimodal news. The dataset comprises 40,945 text--image pairs from diverse outlets, each annotated with a bias label and concise rationale using a two-stage LLM-as-annotator pipeline with hierarchical majority voting and human-in-the-loop validation. We evaluate Small Language Models (SLMs), Large Language Models (LLMs), and Vision--Language Models (VLMs) across closed-ended classification and open-ended reasoning (oVQA), and compare parameter-efficient tuning strategies. Results show that incorporating images alongside text improves detection accuracy by 3--5\%, and that LLMs/VLMs better capture subtle framing and text--image inconsistencies than SLMs. Parameter-efficient methods (LoRA/QLoRA/Adapters) recover 97--99\% of full fine-tuning performance with $<5\%$ trainable parameters. For oVQA, reasoning accuracy spans 52--79\% and faithfulness 68--89\%, both improved by instruction tuning; closed accuracy correlates strongly with reasoning ($r = 0.91$). ViLBias offers a scalable benchmark and strong baselines for multimodal bias detection and rationale quality.
