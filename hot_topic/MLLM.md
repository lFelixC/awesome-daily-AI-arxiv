- **[ContextVLA: Vision-Language-Action Model with Amortized Multi-Frame Context](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04246)**  `arXiv:2510.04246`  `cs.RO` `cs.AI`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Leveraging temporal context is crucial for success in partially observable robotic tasks. However, prior work in behavior cloning has demonstrated inconsistent performance gains when using multi-frame observations. In this paper, we introduce ContextVLA, a policy model that robustly improves robotic task performance by effectively leveraging multi-frame observations. Our approach is motivated by the key observation that Vision-Language-Action models (VLA), i.e., policy models built upon a Vision-Language Model (VLM), more effectively utilize multi-frame observations for action generation. This suggests that VLMs' inherent temporal understanding capability enables them to extract more meaningful context from multi-frame observations. However, the high dimensionality of video inputs introduces significant computational overhead, making VLA training and inference inefficient. To address this, ContextVLA compresses past observations into a single context token, allowing the policy to efficiently leverage temporal context for action generation. Our experiments show that ContextVLA consistently improves over single-frame VLAs and achieves the benefits of full multi-frame training but with reduced training and inference times.

- **[Efficient Navigation in Unknown Indoor Environments with Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04991)**  `arXiv:2510.04991`  `cs.RO`  
  _D. Schwartz, K. Kondo, J. P. How_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present a novel high-level planning framework that leverages vision-language models (VLMs) to improve autonomous navigation in unknown indoor environments with many dead ends. Traditional exploration methods often take inefficient routes due to limited global reasoning and reliance on local heuristics. In contrast, our approach enables a VLM to reason directly about an occupancy map in a zero-shot manner, selecting subgoals that are likely to lead to more efficient paths. At each planning step, we convert a 3D occupancy grid into a partial 2D map of the environment, and generate candidate subgoals. Each subgoal is then evaluated and ranked against other candidates by the model. We integrate this planning scheme into DYNUS \cite{kondo2025dynus}, a state-of-the-art trajectory planner, and demonstrate improved navigation efficiency in simulation. The VLM infers structural patterns (e.g., rooms, corridors) from incomplete maps and balances the need to make progress toward a goal against the risk of entering unknown space. This reduces common greedy failures (e.g., detouring into small rooms) and achieves about 10\% shorter paths on average.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper presents a training-free pipeline for task-oriented grasp generation that combines pre-trained grasp generation models with vision-language models (VLMs). Unlike traditional approaches that focus solely on stable grasps, our method incorporates task-specific requirements by leveraging the semantic reasoning capabilities of VLMs. We evaluate five querying strategies, each utilizing different visual representations of candidate grasps, and demonstrate significant improvements over a baseline method in both grasp success and task compliance rates, with absolute gains of up to 36.9\% in overall success rate. Our results underline the potential of VLMs to enhance task-oriented manipulation, providing insights for future research in robotic grasping and human-robot interaction.

- **[Efficient Test-Time Scaling for Small Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03574)**  `arXiv:2510.03574`  `cs.LG` `cs.CV`  
  _Mehmet Onurcan Kaya, Desmond Elliott, Dim P. Papadopoulos_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Small Vision-Language Models (VLMs) provide a computationally efficient alternative to larger models, at the cost of weaker generalization abilities and downstream task performance. These shortcomings could be addressed by test-time scaling techniques, but existing methods are typically computationally demanding, contradicting the resource-efficient design goals of small models. To address these limitations, we propose two novel and efficient test-time scaling strategies that leverage the model-internal features rather than external supervision: (i) Test-Time Augmentation (TTAug), which generates multiple augmented inputs and aggregates outputs at the token level without parameter updates, and (ii) Test-Time Adaptation (TTAdapt), which adapts model parameters during inference using consensus-based pseudolabels from TTAug. Through extensive experiments across nine benchmarks, we demonstrate consistent performance improvements while maintaining computational efficiency suitable for resource-constrained environments. The generality of our approach is demonstrated both within models at different scales and across different VLMs without additional tuning.

- **[Revealing Interconnections between Diseases: from Statistical Methods to Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04888)**  `arXiv:2510.04888`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Alina Ermilova, Dmitrii Kornilov, Sofia Samoilova, Ekaterina Laptenkova, Anastasia Kolesnikova, Ekaterina Podplutova, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Identifying disease interconnections through manual analysis of large-scale clinical data is labor-intensive, subjective, and prone to expert disagreement. While machine learning (ML) shows promise, three critical challenges remain: (1) selecting optimal methods from the vast ML landscape, (2) determining whether real-world clinical data (e.g., electronic health records, EHRs) or structured disease descriptions yield more reliable insights, (3) the lack of "ground truth," as some disease interconnections remain unexplored in medicine. Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate broad utility, yet they often lack specialized medical knowledge. To address these gaps, we conduct a systematic evaluation of seven approaches for uncovering disease relationships based on two data sources: (i) sequences of ICD-10 codes from MIMIC-IV EHRs and (ii) the full set of ICD-10 codes, both with and without textual descriptions. Our framework integrates the following: (i) a statistical co-occurrence analysis and a masked language modeling (MLM) approach using real clinical data; (ii) domain-specific BERT variants (Med-BERT and BioClinicalBERT); (iii) a general-purpose BERT and document retrieval; and (iv) four LLMs (Mistral, DeepSeek, Qwen, and YandexGPT). Our graph-based comparison of the obtained interconnection matrices shows that the LLM-based approach produces interconnections with the lowest diversity of ICD code connections to different diseases compared to other methods, including text-based and domain-based approaches. This suggests an important implication: LLMs have limited potential for discovering new interconnections. In the absence of ground truth databases for medical interconnections between ICD codes, our results constitute a valuable medical disease ontology that can serve as a foundational resource for future clinical research and artificial intelligence applications in healthcare.

- **[MLLMEraser: Achieving Test-Time Unlearning in Multimodal Large Language Models through Activation Steering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04217)**  `arXiv:2510.04217`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Chenlu Ding, Jiancan Wu, Leheng Sheng, Fan Zhang, Yancheng Yuan, Xiang Wang, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across vision-language tasks, yet their large-scale deployment raises pressing concerns about memorized private data, outdated knowledge, and harmful content. Existing unlearning approaches for MLLMs typically adapt training-based strategies such as gradient ascent or preference optimization, but these methods are computationally expensive, irreversible, and often distort retained knowledge. In this work, we propose MLLMEraser, an input-aware, training-free framework for test-time unlearning. Our approach leverages activation steering to enable dynamic knowledge erasure without parameter updates. Specifically, we construct a multimodal erasure direction by contrasting adversarially perturbed, knowledge-recall image-text pairs with knowledge-erasure counterparts, capturing both textual and visual discrepancies. To prevent unnecessary interference, we further design an input-aware steering mechanism that adaptively determines when and how the erasure direction should be applied, preserving utility on retained knowledge while enforcing forgetting on designated content. Experiments on LLaVA-1.5 and Qwen-2.5-VL demonstrate that MLLMEraser consistently outperforms state-of-the-art MLLM unlearning baselines, achieving stronger forgetting performance with lower computational cost and minimal utility degradation.

  _Zexin Wang, Changhua Pei, Yang Liu, Hengyue Jiang, Quan Zhou, Haotian Si, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Web service administrators must ensure the stability of multiple systems by promptly detecting anomalies in Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). Achieving the goal of "train once, infer across scenarios" remains a fundamental challenge for time series anomaly detection models. Beyond improving zero-shot generalization, such models must also flexibly handle sequences of varying lengths during inference, ranging from one hour to one week, without retraining. Conventional approaches rely on sliding-window encoding and self-supervised learning, which restrict inference to fixed-length inputs. Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable zero-shot capabilities across general domains. However, when applied to time series data, they face inherent limitations due to context length. To address this issue, we propose ViTs, a Vision-Language Model (VLM)-based framework that converts time series curves into visual representations. By rescaling time series images, temporal dependencies are preserved while maintaining a consistent input size, thereby enabling efficient processing of arbitrarily long sequences without context constraints. Training VLMs for this purpose introduces unique challenges, primarily due to the scarcity of aligned time series image-text data. To overcome this, we employ an evolutionary algorithm to automatically generate thousands of high-quality image-text pairs and design a three-stage training pipeline consisting of: (1) time series knowledge injection, (2) anomaly detection enhancement, and (3) anomaly reasoning refinement. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ViTs substantially enhance the ability of VLMs to understand and detect anomalies in time series data. All datasets and code will be publicly released at:this https URL.

- **[Bridge Thinking and Acting: Unleashing Physical Potential of VLM with Generalizable Action Expert](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03896)**  `arXiv:2510.03896`  `cs.CV` `cs.RO`  
  _Mingyu Liu, Zheng Huang, Xiaoyi Lin, Muzhi Zhu, Canyu Zhao, Zongze Du, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Although Vision-Language Models (VLM) have demonstrated impressive planning and reasoning capabilities, translating these abilities into the physical world introduces significant challenges. Conventional Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, which integrate reasoning and action into a monolithic architecture, generalize poorly because they are constrained by scarce, narrow-domain data. While recent dual-system approaches attempt to decouple "thinking" from "acting", they are often constrained by semantic ambiguities within the action module. This ambiguity makes large-scale, cross-task training infeasible. Consequently, these systems typically necessitate fine-tuning on newly collected data when deployed to novel environments, and the cooperation mechanism between the two systems remains ill-defined. To address these limitations, we introduce, for the first time, a framework centered around a generalizable action expert. Our approach utilizes sparse 3D trajectories as an intermediate representation, effectively bridging the high-level planning capabilities of the VLM with the low-level physical action module. During the planning phase, the VLM is only required to generate coarse 3D waypoints. These waypoints are then processed by our generalizable action expert, which refines them into dense, executable action sequences by sampling real-time point cloud observations of the environment. To promote training efficiency and robust generalization, we introduce a novel "Action Pre-training, Pointcloud Fine-tuning" paradigm. Our method combines the broad generalization capabilities of VLMs in visual understanding and planning with the fine-grained, action-level generalization of action expert.

- **[AutoDrive-QA: A Multiple-Choice Benchmark for Vision-Language Evaluation in Urban Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15778)**  `arXiv:2503.15778`  `cs.CV` `cs.RO`  
  _Boshra Khalili, Andrew W.Smyth_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Evaluating vision-language models (VLMs) in urban driving contexts remains challenging, as existing benchmarks rely on open-ended responses that are ambiguous, annotation-intensive, and inconsistent to score. This lack of standardized evaluation slows progress toward safe and reliable AI for urban mobility. We introduce AutoDrive-QA, the first benchmark that systematically converts open-ended driving QA datasets (DriveLM, NuScenes-QA, LingoQA) into structured multiple-choice questions (MCQs) with distractors grounded in five realistic error categories: Driving Domain Misconceptions, Logical Inconsistencies, Misinterpreted Sensor Inputs, Computational Oversights, and Question Ambiguity. This framework enables reproducible and interpretable evaluation of VLMs across perception, prediction, and planning tasks in complex urban scenes. Experiments show that fine-tuning LLaVA-1.5-7B improves accuracy by about six percentage points across tasks, GPT-4V achieves the strongest zero-shot performance with up to 69.8% accuracy, and Qwen2-VL models also perform competitively, particularly in multi-view settings. Moreover, traditional metrics such as BLEU and CIDEr fail to distinguish strong from weak models. By providing an objective, domain-grounded evaluation protocol, AutoDrive-QA contributes to more transparent benchmarking of urban AI systems, supporting the development of safer and more trustworthy autonomous driving technologies for smart cities.

  _Kyoungjun Park, Yifan Yang, Juheon Yi, Shicheng Zheng, Yifei Shen, Dongqi Han, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  With the rapid advancement of AI-generated videos, there is an urgent need for effective detection tools to mitigate societal risks such as misinformation and reputational harm. In addition to accurate classification, it is essential that detection models provide interpretable explanations to ensure transparency for regulators and end users. To address these challenges, we introduce VidGuard-R1, the first video authenticity detector that fine-tunes a multi-modal large language model (MLLM) using group relative policy optimization (GRPO). Our model delivers both highly accurate judgments and insightful reasoning. We curate a challenging dataset of 140k real and AI-generated videos produced by state-of-the-art generation models, carefully designing the generation process to maximize discrimination difficulty. We then fine-tune Qwen-VL using GRPO with two specialized reward models that target temporal artifacts and generation complexity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VidGuard-R1 achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on existing benchmarks, with additional training pushing accuracy above 95%. Case studies further show that VidGuard-R1 produces precise and interpretable rationales behind its predictions. The code is publicly available atthis https URL.

- **[Probabilistic Language-Image Pre-Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18857)**  `arXiv:2410.18857`  `cs.CV` `cs.LG`  
  _Sanghyuk Chun, Wonjae Kim, Song Park, Sangdoo Yun_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision-language models (VLMs) embed aligned image-text pairs into a joint space but often rely on deterministic embeddings, assuming a one-to-one correspondence between images and texts. This oversimplifies real-world relationships, which are inherently many-to-many, with multiple captions describing a single image and vice versa. We introduce Probabilistic Language-Image Pre-training (ProLIP), the first probabilistic VLM pre-trained on a billion-scale image-text dataset using only probabilistic objectives, achieving a strong zero-shot capability (e.g., 74.6% ImageNet zero-shot accuracy with ViT-B/16). ProLIP efficiently estimates uncertainty by an "uncertainty token" without extra parameters. We also introduce a novel inclusion loss that enforces distributional inclusion relationships between image-text pairs and between original and masked inputs. Experiments demonstrate that, by leveraging uncertainty estimates, ProLIP benefits downstream tasks and aligns with intuitive notions of uncertainty, e.g., shorter texts being more uncertain and more general inputs including specific ones. Utilizing text uncertainties, we further improve ImageNet accuracy from 74.6% to 75.8% (under a few-shot setting), supporting the practical advantages of our probabilistic approach.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Despite interpretability work analyzing VIT encoders and transformer activations, we don't yet understand why Multimodal Language Models (MLMs) struggle on perception-heavy tasks. We offer an under-studied perspective by examining how popular MLMs (LLaVA-OneVision, Qwen2.5-VL, and Llama-3-LLaVA-NeXT) process their visual key-value tokens. We first study the flow of visual information through the language model, finding that image value tokens encode sufficient information to perform several perception-heavy tasks zero-shot: segmentation, semantic correspondence, temporal correspondence, and referring expression detection. We find that while the language model does augment the visual information received from the projection of input visual encodings-which we reveal correlates with overall MLM perception capability-it contains less visual information on several tasks than the equivalent visual encoder (SigLIP) that has not undergone MLM finetuning. Further, we find that the visual information corresponding to input-agnostic image key tokens in later layers of language models contains artifacts which reduce perception capability of the overall MLM. Next, we discuss controlling visual information in the language model, showing that adding a text prefix to the image input improves perception capabilities of visual representations. Finally, we reveal that if language models were able to better control their visual information, their perception would significantly improve; e.g., in 33.3% of Art Style questions in the BLINK benchmark, perception information present in the language model is not surfaced to the output! Our findings reveal insights into the role of key-value tokens in multimodal systems, paving the way for deeper mechanistic interpretability of MLMs and suggesting new directions for training their visual encoder and language model components.

- **[No Tokens Wasted: Leveraging Long Context in Biomedical Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03978)**  `arXiv:2510.03978`  `cs.CV` `cs.CL`  
  _Min Woo Sun, Alejandro Lozano, Javier Gamazo Tejero, Vishwesh Nath, Xiao Xiao Sun, James Burgess, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Embedding vision-language models (VLMs) are typically pretrained with short text windows (<77 tokens), which forces the truncation of long-format captions. Yet, the distribution of biomedical captions from large-scale open source literature reveals that a huge portion of captions far exceed 77 tokens. To this end, we investigate the impact of pretraining on long-format biomedical captions by extending the context length of text encoders in VLMs. We find that longer context (thus, enabling additional supervision provided in long-format captions) correlates with better retrieval and classification performance. Given this finding, we introduce BIOMEDICA-LongCAP, a dataset of 1M image-caption pairs enriched with context-aware descriptions from full-text articles, providing longer and additional textual supervision. Using BIOMEDICA-LongCAP, we train BMC-LongCLIP, a long-context biomedical VLM with a text encoder supporting windows of up to 512 tokens. Our model extends context capacity by 6.6x, reducing token waste from 55% to just 2.2%. On long-caption retrieval benchmarks, BMC-LongCLIP achieves up to +30% absolute gains in Recall@1 and +2% average improvements in classification, while also converging faster than short-context. Our results demonstrate that long-context modeling is a promising direction for advancing biomedical VLMs.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved notable gains in various tasks by incorporating Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning in language spaces. Recent work extends this direction by leveraging external tools for visual editing, thereby enhancing the visual signal along the reasoning trajectories. Nevertheless, these approaches remain fundamentally constrained: reasoning is still confined to the language space, with visual information treated as static preconditions. We introduce Latent Visual Reasoning (LVR), a new paradigm that enables autoregressive reasoning directly in the visual embedding space. A visual encoder first projects images into visual tokens within a joint semantic space shared with the language model. The language model is then trained to generate latent states that reconstruct key visual tokens critical for answering the query, constituting the process of latent visual reasoning. By interleaving LVR with standard text generation, our model achieves substantial gains on perception-intensive visual question answering tasks. In addition, we adapt the GRPO algorithm to conduct reinforcement learning on latent reasoning, further balancing LVR and textual generation. We show that LVR substantially improves fine-grained visual understanding and perception, achieving 71.67% on MMVP compared to 66.67% with Qwen2.5-VL. Code base and model weights will be released later.

  Employing a single, unified model (UM) for both visual understanding (image-to-text: I2T) and visual generation (text-to-image: T2I) has opened a new direction in Visual Language Model (VLM) research. While UMs can also support broader unimodal tasks (e.g., text-to-text, image-to-image), we focus on the core cross-modal pair T2I and I2T. Existing evaluation benchmarks consider these capabilities in isolation: FID and GenEval for T2I, and benchmarks such as MME, MMBench for I2T. These isolated single-pass metrics do not reveal cross-consistency: whether a model that "understands" a concept can also "render" it, nor whether semantic meaning is preserved when cycling between image and text modalities. To address this, we introduce the Semantic Drift Protocol (SDP) for Unified Models, a cyclic evaluation protocol that alternates I2T and T2I over multiple generations to quantify semantic drift. We propose two metrics: (i) Mean Cumulative Drift (MCD), an embedding-based measure of overall semantic drift; and (ii) Multi-Generation GenEval (MGG), an object-level compliance score extending GenEval. To assess generalization beyond COCO dataset, which is widely used in training; we create a new benchmark Nocaps+Docci400, sampled from NoCaps and DOCCI and evaluated on seven recent models. SDP reveals substantial variation in cross-modal stability: some models like BAGEL maintain semantic meaning over many alternations, whereas others like VILA-U drift quickly despite strong single-pass scores. Our results highlight SDP as a necessary complement to standard I2T and T2I evaluations. Code is available atthis https URL

  The rapid extension of context windows in large vision-language models has given rise to long-context vision-language models (LCVLMs), which are capable of handling hundreds of images with interleaved text tokens in a single forward pass. In this work, we introduce MMLongBench, the first benchmark covering a diverse set of long-context vision-language tasks, to evaluate LCVLMs effectively and thoroughly. MMLongBench is composed of 13,331 examples spanning five different categories of downstream tasks, such as Visual RAG and Many-Shot ICL. It also provides broad coverage of image types, including various natural and synthetic images. To assess the robustness of the models to different input lengths, all examples are delivered at five standardized input lengths (8K-128K tokens) via a cross-modal tokenization scheme that combines vision patches and text tokens. Through a thorough benchmarking of 46 closed-source and open-source LCVLMs, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the current models' vision-language long-context ability. Our results show that: i) performance on a single task is a weak proxy for overall long-context capability; ii) both closed-source and open-source models face challenges in long-context vision-language tasks, indicating substantial room for future improvement; iii) models with stronger reasoning ability tend to exhibit better long-context performance. By offering wide task coverage, various image types, and rigorous length control, MMLongBench provides the missing foundation for diagnosing and advancing the next generation of LCVLMs.

  This paper identifies a critical yet underexplored challenge in distilling from multimodal large language models (MLLMs): the reasoning trajectories generated by multiple drifting teachers exhibit concept drift, whereby their reasoning distributions evolve unpredictably and transmit biases to the student model, ultimately compromising its performance. To tackle this issue, we pioneer a theoretical connection between concept drift and knowledge distillation, casting the non-stationary reasoning dynamics from multiple MLLM teachers as next-token prediction of multi-stream reasoningthis http URLby concept drift, we introduce the "learn, compare, critique" paradigm, culminating in autonomous preference optimization (APO). Under the active guidance of the teachers, the student model first learns and self-distils preferred thinking by comparing multiple teachers. It then engages in critical reflection over the drifting inference from teachers, performing concept alignment through APO, ultimately yielding a robust, consistent, and generalizablethis http URLexperiments demonstrate our superior performance of consistency, robustness and generalization within knowledge distillation. Besides, we also contributed a large-scale dataset, CXR-MAX (Multi-teachers Alignment X-rays), comprising 170,982 distilled reasoning trajectories derived from publicly accessible MLLMs based on MIMIC-CXR.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision-language models (VLMs) have advanced multimodal reasoning but still face challenges in spatial reasoning for 3D scenes and complex object configurations. To address this, we introduce SpatialViLT, an enhanced VLM that integrates spatial features like depth maps, 3D coordinates, and edge maps through a multi-task learning framework. This approach enriches multimodal embeddings with spatial understanding. We propose two variants: SpatialViLT and MaskedSpatialViLT, focusing on full and masked object regions, respectively. Additionally, SpatialEnsemble combines both approaches, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy. Our models excel in spatial reasoning categories such as directional, topological, and proximity relations, as demonstrated on the challenging Visual Spatial Reasoning (VSR) dataset. This work represents a significant step in enhancing the spatial intelligence of AI systems, crucial for advanced multimodal understanding and real-world applications.

  The rapid growth of AI-generated imagery has blurred the boundary between real and synthetic content, raising critical concerns for digital integrity. Vision-language models (VLMs) offer interpretability through explanations but often fail to detect subtle artifacts in high-quality synthetic images. We propose ZoomIn, a two-stage forensic framework that improves both accuracy and interpretability. Mimicking human visual inspection, ZoomIn first scans an image to locate suspicious regions and then performs a focused analysis on these zoomed-in areas to deliver a grounded verdict. To support training, we introduce MagniFake, a dataset of 20,000 real and high-quality synthetic images annotated with bounding boxes and forensic explanations, generated through an automated VLM-based pipeline. Our method achieves 96.39% accuracy with robust generalization, while providing human-understandable explanations grounded in visual evidence.

  The main challenges limiting the adoption of deep learning-based solutions in medical workflows are the availability of annotated data and the lack of interpretability of such systems. Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) tackle the latter by constraining the model output on a set of predefined and human-interpretable concepts. However, the increased interpretability achieved through these concept-based explanations implies a higher annotation burden. Moreover, if a new concept needs to be added, the whole system needs to be retrained. Inspired by the remarkable performance shown by Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) in few-shot settings, we propose a simple, yet effective, methodology, CBVLM, which tackles both of the aforementioned challenges. First, for each concept, we prompt the LVLM to answer if the concept is present in the input image. Then, we ask the LVLM to classify the image based on the previous concept predictions. Moreover, in both stages, we incorporate a retrieval module responsible for selecting the best examples for in-context learning. By grounding the final diagnosis on the predicted concepts, we ensure explainability, and by leveraging the few-shot capabilities of LVLMs, we drastically lower the annotation cost. We validate our approach with extensive experiments across four medical datasets and twelve LVLMs (both generic and medical) and show that CBVLM consistently outperforms CBMs and task-specific supervised methods without requiring any training and using just a few annotated examples.

  Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have become a central focus of today's AI community, owing to their impressive abilities gained from training on large-scale vision-language data from the Web. These models have demonstrated strong performance across diverse tasks, including image understanding, video understanding, complex visual reasoning, and embodied AI. Despite these noteworthy successes, a fundamental question remains: Can VLMs count objects correctly? In this paper, we introduce a simple yet effective benchmark, VLMCountBench, designed under a minimalist setting with only basic geometric shapes (e.g., triangles, circles) and their compositions, focusing exclusively on counting tasks without interference from other factors. We adopt strict independent variable control and systematically study the effects of simple properties such as color, size, and prompt refinement in a controlled ablation. Our empirical results reveal that while VLMs can count reliably when only one shape type is present, they exhibit substantial failures when multiple shape types are combined (i.e., compositional counting). This highlights a fundamental empirical limitation of current VLMs and motivates important directions for future research.

  Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have markedly expanded the competence of graphical user-interface (GUI) systems, propelling them beyond controlled simulations into complex, real-world environments across diverse platforms. However, practical usefulness is still bounded by the reliability of visual grounding, i.e., mapping textual references to exact on-screen elements. This limitation prevents the system from accurately performing pointer-level actions such as clicking or dragging. To address it, we introduce GUI-Spotlight -- a model trained for image-grounded reasoning that dynamically invokes multiple specialized tools to iteratively narrow its focus to the relevant region of the screen, thereby substantially improving visual grounding accuracy. On the ScreenSpot-Pro benchmark, GUI-Spotlight trained with only 18.5K training samples achieves 52.8\% accuracy, surpassing V2P-7B (50.6\% with 9.6M training samples) and GTA-1-7B (50.1\% with 1.56M training samples).

  Industrial accidents, particularly in high-risk domains such as surface and underground mining, are frequently caused by unsafe worker behaviors. Traditional manual inspection remains labor-intensive, error-prone, and insufficient for large-scale, dynamic environments, highlighting the urgent need for intelligent and automated safety monitoring. In this paper, we present MonitorVLM, a novel vision--language framework designed to detect safety violations directly from surveillance video streams. MonitorVLM introduces three key innovations: (1) a domain-specific violation dataset comprising 9,000 vision--question--answer (VQA) samples across 40 high-frequency mining regulations, enriched with augmentation and auxiliary detection cues; (2) a clause filter (CF) module that dynamically selects the Top-$K$ most relevant clauses, reducing inference latency by 13.56\% while maintaining accuracy; and (3) a behavior magnifier (BM) module that enhances worker regions to improve fine-grained action recognition, yielding additional gains of 3.45% in precision and 8.62% in recall. Experimental results demonstrate that MonitorVLM significantly outperforms baseline vision--language models, achieving improvements of 22.01% in precision, 34.22\% in recall, and 28.37% in F1 score over the 72B unfine-tuned baseline. A lightweight web-based interface further integrates MonitorVLM into practical workflows, enabling automatic violation reporting with video timestamping. This study highlights the potential of multimodal large models to enhance occupational safety monitoring in mining and beyond.

  Large vision-language models (LVLMs) show strong performance across multimodal benchmarks but remain limited in structured reasoning and precise grounding. Recent work has demonstrated that adding simple visual structures, such as partitions and annotations, improves accuracy, yet the internal mechanisms underlying these gains remain unclear. We investigate this phenomenon and propose the concept of Grounding IDs, latent identifiers induced by external cues that bind objects to their designated partitions across modalities. Through representation analysis, we find that these identifiers emerge as robust within-partition alignment in embedding space and reduce the modality gap between image and text. Causal interventions further confirm that these identifiers mediate binding between objects and symbolic cues. We show that Grounding IDs strengthen attention between related components, which in turn improves cross-modal grounding and reduces hallucinations. Taken together, our results identify Grounding IDs as a key symbolic mechanism explaining how external cues enhance multimodal binding, offering both interpretability and practical improvements in robustness.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Understanding how people read city scenes can inform design and planning. We introduce a small benchmark for testing vision-language models (VLMs) on urban perception using 100 Montreal street images, evenly split between photographs and photorealistic synthetic scenes. Twelve participants from seven community groups supplied 230 annotation forms across 30 dimensions mixing physical attributes and subjective impressions. French responses were normalized to English. We evaluated seven VLMs in a zero-shot setup with a structured prompt and deterministic parser. We use accuracy for single-choice items and Jaccard overlap for multi-label items; human agreement uses Krippendorff's alpha and pairwise Jaccard. Results suggest stronger model alignment on visible, objective properties than subjective appraisals. The top system (claude-sonnet) reaches macro 0.31 and mean Jaccard 0.48 on multi-label items. Higher human agreement coincides with better model scores. Synthetic images slightly lower scores. We release the benchmark, prompts, and harness for reproducible, uncertainty-aware evaluation in participatory urban analysis.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  With the growing deployment of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in real-world applications, previously overlooked safety risks are becoming increasingly evident. In particular, seemingly innocuous multimodal inputs can combine to reveal harmful intent, leading to unsafe model outputs. While multimodal safety has received increasing attention, existing approaches often fail to address such latent risks, especially when harmfulness arises only from the interaction between modalities. We propose SIA (Safety via Intent Awareness), a training-free, intent-aware safety framework that proactively detects harmful intent in multimodal inputs and uses it to guide the generation of safe responses. SIA follows a three-stage process: (1) visual abstraction via captioning; (2) intent inference through few-shot chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting; and (3) intent-conditioned response generation. By dynamically adapting to the implicit intent inferred from an image-text pair, SIA mitigates harmful outputs without extensive retraining. Extensive experiments on safety benchmarks, including SIUO, MM-SafetyBench, and HoliSafe, show that SIA consistently improves safety and outperforms prior training-free methods.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) is a widely adopted technique for encoding relative positional information in large language models (LLMs). However, when extended to vision-language models (VLMs), RoPE and its variants enforce relative positional dependencies separately within text and image tokens, introducing unintended cross-modal positional biases. For example, image tokens depicting semantically consistent content are assigned distinct positional encodings solely due to spatial location variations. As a result, such tokens exhibit entirely different relative positional relationships with their corresponding text tokens, ultimately leading to misaligned cross-modal representations. To address this, we propose Per-Token Distance, a simple yet effective metric for quantifying the independence of positional encodings across modalities. Informed by this analysis, we introduce Circle-RoPE, a novel encoding scheme designed to eliminate spurious cross-modal biases. Our key idea is to project image token indices onto a \emph{ring} that is orthogonal to the linear axis of text token indices, thereby forming a cone-like structure in the positional encoding space. In this configuration, each text token (point on the linear text axis) becomes the apex of a cone and maintains an equal distance to all image tokens (points on the circular image \emph{ring}), reducing artificial cross-modal biases while preserving intra-image spatial information. To further enhance performance, we propose a staggered strategy that applies different RoPE variants across layers. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method effectively preserves spatial information from images while reducing relative positional bias, offering a more robust and flexible positional encoding framework for VLMs. The code is available atthis https URL.

  Visual reasoning abilities play a crucial role in understanding complex multimodal data, advancing both domain-specific applications and artificial general intelligence (AGI). Existing methods enhance Vision-Language Models (VLMs) through Chain-of-Thought (CoT) supervised fine-tuning using meticulously annotated data. However, this approach may lead to overfitting and cognitive rigidity, limiting the model's generalization ability under domain shifts and reducing real-world applicability. To overcome these limitations, we propose Reason-RFT, a two-stage reinforcement fine-tuning framework for visual reasoning. First, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with curated CoT data activates the reasoning potential of VLMs. This is followed by reinforcement learning based on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), which generates multiple reasoning-response pairs to enhance adaptability to domain shifts. To evaluate Reason-RFT, we reconstructed a comprehensive dataset covering visual counting, structural perception, and spatial transformation, serving as a benchmark for systematic assessment across three key dimensions. Experimental results highlight three advantages: (1) performance enhancement, with Reason-RFT achieving state-of-the-art results and outperforming both open-source and proprietary models; (2) generalization superiority, maintaining robust performance under domain shifts across various tasks; and (3) data efficiency, excelling in few-shot learning scenarios and surpassing full-dataset SFT baselines. Reason-RFT introduces a novel training paradigm for visual reasoning and marks a significant step forward in multimodal research. Project website:this https URL

  _Zhenyu Pan, Han Liu_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present MetaSpatial, the first reinforcement learning (RL)-based framework designed to enhance 3D spatial reasoning in vision-language models (VLMs), enabling real-time 3D scene generation without the need for hard-coded optimizations. MetaSpatial addresses two core challenges: (i) the lack of internalized 3D spatial reasoning in VLMs, which limits their ability to generate realistic layouts, and (ii) the inefficiency of traditional supervised fine-tuning (SFT) for layout generation tasks, as perfect ground truth annotations are unavailable. Our key innovation is a multi-turn RL-based optimization mechanism that integrates physics-aware constraints and rendered image evaluations, ensuring generated 3D layouts are coherent, physically plausible, and aesthetically consistent. Methodologically, MetaSpatial introduces an adaptive, iterative reasoning process, where the VLM refines spatial arrangements over multiple turns by analyzing rendered outputs, improving scene coherence progressively. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that MetaSpatial significantly enhances the spatial consistency and formatting stability of various scale models. Post-training, object placements are more realistic, aligned, and functionally coherent, validating the effectiveness of RL for 3D spatial reasoning in metaverse, AR/VR, digital twins, and game development applications. Our code, data, and training pipeline are publicly available atthis https URL.

  While modern visual generation models excel at creating aesthetically pleasing natural images, they struggle with producing or editing structured visuals like charts, diagrams, and mathematical figures, which demand composition planning, text rendering, and multimodal reasoning for factual fidelity. To address this, we present the first comprehensive, systematic investigation of this domain, encompassing data construction, model training, and an evaluation benchmark. First, we construct a large-scale dataset of 1.3 million high-quality structured image pairs derived from executable drawing programs and augmented with chain-of-thought reasoning annotations. Building on it, we train a unified model that integrates a VLM with FLUX.1 Kontext via a lightweight connector for enhanced multimodal understanding. A three-stage training curriculum enables progressive feature alignment, knowledge infusion, and reasoning-augmented generation, further boosted by an external reasoner at inference time. Finally, we introduce StructBench, a novel benchmark for generation and editing with over 1,700 challenging instances, and an accompanying evaluation metric, StructScore, which employs a multi-round Q\&A protocol to assess fine-grained factual accuracy. Evaluations of 15 models reveal that even leading closed-source systems remain far from satisfactory. Our model attains strong editing performance, and inference-time reasoning yields consistent gains across diverse architectures. By releasing the dataset, model, and benchmark, we aim to advance unified multimodal foundations for structured visuals.

  Conventional representation learning methods learn a universal representation that primarily captures dominant semantics, which may not always align with customized downstream tasks. For instance, in animal habitat analysis, researchers prioritize scene-related features, whereas universal embeddings emphasize categorical semantics, leading to suboptimal results. As a solution, existing approaches resort to supervised fine-tuning, which however incurs high computational and annotation costs. In this paper, we propose Conditional Representation Learning (CRL), aiming to extract representations tailored to arbitrary user-specified criteria. Specifically, we reveal that the semantics of a space are determined by its basis, thereby enabling a set of descriptive words to approximate the basis for a customized feature space. Building upon this insight, given a user-specified criterion, CRL first employs a large language model (LLM) to generate descriptive texts to construct the semantic basis, then projects the image representation into this conditional feature space leveraging a vision-language model (VLM). The conditional representation better captures semantics for the specific criterion, which could be utilized for multiple customized tasks. Extensive experiments on classification and retrieval tasks demonstrate the superiority and generality of the proposed CRL. The code is available atthis https URL.

  Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved significant progress in multimodal understanding tasks, demonstrating strong capabilities particularly in general tasks such as image captioning and visual reasoning. However, when dealing with specialized cultural heritage domains like 3D vase artifacts, existing models face severe data scarcity issues and insufficient domain knowledge limitations. Due to the lack of targeted training data, current VLMs struggle to effectively handle such culturally significant specialized tasks. To address these challenges, we propose the VaseVQA-3D dataset, which serves as the first 3D visual question answering dataset for ancient Greek pottery analysis, collecting 664 ancient Greek vase 3D models with corresponding question-answer data and establishing a complete data construction pipeline. We further develop the VaseVLM model, enhancing model performance in vase artifact analysis through domain-adaptive training. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our approach, where we improve by 12.8% on R@1 metrics and by 6.6% on lexical similarity compared with previous state-of-the-art on the VaseVQA-3D dataset, significantly improving the recognition and understanding of 3D vase artifacts, providing new technical pathways for digital heritage preservation research.

  Effectively applying Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to Video Question Answering (VideoQA) hinges on selecting a concise yet comprehensive set of frames, as processing entire videos is computationally infeasible. However, current frame selection methods face a critical trade-off: approaches relying on lightweight similarity models, such as CLIP, often fail to capture the nuances of complex queries, resulting in inaccurate similarity scores that cannot reflect the authentic query-frame relevance, which further undermines frame selection. Meanwhile, methods that leverage a VLM for deeper analysis achieve higher accuracy but incur prohibitive computational costs. To address these limitations, we propose A.I.R., a training-free approach for Adaptive, Iterative, and Reasoning-based frame selection. We leverage a powerful VLM to perform deep, semantic analysis on complex queries, and this analysis is deployed within a cost-effective iterative loop that processes only a small batch of the most high-potential frames at a time. Extensive experiments on various VideoQA benchmarks demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing frame selection methods, significantly boosts the performance of the foundation VLM, and achieves substantial gains in computational efficiency over other VLM-based techniques.

  Autonomous driving perception systems are particularly vulnerable in foggy conditions, where light scattering reduces contrast and obscures fine details critical for safe operation. While numerous defogging methods exist-from handcrafted filters to learned restoration models-improvements in image fidelity do not consistently translate into better downstream detection and segmentation. Moreover, prior evaluations often rely on synthetic data, leaving questions about real-world transferability. We present a structured empirical study that benchmarks a comprehensive set of pipelines, including (i) classical filters, (ii) modern defogging networks, (iii) chained variants (filter$\rightarrow$model, model$\rightarrow$filter), and (iv) prompt-driven visual--language image editing models (VLM) applied directly to foggy images. Using Foggy Cityscapes, we assess both image quality and downstream performance on object detection (mAP) and segmentation (PQ, RQ, SQ). Our analysis reveals when defogging helps, when chaining yields synergy or degradation, and how VLM-based editors compare to dedicated approaches. In addition, we evaluate qualitative rubric-based scores from a VLM judge and quantify their alignment with task metrics, showing strong correlations with mAP. Together, these results establish a transparent, task-oriented benchmark for defogging methods and highlight the conditions under which preprocessing genuinely improves autonomous perception in adverse weather.

  Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance on vision-language reasoning tasks. However, their potential for zero-shot fine-grained image classification, a challenging task requiring precise differentiation between visually similar categories, remains underexplored. We present a novel method that transforms zero-shot fine-grained image classification into a visual question-answering framework, leveraging LVLMs' comprehensive understanding capabilities rather than relying on direct class name generation. We enhance model performance through a novel attention intervention technique. We also address a key limitation in existing datasets by developing more comprehensive and precise class description benchmarks. We validate the effectiveness of our method through extensive experimentation across multiple fine-grained image classification benchmarks. Our proposed method consistently outperforms the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) approach, demonstrating both the effectiveness of our method and the broader potential of LVLMs for zero-shot fine-grained classification tasks.

  In recent years, with the rapid development of powerful multimodal large language models (MLLMs), explainable image quality assessment (IQA) has gradually become popular, aiming at providing quality-related descriptions and answers of images. To achieve this goal, recent methods seek to construct a large-scale instruction tuning dataset to empower the MLLM with quality perception ability following the well-known scaling law. However, a large amount of instruction tuning data may cause substantial computational costs and redundant data, which in turn will cause harm to the performance of the model. To cope with this problem, in this paper, we challenge the scaling law and systematically investigate the role of data quality of the instruction tuning dataset for explainable IQA. Using a powerful pre-trained MLLM, we first investigate the changes in model performance after fine-tuning with different sizes of instruction tuning data. We find that selecting a subset of the data set randomly using an appropriate ratio can even lead to better results than training with the entire instruction tuning dataset, demonstrating the redundancy of current explainable IQA instruction tuning data. Beyond randomly sampling a subset, we propose a clustering-based data selection framework with three stages: clustering feature extraction, cluster quota allocation, and cluster sampling strategy. Then we systematically analyze the choices of each stage and propose a simple but efficient data selection method IQA-Select for explainable IQA. The experimental results demonstrate that IQA-Select can achieve 102.1% and 103.7% performance of full fine-tuning using only 10% selected data in Q-Bench and AesBench respectively, significantly reducing computational costs while achieving better performance.

  Recent advances in image generation models have led to models that produce synthetic images that are increasingly difficult for standard AI detectors to identify, even though they often remain distinguishable by humans. To identify this discrepancy, we introduce \textbf{Mirage}, a curated dataset comprising a diverse range of AI-generated images exhibiting visible artifacts, where current state-of-the-art detection methods largely fail. Furthermore, we investigate whether Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), which are increasingly employed as substitutes for human judgment in various tasks, can be leveraged for explainable AI image detection. Our experiments on both Mirage and existing benchmark datasets demonstrate that while LVLMs are highly effective at detecting AI-generated images with visible artifacts, their performance declines when confronted with images lacking such cues.

  Vision-language models (VLMs) have advanced video understanding, but their performance is limited by the number of input frames they can process. Existing frame sampling strategies, such as uniform or fixed-budget selection, often fail to adapt to variations in information density or task complexity, resulting in inefficiency and information loss. To address this, we present FrameOracle, a lightweight and plug-and-play module that predicts both (1) which frames are most relevant to a given query and (2) how many frames are needed. FrameOracle is trained using a four-stage curriculum, with the first three stages relying on weak proxy signals such as cross-modal similarity. In the final stage, it leverages stronger supervision from a new dataset we introduce, FrameOracle-41K, the first large-scale VideoQA collection to provide keyframe annotations specifying the minimal set of frames required to answer each question. Extensive experiments across five VLMs and six benchmarks demonstrate that FrameOracle reduces 16-frame inputs to an average of 10.4 frames without any loss in accuracy. When starting from 64-frame candidates, it reduces the input to an average of 13.9 frames while improving accuracy by 1.4%, achieving state-of-the-art efficiency-accuracy trade-offs for scalable video understanding.

  Dynamic Chart Generation (DCG) involves producing code-rendered animated visualizations as charts. While recent advances in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have significantly improved their capability on static chart generation and comprehension, MLLMs' potential for handling dynamic chart generation and understanding remains underexplored. To bridge this research gap, we introduce DCG-Bench (Dynamic Chart Generation Benchmark), the first benchmark evaluating MLLM's capability on dynamic chart generation tasks from three dimensions: Simple Text-to-Chart, Detailed Text-to-Chart, and Video-to-Chart tasks. We construct DCG-8K, a high-quality DCG dataset with annotations covering instruction-code-video triplets and QA pairs for both code and video evaluation. Based on DCG-8K, we explored a two-stage training recipe, proposing Joint-Code-Visual Reward for group relative policy optimization to construct expert MLLM Qwen2.5-VL-DCG-3B for the DCG task. Our benchmarking result reveals shortcomings of existing MLLMs in the visual-to-chart task, and our model beats the best open-sourced MLLM with an average 8.31% performance gain across three tasks, and shows on par performance against proprietary models with only 3B parameters, proving the effectiveness of our training recipe.

  Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents powered by Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) promise human-like interaction with software applications, yet long-horizon tasks remain challenging due to memory limitations. Existing approaches either truncate history or rely on simple textual summaries, which risk losing critical information when past visual details become necessary for future decisions. In this paper, we propose \textbf{PAL-UI} (\textbf{P}lanning with \textbf{A}ctive \textbf{L}ook-back), a novel framework that enables GUI agents to adaptively retrieve past observations when required. PAL-UI combines a dual-level summarization agent, capturing both observation-level cues and action-level outcomes, with a dedicated retrieval tool that allows the agent to recall specific historical screenshots during planning. We curate a step-level instruction dataset of 8.6K samples from mobile GUI navigation trajectories and train \textbf{PAL-UI-3B} and \textbf{PAL-UI-7B} models based on Qwen2.5-VL. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PAL-UI significantly outperforms baseline models and prior methods in mobile GUI navigation tasks, even under data-efficient settings. Moreover, PAL-UI exhibits strong cross-domain generalization, achieving notable improvements in web navigation without additional training. Our work highlights the potential of active memory retrieval for long-horizon planning capabilities of vision-based GUI agents.

  Improving vision-language models (VLMs) in the post-training stage typically relies on supervised fine-tuning or reinforcement learning, methods that necessitate costly, human-annotated data. While self-supervised techniques such as self-consistency have proven effective for enhancing reasoning capabilities, their application to perceptual domains such as image quality assessment (IQA) remains largely unexplored. In this work, we introduce EvoQuality, a novel framework that enables a VLM to autonomously refine its quality perception capabilities without any ground-truth labels. EvoQuality adapts the principle of self-consistency to the ranking-based nature of IQA. It generates pseudo-labels by performing pairwise majority voting on the VLM's own outputs to establish a consensus on relative quality. These pseudo-rankings are then formulated into a fidelity reward that guides the model's iterative evolution through group relative policy optimization (GRPO). By iteratively leveraging its own predictions, EvoQuality progressively refines the VLM's perceptual capability. Extensive experiments show that EvoQuality boosts the base VLM's zero-shot performance by 31.8\% on PLCC across diverse IQA benchmarks. Remarkably, despite being entirely self-supervised, EvoQuality achieves performance that is competitive with, or even surpasses, state-of-the-art supervised VLM-based IQA models, outperforming these models on 5 out of 7 IQA benchmarks.

  Short video platforms are evolving rapidly, making the identification of inappropriate content increasingly critical. Existing approaches typically train separate and small classification models for each type of issue, which requires extensive human-labeled data and lacks cross-issue generalization. We propose a reasoning-enhanced multimodal large language model (MLLM) pretraining paradigm for unified inappropriate content detection. To address the distribution gap between short video content and the original pretraining data of MLLMs, as well as the complex issue definitions, we introduce three targeted pretraining tasks: (1) \textit{Caption}, to enhance the MLLM's perception of video details; (2) \textit{Visual Question Answering (VQA)}, to deepen the MLLM's understanding of issue definitions and annotation guidelines; (3) \textit{Chain-of-Thought (CoT)}, to enhance the MLLM's reasoning capability. Experimental results show that our pretraining approach significantly improves the MLLM's performance in both zero-shot and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) settings. In addition, our pretrained model demonstrates strong generalization capabilities to emergent, previously unseen issues.

  Gender bias in vision-language foundation models (VLMs) raises concerns about their safe deployment and is typically evaluated using benchmarks with gender annotations on real-world images. However, as these benchmarks often contain spurious correlations between gender and non-gender features, such as objects and backgrounds, we identify a critical oversight in gender bias evaluation: Do spurious features distort gender bias evaluation? To address this question, we systematically perturb non-gender features across four widely used benchmarks (COCO-gender, FACET, MIAP, and PHASE) and various VLMs to quantify their impact on bias evaluation. Our findings reveal that even minimal perturbations, such as masking just 10% of objects or weakly blurring backgrounds, can dramatically alter bias scores, shifting metrics by up to 175% in generative VLMs and 43% in CLIP variants. This suggests that current bias evaluations often reflect model responses to spurious features rather than gender bias, undermining their reliability. Since creating spurious feature-free benchmarks is fundamentally challenging, we recommend reporting bias metrics alongside feature-sensitivity measurements to enable a more reliable bias assessment.

  Vision Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable breakthroughs in the field of remote sensing in recent years. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery, with its all-weather capability, is essential in remote sensing, yet the lack of large-scale, high-quality SAR image-text datasets hinders its semantic understanding. In this paper, we construct SAR-TEXT, a large-scale and high-quality dataset consisting of over 130,000 SAR image-text pairs. To construct the SAR-TEXT dataset, we design the SAR-Narrator framework, which generates textual descriptions for SAR images through a multi-stage strategy. To verify the effectiveness of the SAR-TEXT dataset, we conduct experiments on three typical vision-language tasks: image-text retrieval, image captioning, and visual question answering (VQA). Specifically, we construct three representative models on SAR-TEXT: SAR-RS-CLIP, SAR-RS-CoCa, and SAR-GPT. SAR-RS-CLIP achieves notable improvements in retrieval performance, boosting average recall by 12.97% and 10.0% on the OSdataset_512 and HRSID test sets, respectively. In the captioning task, SAR-RS-CoCa achieves significant improvements over the original CoCa models in terms of BLEU-4, SPICE, and CIDEr scores. In the VQA task, SAR-GPT outperforms baseline and single-stage models on multiple SAR-VQA datasets, demonstrating stronger semantic understanding and reasoning ability, as further confirmed by qualitative results. It is worth noting that, as a flexible captioning tool, SAR-Narrator can be readily adopted by the community to construct larger-scale SAR image-text datasets.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) have undergone rapid progress, largely attributed to reinforcement learning on complex reasoning tasks. In contrast, while spatial intelligence is fundamental for Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in real-world interaction, the systematic study of their complex spatial reasoning remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce SIRI-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate VLMs' structural spatial intelligence through spatial-grounded reasoning tasks. SIRI-Bench comprises 9,000 video-question-answer triplets, where each problem is embedded in a realistic 3D scene. The benchmark is carefully designed so that solving each problem requires both spatial comprehension and structural reasoning. To facilitate large-scale data synthesis, we develop an Automatic Scene Creation Engine that employs collaborative LLM agents to translate abstract mathematical problems into faithful 3D scenes. Experimental results reveal that state-of-the-art VLMs struggle significantly on SIRI-Bench, underscoring the challenge of structural spatial reasoning. We hope that our study will bring researchers' attention to spatially grounded reasoning and advance VLMs in visual problem-solving.

  The advancement in large language models (LLMs) and large vision models has fueled the rapid progress in multi-modal vision-language reasoning capabilities. However, existing vision-language models (VLMs) remain challenged by compositional visual reasoning. This paper presents VLAgent, a neuro-symbolic approach to developing a Vision-Language Agent system for efficient compositional visual reasoning with three novel features. First, VLAgent develops an interpretable visualization-enhanced two-stage neuro-symbolic reasoning system. The first stage is managed by a front-end engine that generates a structured visual reasoning plan (symbolic program script) for each compositional visual reasoning task by utilizing a pre-trained LLM powered with few-shot chain-of-thought in-context learning. The second stage is managed by a high-performance back-end engine. It transforms the planning script into executable code based on visual input (image or video) and the combination of neural models and symbolic functions and then performs a sequence of actions for the compositional visual reason task. Second, to ensure and enhance the quality of mapping the logic plan to a sequence of executable instructions, VLAgent introduces the SS-parser, which examines the syntax and semantic correctness of the planning script, detects and repairs the logic errors found in the LLM-generated logic plan before generating the executable program. Third, VLAgent introduces the execution verifier in critical reasoning steps to validate and refine its compositional reasoning results in a stepwise manner, for example, ensemble methods for critical visual reasoning and caption analysis for low-confidence compositional reasoning. Extensive experiments on six visual benchmarks compared to a dozen SoTA visual reasoning models show that VLAgent outperforms existing representative approaches to compositional visual reasoning.

  _Jiaxing Zhang, Hao Tang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Unified multimodal large language models (MLLMs) based on end-to-end autoregressive (AR) transformers effectively integrate both understanding and generation tasks within a single framework. However, intrinsic Task Objective Conflicts between high-level semantic abstraction in understanding and fine-grained detail preservation in generation pose significant challenges, often leading to suboptimal trade-offs and task interference. Existing solutions, such as decoupling shared visual encoders, fall short of fundamentally resolving these conflicts due to inherent AR architecture. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that decouples internal components of AR to resolve task objective conflicts. Specifically, we design UTAMoE, a Unified Task-Aware Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework that decouples internal AR modules via a Task-Aware MoE Layer to create task-specific optimization subpaths. To enhance task differentiation while maintaining overall coordination, we introduce a novel Two-Stage Training Strategy. Extensive experiments on multimodal benchmarks demonstrate that UTAMoE mitigates task objective conflicts, achieving state-of-the-art performance across various tasks. Visualizations and ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of our approach.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Text-driven object insertion in 3D scenes is an emerging task that enables intuitive scene editing through natural language. However, existing 2D editing-based methods often rely on spatial priors such as 2D masks or 3D bounding boxes, and they struggle to ensure consistency of the inserted object. These limitations hinder flexibility and scalability in real-world applications. In this paper, we propose FreeInsert, a novel framework that leverages foundation models including MLLMs, LGMs, and diffusion models to disentangle object generation from spatial placement. This enables unsupervised and flexible object insertion in 3D scenes without spatial priors. FreeInsert starts with an MLLM-based parser that extracts structured semantics, including object types, spatial relationships, and attachment regions, from user instructions. These semantics guide both the reconstruction of the inserted object for 3D consistency and the learning of its degrees of freedom. We leverage the spatial reasoning capabilities of MLLMs to initialize object pose and scale. A hierarchical, spatially aware refinement stage further integrates spatial semantics and MLLM-inferred priors to enhance placement. Finally, the appearance of the object is improved using the inserted-object image to enhance visual fidelity. Experimental results demonstrate that FreeInsert achieves semantically coherent, spatially precise, and visually realistic 3D insertions without relying on spatial priors, offering a user-friendly and flexible editing experience.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Medical image segmentation remains challenging due to the high cost of pixel-level annotations for training. In the context of weak supervision, clinician gaze data captures regions of diagnostic interest; however, its sparsity limits its use for segmentation. In contrast, vision-language models (VLMs) provide semantic context through textual descriptions but lack the explanation precision required. Recognizing that neither source alone suffices, we propose a teacher-student framework that integrates both gaze and language supervision, leveraging their complementary strengths. Our key insight is that gaze data indicates where clinicians focus during diagnosis, while VLMs explain why those regions are significant. To implement this, the teacher model first learns from gaze points enhanced by VLM-generated descriptions of lesion morphology, establishing a foundation for guiding the student model. The teacher then directs the student through three strategies: (1) Multi-scale feature alignment to fuse visual cues with textual semantics; (2) Confidence-weighted consistency constraints to focus on reliable predictions; (3) Adaptive masking to limit error propagation in uncertain areas. Experiments on the Kvasir-SEG, NCI-ISBI, and ISIC datasets show that our method achieves Dice scores of 80.78%, 80.53%, and 84.22%, respectively-improving 3-5% over gaze baselines without increasing the annotation burden. By preserving correlations among predictions, gaze data, and lesion descriptions, our framework also maintains clinical interpretability. This work illustrates how integrating human visual attention with AI-generated semantic context can effectively overcome the limitations of individual weak supervision signals, thereby advancing the development of deployable, annotation-efficient medical AI systems.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Under pure textual modality, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success in complex reasoning tasks by decomposing them into simpler sub-problems. However, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) still struggle with some seemingly straightforward visual tasks, such as counting and solving jigsaw puzzles. We argue that these tasks challenge the ability of visual-to-textual conversion, where MLLMs convert visual information perceived from the input scene, to textual information for further reasoning and generating the answer. If the complexity of the visual input is beyond the perceptual capability of the MLLMs, without decomposing this conversion process, simply scaling inference-time reasoning cannot solve the task because it repeatedly encounters the same perceptual bottleneck. We propose an approach, autonomous imagination, to enable MLLMs to iteratively modify visual inputs (e.g. isolating objects, rearranging puzzle pieces) into intermediate visual states, decomposing visual-to-textual conversion into closed-loop visual modification steps. We show that, without any retraining, MLLMs can now solve tasks initially beyond their perceptual capability, highlighting that closed-loop visual modification can be an effective way of decomposing the visual reasoning task into solvable substeps. Our code and data are released atthis https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The development of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) enables the evaluation of image quality through natural language descriptions. This advancement allows for more detailed assessments. However, these MLLM-based IQA methods primarily rely on general contextual descriptions, sometimes limiting fine-grained quality assessment. To address this limitation, we introduce a new image quality assessment (IQA) task paradigm, **grounding-IQA**. This paradigm integrates multimodal referring and grounding with IQA to realize more fine-grained quality perception, thereby extending existing IQA. Specifically, grounding-IQA comprises two subtasks: grounding-IQA-description (GIQA-DES) and visual question answering (GIQA-VQA). GIQA-DES involves detailed descriptions with precise locations (e.g., bounding boxes), while GIQA-VQA focuses on quality QA for local regions. To realize grounding-IQA, we construct a corresponding dataset, GIQA-160K, through our proposed automated annotation pipeline. Furthermore, we develop a well-designed benchmark, GIQA-Bench. The benchmark evaluates the grounding-IQA performance from three perspectives: description quality, VQA accuracy, and grounding precision. Experiments demonstrate that our proposed method facilitates the more fine-grained IQA application. Code:this https URL.

  We present the "Law of Vision Representation" in multimodal large language models (MLLMs). It reveals a strong correlation between the combination of cross-modal alignment, correspondence in vision representation, and MLLM performance. We quantify the two factors using the cross-modal Alignment and Correspondence score (AC score). Through extensive experiments involving thirteen different vision representation settings and evaluations across eight benchmarks, we find that the AC score is linearly correlated to model performance. By leveraging this relationship, we are able to identify and train the optimal vision representation only, which does not require finetuning the language model every time, resulting in a 99.7% reduction in computational cost.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce CEMTM, a context-enhanced multimodal topic model designed to infer coherent and interpretable topic structures from both short and long documents containing text and images. CEMTM builds on fine-tuned large vision language models (LVLMs) to obtain contextualized embeddings, and employs a distributional attention mechanism to weight token-level contributions to topic inference. A reconstruction objective aligns topic-based representations with the document embedding, encouraging semantic consistency across modalities. Unlike existing approaches, CEMTM can process multiple images per document without repeated encoding and maintains interpretability through explicit word-topic and document-topic distributions. Extensive experiments on six multimodal benchmarks show that CEMTM consistently outperforms unimodal and multimodal baselines, achieving a remarkable average LLM score of 2.61. Further analysis shows its effectiveness in downstream few-shot retrieval and its ability to capture visually grounded semantics in complex domains such as scientific articles.

  Multimodal in-context learning (ICL) has emerged as a key mechanism for harnessing the capabilities of large vision-language models (LVLMs). However, its effectiveness remains highly sensitive to the quality of input ICL sequences, particularly for tasks involving complex reasoning or open-ended generation. A major limitation is our limited understanding of how LVLMs actually exploit these sequences during inference. To bridge this gap, we systematically interpret multimodal ICL through the lens of task mapping, which reveals how local and global relationships within and among demonstrations guide model reasoning. Building on this insight, we present TACO, a lightweight transformer-based model equipped with task-aware attention that dynamically configures ICL sequences. By injecting task-mapping signals into the autoregressive decoding process, TACO creates a bidirectional synergy between sequence construction and task reasoning. Experiments on five LVLMs and nine datasets demonstrate that TACO consistently surpasses baselines across diverse ICL tasks. These results position task mapping as a novel and valuable perspective for interpreting and improving multimodal ICL.

  Vision Language Models exhibit impressive performance for various tasks, yet they often lack the sophisticated situational reasoning required for complex decision-making. This paper shows that VLMs can achieve surprisingly strong decision-making performance when visual scenes are replaced by textual descriptions, suggesting foundational reasoning can be effectively learned from language. Motivated by this insight, we propose Praxis-VLM, a reasoning VLM for vision-grounded decision-making. Praxis-VLM employs the GRPO algorithm on textual scenarios to instill robust reasoning capabilities, where models learn to evaluate actions and their consequences. These reasoning skills, acquired purely from text, successfully transfer to multimodal inference with visual inputs, significantly reducing reliance on scarce paired image-text training data. Experiments across diverse decision-making benchmarks demonstrate that Praxis-VLM substantially outperforms standard supervised fine-tuning, exhibiting superior performance and generalizability. Further analysis confirms that our models engage in explicit and effective reasoning, underpinning their enhanced performance and adaptability.

  Recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have driven researchers to explore how well these models read data visualizations, e.g., bar charts, scatter plots. More recently, attention has shifted to visual question answering with maps (Map-VQA). However, Map-VQA research has primarily focused on choropleth maps, which cover only a limited range of thematic categories and visual analytical tasks. To address these gaps, we introduce MapIQ, a benchmark dataset comprising 14,706 question-answer pairs across three map types: choropleth maps, cartograms, and proportional symbol maps spanning topics from six distinct themes (e.g., housing, crime). We evaluate multiple MLLMs using six visual analytical tasks, comparing their performance against one another and a human baseline. An additional experiment examining the impact of map design changes (e.g., altered color schemes, modified legend designs, and removal of map elements) provides insights into the robustness and sensitivity of MLLMs, their reliance on internal geographic knowledge, and potential avenues for improving Map-VQA performance.

  Time series reasoning is crucial to decision-making in diverse domains, including finance, energy usage, traffic, weather, and scientific discovery. While existing time series foundation models (TSFMs) can capture low-level dynamic patterns and provide accurate forecasting, further analysis usually requires additional background knowledge and sophisticated reasoning, which are lacking in most TSFMs but can be achieved through large language models (LLMs). On the other hand, without expensive post-training, LLMs often struggle with the numerical understanding of time series data. Although it is intuitive to integrate the two types of models, developing effective training recipes that align the two modalities for reasoning tasks is still an open challenge. To this end, we propose TS-Reasoner that aligns the latent representations of TSFMs with the textual inputs of LLMs for downstream understanding/reasoning tasks. Specifically, we propose a simple yet effective method to curate diverse, synthetic pairs of time series and textual captions for alignment training. We then develop a two-stage training recipe that applies instruction finetuning after the alignment pretraining. Unlike existing works that train an LLM to take time series as inputs, we leverage a pretrained TSFM and freeze it during training. Extensive experiments on several benchmarks demonstrate that TS-Reasoner not only outperforms a wide range of prevailing LLMs, Vision Language Models (VLMs), and Time Series LLMs, but also achieves this with remarkable data efficiency, e.g., using less than half the training data.

  Despite rapid advances in multimodal large language models, agricultural applications remain constrained by the scarcity of domain-tailored models, curated vision-language corpora, and rigorous evaluation. To address these challenges, we present the AgriGPT-VL Suite, a unified multimodal framework for agriculture. Our contributions are threefold. First, we introduce Agri-3M-VL, the largest vision-language corpus for agriculture to our knowledge, curated by a scalable multi-agent data generator; it comprises 1M image-caption pairs, 2M image-grounded VQA pairs, 50K expert-level VQA instances, and 15K GRPO reinforcement learning samples. Second, we develop AgriGPT-VL, an agriculture-specialized vision-language model trained via a progressive curriculum of textual grounding, multimodal shallow/deep alignment, and GRPO refinement. This method achieves strong multimodal reasoning while preserving text-only capability. Third, we establish AgriBench-VL-4K, a compact yet challenging evaluation suite with open-ended and image-grounded questions, paired with multi-metric evaluation and an LLM-as-a-judge framework. Experiments show that AgriGPT-VL outperforms leading general-purpose VLMs on AgriBench-VL-4K, achieving higher pairwise win rates in the LLM-as-a-judge evaluation. Meanwhile, it remains competitive on the text-only AgriBench-13K with no noticeable degradation of language ability. Ablation studies further confirm consistent gains from our alignment and GRPO refinement stages. We will open source all of the resources to support reproducible research and deployment in low-resource agricultural settings.

  Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown promising capabilities in reasoning tasks, yet still struggle with complex problems requiring explicit self-reflection and self-correction, especially compared to their unimodal text-based counterparts. Existing reflection methods are simplistic and struggle to generate meaningful and instructive feedback, as the reasoning ability and knowledge limits of pre-trained models are largely fixed during initial training. To overcome these challenges, we propose Multimodal Self-Reflection enhanced reasoning with Group Relative Policy Optimization (SRPO), a two-stage reflection-aware reinforcement learning (RL) framework explicitly designed to enhance multimodal LLM reasoning. In the first stage, we construct a high-quality, reflection-focused dataset under the guidance of an advanced MLLM, which generates reflections based on initial responses to help the policy model learn both reasoning and self-reflection. In the second stage, we introduce a novel reward mechanism within the GRPO framework that encourages concise and cognitively meaningful reflection while avoiding redundancy. Extensive experiments across multiple multimodal reasoning benchmarks, including MathVista, MathVision, MathVerse, and MMMU-Pro, using Qwen-2.5-VL-7B and Qwen-2.5-VL-32B demonstrate that SRPO significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models, achieving notable improvements in both reasoning accuracy and reflection quality.

  The rapid development of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLM) has led to a wide range of MLLM applications, and a number of benchmark datasets have sprung up in order to assess MLLM abilities. However, full-coverage Q&A testing on large-scale data is resource-intensive and time-consuming. To address this issue, we propose the MLLM Interview (MITV) strategy, which aims to quickly obtain MLLM performance metrics by quizzing fewer question. First, First, we constructed the interview dataset, which was built on an existing MLLM assessment dataset, by adding difficulty labels based on the performance of some typical MLLMs in this dataset. Second, we propose an MLLM Interview strategy, which obtains an initial performance situation of the large model by quizzing a small number of topics and then continuously tries to test the model's limits. Through extensive experiments, the result shows that the MITV strategy proposed in this paper performs well on MLLM benchmark datasets, and it is able to obtain the model evaluation capability faster through a small number of questions and answers.

  There is a growing interest in Universal Multimodal Embeddings (UME), where models are required to generate task-specific representations. While recent studies show that Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) perform well on such tasks, they treat MLLMs solely as encoders, overlooking their generative capacity. However, such an encoding paradigm becomes less effective as instructions become more complex and require compositional reasoning. Inspired by the proven effectiveness of chain-of-thought reasoning, we propose a general Think-Then-Embed (TTE) framework for UME, composed of a reasoner and an embedder. The reasoner MLLM first generates reasoning traces that explain complex queries, followed by an embedder that produces representations conditioned on both the original query and the intermediate reasoning. This explicit reasoning step enables more nuanced understanding of complex multimodal instructions. Our contributions are threefold. First, by leveraging a powerful MLLM reasoner, we achieve state-of-the-art performance on the MMEB-V2 benchmark, surpassing proprietary models trained on massive in-house datasets. Second, to reduce the dependency on large MLLM reasoners, we finetune a smaller MLLM reasoner using high-quality embedding-centric reasoning traces, achieving the best performance among open-source models with a 7% absolute gain over recently proposed models. Third, we investigate strategies for integrating the reasoner and embedder into a unified model for improved efficiency without sacrificing performance.

  Vision-Language Model (VLM) driving agents promise explainable end-to-end autonomy by first producing natural-language reasoning and then predicting trajectory planning. However, whether planning is causally driven by this reasoning remains a critical but unverified assumption. To investigate this, we build DriveMind, a large-scale driving Visual Question Answering (VQA) corpus with plan-aligned Chain-of-Thought (CoT), automatically generated from nuPlan. Our data generation process converts sensors and annotations into structured inputs and, crucially, separates priors from to-be-reasoned signals, enabling clean information ablations. Using DriveMind, we train representative VLM agents with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and evaluate them with nuPlan's metrics. Our results, unfortunately, indicate a consistent causal disconnect in reasoning-planning: removing ego/navigation priors causes large drops in planning scores, whereas removing CoT produces only minor changes. Attention analysis further shows that planning primarily focuses on priors rather than the CoT. Based on this evidence, we propose the Reasoning-Planning Decoupling Hypothesis, positing that the training-yielded reasoning is an ancillary byproduct rather than a causal mediator. To enable efficient diagnosis, we also introduce a novel, training-free probe that measures an agent's reliance on priors by evaluating its planning robustness against minor input perturbations. In summary, we provide the community with a new dataset and a diagnostic tool to evaluate the causal fidelity of future models.

  Recent advances demonstrate that multimodal large language models (MLLMs) exhibit strong multimodal in-context learning (ICL) capabilities, enabling them to adapt to novel vision-language tasks from a few contextual examples. However, existing ICL approaches face challenges in reconciling scalability with robustness across diverse tasks and noisy contextual examples: manually selecting examples produces clean contexts but is labor-intensive and task-specific, while similarity-based retrieval improves scalability but could introduce irrelevant or structurally inconsistent samples that degrade ICL performance. To address these limitations, we propose ContextNav, the first agentic framework that integrates the scalability of automated retrieval with the quality and adaptiveness of human-like curation, enabling noise-robust and dynamically optimized contextualization for multimodal ICL. ContextNav unifies context management and noise-robust contextualization within a closed-loop workflow driven by graph-based orchestration. Specifically, it builds a resource-aware multimodal embedding pipeline, maintains a retrievable vector database, and applies agentic retrieval and structural alignment to construct noise-resilient contexts. An Operational Grammar Graph (OGG) further supports adaptive workflow planning and optimization, enabling the agent to refine its operational strategies based on downstream ICL feedback. Experimental results demonstrate that ContextNav achieves state-of-the-art performance across various datasets, underscoring the promise of agentic workflows for advancing scalable and robust contextualization in multimodal ICL.

  Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) hold promise for integrating diverse data modalities, but current medical adaptations such as LLaVA-Med often fail to fully exploit the synergy between color fundus photography (CFP) and optical coherence tomography (OCT), and offer limited interpretability of quantitative biomarkers. We introduce GROK, a grounded multimodal large language model that jointly processes CFP, OCT, and text to deliver clinician-grade diagnoses of ocular and systemic disease. GROK comprises three core modules: Knowledge-Guided Instruction Generation, CLIP-Style OCT-Biomarker Alignment, and Supervised Instruction Fine-Tuning, which together establish a quantitative-to-qualitative diagnostic chain of thought, mirroring real clinical reasoning when producing detailed lesion annotations. To evaluate our approach, we introduce the Grounded Ophthalmic Understanding benchmark, which covers six disease categories and three tasks: macro-level diagnostic classification, report generation quality, and fine-grained clinical assessment of the generated chain of thought. Experiments show that, with only LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) fine-tuning of a 7B-parameter Qwen2 backbone, GROK outperforms comparable 7B and 32B baselines on both report quality and fine-grained clinical metrics, and even exceeds OpenAI o3. Code and data are publicly available in the GROK repository.

  This survey paper chronicles the evolution of evaluation in multimodal artificial intelligence (AI), framing it as a progression of increasingly sophisticated "cognitive examinations." We argue that the field is undergoing a paradigm shift, moving from simple recognition tasks that test "what" a model sees, to complex reasoning benchmarks that probe "why" and "how" it understands. This evolution is driven by the saturation of older benchmarks, where high performance often masks fundamental weaknesses. We chart the journey from the foundational "knowledge tests" of the ImageNet era to the "applied logic and comprehension" exams such as GQA and Visual Commonsense Reasoning (VCR), which were designed specifically to diagnose systemic flaws such as shortcut learning and failures in compositional generalization. We then survey the current frontier of "expert-level integration" benchmarks (e.g., MMBench, SEED-Bench, MMMU) designed for today's powerful multimodal large language models (MLLMs), which increasingly evaluate the reasoning process itself. Finally, we explore the uncharted territories of evaluating abstract, creative, and social intelligence. We conclude that the narrative of AI evaluation is not merely a history of datasets, but a continuous, adversarial process of designing better examinations that, in turn, redefine our goals for creating truly intelligent systems.

  Automating the conversion of UI images into web code is a critical task for front-end development and rapid prototyping. Advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made WebUI-to-Code increasingly feasible, yet existing benchmarks remain limited in data diversity and evaluation reliability. To address these issues, we present WebRenderBench, a large-scale benchmark of 22.5k webpages collected from real-world portal sites, offering greater diversity, complexity, and realism than prior benchmarks. We further propose a novel evaluation metric that measures layout and style consistency from the final rendered pages. Unlike vision-based methods that rely on costly LLM reasoning or structure-based comparisons vulnerable to noise and asymmetry, our approach enables more efficient, objective, and reliable UI quality assessment. Finally, we introduce the Automated Layout and Style Inspection Agent (ALISA), which integrates this metric into reinforcement learning as a reward signal to enhance training on crawled asymmetric webpages. Experiments show that ALISA significantly boosts generation performance, achieving state-of-the-art results across multiple metrics.

  Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) strive to achieve a profound, human-like understanding of and interaction with the physical world, but often exhibit a shallow and incoherent integration when acquiring information (Perception) and conducting reasoning (Cognition). This disconnect leads to a spectrum of reasoning failures, with hallucination being the most prominent. Collectively, these issues expose a fundamental challenge: the ability to process pixels does not yet confer the ability to construct a coherent, credible internal world model. To systematically dissect and address this challenge, this survey introduces a novel and unified analytical framework: ``From Perception to Cognition." We deconstruct the complex process of vision-language interactive understanding into two interdependent layers: Perception, the foundational ability to accurately extract visual information and achieve fine-grained alignment with textual instructions; and Cognition, the higher-order capability for proactive, multi-step, goal-oriented reasoning built upon this perceptual foundation, the core of which is the formation of a dynamic observe-think-verify reasoning loop. Guided by this framework, this paper systematically analyzes the key bottlenecks of current MLLMs at both layers. It surveys the landscape of cutting-edge methods designed to address these challenges, spanning from techniques that enhance low-level visual representations to those that improve high-level reasoning paradigms. Furthermore, we review critical benchmarks and delineate future research directions. This survey aims to provide the research community with a clear, structured perspective for understanding the intrinsic limitations of current MLLMs and to illuminate the path toward building next-generation models capable of deep reasoning and a genuine understanding of the world.
