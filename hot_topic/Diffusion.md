- **[StaMo: Unsupervised Learning of Generalizable Robot Motion from Compact State Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05057)**  `arXiv:2510.05057`  `cs.RO` `cs.CV`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  A fundamental challenge in embodied intelligence is developing expressive and compact state representations for efficient world modeling and decision making. However, existing methods often fail to achieve this balance, yielding representations that are either overly redundant or lacking in task-critical information. We propose an unsupervised approach that learns a highly compressed two-token state representation using a lightweight encoder and a pre-trained Diffusion Transformer (DiT) decoder, capitalizing on its strong generative prior. Our representation is efficient, interpretable, and integrates seamlessly into existing VLA-based models, improving performance by 14.3% on LIBERO and 30% in real-world task success with minimal inference overhead. More importantly, we find that the difference between these tokens, obtained via latent interpolation, naturally serves as a highly effective latent action, which can be further decoded into executable robot actions. This emergent capability reveals that our representation captures structured dynamics without explicit supervision. We name our method StaMo for its ability to learn generalizable robotic Motion from compact State representation, which is encoded from static images, challenging the prevalent dependence to learning latent action on complex architectures and video data. The resulting latent actions also enhance policy co-training, outperforming prior methods by 10.4% with improved interpretability. Moreover, our approach scales effectively across diverse data sources, including real-world robot data, simulation, and human egocentric video.

- **[Flexible Locomotion Learning with Diffusion Model Predictive Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04234)**  `arXiv:2510.04234`  `cs.RO` `cs.AI`

  Legged locomotion demands controllers that are both robust and adaptable, while remaining compatible with task and safety considerations. However, model-free reinforcement learning (RL) methods often yield a fixed policy that can be difficult to adapt to new behaviors at test time. In contrast, Model Predictive Control (MPC) provides a natural approach to flexible behavior synthesis by incorporating different objectives and constraints directly into its optimization process. However, classical MPC relies on accurate dynamics models, which are often difficult to obtain in complex environments and typically require simplifying assumptions. We present Diffusion-MPC, which leverages a learned generative diffusion model as an approximate dynamics prior for planning, enabling flexible test-time adaptation through reward and constraint based optimization. Diffusion-MPC jointly predicts future states and actions; at each reverse step, we incorporate reward planning and impose constraint projection, yielding trajectories that satisfy task objectives while remaining within physical limits. To obtain a planning model that adapts beyond imitation pretraining, we introduce an interactive training algorithm for diffusion based planner: we execute our reward-and-constraint planner in environment, then filter and reweight the collected trajectories by their realized returns before updating the denoiser. Our design enables strong test-time adaptability, allowing the planner to adjust to new reward specifications without retraining. We validate Diffusion-MPC on real world, demonstrating strong locomotion and flexible adaptation.

- **[SafeFlowMatcher: Safe and Fast Planning using Flow Matching with Control Barrier Functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24243)**  `arXiv:2509.24243`  `cs.RO` `cs.AI`  
  _Jeongyong Yang, Seunghwan Jang, SooJean Han_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Generative planners based on flow matching (FM) can produce high-quality paths in one or a few ODE steps, but their sampling dynamics offer no formal safety guarantees and can yield incomplete paths near constraints. We present SafeFlowMatcher, a planning framework that couples FM with control barrier functions (CBFs) to achieve both real-time efficiency and certified safety. SafeFlowMatcher uses a two-phase prediction-correction (PC) integrator: (i) a prediction phase integrates the learned FM once (or a few steps) to obtain a candidate path without intervention; (ii) a correction phase refines this path with a vanishing time-scaled vector field and a CBF-based quadratic program that minimally perturbs the vector field. We prove a barrier certificate for the resulting flow system, establishing forward invariance of a robust safe set and finite-time convergence to the safe set. By enforcing safety only on the executed path (rather than on all intermediate latent paths), SafeFlowMatcher avoids distributional drift and mitigates local trap problems. Across maze navigation and locomotion benchmarks, SafeFlowMatcher attains faster, smoother, and safer paths than diffusion- and FM-based baselines. Extensive ablations corroborate the contributions of the PC integrator and the barrier certificate.

- **[A Knowledge-Driven Diffusion Policy for End-to-End Autonomous Driving Based on Expert Routing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04853)**  `arXiv:2509.04853`  `cs.RO` `cs.AI`  
  _Chengkai Xu, Jiaqi Liu, Yicheng Guo, Peng Hang, Jian Sun_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  End-to-end autonomous driving remains constrained by the difficulty of producing adaptive, robust, and interpretable decision-making across diverse scenarios. Existing methods often collapse diverse driving behaviors, lack long-horizon consistency, or require task-specific engineering that limits generalization. This paper presents KDP, a knowledge-driven diffusion policy that integrates generative diffusion modeling with a sparse mixture-of-experts routing mechanism. The diffusion component generates temporally coherent action sequences, while the expert routing mechanism activates specialized and reusable experts according to context, enabling modular knowledge composition. Extensive experiments across representative driving scenarios demonstrate that KDP achieves consistently higher success rates, reduced collision risk, and smoother control compared to prevailing paradigms. Ablation studies highlight the effectiveness of sparse expert activation and the Transformer backbone, and activation analyses reveal structured specialization and cross-scenario reuse of experts. These results establish diffusion with expert routing as a scalable and interpretable paradigm for knowledge-driven end-to-end autonomous driving.

- **[Learning Geometry-Aware Nonprehensile Pushing and Pulling with Dexterous Hands](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18455)**  `arXiv:2509.18455`  `cs.RO`  
  _Yunshuang Li, Yiyang Ling, Gaurav S. Sukhatme, Daniel Seita_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Nonprehensile manipulation, such as pushing and pulling, enables robots to move, align, or reposition objects that may be difficult to grasp due to their geometry, size, or relationship to the robot or the environment. Much of the existing work in nonprehensile manipulation relies on parallel-jaw grippers or tools such as rods and spatulas. In contrast, multi-fingered dexterous hands offer richer contact modes and versatility for handling diverse objects to provide stable support over the objects, which compensates for the difficulty of modeling the dynamics of nonprehensile manipulation. Therefore, we propose Geometry-aware Dexterous Pushing and Pulling (GD2P) for nonprehensile manipulation with dexterous robotic hands. We study pushing and pulling by framing the problem as synthesizing and learning pre-contact dexterous hand poses that lead to effective manipulation. We generate diverse hand poses via contact-guided sampling, filter them using physics simulation, and train a diffusion model conditioned on object geometry to predict viable poses. At test time, we sample hand poses and use standard motion planners to select and execute pushing and pulling actions. We perform 840 real-world experiments with an Allegro Hand, comparing our method to baselines. The results indicate that GD2P offers a scalable route for training dexterous nonprehensile manipulation policies. We further demonstrate GD2P on a LEAP Hand, highlighting its applicability to different hand morphologies. Our pre-trained models and dataset, including 1.3 million hand poses across 2.3k objects, will be open-source to facilitate further research. Our project website is available at:this http URL.

- **[Viewpoint-Agnostic Manipulation Policies with Strategic Vantage Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12261)**  `arXiv:2506.12261`  `cs.RO`  
  _Sreevishakh Vasudevan, Som Sagar, Ransalu Senanayake_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Since vision-based manipulation policies are typically trained from data gathered from a single viewpoint, their performance drops when the view changes during deployment. Naively aggregating demonstrations from numerous random views is not only costly but also known to destabilize learning, as excessive visual diversity acts as noise. We present Vantage, a viewpoint selection framework to fine-tune any pre-trained policy on a small, strategically set of camera poses to induce viewpoint-agnostic behavior. Instead of relying on costly brute-force search over viewpoints, Vantage formulates camera placement as an information gain optimization problem in a continuous space. This approach balances exploration of novel poses with exploitation of promising ones, while also providing theoretical guarantees about convergence and robustness. Across manipulation tasks and policy families, Vantage consistently improves success under viewpoint shifts compared to fixed, grid, or random data selection strategies with only a handful of fine-tuning steps. Experiments conducted on simulated and real-world setups show that Vantage increases the task success rate by 25% for diffusion policies, and yields robust gains in dynamic-camera settings.

- **[Revoking Amnesia: RL-based Trajectory Optimization to Resurrect Erased Concepts in Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03302)**  `arXiv:2510.03302`  `cs.LG` `cs.CV`  
  _Daiheng Gao, Nanxiang Jiang, Andi Zhang, Shilin Lu, Yufei Tang, Wenbo Zhou, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Concept erasure techniques have been widely deployed in T2I diffusion models to prevent inappropriate content generation for safety and copyright considerations. However, as models evolve to next-generation architectures like Flux, established erasure methods (\textit{e.g.}, ESD, UCE, AC) exhibit degraded effectiveness, raising questions about their true mechanisms. Through systematic analysis, we reveal that concept erasure creates only an illusion of ``amnesia": rather than genuine forgetting, these methods bias sampling trajectories away from target concepts, making the erasure fundamentally reversible. This insight motivates the need to distinguish superficial safety from genuine concept removal. In this work, we propose \textbf{RevAm} (\underline{Rev}oking \underline{Am}nesia), an RL-based trajectory optimization framework that resurrects erased concepts by dynamically steering the denoising process without modifying model weights. By adapting Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to diffusion models, RevAm explores diverse recovery trajectories through trajectory-level rewards, overcoming local optima that limit existing methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RevAm achieves superior concept resurrection fidelity while reducing computational time by 10$\times$, exposing critical vulnerabilities in current safety mechanisms and underscoring the need for more robust erasure techniques beyond trajectory manipulation.

- **[How to build a consistency model: Learning flow maps via self-distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18825)**  `arXiv:2505.18825`  `cs.LG` `cs.CV`  
  _Nicholas M. Boffi, Michael S. Albergo, Eric Vanden-Eijnden_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Flow-based generative models achieve state-of-the-art sample quality, but require the expensive solution of a differential equation at inference time. Flow map models, commonly known as consistency models, encompass many recent efforts to improve inference-time efficiency by learning the solution operator of this differential equation. Yet despite their promise, these models lack a unified description that clearly explains how to learn them efficiently in practice. Here, building on the methodology proposed in Boffi et. al. (2024), we present a systematic algorithmic framework for directly learning the flow map associated with a flow or diffusion model. By exploiting a relationship between the velocity field underlying a continuous-time flow and the instantaneous rate of change of the flow map, we show how to convert any distillation scheme into a direct training algorithm via self-distillation, eliminating the need for pre-trained teachers. We introduce three algorithmic families based on different mathematical characterizations of the flow map: Eulerian, Lagrangian, and Progressive methods, which we show encompass and extend all known distillation and direct training schemes for consistency models. We find that the novel class of Lagrangian methods, which avoid both spatial derivatives and bootstrapping from small steps by design, achieve significantly more stable training and higher performance than more standard Eulerian and Progressive schemes. Our methodology unifies existing training schemes under a single common framework and reveals new design principles for accelerated generative modeling. Associated code is available atthis https URL.

- **[Universal Multi-Domain Translation via Diffusion Routers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03252)**  `arXiv:2510.03252`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI` `cs.CV`  
  _Duc Kieu, Kien Do, Tuan Hoang, Thao Minh Le, Tung Kieu, Dang Nguyen, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multi-domain translation (MDT) aims to learn translations between multiple domains, yet existing approaches either require fully aligned tuples or can only handle domain pairs seen in training, limiting their practicality and excluding many cross-domain mappings. We introduce universal MDT (UMDT), a generalization of MDT that seeks to translate between any pair of $K$ domains using only $K-1$ paired datasets with a central domain. To tackle this problem, we propose Diffusion Router (DR), a unified diffusion-based framework that models all central$\leftrightarrow$non-central translations with a single noise predictor conditioned on the source and target domain labels. DR enables indirect non-central translations by routing through the central domain. We further introduce a novel scalable learning strategy with a variational-bound objective and an efficient Tweedie refinement procedure to support direct non-central mappings. Through evaluation on three large-scale UMDT benchmarks, DR achieves state-of-the-art results for both indirect and direct translations, while lowering sampling cost and unlocking novel tasks such as sketch$\leftrightarrow$segmentation. These results establish DR as a scalable and versatile framework for universal translation across multiple domains.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate their reasoning ability through chain-of-thought (CoT) generation. However, LLM's autoregressive decoding may limit the ability to revisit and refine earlier tokens in a holistic manner, which can also lead to inefficient exploration for diverse solutions. In this paper, we propose LaDiR (Latent Diffusion Reasoner), a novel reasoning framework that unifies the expressiveness of continuous latent representation with the iterative refinement capabilities of latent diffusion models for an existing LLM. We first construct a structured latent reasoning space using a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) that encodes text reasoning steps into blocks of thought tokens, preserving semantic information and interpretability while offering compact but expressive representations. Subsequently, we utilize a latent diffusion model that learns to denoise a block of latent thought tokens with a blockwise bidirectional attention mask, enabling longer horizon and iterative refinement with adaptive test-time compute. This design allows efficient parallel generation of diverse reasoning trajectories, allowing the model to plan and revise the reasoning process holistically. We conduct evaluations on a suite of mathematical reasoning and planning benchmarks. Empirical results show that LaDiR consistently improves accuracy, diversity, and interpretability over existing autoregressive, diffusion-based, and latent reasoning methods, revealing a new paradigm for text reasoning with latent diffusion.

- **[Beyond Next-Token Prediction: A Performance Characterization of Diffusion versus Autoregressive Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04146)**  `arXiv:2510.04146`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI` `cs.CL`

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance on a broad range of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, including document processing and coding. Autoregressive Language Models (ARMs), which generate tokens sequentially conditioned on all previous tokens, have been the predominant paradigm for LLMs. However, while these networks have achieved high accuracy across a range of downstream tasks, they exhibit low arithmetic intensity due to the inherent sequential dependency with next-token prediction. Recently, Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) have emerged as a promising alternative architecture. DLMs generate output text in parallel, breaking the limitations of sequential dependency. However, the performance implications of DLMs relative to commonly deployed ARMs are not fully understood. In this work, we present a comprehensive performance study analyzing the performance characteristics of ARMs and DLMs, using both theoretical analysis and profiling data to characterize the trade-offs between these approaches. We illustrate that although DLMs exhibit higher arithmetic intensity compared to ARMs because of their capability to utilize parallelism across sequence lengths, they fail to scale effectively to longer contexts. We then explore DLMs with block-wise decoding, outlining how this approach allows for increased arithmetic intensity, while still scaling well to long contexts (similar to ARMs). We also show interesting trade-offs for batched inference, where we find that ARMs exhibit superior throughput, as they benefit more from parallelism across sequences in the batch. Finally, we highlight opportunities for accelerating DLM inference, and, in particular, highlight the importance of reducing the number of sampling steps for allowing open-source DLMs to provide improved latency relative to ARMs.

- **[Principled and Tractable RL for Reasoning with Diffusion Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04019)**  `arXiv:2510.04019`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI` `cs.CL`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) are a new paradigm of non-autoregressive language models that are trained to predict multiple tokens in parallel and generate text via iterative unmasking. Recent works have successfully pretrained dLLMs to parity with autoregressive LLMs at the 8B scale, but dLLMs have yet to benefit from modern post-training techniques, e.g. reinforcement learning (RL), that have proven effective for autoregressive models. Crucially, algorithms designed for traditional LLMs aren't directly compatible with diffusion frameworks due to inherent differences in modeling assumptions. Moreover, existing attempts at dLLM post-training with RL rely on heuristic-based objectives with no theoretical grounding. In this work, we present Amortized Group Relative Policy Optimization (AGRPO), a principled on-policy RL algorithm designed specifically for dLLMs. AGRPO uses Monte Carlo sampling to compute an unbiased policy gradient estimate, making it the first tractable, faithful adaptation of policy gradient methods for dLLMs. We demonstrate AGRPO's effectiveness on different math/reasoning tasks, a common setting for RL with LLMs, achieving up to +7.6% absolute gain on GSM8K and 3.8x performance on the Countdown task over the baseline LLaDA-8B-Instruct model and 1.3x performance gains over comparable RL methods such as diffu-GRPO. Furthermore, these gains persist across different numbers of sampling steps at inference time, achieving better tradeoffs between compute and performance. Our results demonstrate that online RL algorithms can be extended to diffusion LLMs in principled ways, maintaining both theoretical soundness and practical effectiveness.

- **[Why mask diffusion does not work](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03289)**  `arXiv:2510.03289`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI` `cs.CL`  
  _Haocheng Sun, Cynthia Xin Wen, Edward Hong Wang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The main advantages of diffusion language models over autoregressive (AR) models lie in their ability to support parallel generation and bidirectional attention, enabling a more controllable generation process. In recent years, open-source mask diffusion language models have emerged, most of which are based on a variant known as absorbing diffusion. However, this paper demonstrates why mask diffusion faces inherent difficulties in achieving parallel generation and bidirectional attention. We also propose the most effective training and inference strategies for mask diffusion.

  We introduce Quokka, the first systematic scaling law for diffusion language models (DLMs), encompassing both compute-constrained and data-constrained regimes, and studying the key modeling and optimization designs. Quokka is a good friend of Chinchilla and provides wider scopes. We hope the results would bring short-term practical guidance in DLMs training and long-term inspirations for the whole AI community.

  Diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs) are trained flexibly to model extreme dependence in the data distribution; however, how to best utilize this information at inference time remains an open problem. In this work, we uncover an interesting property of these models: dLLMs trained on textual data implicitly learn a mixture of semi-autoregressive experts, where different generation orders reveal different specialized behaviors. We show that committing to any single, fixed inference time schedule, a common practice, collapses performance by failing to leverage this latent ensemble. To address this, we introduce HEX (Hidden semiautoregressive EXperts for test-time scaling), a training-free inference method that ensembles across heterogeneous block schedules. By doing a majority vote over diverse block-sized generation paths, HEX robustly avoids failure modes associated with any single fixed schedule. On reasoning benchmarks such as GSM8K, it boosts accuracy by up to 3.56X (from 24.72% to 88.10%), outperforming top-K margin inference and specialized fine-tuned methods like GRPO, without additional training. HEX even yields significant gains on MATH benchmark from 16.40% to 40.00%, scientific reasoning on ARC-C from 54.18% to 87.80%, and TruthfulQA from 28.36% to 57.46%. Our results establish a new paradigm for test-time scaling in diffusion-based LLMs (dLLMs), revealing that the sequence in which masking is performed plays a critical role in determining performance during inference.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We study the problem of generating graph signals from unknown distributions defined over given graphs, relevant to domains such as recommender systems or sensor networks. Our approach builds on generative diffusion models, which are well established in vision and graph generation but remain underexplored for graph signals. Existing methods lack generality, either ignoring the graph structure in the forward process or designing graph-aware mechanisms tailored to specific domains. We adopt a forward process that incorporates the graph through the heat equation. Rather than relying on the standard formulation, we consider a time-warped coefficient to mitigate the exponential decay of the drift term, yielding a graph-aware generative diffusion model (GAD). We analyze its forward dynamics, proving convergence to a Gaussian Markov random field with covariance parametrized by the graph Laplacian, and interpret the backward dynamics as a sequence of graph-signal denoising problems. Finally, we demonstrate the advantages of GAD on synthetic data, real traffic speed measurements, and a temperature sensor network.

- **[Alignment Tipping Process: How Self-Evolution Pushes LLM Agents Off the Rails](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04860)**  `arXiv:2510.04860`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Siwei Han, Jiaqi Liu, Yaofeng Su, Wenbo Duan, Xinyuan Liu, Cihang Xie, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As Large Language Model (LLM) agents increasingly gain self-evolutionary capabilities to adapt and refine their strategies through real-world interaction, their long-term reliability becomes a critical concern. We identify the Alignment Tipping Process (ATP), a critical post-deployment risk unique to self-evolving LLM agents. Unlike training-time failures, ATP arises when continual interaction drives agents to abandon alignment constraints established during training in favor of reinforced, self-interested strategies. We formalize and analyze ATP through two complementary paradigms: Self-Interested Exploration, where repeated high-reward deviations induce individual behavioral drift, and Imitative Strategy Diffusion, where deviant behaviors spread across multi-agent systems. Building on these paradigms, we construct controllable testbeds and benchmark Qwen3-8B and Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct. Our experiments show that alignment benefits erode rapidly under self-evolution, with initially aligned models converging toward unaligned states. In multi-agent settings, successful violations diffuse quickly, leading to collective misalignment. Moreover, current reinforcement learning-based alignment methods provide only fragile defenses against alignment tipping. Together, these findings demonstrate that alignment of LLM agents is not a static property but a fragile and dynamic one, vulnerable to feedback-driven decay during deployment. Our data and code are available atthis https URL.

- **[Toward a Unified Geometry Understanding: Riemannian Diffusion Framework for Graph Generation and Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04522)**  `arXiv:2510.04522`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`

  Graph diffusion models have made significant progress in learning structured graph data and have demonstrated strong potential for predictive tasks. Existing approaches typically embed node, edge, and graph-level features into a unified latent space, modeling prediction tasks including classification and regression as a form of conditional generation. However, due to the non-Euclidean nature of graph data, features of different curvatures are entangled in the same latent space without releasing their geometric potential. To address this issue, we aim to construt an ideal Riemannian diffusion model to capture distinct manifold signatures of complex graph data and learn their distribution. This goal faces two challenges: numerical instability caused by exponential mapping during the encoding proces and manifold deviation during diffusion generation. To address these challenges, we propose GeoMancer: a novel Riemannian graph diffusion framework for both generation and prediction tasks. To mitigate numerical instability, we replace exponential mapping with an isometric-invariant Riemannian gyrokernel approach and decouple multi-level features onto their respective task-specific manifolds to learn optimal representations. To address manifold deviation, we introduce a manifold-constrained diffusion method and a self-guided strategy for unconditional generation, ensuring that the generated data remains aligned with the manifold signature. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating superior performance across a variety of tasks.

- **[Diffusion-Assisted Distillation for Self-Supervised Graph Representation Learning with MLPs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04241)**  `arXiv:2510.04241`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Seong Jin Ahn, Myoung-Ho Kim_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  For large-scale applications, there is growing interest in replacing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with lightweight Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) via knowledge distillation. However, distilling GNNs for self-supervised graph representation learning into MLPs is more challenging. This is because the performance of self-supervised learning is more related to the model's inductive bias than supervised learning. This motivates us to design a new distillation method to bridge a huge capacity gap between GNNs and MLPs in self-supervised graph representation learning. In this paper, we propose \textbf{D}iffusion-\textbf{A}ssisted \textbf{D}istillation for \textbf{S}elf-supervised \textbf{G}raph representation learning with \textbf{M}LPs (DAD-SGM). The proposed method employs a denoising diffusion model as a teacher assistant to better distill the knowledge from the teacher GNN into the student MLP. This approach enhances the generalizability and robustness of MLPs in self-supervised graph representation learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DAD-SGM effectively distills the knowledge of self-supervised GNNs compared to state-of-the-art GNN-to-MLP distillation methods. Our implementation is available atthis https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  High-quality observations of hub-height winds are valuable but sparse in space and time. Simulations are widely available on regular grids but are generally biased and too coarse to inform wind-farm siting or to assess extreme-weather-related risks (e.g., gusts) at infrastructure scales. To fully utilize both data types for generating high-quality, high-resolution hub-height wind speeds (tens to ~100m above ground), this study introduces WindSR, a diffusion model with data assimilation for super-resolution downscaling of hub-height winds. WindSR integrates sparse observational data with simulation fields during downscaling using state-of-the-art diffusion models. A dynamic-radius blending method is introduced to merge observations with simulations, providing conditioning for the diffusion process. Terrain information is incorporated during both training and inference to account for its role as a key driver of winds. Evaluated against convolutional-neural-network and generative-adversarial-network baselines, WindSR outperforms them in both downscaling efficiency and accuracy. Our data assimilation reduces WindSR's model bias by approximately 20% relative to independent observations.

- **[Quant-dLLM: Post-Training Extreme Low-Bit Quantization for Diffusion Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03274)**  `arXiv:2510.03274`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Diffusion large language models (dLLMs), which offer bidirectional context and flexible masked-denoising generation, are emerging as a compelling alternative to autoregressive (AR) LLMs. However, like AR LLMs, their model sizes continue to grow, motivating weight compression for deployment. Although post-training quantization (PTQ) is effective for AR LLMs, directly transferring it to dLLMs at 2-bit leads to unsatisfactory performance. To tackle these challenges, we propose Quant-dLLM, an ultra-low-bit PTQ framework tailored to dLLMs. Since masked-denoising activations in dLLMs differ from the fully visible signals assumed by standard PTQ methods, we introduce Masked Calibration Simulation (MCS) to align calibration with the timestep-dependent masking, which yields more reliable calibrations. Moreover, we propose a Data-aware Any-order Quantizer (DAQ) that learns ultra-low-bit weight representations via an optimization algorithm. It performs iterative approximation guided by our simulated calibration data. In addition, under a strict 2-bit budget, we introduce Adaptive Blockwise Mixed Precision (ABMP), a sensitivity-based precision allocation scheme that adaptively assigns bit width across channel groups.

  Diffusion language models promise bidirectional context and infilling capabilities that autoregressive coders lack, yet practical systems remain heavyweight. We introduce CoDA, a 1.7B-parameter diffusion coder trained on TPU with a fully open-source training pipeline. CoDA pairs large-scale diffusion pre-training with code-centric mid-training and instruction tuning, enabling confidence-guided sampling that keeps inference latency competitive. On Humaneval, MBPP, and EvalPlus, CoDA-1.7B-Instruct matches or surpasses diffusion models up to 7B parameters. Our release includes model checkpoints, evaluation harnesses, and TPU training pipelines to accelerate research on lightweight diffusion-based coding assistants.

  While most autoregressive LLMs are constrained to one-by-one decoding, diffusion LLMs (dLLMs) have attracted growing interest for their potential to dramatically accelerate inference through parallel decoding. Despite this promise, the conditional independence assumption in dLLMs causes parallel decoding to ignore token dependencies, inevitably degrading generation quality when these dependencies are strong. However, existing works largely overlook these inherent challenges, and evaluations on standard benchmarks (e.g., math and coding) are not sufficient to capture the quality degradation caused by parallel decoding. To address this gap, we first provide an information-theoretic analysis of parallel decoding. We then conduct case studies on analytically tractable synthetic list operations from both data distribution and decoding strategy perspectives, offering quantitative insights that highlight the fundamental limitations of parallel decoding. Building on these insights, we propose ParallelBench, the first benchmark specifically designed for dLLMs, featuring realistic tasks that are trivial for humans and autoregressive LLMs yet exceptionally challenging for dLLMs under parallel decoding. Using ParallelBench, we systematically analyze both dLLMs and autoregressive LLMs, revealing that: (i) dLLMs under parallel decoding can suffer dramatic quality degradation in real-world scenarios, and (ii) current parallel decoding strategies struggle to adapt their degree of parallelism based on task difficulty, thus failing to achieve meaningful speedup without compromising quality. Our findings underscore the pressing need for innovative decoding methods that can overcome the current speed-quality trade-off. We release our benchmark to help accelerate the development of truly efficient dLLMs.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Probabilistic regression models the entire predictive distribution of a response variable, offering richer insights than classical point estimates and directly allowing for uncertainty quantification. While diffusion-based generative models have shown remarkable success in generating complex, high-dimensional data, their usage in general regression tasks often lacks uncertainty-related evaluation and remains limited to domain-specific applications. We propose a novel diffusion-based framework for probabilistic regression that learns predictive distributions in a nonparametric way. More specifically, we propose to model the full distribution of the diffusion noise, enabling adaptation to diverse tasks and enhanced uncertainty quantification. We investigate different noise parameterizations, analyze their trade-offs, and evaluate our framework across a broad range of regression tasks, covering low- and high-dimensional settings. For several experiments, our approach shows superior performance against existing baselines, while delivering calibrated uncertainty estimates, demonstrating its versatility as a tool for probabilistic prediction.

  In this work, we introduce novel algorithms for label propagation and self-training using fractional heat kernel dynamics with a source term. We motivate the methodology through the classical correspondence of information theory with the physics of parabolic evolution equations. We integrate the fractional heat kernel into Graph Neural Network architectures such as Graph Convolutional Networks and Graph Attention, enhancing their expressiveness through adaptive, multi-hop diffusion. By applying Chebyshev polynomial approximations, large graphs become computationally feasible. Motivating variational formulations demonstrate that by extending the classical diffusion model to fractional powers of the Laplacian, nonlocal interactions deliver more globally diffusing labels. The particular balance between supervision of known labels and diffusion across the graph is particularly advantageous in the case where only a small number of labeled training examples are present. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on standard datasets.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  For a responsible and safe deployment of diffusion models in various domains, regulating the generated outputs from these models is desirable because such models could generate undesired, violent, and obscene outputs. To tackle this problem, recent works use machine unlearning methodology to forget training data points containing these undesired features from pre-trained generative models. However, these methods proved to be ineffective in data-constrained settings where the whole training dataset is inaccessible. Thus, the principal objective of this work is to propose a machine unlearning methodology that can prevent the generation of outputs containing undesired features from a pre-trained diffusion model in such a data-constrained setting. Our proposed method, termed as Variational Diffusion Unlearning (VDU), is a computationally efficient method that only requires access to a subset of training data containing undesired features. Our approach is inspired by the variational inference framework with the objective of minimizing a loss function consisting of two terms: plasticity inducer and stability regularizer. Plasticity inducer reduces the log-likelihood of the undesired training data points, while the stability regularizer, essential for preventing loss of image generation quality, regularizes the model in parameter space. We validate the effectiveness of our method through comprehensive experiments for both class unlearning and feature unlearning. For class unlearning, we unlearn some user-identified classes from MNIST, CIFAR-10, and tinyImageNet datasets from a pre-trained unconditional denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM). Similarly, for feature unlearning, we unlearn the generation of certain high-level features from a pre-trained Stable Diffusion model

  Spatio-temporal sensor data is often sparse, noisy, and irregular, and existing interpolation or learning methods struggle here because they either ignore governing PDEs or do not scale. We introduce FieldFormer, a transformer-based framework for mesh-free spatio-temporal field reconstruction that combines data-driven flexibility with physics-based structure. For each query, FieldFormer gathers a local neighborhood using a learnable velocity-scaled distance metric, enabling anisotropic adaptation to different propagation regimes. Neighborhoods are built efficiently via per-batch offset recomputation, and refined in an expectation-maximization style as the velocity scales evolve. Predictions are made by a local transformer encoder, and physics consistency is enforced through autograd-based PDE residuals and boundary-specific penalties. Across three benchmarks--a scalar anisotropic heat equation, a vector-valued shallow-water system, and a realistic advection-diffusion pollution simulation--FieldFormer consistently outperforms strong baselines by more than 40%. Our results demonstrate that FieldFormer enables accurate (RMSE$<10^{-2}$), efficient, and physically consistent field reconstruction from sparse (0.4%-2%) and noisy(10%) data.

  We introduce D2AC, a new model-free reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm designed to train expressive diffusion policies online effectively. At its core is a policy improvement objective that avoids the high variance of typical policy gradients and the complexity of backpropagation through time. This stable learning process is critically enabled by our second contribution: a robust distributional critic, which we design through a fusion of distributional RL and clipped double Q-learning. The resulting algorithm is highly effective, achieving state-of-the-art performance on a benchmark of eighteen hard RL tasks, including Humanoid, Dog, and Shadow Hand domains, spanning both dense-reward and goal-conditioned RL scenarios. Beyond standard benchmarks, we also evaluate a biologically motivated predator-prey task to examine the behavioral robustness and generalization capacity of our approach.

  Modeling radio frequency (RF) signal propagation is essential for understanding the environment, as RF signals offer valuable insights beyond the capabilities of RGB cameras, which are limited by the visible-light spectrum, lens coverage, and occlusions. It is also useful for supporting wireless diagnosis, deployment, and optimization. However, accurately predicting RF signals in complex environments remains a challenge due to interactions with obstacles such as absorption and reflection. We introduce Diffusion^2, a diffusion-based approach that uses 3D point clouds to model the propagation of RF signals across a wide range of frequencies, from Wi-Fi to millimeter waves. To effectively capture RF-related features from 3D data, we present the RF-3D Encoder, which encapsulates the complexities of 3D geometry along with signal-specific details. These features undergo multi-scale embedding to simulate the actual RF signal dissemination process. Our evaluation, based on synthetic and real-world measurements, demonstrates that Diffusion^2 accurately estimates the behavior of RF signals in various frequency bands and environmental conditions, with an error margin of just 1.9 dB and 27x faster than existing methods, marking a significant advancement in the field.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent methods for molecular generation face a trade-off: they either enforce strict equivariance with costly architectures or relax it to gain scalability and flexibility. We propose a frame-based diffusion paradigm that achieves deterministic E(3)-equivariance while decoupling symmetry handling from the backbone. Building on this paradigm, we investigate three variants: Global Frame Diffusion (GFD), which assigns a shared molecular frame; Local Frame Diffusion (LFD), which constructs node-specific frames and benefits from additional alignment constraints; and Invariant Frame Diffusion (IFD), which relies on pre-canonicalized invariant representations. To enhance expressivity, we further utilize EdgeDiT, a Diffusion Transformer with edge-aware attention.On the QM9 dataset, GFD with EdgeDiT achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a test NLL of -137.97 at standard scale and -141.85 at double scale, alongside atom stability of 98.98%, and molecular stability of 90.51%. These results surpass all equivariant baselines while maintaining high validity and uniqueness and nearly 2x faster sampling compared to EDM. Altogether, our study establishes frame-based diffusion as a scalable, flexible, and physically grounded paradigm for molecular generation, highlighting the critical role of global structure preservation.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Discrete diffusion models have recently emerged as strong alternatives to autoregressive language models, matching their performance through large-scale training. However, inference-time control remains relatively underexplored. In this work, we study how to steer generation toward desired rewards without retraining the models. Prior methods typically resample or filter within a single denoising trajectory, optimizing rewards step-by-step without trajectory-level refinement. We introduce particle Gibbs sampling for diffusion language models (PG-DLM), a novel inference-time algorithm enabling trajectory-level refinement while preserving generation perplexity under reward optimization. PG-DLM constructs a Markov chain over full denoising trajectories and applies a conditional sequential Monte Carlo kernel to resample them. We derive theoretical guarantees for convergence, including asymptotic consistency and variance bounds. Within this framework, we further analyze trade-offs across four key axes for inference-time scaling under fixed budgets: iterations, samples, denoising steps, and reward estimation. Our analysis shows scaling iterations achieves the best reward-perplexity trade-off. Empirically, PG-DLM consistently outperforms prior methods using MDLM and LLaDA-8B as base models across a wide range of compute budgets for reward-guided generation tasks including toxicity and sentiment control as well as linguistic acceptability.

  Diffusion models provide a powerful way to incorporate complex prior information for solving inverse problems. However, existing methods struggle to correctly incorporate guidance from conflicting signals in the prior and measurement, and often failed to maximizing the consistency to the measurement, especially in the challenging setting of non-Gaussian or unknown noise. To address these issues, we propose Measurement-Aligned Sampling (MAS), a novel framework for linear inverse problem solving that flexibly balances prior and measurement information. MAS unifies and extends existing approaches such as DDNM, TMPD, while generalizing to handle both known Gaussian noise and unknown or non-Gaussian noise types. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MAS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across a variety of tasks, while maintaining relatively low computational cost.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The machine learning methods for data-driven identification of partial differential equations (PDEs) are typically defined for a given number of spatial dimensions and a choice of coordinates the data have been collected in. This dependence prevents the learned evolution equation from generalizing to other spaces. In this work, we reformulate the problem in terms of coordinate- and dimension-independent representations, paving the way toward what we call ``spatially liberated" PDE learning. To this end, we employ a machine learning approach to predict the evolution of scalar field systems expressed in the formalism of exterior calculus, which is coordinate-free and immediately generalizes to arbitrary dimensions by construction. We demonstrate the performance of this approach in the FitzHugh-Nagumo and Barkley reaction-diffusion models, as well as the Patlak-Keller-Segel model informed by in-situ chemotactic bacteria observations. We provide extensive numerical experiments that demonstrate that our approach allows for seamless transitions across various spatial contexts. We show that the field dynamics learned in one space can be used to make accurate predictions in other spaces with different dimensions, coordinate systems, boundary conditions, and curvatures.

  _Xuyang Chen, Keyu Yan, Wenhan Cao, Lin Zhao_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Offline reinforcement learning (RL) learns policies from fixed datasets without online interactions, but suffers from distribution shift, causing inaccurate evaluation and overestimation of out-of-distribution (OOD) actions. Existing methods counter this by conservatively discouraging all OOD actions, which limits generalization. We propose Advantage-based Diffusion Actor-Critic (ADAC), which evaluates OOD actions via an advantage-like function and uses it to modulate the Q-function update discriminatively. Our key insight is that the (state) value function is generally learned more reliably than the action-value function; we thus use the next-state value to indirectly assess each action. We develop a PointMaze environment to clearly visualize that advantage modulation effectively selects superior OOD actions while discouraging inferior ones. Moreover, extensive experiments on the D4RL benchmark show that ADAC achieves state-of-the-art performance, with especially strong gains on challenging tasks.

  In this work, we introduce JDCL - a new method for continual learning with generative rehearsal based on joint diffusion models. Neural networks suffer from catastrophic forgetting defined as abrupt loss in the model's performance when retrained with additional data coming from a different distribution. Generative-replay-based continual learning methods try to mitigate this issue by retraining a model with a combination of new and rehearsal data sampled from a generative model. In this work, we propose to extend this idea by combining a continually trained classifier with a diffusion-based generative model into a single - jointly optimized neural network. We show that such shared parametrization, combined with the knowledge distillation technique allows for stable adaptation to new tasks without catastrophic forgetting. We evaluate our approach on several benchmarks, where it outperforms recent state-of-the-art generative replay techniques. Additionally, we extend our method to the semi-supervised continual learning setup, where it outperforms competing buffer-based replay techniques, and evaluate, in a self-supervised manner, the quality of trained representations.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We propose SketchPlan, a diffusion-based planner that interprets 2D hand-drawn sketches over depth images to generate 3D flight paths for drone navigation. SketchPlan comprises two components: a SketchAdapter that learns to map the human sketches to projected 2D paths, and DiffPath, a diffusion model that infers 3D trajectories from 2D projections and a first person view depth image. Our model achieves zero-shot sim-to-real transfer, generating accurate and safe flight paths in previously unseen real-world environments. To train the model, we build a synthetic dataset of 32k flight paths using a diverse set of photorealistic 3D Gaussian Splatting scenes. We automatically label the data by computing 2D projections of the 3D flight paths onto the camera plane, and use this to train the DiffPath diffusion model. However, since real human 2D sketches differ significantly from ideal 2D projections, we additionally label 872 of the 3D flight paths with real human sketches and use this to train the SketchAdapter to infer the 2D projection from the human sketch. We demonstrate SketchPlan's effectiveness in both simulated and real-world experiments, and show through ablations that training on a mix of human labeled and auto-labeled data together with a modular design significantly boosts its capabilities to correctly interpret human intent and infer 3D paths. In real-world drone tests, SketchPlan achieved 100\% success in low/medium clutter and 40\% in unseen high-clutter environments, outperforming key ablations by 20-60\% in task completion.

  Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in generating realistic and versatile images from text prompts. Inspired by the recent advancements of language models, there is an increasing interest in further improving the models by aligning with human preferences. However, we investigate alignment from a divergence minimization perspective and reveal that existing preference optimization methods are typically trapped in suboptimal mean-seeking optimization. In this paper, we introduce Divergence Minimization Preference Optimization (DMPO), a novel and principled method for aligning diffusion models by minimizing reverse KL divergence, which asymptotically enjoys the same optimization direction as original RL. We provide rigorous analysis to justify the effectiveness of DMPO and conduct comprehensive experiments to validate its empirical strength across both human evaluations and automatic metrics. Our extensive results show that diffusion models fine-tuned with DMPO can consistently outperform or match existing techniques, specifically consistently outperforming all baseline models across different base models and test sets, achieving the best PickScore in every case, demonstrating the method's superiority in aligning generative behavior with desired outputs. Overall, DMPO unlocks a robust and elegant pathway for preference alignment, bridging principled theory with practical performance in diffusion models.

  Synthetically augmenting training datasets with diffusion models has been an effective strategy for improving generalization of image classifiers. However, existing techniques struggle to ensure the diversity of generation and increase the size of the data by up to 10-30x to improve the in-distribution performance. In this work, we show that synthetically augmenting part of the data that is not learned early in training with faithful images-containing same features but different noise-outperforms augmenting the entire dataset. By analyzing a two-layer CNN, we prove that this strategy improves generalization by promoting homogeneity in feature learning speed without amplifying noise. Our extensive experiments show that by augmenting only 30%-40% of the data, our method boosts generalization by up to 2.8% in a variety of scenarios, including training ResNet, ViT, ConvNeXt, and Swin Transformer on CIFAR-10/100, and TinyImageNet, with various optimizers including SGD and SAM. Notably, our method applied with SGD outperforms the SOTA optimizer, SAM, on CIFAR-100 and TinyImageNet.

  Diffusion Transformer (DiT) has exhibited impressive generation capabilities but faces great challenges due to its high computational complexity. To address this issue, various methods, notably feature caching, have been introduced. However, these approaches focus on aligning non-cache diffusion without analyzing why caching damage the generation processes. In this paper, we first confirm that the cache greatly amplifies the exposure bias, resulting in a decline in the generation quality. However, directly applying noise scaling is challenging for this issue due to the non-smoothness of exposure bias. We found that this phenomenon stems from the mismatch between its frequency response characteristics and the simple cache of Attention and MLP. Since these two components exhibit unique preferences for frequency signals, which provides us with a caching strategy to separate Attention and MLP to achieve an enhanced fit of exposure bias and reduce it. Based on this, we introduced FEB-Cache, a joint caching strategy that aligns with the non-exposed bias diffusion process (which gives us a higher performance cap) of caching Attention and MLP based on the frequency-guided cache table. Our approach combines a comprehensive understanding of the caching mechanism and offers a new perspective on leveraging caching to accelerate the diffusion process. Empirical results indicate that FEB-Cache optimizes model performance while concurrently facilitating acceleration. Code is available atthis https URL.

  Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has been successfully used to align large language models (LLMs) according to human preferences, and more recently it has also been applied to improving the quality of text-to-image diffusion models. However, DPO-based methods such as SPO, Diffusion-DPO, and D3PO are highly susceptible to overfitting and reward hacking, especially when the generative model is optimized to fit out-of-distribution during prolonged training. To overcome these challenges and stabilize the training of diffusion models, we introduce a self-entropy regularization mechanism in reinforcement learning from human feedback. This enhancement improves DPO training by encouraging broader exploration and greater robustness. Our regularization technique effectively mitigates reward hacking, leading to improved stability and enhanced image quality across the latent space. Extensive experiments demonstrate that integrating human feedback with self-entropy regularization can significantly boost image diversity and specificity, achieving state-of-the-art results on key image generation metrics.

  Large denoising diffusion models, such as Stable Diffusion, have been trained on billions of image-caption pairs to perform text-conditioned image generation. As a byproduct of this training, these models have acquired general knowledge about image statistics, which can be useful for other inference tasks. However, when confronted with sampling an image under new constraints, e.g. generating the missing parts of an image, using large pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models is inefficient and often unreliable. Previous approaches either utilized backpropagation through the denoiser network, making them significantly slower and more memory-demanding than simple text-to-image generation, or only enforced the constraint locally, failing to capture critical long-range correlations in the sampled image. In this work, we propose an algorithm that enables fast, high-quality generation under arbitrary constraints. We show that in denoising diffusion models, we can employ an approximation to Newton's optimization method that allows us to speed up inference and avoid the expensive backpropagation operations. Our approach produces results that rival or surpass the state-of-the-art training-free inference methods while requiring a fraction of the time. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm under both linear (inpainting, super-resolution) and non-linear (style-guided generation) constraints.

  Diffusion models have emerged as powerful priors for solving inverse problems. However, existing approaches typically overlook side information that could significantly improve reconstruction quality, especially in severely ill-posed settings. In this work, we propose a novel inference-time search algorithm that guides the sampling process using the side information in a manner that balances exploration and exploitation. This enables more accurate and reliable reconstructions, providing an alternative to the gradient-based guidance that is prone to reward-hacking artifacts. Our approach can be seamlessly integrated into a wide range of existing diffusion-based image reconstruction pipelines. Through extensive experiments on a number of inverse problems, such as box inpainting, super-resolution, and various deblurring tasks including motion, Gaussian, nonlinear, and blind deblurring, we show that our approach consistently improves the qualitative and quantitative performance of diffusion-based image reconstruction algorithms. We also show the superior performance of our approach with respect to other baselines, including reward gradient-based guidance algorithms.

  Dual-view mammography, including craniocaudal (CC) and mediolateral oblique (MLO) projections, offers complementary anatomical views crucial for breast cancer diagnosis. However, in real-world clinical workflows, one view may be missing, corrupted, or degraded due to acquisition errors or compression artifacts, limiting the effectiveness of downstream analysis. View-to-view translation can help recover missing views and improve lesion alignment. Unlike natural images, this task in mammography is highly challenging due to large non-rigid deformations and severe tissue overlap in X-ray projections, which obscure pixel-level correspondences. In this paper, we propose Column-Aware and Implicit 3D Diffusion (CA3D-Diff), a novel bidirectional mammogram view translation framework based on conditional diffusion model. To address cross-view structural misalignment, we first design a column-aware cross-attention mechanism that leverages the geometric property that anatomically corresponding regions tend to lie in similar column positions across views. A Gaussian-decayed bias is applied to emphasize local column-wise correlations while suppressing distant mismatches. Furthermore, we introduce an implicit 3D structure reconstruction module that back-projects noisy 2D latents into a coarse 3D feature volume based on breast-view projection geometry. The reconstructed 3D structure is refined and injected into the denoising UNet to guide cross-view generation with enhanced anatomical awareness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CA3D-Diff achieves superior performance in bidirectional tasks, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in visual fidelity and structural consistency. Furthermore, the synthesized views effectively improve single-view malignancy classification in screening settings, demonstrating the practical value of our method in real-world diagnostics.

  Observing surgical practice has historically relied on fixed vantage points or recollections, leaving the egocentric visual perspectives that guide clinical decisions undocumented. Fixed-camera video can capture surgical workflows at the room-scale, but cannot reconstruct what each team member actually saw. Thus, these videos only provide limited insights into how decisions that affect surgical safety, training, and workflow optimization are made. Here we introduce EgoSurg, the first framework to reconstruct the dynamic, egocentric replays for any operating room (OR) staff directly from wall-mounted fixed-camera video, and thus, without intervention to clinical workflow. EgoSurg couples geometry-driven neural rendering with diffusion-based view enhancement, enabling high-visual fidelity synthesis of arbitrary and egocentric viewpoints at any moment. In evaluation across multi-site surgical cases and controlled studies, EgoSurg reconstructs person-specific visual fields and arbitrary viewpoints with high visual quality and fidelity. By transforming existing OR camera infrastructure into a navigable dynamic 3D record, EgoSurg establishes a new foundation for immersive surgical data science, enabling surgical practice to be visualized, experienced, and analyzed from every angle.

  The rapid growth of e-commerce has intensified the demand for Virtual Try-On (VTO) technologies, enabling customers to realistically visualize products overlaid on their own images. Despite recent advances, existing VTO models face challenges with fine-grained detail preservation, robustness to real-world imagery, efficient sampling, image editing capabilities, and generalization across diverse product categories. In this paper, we present DiT-VTON, a novel VTO framework that leverages a Diffusion Transformer (DiT), renowned for its performance on text-conditioned image generation, adapted here for the image-conditioned VTO task. We systematically explore multiple DiT configurations, including in-context token concatenation, channel concatenation, and ControlNet integration, to determine the best setup for VTO image conditioning.To enhance robustness, we train the model on an expanded dataset encompassing varied backgrounds, unstructured references, and non-garment categories, demonstrating the benefits of data scaling for VTO adaptability. DiT-VTON also redefines the VTO task beyond garment try-on, offering a versatile Virtual Try-All (VTA) solution capable of handling a wide range of product categories and supporting advanced image editing functionalities such as pose preservation, localized editing, texture transfer, and object-level customization. Experimental results show that our model surpasses state-of-the-art methods on VITON-HD, achieving superior detail preservation and robustness without reliance on additional condition encoders. It also outperforms models with VTA and image editing capabilities on a diverse dataset spanning thousands of product categories.

  Recent advances in image editing have shifted from manual pixel manipulation to employing deep learning methods like stable diffusion models, which now leverage cross-attention mechanisms for text-driven control. This transition has simplified the editing process but also introduced variability in results, such as inconsistent hair color changes. Our research aims to enhance the precision and reliability of prompt-to-prompt image editing frameworks by exploring and optimizing hyperparameters. We present a comprehensive study of the "word swap" method, develop an "attention re-weight method" for better adaptability, and propose the "CL P2P" framework to address existing limitations like cycle inconsistency. This work contributes to understanding and improving the interaction between hyperparameter settings and the architectural choices of neural network models, specifically their attention mechanisms, which significantly influence the composition and quality of the generated images.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has become a cornerstone of structural biology, enabling near-atomic resolution analysis of macromolecules through advanced computational methods. However, the development of cryo-EM processing tools is constrained by the scarcity of high-quality annotated datasets. Synthetic data generation offers a promising alternative, but existing approaches lack thorough biophysical modeling of heterogeneity and fail to reproduce the complex noise observed in real imaging. To address these limitations, we present CryoCCD, a synthesis framework that unifies versatile biophysical modeling with the first conditional cycle-consistent diffusion model tailored for cryo-EM. The biophysical engine provides multi-functional generation capabilities to capture authentic biological organization, and the diffusion model is enhanced with cycle consistency and mask-guided contrastive learning to ensure realistic noise while preserving structural fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CryoCCD generates structurally faithful micrographs, enhances particle picking and pose estimation, as well as achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art baselines, while also generalizing effectively to held-out protein families.

  _Jiyuan Wang, Chunyu Lin, Cheng Guan, Lang Nie, Jing He, Haodong Li, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this paper, we propose Jasmine, the first Stable Diffusion (SD)-based self-supervised framework for monocular depth estimation, which effectively harnesses SD's visual priors to enhance the sharpness and generalization of unsupervised prediction. Previous SD-based methods are all supervised since adapting diffusion models for dense prediction requires high-precision supervision. In contrast, self-supervised reprojection suffers from inherent challenges (e.g., occlusions, texture-less regions, illumination variance), and the predictions exhibit blurs and artifacts that severely compromise SD's latent priors. To resolve this, we construct a novel surrogate task of hybrid image reconstruction. Without any additional supervision, it preserves the detail priors of SD models by reconstructing the images themselves while preventing depth estimation from degradation. Furthermore, to address the inherent misalignment between SD's scale and shift invariant estimation and self-supervised scale-invariant depth estimation, we build the Scale-Shift GRU. It not only bridges this distribution gap but also isolates the fine-grained texture of SD output against the interference of reprojection loss. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Jasmine achieves SoTA performance on the KITTI benchmark and exhibits superior zero-shot generalization across multiple datasets.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in text-to-image diffusion models enable photorealistic image generation, but they also risk producing malicious content, such as NSFW images. To mitigate risk, concept erasure methods are studied to facilitate the model to unlearn specific concepts. However, current studies struggle to fully erase malicious concepts implicitly embedded in prompts (e.g., metaphorical expressions or adversarial prompts) while preserving the model's normal generation capability. To address this challenge, our study proposes TRCE, using a two-stage concept erasure strategy to achieve an effective trade-off between reliable erasure and knowledge preservation. Firstly, TRCE starts by erasing the malicious semantics implicitly embedded in textual prompts. By identifying a critical mapping objective(i.e., the [EoT] embedding), we optimize the cross-attention layers to map malicious prompts to contextually similar prompts but with safe concepts. This step prevents the model from being overly influenced by malicious semantics during the denoising process. Following this, considering the deterministic properties of the sampling trajectory of the diffusion model, TRCE further steers the early denoising prediction toward the safe direction and away from the unsafe one through contrastive learning, thus further avoiding the generation of malicious content. Finally, we conduct comprehensive evaluations of TRCE on multiple malicious concept erasure benchmarks, and the results demonstrate its effectiveness in erasing malicious concepts while better preserving the model's original generation ability.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advancements in video diffusion models enable the generation of photorealistic videos with impressive 3D consistency and temporal coherence. However, the extent to which these AI-generated videos simulate the 3D visual world remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce Learned 3D Evaluation (L3DE), an objective, quantifiable, and interpretable method for assessing AI-generated videos' ability to simulate the real world in terms of 3D visual qualities and consistencies, without requiring manually labeled defects or quality annotations. Instead of relying on 3D reconstruction, which is prone to failure with in-the-wild videos, L3DE employs a 3D convolutional network, trained on monocular 3D cues of motion, depth, and appearance, to distinguish real from synthetic videos. Confidence scores from L3DE quantify the gap between real and synthetic videos in terms of 3D visual coherence, while a gradient-based visualization pinpoints unrealistic regions, improving interpretability. We validate L3DE through extensive experiments, demonstrating strong alignment with 3D reconstruction quality and human judgments. Our evaluations on leading generative models (e.g., Kling, Sora, and MiniMax) reveal persistent simulation gaps and subtle inconsistencies. Beyond generative video assessment, L3DE extends to broader applications: benchmarking video generation models, serving as a deepfake detector, and enhancing video synthesis by inpainting flagged inconsistencies.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Tokenizers are a key component of state-of-the-art generative image models, extracting the most important features from the signal while reducing data dimension and redundancy. Most current tokenizers are based on KL-regularized variational autoencoders (KL-VAE), trained with reconstruction, perceptual and adversarial losses. Diffusion decoders have been proposed as a more principled alternative to model the distribution over images conditioned on the latent. However, matching the performance of KL-VAE still requires adversarial losses, as well as a higher decoding time due to iterative sampling. To address these limitations, we introduce a new pixel diffusion decoder architecture for improved scaling and training stability, benefiting from transformer components and GAN-free training. We use distillation to replicate the performance of the diffusion decoder in an efficient single-step decoder. This makes SSDD the first diffusion decoder optimized for single-step reconstruction trained without adversarial losses, reaching higher reconstruction quality and faster sampling than KL-VAE. In particular, SSDD improves reconstruction FID from $0.87$ to $0.50$ with $1.4\times$ higher throughput and preserve generation quality of DiTs with $3.8\times$ faster sampling. As such, SSDD can be used as a drop-in replacement for KL-VAE, and for building higher-quality and faster generative models.

  Human-centric generative models designed for AI-driven storytelling must bring together two core capabilities: identity consistency and precise control over human performance. While recent diffusion-based approaches have made significant progress in maintaining facial identity, achieving fine-grained expression control without compromising identity remains challenging. In this work, we present a diffusion-based framework that faithfully reimagines any subject under any particular facial expression. Building on an ID-consistent face foundation model, we adopt a compositional design featuring an expression cross-attention module guided by FLAME blendshape parameters for explicit control. Trained on a diverse mixture of image and video data rich in expressive variation, our adapter generalizes beyond basic emotions to subtle micro-expressions and expressive transitions, overlooked by prior works. In addition, a pluggable Reference Adapter enables expression editing in real images by transferring the appearance from a reference frame during synthesis. Extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations show that our model outperforms existing methods in tailored and identity-consistent expression generation.

  In recent years, multi-concept personalization for text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models to represent several subjects in an image has gained much more attention. The main challenge of this task is "concept mixing", where multiple learned concepts interfere or blend undesirably in the output image. To address this issue, in this paper, we present ConceptSplit, a novel framework to split the individual concepts through training and inference. Our framework comprises two key components. First, we introduce Token-wise Value Adaptation (ToVA), a merging-free training method that focuses exclusively on adapting the value projection in cross-attention. Based on our empirical analysis, we found that modifying the key projection, a common approach in existing methods, can disrupt the attention mechanism and lead to concept mixing. Second, we propose Latent Optimization for Disentangled Attention (LODA), which alleviates attention entanglement during inference by optimizing the input latent. Through extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments, we demonstrate that ConceptSplit achieves robust multi-concept personalization, mitigating unintended concept interference.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent diffusion models achieve the state-of-the-art performance in image generation, but often suffer from semantic inconsistencies or hallucinations. While various inference-time guidance methods can enhance generation, they often operate indirectly by relying on external signals or architectural modifications, which introduces additional computational overhead. In this paper, we propose Tangential Amplifying Guidance (TAG), a more efficient and direct guidance method that operates solely on trajectory signals without modifying the underlying diffusion model. TAG leverages an intermediate sample as a projection basis and amplifies the tangential components of the estimated scores with respect to this basis to correct the sampling trajectory. We formalize this guidance process by leveraging a first-order Taylor expansion, which demonstrates that amplifying the tangential component steers the state toward higher-probability regions, thereby reducing inconsistencies and enhancing sample quality. TAG is a plug-and-play, architecture-agnostic module that improves diffusion sampling fidelity with minimal computational addition, offering a new perspective on diffusion guidance.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Diffusion models have achieved impressive results in generating high-quality images. Yet, they often struggle to faithfully align the generated images with the input prompts. This limitation arises from synchronous denoising, where all pixels simultaneously evolve from random noise to clear images. As a result, during generation, the prompt-related regions can only reference the unrelated regions at the same noise level, failing to obtain clear context and ultimately impairing text-to-image alignment. To address this issue, we propose asynchronous diffusion models -- a novel framework that allocates distinct timesteps to different pixels and reformulates the pixel-wise denoising process. By dynamically modulating the timestep schedules of individual pixels, prompt-related regions are denoised more gradually than unrelated regions, thereby allowing them to leverage clearer inter-pixel context. Consequently, these prompt-related regions achieve better alignment in the final images. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our asynchronous diffusion models can significantly improve text-to-image alignment across diverse prompts.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Visual autoregressive (AR) generation offers a promising path toward unifying vision and language models, yet its performance remains suboptimal against diffusion models. Prior work often attributes this gap to tokenizer limitations and rasterization ordering. In this work, we identify a core bottleneck from the perspective of generator-tokenizer inconsistency, i.e., the AR-generated tokens may not be well-decoded by the tokenizer. To address this, we propose reAR, a simple training strategy introducing a token-wise regularization objective: when predicting the next token, the causal transformer is also trained to recover the visual embedding of the current token and predict the embedding of the target token under a noisy context. It requires no changes to the tokenizer, generation order, inference pipeline, or external models. Despite its simplicity, reAR substantially improves performance. On ImageNet, it reduces gFID from 3.02 to 1.86 and improves IS to 316.9 using a standard rasterization-based tokenizer. When applied to advanced tokenizers, it achieves a gFID of 1.42 with only 177M parameters, matching the performance with larger state-of-the-art diffusion models (675M).

  Accurate pedestrian trajectory prediction is crucial for ensuring safety and efficiency in autonomous driving and human-robot interaction scenarios. Earlier studies primarily utilized sufficient observational data to predict future trajectories. However, in real-world scenarios, such as pedestrians suddenly emerging from blind spots, sufficient observational data is often unavailable (i.e. momentary trajectory), making accurate prediction challenging and increasing the risk of traffic accidents. Therefore, advancing research on pedestrian trajectory prediction under extreme scenarios is critical for enhancing traffic safety. In this work, we propose a novel framework termed Diffusion^2, tailored for momentary trajectory prediction. Diffusion^2 consists of two sequentially connected diffusion models: one for backward prediction, which generates unobserved historical trajectories, and the other for forward prediction, which forecasts future trajectories. Given that the generated unobserved historical trajectories may introduce additional noise, we propose a dual-head parameterization mechanism to estimate their aleatoric uncertainty and design a temporally adaptive noise module that dynamically modulates the noise scale in the forward diffusion process. Empirically, Diffusion^2 sets a new state-of-the-art in momentary trajectory prediction on ETH/UCY and Stanford Drone datasets.

  Diffusion Transformers offer state-of-the-art fidelity in image and video synthesis, but their iterative sampling process remains a major bottleneck due to the high cost of transformer forward passes at each timestep. To mitigate this, feature caching has emerged as a training-free acceleration technique that reuses or forecasts hidden representations. However, existing methods often apply a uniform caching strategy across all feature dimensions, ignoring their heterogeneous dynamic behaviors. Therefore, we adopt a new perspective by modeling hidden feature evolution as a mixture of ODEs across dimensions, and introduce HyCa, a Hybrid ODE solver inspired caching framework that applies dimension-wise caching strategies. HyCa achieves near-lossless acceleration across diverse domains and models, including 5.55 times speedup on FLUX, 5.56 times speedup on HunyuanVideo, 6.24 times speedup on Qwen-Image and Qwen-Image-Edit without retraining.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Latest diffusion models have shown promising results in category-level 6D object pose estimation by modeling the conditional pose distribution with depth image input. The existing methods, however, suffer from slow convergence during training, learning its encoder with the diffusion denoising network in end-to-end fashion, and require an additional network that evaluates sampled pose hypotheses to filter out low-quality pose candidates. In this paper, we propose a novel pipeline that tackles these limitations by two key components. First, the proposed method pretrains the encoder with the direct pose regression head, and jointly learns the networks via the regression head and the denoising diffusion head, significantly accelerating training convergence while achieving higher accuracy. Second, sampling guidance via time-dependent score scaling is proposed s.t. the exploration-exploitation trade-off is effectively taken, eliminating the need for the additional evaluation network. The sampling guidance maintains multi-modal characteristics of symmetric objects at early denoising steps while ensuring high-quality pose generation at final steps. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks including REAL275, HouseCat6D, and ROPE, demonstrate that the proposed method, simple yet effective, achieves state-of-the-art accuracies even with single-pose inference, while being more efficient in both training and inference.

  This work presents TV-LoRA, a novel method for low-dose sparse-view CT reconstruction that combines a diffusion generative prior (NCSN++ with SDE modeling) and multi-regularization constraints, including anisotropic TV and nuclear norm (LoRA), within an ADMM framework. To address ill-posedness and texture loss under extremely sparse views, TV-LoRA integrates generative and physical constraints, and utilizes a 2D slice-based strategy with FFT acceleration and tensor-parallel optimization for efficient inference. Experiments on AAPM-2016, CTHD, and LIDC datasets with $N_{\mathrm{view}}=8,4,2$ show that TV-LoRA consistently surpasses benchmarks in SSIM, texture recovery, edge clarity, and artifact suppression, demonstrating strong robustness and generalizability. Ablation studies confirm the complementary effects of LoRA regularization and diffusion priors, while the FFT-PCG module provides a speedup. Overall, Diffusion + TV-LoRA achieves high-fidelity, efficient 3D CT reconstruction and broad clinical applicability in low-dose, sparse-sampling scenarios.

  Human video generation is becoming an increasingly important task with broad applications in graphics, entertainment, and embodied AI. Despite the rapid progress of video diffusion models (VDMs), their use for general-purpose human video generation remains underexplored, with most works constrained to image-to-video setups or narrow domains like dance videos. In this work, we propose CAMEO, a cascaded framework for general human motion video generation. It seamlessly bridges Text-to-Motion (T2M) models and conditional VDMs, mitigating suboptimal factors that may arise in this process across both training and inference through carefully designed components. Specifically, we analyze and prepare both textual prompts and visual conditions to effectively train the VDM, ensuring robust alignment between motion descriptions, conditioning signals, and the generated videos. Furthermore, we introduce a camera-aware conditioning module that connects the two stages, automatically selecting viewpoints aligned with the input text to enhance coherence and reduce manual intervention. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on both the MovieGen benchmark and a newly introduced benchmark tailored to the T2M-VDM combination, while highlighting its versatility across diverse use cases.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Unpaired image-to-image translation involves learning mappings between source domain and target domain in the absence of aligned or corresponding samples. Score based diffusion models have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in generative tasks. Their ability to approximate complex data distributions through stochastic differential equations (SDEs) enables them to generate high-fidelity and diverse outputs, making them particularly well-suited for unpaired I2I settings. In parallel, contrastive learning provides a powerful framework for learning semantic similarities without the need for explicit supervision or paired data. By pulling together representations of semantically similar samples and pushing apart dissimilar ones, contrastive methods are inherently aligned with the objectives of unpaired translation. Its ability to selectively enforce semantic consistency at the feature level makes contrastive learning particularly effective for guiding generation in unpaired scenarios. In this work, we propose a time-dependent contrastive learning approach where a model is trained with SimCLR by considering an image and its domain invarient feature as a positive pair, enabling the preservation of domain-invariant features and the discarding of domain-specific ones. The learned contrastive model then guides the inference of a pretrained SDE for the I2I translation task. We empirically compare Contrastive-SDE with several baselines across three common unpaired I2I tasks, using four metrics for evaluation. Constrastive-SDE achieves comparable results to the state-of-the-art on several metrics. Furthermore, we observe that our model converges significantly faster and requires no label supervision or classifier training, making it a more efficient alternative for this task.

  The integration of Diffusion Models into Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) is a substantial improvement in the detection of accidents. We present a novel hybrid model integrating guidance classification with diffusion techniques. By leveraging fine-tuned ExceptionNet architecture outputs as input for our proposed diffusion model and processing image tensors as our conditioning, our approach creates a robust classification framework. Our model consists of multiple conditional modules, which aim to modulate the linear projection of inputs using time embeddings and image covariate embeddings, allowing the network to adapt its behavior dynamically throughout the diffusion process. To address the computationally intensive nature of diffusion models, our implementation is cloud-based, enabling scalable and efficient processing. Our strategy overcomes the shortcomings of conventional classification approaches by leveraging diffusion models inherent capacity to effectively understand complicated data distributions. We investigate important diffusion characteristics, such as timestep schedulers, timestep encoding techniques, timestep count, and architectural design changes, using a thorough ablation study, and have conducted a comprehensive evaluation of the proposed model against the baseline models on a publicly available dataset. The proposed diffusion model performs best in image-based accident detection with an accuracy of 97.32%.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL) challenges models to sequentially learn new classes from minimal examples without forgetting prior knowledge, a task complicated by the stability-plasticity dilemma and data scarcity. Current FSCIL methods often struggle with generalization due to their reliance on limited datasets. While diffusion models offer a path for data augmentation, their direct application can lead to semantic misalignment or ineffective guidance. This paper introduces Diffusion-Classifier Synergy (DCS), a novel framework that establishes a mutual boosting loop between diffusion model and FSCIL classifier. DCS utilizes a reward-aligned learning strategy, where a dynamic, multi-faceted reward function derived from the classifier's state directs the diffusion model. This reward system operates at two levels: the feature level ensures semantic coherence and diversity using prototype-anchored maximum mean discrepancy and dimension-wise variance matching, while the logits level promotes exploratory image generation and enhances inter-class discriminability through confidence recalibration and cross-session confusion-aware mechanisms. This co-evolutionary process, where generated images refine the classifier and an improved classifier state yields better reward signals, demonstrably achieves state-of-the-art performance on FSCIL benchmarks, significantly enhancing both knowledge retention and new class learning.

  Achieving streaming, fine-grained control over the outputs of autoregressive video diffusion models remains challenging, making it difficult to ensure that they consistently align with user expectations. To bridge this gap, we propose \textbf{stReaming drag-oriEnted interactiVe vidEo manipuLation (REVEL)}, a new task that enables users to modify generated videos \emph{anytime} on \emph{anything} via fine-grained, interactive drag. Beyond DragVideo and SG-I2V, REVEL unifies drag-style video manipulation as editing and animating video frames with both supporting user-specified translation, deformation, and rotation effects, making drag operations versatile. In resolving REVEL, we observe: \emph{i}) drag-induced perturbations accumulate in latent space, causing severe latent distribution drift that halts the drag process; \emph{ii}) streaming drag is easily disturbed by context frames, thereby yielding visually unnatural outcomes. We thus propose a training-free approach, \textbf{DragStream}, comprising: \emph{i}) an adaptive distribution self-rectification strategy that leverages neighboring frames' statistics to effectively constrain the drift of latent embeddings; \emph{ii}) a spatial-frequency selective optimization mechanism, allowing the model to fully exploit contextual information while mitigating its interference via selectively propagating visual cues along generation. Our method can be seamlessly integrated into existing autoregressive video diffusion models, and extensive experiments firmly demonstrate the effectiveness of our DragStream.

  Accurate prediction of tumor trajectories under standard-of-care (SoC) therapies remains a major unmet need in oncology. This capability is essential for optimizing treatment planning and anticipating disease progression. Conventional reaction-diffusion models are limited in scope, as they fail to capture tumor dynamics under heterogeneous therapeutic paradigms. There is hence a critical need for computational frameworks that can realistically simulate SoC interventions while accounting for inter-patient variability in genomics, demographics, and treatment regimens. We introduce Standard-of-Care Digital Twin (SoC-DT), a differentiable framework that unifies reaction-diffusion tumor growth models, discrete SoC interventions (surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy) along with genomic and demographic personalization to predict post-treatment tumor structure on imaging. An implicit-explicit exponential time-differencing solver, IMEX-SoC, is also proposed, which ensures stability, positivity, and scalability in SoC treatment situations. Evaluated on both synthetic data and real world glioma data, SoC-DT consistently outperforms classical PDE baselines and purely data-driven neural models in predicting tumor dynamics. By bridging mechanistic interpretability with modern differentiable solvers, SoC-DT establishes a principled foundation for patient-specific digital twins in oncology, enabling biologically consistent tumor dynamics estimation. Code will be made available upon acceptance.

  Recent advances in text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have enabled impressive generative capabilities, but they also raise significant safety concerns due to the potential to produce harmful or undesirable content. While concept erasure has been explored as a mitigation strategy, most existing approaches and corresponding attack evaluations are tailored to Stable Diffusion (SD) and exhibit limited effectiveness when transferred to next-generation rectified flow transformers such as Flux. In this work, we present ReFlux, the first concept attack method specifically designed to assess the robustness of concept erasure in the latest rectified flow-based T2I framework. Our approach is motivated by the observation that existing concept erasure techniques, when applied to Flux, fundamentally rely on a phenomenon known as attention localization. Building on this insight, we propose a simple yet effective attack strategy that specifically targets this property. At its core, a reverse-attention optimization strategy is introduced to effectively reactivate suppressed signals while stabilizing attention. This is further reinforced by a velocity-guided dynamic that enhances the robustness of concept reactivation by steering the flow matching process, and a consistency-preserving objective that maintains the global layout and preserves unrelated content. Extensive experiments consistently demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed attack method, establishing a reliable benchmark for evaluating the robustness of concept erasure strategies in rectified flow transformers.

  Neural scene representations, such as 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), have enabled high-quality neural rendering; however, their large storage and transmission costs hinder deployment in resource-constrained environments. Existing compression methods either rely on costly optimization, which is slow and scene-specific, or adopt training-free pruning and quantization, which degrade rendering quality under high compression ratios.

  Sparse-view novel view synthesis is fundamentally ill-posed due to severe geometric ambiguity. Current methods are caught in a trade-off: regressive models are geometrically faithful but incomplete, whereas generative models can complete scenes but often introduce structural inconsistencies. We propose OracleGS, a novel framework that reconciles generative completeness with regressive fidelity for sparse view Gaussian Splatting. Instead of using generative models to patch incomplete reconstructions, our "propose-and-validate" framework first leverages a pre-trained 3D-aware diffusion model to synthesize novel views to propose a complete scene. We then repurpose a multi-view stereo (MVS) model as a 3D-aware oracle to validate the 3D uncertainties of generated views, using its attention maps to reveal regions where the generated views are well-supported by multi-view evidence versus where they fall into regions of high uncertainty due to occlusion, lack of texture, or direct inconsistency. This uncertainty signal directly guides the optimization of a 3D Gaussian Splatting model via an uncertainty-weighted loss. Our approach conditions the powerful generative prior on multi-view geometric evidence, filtering hallucinatory artifacts while preserving plausible completions in under-constrained regions, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on datasets including Mip-NeRF 360 and NeRF Synthetic.

  The widespread deployment of large vision models such as Stable Diffusion raises significant legal and ethical concerns, as these models can memorize and reproduce copyrighted content without authorization. Existing detection approaches often lack robustness and fail to provide rigorous theoretical underpinnings. To address these gaps, we formalize the concept of copyright infringement and its detection from the perspective of Differential Privacy (DP), and introduce the conditional sensitivity metric, a concept analogous to sensitivity in DP, that quantifies the deviation in a diffusion model's output caused by the inclusion or exclusion of a specific training data point. To operationalize this metric, we propose D-Plus-Minus (DPM), a novel post-hoc detection framework that identifies copyright infringement in text-to-image diffusion models. Specifically, DPM simulates inclusion and exclusion processes by fine-tuning models in two opposing directions: learning or unlearning. Besides, to disentangle concept-specific influence from the global parameter shifts induced by fine-tuning, DPM computes confidence scores over orthogonal prompt distributions using statistical metrics. Moreover, to facilitate standardized benchmarking, we also construct the Copyright Infringement Detection Dataset (CIDD), a comprehensive resource for evaluating detection across diverse categories. Our results demonstrate that DPM reliably detects infringement content without requiring access to the original training dataset or text prompts, offering an interpretable and practical solution for safeguarding intellectual property in the era of generative AI.

  Text-to-Motion (T2M) generation aims to synthesize realistic and semantically aligned human motion sequences from natural language descriptions. However, current approaches face dual challenges: Generative models (e.g., diffusion models) suffer from limited diversity, error accumulation, and physical implausibility, while Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods exhibit diffusion inertia, partial-mode collapse, and asynchronous artifacts. To address these limitations, we propose ReMoMask, a unified framework integrating three key innovations: 1) A Bidirectional Momentum Text-Motion Model decouples negative sample scale from batch size via momentum queues, substantially improving cross-modal retrieval precision; 2) A Semantic Spatio-temporal Attention mechanism enforces biomechanical constraints during part-level fusion to eliminate asynchronous artifacts; 3) RAG-Classier-Free Guidance incorporates minor unconditional generation to enhance generalization. Built upon MoMask's RVQ-VAE, ReMoMask efficiently generates temporally coherent motions in minimal steps. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of ReMoMask, achieving a 3.88% and 10.97% improvement in FID scores on HumanML3D and KIT-ML, respectively, compared to the previous SOTA method RAG-T2M.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Unsupervised disentanglement of static appearance and dynamic motion in video remains a fundamental challenge, often hindered by information leakage and blurry reconstructions in existing VAE- and GAN-based approaches. We introduce DiViD, the first end-to-end video diffusion framework for explicit static-dynamic factorization. DiViD's sequence encoder extracts a global static token from the first frame and per-frame dynamic tokens, explicitly removing static content from the motion code. Its conditional DDPM decoder incorporates three key inductive biases: a shared-noise schedule for temporal consistency, a time-varying KL-based bottleneck that tightens at early timesteps (compressing static information) and relaxes later (enriching dynamics), and cross-attention that routes the global static token to all frames while keeping dynamic tokens frame-specific. An orthogonality regularizer further prevents residual static-dynamic leakage. We evaluate DiViD on real-world benchmarks using swap-based accuracy and cross-leakage metrics. DiViD outperforms state-of-the-art sequential disentanglement methods: it achieves the highest swap-based joint accuracy, preserves static fidelity while improving dynamic transfer, and reduces average cross-leakage.

  Recent advancements in generative models have revolutionized video synthesis and editing. However, the scarcity of diverse, high-quality datasets continues to hinder video-conditioned robotic learning, limiting cross-platform generalization. In this work, we address the challenge of swapping a robotic arm in one video with another: a key step for crossembodiment learning. Unlike previous methods that depend on paired video demonstrations in the same environmental settings, our proposed framework, RoboSwap, operates on unpaired data from diverse environments, alleviating the data collection needs. RoboSwap introduces a novel video editing pipeline integrating both GANs and diffusion models, combining their isolated advantages. Specifically, we segment robotic arms from their backgrounds and train an unpaired GAN model to translate one robotic arm to another. The translated arm is blended with the original video background and refined with a diffusion model to enhance coherence, motion realism and object interaction. The GAN and diffusion stages are trained independently. Our experiments demonstrate that RoboSwap outperforms state-of-the-art video and image editing models on three benchmarks in terms of both structural coherence and motion consistency, thereby offering a robust solution for generating reliable, cross-embodiment data in robotic learning.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Despite recent progress, most existing virtual try-on methods still struggle to simultaneously address two core challenges: accurately aligning the garment image with the target human body, and preserving fine-grained garment textures and patterns. These two requirements map directly onto a coarse-to-fine generation paradigm, where the coarse stage handles structural alignment and the fine stage recovers rich garment details. Motivated by this observation, we propose DS-VTON, an enhanced dual-scale coarse-to-fine framework that tackles the try-on problem more effectively. DS-VTON consists of two stages: the first stage generates a low-resolution try-on result to capture the semantic correspondence between garment and body, where reduced detail facilitates robust structural alignment. In the second stage, a blend-refine diffusion process reconstructs high-resolution outputs by refining the residual between scales through noise-image blending, emphasizing texture fidelity and effectively correcting fine-detail errors from the low-resolution stage. In addition, our method adopts a fully mask-free generation strategy, eliminating reliance on human parsing maps or segmentation masks. Extensive experiments show that DS-VTON not only achieves state-of-the-art performance but consistently and significantly surpasses prior methods in both structural alignment and texture fidelity across multiple standard virtual try-on benchmarks.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Text-driven object insertion in 3D scenes is an emerging task that enables intuitive scene editing through natural language. However, existing 2D editing-based methods often rely on spatial priors such as 2D masks or 3D bounding boxes, and they struggle to ensure consistency of the inserted object. These limitations hinder flexibility and scalability in real-world applications. In this paper, we propose FreeInsert, a novel framework that leverages foundation models including MLLMs, LGMs, and diffusion models to disentangle object generation from spatial placement. This enables unsupervised and flexible object insertion in 3D scenes without spatial priors. FreeInsert starts with an MLLM-based parser that extracts structured semantics, including object types, spatial relationships, and attachment regions, from user instructions. These semantics guide both the reconstruction of the inserted object for 3D consistency and the learning of its degrees of freedom. We leverage the spatial reasoning capabilities of MLLMs to initialize object pose and scale. A hierarchical, spatially aware refinement stage further integrates spatial semantics and MLLM-inferred priors to enhance placement. Finally, the appearance of the object is improved using the inserted-object image to enhance visual fidelity. Experimental results demonstrate that FreeInsert achieves semantically coherent, spatially precise, and visually realistic 3D insertions without relying on spatial priors, offering a user-friendly and flexible editing experience.

  Realistic human geometry generation is an important yet challenging task, requiring both the preservation of fine clothing details and the accurate modeling of clothing-body interactions. To tackle this challenge, we build upon Geometry distributions, a recently proposed representation that can model a single human geometry with high fidelity using a flow matching model. However, extending a single-geometry distribution to a dataset is non-trivial and inefficient for large-scale learning. To address this, we propose a new geometry distribution model by two key techniques: (1) encoding distributions as 2D feature maps rather than network parameters, and (2) using SMPL models as the domain instead of Gaussian and refining the associated flow velocity field. We then design a generative framework adopting a two staged training paradigm analogous to state-of-the-art image and 3D generative models. In the first stage, we compress geometry distributions into a latent space using a diffusion flow model; the second stage trains another flow model on this latent space. We validate our approach on two key tasks: pose-conditioned random avatar generation and avatar-consistent novel pose synthesis. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving a 57% improvement in geometry quality.

  The increasing demand for immersive AR/VR applications and spatial intelligence has heightened the need to generate high-quality scene-level and 360$¬∞$ panoramic video. However, most video diffusion models are constrained by limited resolution and aspect ratio, which restricts their applicability to scene-level dynamic content synthesis. In this work, we propose $\textbf{DynamicScaler}$, addressing these challenges by enabling spatially scalable and panoramic dynamic scene synthesis that preserves coherence across panoramic scenes of arbitrary size. Specifically, we introduce a Offset Shifting Denoiser, facilitating efficient, synchronous, and coherent denoising panoramic dynamic scenes via a diffusion model with fixed resolution through a seamless rotating Window, which ensures seamless boundary transitions and consistency across the entire panoramic space, accommodating varying resolutions and aspect ratios. Additionally, we employ a Global Motion Guidance mechanism to ensure both local detail fidelity and global motion continuity. Extensive experiments demonstrate our method achieves superior content and motion quality in panoramic scene-level video generation, offering a training-free, efficient, and scalable solution for immersive dynamic scene creation with constant VRAM consumption regardless of the output video resolution.

  Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) have recently emerged as a promising alternative to autoregressive (AR) models, offering advantages such as accelerated parallel decoding and bidirectional context modeling. However, the vanilla decoding strategy in discrete dLLMs suffers from a critical limitation: once a token is accepted, it can no longer be revised in subsequent steps. As a result, early mistakes persist across iterations, harming both intermediate predictions and final output quality. To address this issue, we propose Tolerator (Token-Level Cross-Validation Refinement), a training-free decoding strategy that leverages cross-validation among predicted tokens. Unlike existing methods that follow a single progressive unmasking procedure, Tolerator introduces a two-stage process: (i) sequence fill-up and (ii) iterative refinement by remasking and decoding a subset of tokens while treating the remaining as context. This design enables previously accepted tokens to be reconsidered and corrected when necessary, leading to more reliable diffusion decoding outputs. We evaluate Tolerator on five standard benchmarks covering language understanding, code generation, and mathematics. Experiments show that our method achieves consistent improvements over the baselines under the same computational budget. These findings suggest that decoding algorithms are crucial to realizing the full potential of diffusion large language models. Code and data are publicly available.

  Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) generate text through iterative denoising, yet current decoding strategies discard rich intermediate predictions in favor of the final output. Our work here reveals a critical phenomenon, temporal oscillation, where correct answers often emerge in the middle process, but are overwritten in later denoising steps. To address this issue, we introduce two complementary methods that exploit temporal consistency: 1) Temporal Self-Consistency Voting, a training-free, test-time decoding strategy that aggregates predictions across denoising steps to select the most consistent output; and 2) a post-training method termed Temporal Consistency Reinforcement, which uses Temporal Semantic Entropy (TSE), a measure of semantic stability across intermediate predictions, as a reward signal to encourage stable generations. Empirical results across multiple benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Using the negative TSE reward alone, we observe a remarkable average improvement of 24.7% on the Countdown dataset over an existing dLLM. Combined with the accuracy reward, we achieve absolute gains of 2.0% on GSM8K, 4.3% on MATH500, 6.6% on SVAMP, and 25.3% on Countdown, respectively. Our findings underscore the untapped potential of temporal dynamics in dLLMs and offer two simple yet effective tools to harness them.

  Diffusion-based Large Language Models (dLLMs) have emerged as a competitive alternative to autoregressive models, offering unique advantages through bidirectional attention and parallel generation paradigms. However, the generation results of current parallel decoding methods deviate from stepwise decoding, introducing potential performance degradation, which limits their practical deployment. To address this problem, we propose \textbf{S}elf \textbf{S}peculative \textbf{D}ecoding (SSD), a lossless inference acceleration method that leverages the dLLM itself as both speculative decoding drafter and verifier without auxiliary modules. SSD introduces a self-drafting mechanism where the model generates predictions for multiple positions, then verifies them through hierarchical verification trees in a single forward pass. Unlike traditional speculative decoding that requires separate draft models, SSD eliminates model redundancy and memory overhead by exploiting the dLLM's inherent parallel prediction capability for multiple positions. This self-speculative approach allows the model to progressively verify and accept multiple tokens in a single forward pass. Our experiments demonstrate that SSD achieves up to 3.46$\times$ speedup while keeping the output identical to stepwise decoding on open source models such as LLaDA and Dream. Code will be made publicly available on GitHub.

  Cognitive diagnostics in the Web-based Intelligent Education System (WIES) aims to assess students' mastery of knowledge concepts from heterogeneous, noisy interactions. Recent work has tried to utilize Large Language Models (LLMs) for cognitive diagnosis, yet LLMs struggle with structured data and are prone to noise-induced misjudgments. Specially, WIES's open environment continuously attracts new students and produces vast amounts of response logs, exacerbating the data imbalance and noise issues inherent in traditional educational systems. To address these challenges, we propose DLLM, a Diffusion-based LLM framework for noise-robust cognitive diagnosis. DLLM first constructs independent subgraphs based on response correctness, then applies relation augmentation alignment module to mitigate data imbalance. The two subgraph representations are then fused and aligned with LLM-derived, semantically augmented representations. Importantly, before each alignment step, DLLM employs a two-stage denoising diffusion module to eliminate intrinsic noise while assisting structural representation alignment. Specifically, unconditional denoising diffusion first removes erroneous information, followed by conditional denoising diffusion based on graph-guided to eliminate misleading information. Finally, the noise-robust representation that integrates semantic knowledge and structural information is fed into existing cognitive diagnosis models for prediction. Experimental results on three publicly available web-based educational platform datasets demonstrate that our DLLM achieves optimal predictive performance across varying noise levels, which demonstrates that DLLM achieves noise robustness while effectively leveraging semantic knowledge from LLM.

  Starting from flow- and diffusion-based transformers, Multi-modal Diffusion Transformers (MM-DiTs) have reshaped text-to-vision generation, gaining acclaim for exceptional visual fidelity. As these models advance, users continually push the boundary with imaginative or rare prompts, which advanced models still falter in generating, since their concepts are often too scarce to leave a strong imprint during pre-training. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective intervention that surfaces rare semantics inside MM-DiTs without additional training steps, data, denoising-time optimization, or reliance on external modules (e.g., large language models). In particular, the joint-attention mechanism intrinsic to MM-DiT sequentially updates text embeddings alongside image embeddings throughout transformer blocks. We find that by mathematically expanding representational basins around text token embeddings via variance scale-up before the joint-attention blocks, rare semantics clearly emerge in MM-DiT's outputs. Furthermore, our results generalize effectively across text-to-vision tasks, including text-to-image, text-to-video, and text-driven image editing. Our work invites generative models to reveal the semantics that users intend, once hidden yet ready to surface.

  Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) have emerged as a promising alternative to autoregressive models, offering flexible generation orders and strong performance on complex reasoning tasks. However, instruction-tuned dLLMs exhibit a critical vulnerability we term \texttt{<eos>} overflow: as allocated sequence length increases, responses paradoxically become shorter, collapsing into early termination or degenerating into streams of \texttt{<eos>} tokens. Although noticed in practice, this issue has not been systematically analyzed. We trace its root cause to the dual role of \texttt{<eos>} as both termination and padding, which concentrates probability mass on \texttt{<eos>} at later positions and propagates backward to trigger early termination. To address this, we introduce Rainbow Padding, a simple remedy that replaces repeated \texttt{<eos>} placeholders with a repeating cycle of distinct padding tokens, distributing probability mass and breaking \texttt{<eos>} dominance. Experiments show that Rainbow Padding substantially improves length robustness and output quality, with as few as seven padding tokens sufficient to prevent early termination. Moreover, the method integrates efficiently into existing instruction-tuned models: LoRA fine-tuning for a single epoch on minimal data yields significant improvements, making this solution highly practical.

  We present OneFlow, the first non-autoregressive multimodal model that enables variable-length and concurrent mixed-modal generation. Unlike autoregressive models that enforce rigid causal ordering between text and image generation, OneFlow combines an insertion-based Edit Flow for discrete text tokens with Flow Matching for image latents. OneFlow enables concurrent text-image synthesis with hierarchical sampling that prioritizes content over grammar. Through controlled experiments across model sizes from 1B to 8B, we demonstrate that OneFlow outperforms autoregressive baselines on both generation and understanding tasks while using up to 50% fewer training FLOPs. OneFlow surpasses both autoregressive and diffusion-based approaches while unlocking new capabilities for concurrent generation, iterative refinement, and natural reasoning-like generation.
