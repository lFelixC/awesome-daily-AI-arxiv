- **[Streaming Flow Policy: Simplifying diffusion/flow-matching policies by treating action trajectories as flow trajectories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21851)**  `arXiv:2505.21851`  `cs.RO` `cs.AI` `cs.LG`

  Recent advances in diffusion$/$flow-matching policies have enabled imitation learning of complex, multi-modal action trajectories. However, they are computationally expensive because they sample a trajectory of trajectories: a diffusion$/$flow trajectory of action trajectories. They discard intermediate action trajectories, and must wait for the sampling process to complete before any actions can be executed on the robot. We simplify diffusion$/$flow policies by treating action trajectories as flow trajectories. Instead of starting from pure noise, our algorithm samples from a narrow Gaussian around the last action. Then, it incrementally integrates a velocity field learned via flow matching to produce a sequence of actions that constitute a single trajectory. This enables actions to be streamed to the robot on-the-fly during the flow sampling process, and is well-suited for receding horizon policy execution. Despite streaming, our method retains the ability to model multi-modal behavior. We train flows that stabilize around demonstration trajectories to reduce distribution shift and improve imitation learning performance. Streaming flow policy outperforms prior methods while enabling faster policy execution and tighter sensorimotor loops for learning-based robot control. Project website:this https URL

- **[Pure Vision Language Action (VLA) Models: A Comprehensive Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19012)**  `arXiv:2509.19012`  `cs.RO` `cs.AI`  
  _Dapeng Zhang, Jing Sun, Chenghui Hu, Xiaoyan Wu, Zhenlong Yuan, Rui Zhou, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The emergence of Vision Language Action (VLA) models marks a paradigm shift from traditional policy-based control to generalized robotics, reframing Vision Language Models (VLMs) from passive sequence generators into active agents for manipulation and decision-making in complex, dynamic environments. This survey delves into advanced VLA methods, aiming to provide a clear taxonomy and a systematic, comprehensive review of existing research. It presents a comprehensive analysis of VLA applications across different scenarios and classifies VLA approaches into several paradigms: autoregression-based, diffusion-based, reinforcement-based, hybrid, and specialized methods; while examining their motivations, core strategies, and implementations in detail. In addition, foundational datasets, benchmarks, and simulation platforms are introduced. Building on the current VLA landscape, the review further proposes perspectives on key challenges and future directions to advance research in VLA models and generalizable robotics. By synthesizing insights from over three hundred recent studies, this survey maps the contours of this rapidly evolving field and highlights the opportunities and challenges that will shape the development of scalable, general-purpose VLA methods.

- **[DAGDiff: Guiding Dual-Arm Grasp Diffusion to Stable and Collision-Free Grasps](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21145)**  `arXiv:2509.21145`  `cs.RO`  
  _Md Faizal Karim, Vignesh Vembar, Keshab Patra, Gaurav Singh, K Madhava Krishna_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reliable dual-arm grasping is essential for manipulating large and complex objects but remains a challenging problem due to stability, collision, and generalization requirements. Prior methods typically decompose the task into two independent grasp proposals, relying on region priors or heuristics that limit generalization and provide no principled guarantee of stability. We propose DAGDiff, an end-to-end framework that directly denoises to grasp pairs in the SE(3) x SE(3) space. Our key insight is that stability and collision can be enforced more effectively by guiding the diffusion process with classifier signals, rather than relying on explicit region detection or object priors. To this end, DAGDiff integrates geometry-, stability-, and collision-aware guidance terms that steer the generative process toward grasps that are physically valid and force-closure compliant. We comprehensively evaluate DAGDiff through analytical force-closure checks, collision analysis, and large-scale physics-based simulations, showing consistent improvements over previous work on these metrics. Finally, we demonstrate that our framework generates dual-arm grasps directly on real-world point clouds of previously unseen objects, which are executed on a heterogeneous dual-arm setup where two manipulators reliably grasp and lift them.

- **[Normalizing Flows are Capable Visuomotor Policy Learning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21073)**  `arXiv:2509.21073`  `cs.RO`  
  _Simon Kristoffersson Lind, Jialong Li, Maj Stenmark, Volker Kr√ºger_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The field of general purpose robotics has recently embraced powerful probabilistic models, such as diffusion models, to model and learn complex behaviors. However, these models often come with significant trade-offs, namely high computational costs for inference and a fundamental inability to quantify output uncertainty. We argue that a model's trustworthiness, a critical factor for reliable, general-purpose robotics, is inherently linked to its ability to provide confidence measures.In this work, we introduce Normalizing Flows Policy, a novel visuomotor policy learning model based on Normalizing Flows. We show that Normalizing Flows are a natural and powerful alternative to diffusion models, providing both a statistically sound measure of confidence and a highly efficient inference process. Through comprehensive experiments across four distinct simulated robotic tasks, we demonstrate that Normalizing Flows Policy achieves performance comparable to, and often surpassing, Diffusion Policy, and it does so not only with improved sample efficiency but also with up to 30 times faster inference. Additionally, our ablation study validates several key architectural and training techniques that enable Normalizing Flows to perform well in this domain.

- **[GUIDE: A Diffusion-Based Autonomous Robot Exploration Framework Using Global Graph Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19916)**  `arXiv:2509.19916`  `cs.RO`  
  _Zijun Che, Yinghong Zhang, Shengyi Liang, Boyu Zhou, Jun Ma, Jinni Zhou_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Autonomous exploration in structured and complex indoor environments remains a challenging task, as existing methods often struggle to appropriately model unobserved space and plan globally efficient paths. To address these limitations, we propose GUIDE, a novel exploration framework that synergistically combines global graph inference with diffusion-based decision-making. We introduce a region-evaluation global graph representation that integrates both observed environmental data and predictions of unexplored areas, enhanced by a region-level evaluation mechanism to prioritize reliable structural inferences while discounting uncertain predictions. Building upon this enriched representation, a diffusion policy network generates stable, foresighted action sequences with significantly reduced denoising steps. Extensive simulations and real-world deployments demonstrate that GUIDE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to 18.3% faster coverage completion and a 34.9% reduction in redundant movements.

- **[A Unified Framework for Diffusion Model Unlearning with f-Divergence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21167)**  `arXiv:2509.21167`  `cs.LG` `cs.CV`  
  _Nicola Novello, Federico Fontana, Luigi Cinque, Deniz Gunduz, Andrea M. Tonello_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Machine unlearning aims to remove specific knowledge from a trained model. While diffusion models (DMs) have shown remarkable generative capabilities, existing unlearning methods for text-to-image (T2I) models often rely on minimizing the mean squared error (MSE) between the output distribution of a target and an anchor concept. We show that this MSE-based approach is a special case of a unified $f$-divergence-based framework, in which any $f$-divergence can be utilized. We analyze the benefits of using different $f$-divergences, that mainly impact the convergence properties of the algorithm and the quality of unlearning. The proposed unified framework offers a flexible paradigm that allows to select the optimal divergence for a specific application, balancing different trade-offs between aggressive unlearning and concept preservation.

- **[Flow Matching in the Low-Noise Regime: Pathologies and a Contrastive Remedy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20952)**  `arXiv:2509.20952`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Weili Zeng, Yichao Yan_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Flow matching has recently emerged as a powerful alternative to diffusion models, providing a continuous-time formulation for generative modeling and representation learning. Yet, we show that this framework suffers from a fundamental instability in the low-noise regime. As noise levels approach zero, arbitrarily small perturbations in the input can induce large variations in the velocity target, causing the condition number of the learning problem to diverge. This ill-conditioning not only slows optimization but also forces the encoder to reallocate its limited Jacobian capacity toward noise directions, thereby degrading semantic representations. We provide the first theoretical analysis of this phenomenon, which we term the low-noise pathology, establishing its intrinsic link to the structure of the flow matching objective. Building on these insights, we propose Local Contrastive Flow (LCF), a hybrid training protocol that replaces direct velocity regression with contrastive feature alignment at small noise levels, while retaining standard flow matching at moderate and high noise. Empirically, LCF not only improves convergence speed but also stabilizes representation quality. Our findings highlight the critical importance of addressing low-noise pathologies to unlock the full potential of flow matching for both generation and representation learning.

- **[Measuring LLM Sensitivity in Transformer-based Tabular Data Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20768)**  `arXiv:2509.20768`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Maria F. Davila R, Azizjon Turaev, Wolfram Wingerath_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Synthetic tabular data is used for privacy-preserving data sharing and data-driven model development. Its effectiveness, however, depends heavily on the used Tabular Data Synthesis (TDS) tool. Recent studies have shown that Transformer-based models outperform other state-of-the-art models such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Diffusion models in terms of data quality. However, Transformer-based models also come with high computational costs, making them sometimes unfeasible for end users with prosumer hardware. This study presents a sensitivity assessment on how the choice of hyperparameters, such as number of layers or hidden dimension affects the quality of the resultant synthetic data and the computational performance. It is performed across two tools, GReaT and REaLTabFormer, evaluating 10 model setups that vary in architecture type and depth. We assess the sensitivity on three dimensions: runtime, machine learning (ML) utility, and similarity to real data distributions. Experiments were conducted on four real-world datasets. Our findings reveal that runtime is proportional to the number of hyperparameters, with shallower configurations completing faster. GReaT consistently achieves lower runtimes than REaLTabFormer, and only on the largest dataset they have comparable runtime. For small datasets, both tools achieve synthetic data with high utility and optimal similarity, but on larger datasets only REaLTabFormer sustains strong utility and similarity. As a result, REaLTabFormer with lightweight LLMs provides the best balance, since it preserves data quality while reducing computational requirements. Nonetheless, its runtime remains higher than that of GReaT and other TDS tools, suggesting that efficiency gains are possible but only up to a certain level.

- **[MMG: Mutual Information Estimation via the MMSE Gap in Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20609)**  `arXiv:2509.20609`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Longxuan Yu, Xing Shi, Xianghao Kong, Tong Jia, Greg Ver Steeg_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Mutual information (MI) is one of the most general ways to measure relationships between random variables, but estimating this quantity for complex systems is challenging. Denoising diffusion models have recently set a new bar for density estimation, so it is natural to consider whether these methods could also be used to improve MI estimation. Using the recently introduced information-theoretic formulation of denoising diffusion models, we show the diffusion models can be used in a straightforward way to estimate MI. In particular, the MI corresponds to half the gap in the Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE) between conditional and unconditional diffusion, integrated over all Signal-to-Noise-Ratios (SNRs) in the noising process. Our approach not only passes self-consistency tests but also outperforms traditional and score-based diffusion MI estimators. Furthermore, our method leverages adaptive importance sampling to achieve scalable MI estimation, while maintaining strong performance even when the MI is high.

- **[UNO: Unlearning via Orthogonalization in Generative models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04712)**  `arXiv:2506.04712`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Pinak Mandal, Georg A. Gottwald_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As generative models become increasingly powerful and pervasive, the ability to unlearn specific data, whether due to privacy concerns, legal requirements, or the correction of harmful content, has become increasingly important. Unlike in conventional training, where data are accumulated and knowledge is reinforced, unlearning aims to selectively remove the influence of particular data points without costly retraining from scratch. To be effective and reliable, such algorithms need to achieve (i) forgetting of the undesired data, (ii) preservation of the quality of the generation, (iii) preservation of the influence of the desired training data on the model parameters, and (iv) small number of training steps. We propose fast unlearning algorithms based on loss gradient orthogonalization for unconditional and conditional generative models. We show that our algorithms are able to forget data while maintaining the fidelity of the original model. On standard image benchmarks, our algorithms achieve orders of magnitude faster unlearning times than their predecessors, such as gradient surgery. We demonstrate our algorithms with datasets of increasing complexity (MNIST, CelebA and ImageNet-1K) and for generative models of increasing complexity (VAEs and diffusion transformers).

- **[SPREAD: Sampling-based Pareto front Refinement via Efficient Adaptive Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21058)**  `arXiv:2509.21058`  `cs.LG`  
  _Sedjro Salomon Hotegni, Sebastian Peitz_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Developing efficient multi-objective optimization methods to compute the Pareto set of optimal compromises between conflicting objectives remains a key challenge, especially for large-scale and expensive problems. To bridge this gap, we introduce SPREAD, a generative framework based on Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs). SPREAD first learns a conditional diffusion process over points sampled from the decision space and then, at each reverse diffusion step, refines candidates via a sampling scheme that uses an adaptive multiple gradient descent-inspired update for fast convergence alongside a Gaussian RBF-based repulsion term for diversity. Empirical results on multi-objective optimization benchmarks, including offline and Bayesian surrogate-based settings, show that SPREAD matches or exceeds leading baselines in efficiency, scalability, and Pareto front coverage.

- **[Actor-Critic without Actor](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21022)**  `arXiv:2509.21022`  `cs.LG`  
  _Donghyeon Ki, Hee-Jun Ahn, Kyungyoon Kim, Byung-Jun Lee_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Actor-critic methods constitute a central paradigm in reinforcement learning (RL), coupling policy evaluation with policy improvement. While effective across many domains, these methods rely on separate actor and critic networks, which makes training vulnerable to architectural decisions and hyperparameter tuning. Such complexity limits their scalability in settings that require large function approximators. Recently, diffusion models have recently been proposed as expressive policies that capture multi-modal behaviors and improve exploration, but they introduce additional design choices and computational burdens, hindering efficient deployment. We introduce Actor-Critic without Actor (ACA), a lightweight framework that eliminates the explicit actor network and instead generates actions directly from the gradient field of a noise-level critic. This design removes the algorithmic and computational overhead of actor training while keeping policy improvement tightly aligned with the critic's latest value estimates. Moreover, ACA retains the ability to capture diverse, multi-modal behaviors without relying on diffusion-based actors, combining simplicity with expressiveness. Through extensive experiments on standard online RL benchmarks,ACA achieves more favorable learning curves and competitive performance compared to both standard actor-critic and state-of-the-art diffusion-based methods, providing a simple yet powerful solution for online RL.

- **[Causal Time Series Generation via Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20846)**  `arXiv:2509.20846`  `cs.LG`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Time series generation (TSG) synthesizes realistic sequences and has achieved remarkable success. Among TSG, conditional models generate sequences given observed covariates, however, such models learn observational correlations without considering unobserved confounding. In this work, we propose a causal perspective on conditional TSG and introduce causal time series generation as a new TSG task family, formalized within Pearl's causal ladder, extending beyond observational generation to include interventional and counterfactual settings. To instantiate these tasks, we develop CaTSG, a unified diffusion-based framework with backdoor-adjusted guidance that causally steers sampling toward desired interventions and individual counterfactuals while preserving observational fidelity. Specifically, our method derives causal score functions via backdoor adjustment and the abduction-action-prediction procedure, thus enabling principled support for all three levels of TSG. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets show that CaTSG achieves superior fidelity and also supporting interventional and counterfactual generation that existing baselines cannot handle. Overall, we propose the causal TSG family and instantiate it with CaTSG, providing an initial proof-of-concept and opening a promising direction toward more reliable simulation under interventions and counterfactual generation.

- **[T2I-Diff: fMRI Signal Generation via Time-Frequency Image Transform and Classifier-Free Denoising Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20822)**  `arXiv:2509.20822`  `cs.LG`  
  _Hwa Hui Tew, Junn Yong Loo, Yee-Fan Tan, Xinyu Tang, Hernando Ombao, Fuad Noman, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) is an advanced neuroimaging method that enables in-depth analysis of brain activity by measuring dynamic changes in the blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signals. However, the resource-intensive nature of fMRI data acquisition limits the availability of high-fidelity samples required for data-driven brain analysis models. While modern generative models can synthesize fMRI data, they often underperform because they overlook the complex non-stationarity and nonlinear BOLD dynamics. To address these challenges, we introduce T2I-Diff, an fMRI generation framework that leverages time-frequency representation of BOLD signals and classifier-free denoising diffusion. Specifically, our framework first converts BOLD signals into windowed spectrograms via a time-dependent Fourier transform, capturing both the underlying temporal dynamics and spectral evolution. Subsequently, a classifier-free diffusion model is trained to generate class-conditioned frequency spectrograms, which are then reverted to BOLD signals via inverse Fourier transforms. Finally, we validate the efficacy of our approach by demonstrating improved accuracy and generalization in downstream fMRI-based brain network classification.

- **[Local Mechanisms of Compositional Generalization in Conditional Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16447)**  `arXiv:2509.16447`  `cs.LG`  
  _Arwen Bradley_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Conditional diffusion models appear capable of compositional generalization, i.e., generating convincing samples for out-of-distribution combinations of conditioners, but the mechanisms underlying this ability remain unclear. To make this concrete, we study length generalization, the ability to generate images with more objects than seen during training. In a controlled CLEVR setting (Johnson et al., 2017), we find that length generalization is achievable in some cases but not others, suggesting that models only sometimes learn the underlying compositional structure. We then investigate locality as a structural mechanism for compositional generalization. Prior works proposed score locality as a mechanism for creativity in unconditional diffusion models (Kamb & Ganguli, 2024; Niedoba et al., 2024), but did not address flexible conditioning or compositional generalization. In this paper, we prove an exact equivalence between a specific compositional structure ("conditional projective composition") (Bradley et al., 2025) and scores with sparse dependencies on both pixels and conditioners ("local conditional scores"). This theory also extends to feature-space compositionality. We validate our theory empirically: CLEVR models that succeed at length generalization exhibit local conditional scores, while those that fail do not. Furthermore, we show that a causal intervention explicitly enforcing local conditional scores restores length generalization in a previously failing model. Finally, we investigate feature-space compositionality in color-conditioned CLEVR, and find preliminary evidence of compositional structure in SDXL.

- **[MDPO: Overcoming the Training-Inference Divide of Masked Diffusion Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13148)**  `arXiv:2508.13148`  `cs.LG`  
  _Haoyu He, Katrin Renz, Yong Cao, Andreas Geiger_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Diffusion language models, as a promising alternative to traditional autoregressive (AR) models, enable faster generation and richer conditioning on bidirectional context. However, they suffer from a key discrepancy between training and inference: during inference, MDLMs progressively reveal the structure of the generated sequence by producing fewer and fewer masked tokens, whereas this structure is ignored in training as tokens are masked at random. Although this discrepancy between training and inference can lead to suboptimal performance, it has been largely overlooked by previous works, leaving closing this gap between the two stages an open problem. To address this, we frame the problem of learning effective denoising trajectories as a sequential decision-making problem and use the resulting framework to apply reinforcement learning. We propose a novel Masked Diffusion Policy Optimization (MDPO) to exploit the Markov property diffusion possesses and explicitly train the model under the same progressive refining schedule used at inference. MDPO matches the performance of the previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) method with 60x fewer gradient updates, while achieving average improvements of 9.6% on MATH500 and 54.2% on Countdown over SOTA when trained within the same number of weight updates. Additionally, we improve the remasking strategy of MDLMs as a plug-in inference replacement to overcome the limitation that the model cannot refine tokens flexibly. This training-free method, termed Running Confidence Remasking (RCR), consistently enhances performance and provides further improvements when used with MDPO. Our findings establish great potential for investigating the discrepancy between pre-training and inference of MDLMs. Code:this https URL. Project Page:this https URL.

- **[Does FLUX Already Know How to Perform Physically Plausible Image Composition?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21278)**  `arXiv:2509.21278`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI` `cs.LG`  
  _Shilin Lu, Zhuming Lian, Zihan Zhou, Shaocong Zhang, Chen Zhao, Adams Wai-Kin Kong_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Image composition aims to seamlessly insert a user-specified object into a new scene, but existing models struggle with complex lighting (e.g., accurate shadows, water reflections) and diverse, high-resolution inputs. Modern text-to-image diffusion models (e.g., SD3.5, FLUX) already encode essential physical and resolution priors, yet lack a framework to unleash them without resorting to latent inversion, which often locks object poses into contextually inappropriate orientations, or brittle attention surgery. We propose SHINE, a training-free framework for Seamless, High-fidelity Insertion with Neutralized Errors. SHINE introduces manifold-steered anchor loss, leveraging pretrained customization adapters (e.g., IP-Adapter) to guide latents for faithful subject representation while preserving background integrity. Degradation-suppression guidance and adaptive background blending are proposed to further eliminate low-quality outputs and visible seams. To address the lack of rigorous benchmarks, we introduce ComplexCompo, featuring diverse resolutions and challenging conditions such as low lighting, strong illumination, intricate shadows, and reflective surfaces. Experiments on ComplexCompo and DreamEditBench show state-of-the-art performance on standard metrics (e.g., DINOv2) and human-aligned scores (e.g., DreamSim, ImageReward, VisionReward). Code and benchmark will be publicly available upon publication.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recently remarkable progress has been made in synthesizing realistic human photos using text-to-image diffusion models. However, current approaches face degraded scenes, insufficient control, and suboptimal perceptual identity. We introduce CustomEnhancer, a novel framework to augment existing identity customization models. CustomEnhancer is a zero-shot enhancement pipeline that leverages face swapping techniques, pretrained diffusion model, to obtain additional representations in a zeroshot manner for encoding into personalized models. Through our proposed triple-flow fused PerGeneration approach, which identifies and combines two compatible counter-directional latent spaces to manipulate a pivotal space of personalized model, we unify the generation and reconstruction processes, realizing generation from three flows. Our pipeline also enables comprehensive training-free control over the generation process of personalized models, offering precise controlled personalization for them and eliminating the need for controller retraining for per-model. Besides, to address the high time complexity of null-text inversion (NTI), we introduce ResInversion, a novel inversion method that performs noise rectification via a pre-diffusion mechanism, reducing the inversion time by 129 times. Experiments demonstrate that CustomEnhancer reach SOTA results at scene diversity, identity fidelity, training-free controls, while also showing the efficiency of our ResInversion over NTI. The code will be made publicly available upon paper acceptance.

  _Fangqiu Yi, Jingyu Xu, Jiawei Shao, Chi Zhang, Xuelong Li_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Perceptual studies demonstrate that conditional diffusion models excel at reconstructing video content aligned with human visual perception. Building on this insight, we propose a video compression framework that leverages conditional diffusion models for perceptually optimized reconstruction. Specifically, we reframe video compression as a conditional generation task, where a generative model synthesizes video from sparse, yet informative signals. Our approach introduces three key modules: (1) Multi-granular conditioning that captures both static scene structure and dynamic spatio-temporal cues; (2) Compact representations designed for efficient transmission without sacrificing semantic richness; (3) Multi-condition training with modality dropout and role-aware embeddings, which prevent over-reliance on any single modality and enhance robustness. Extensive experiments show that our method significantly outperforms both traditional and neural codecs on perceptual quality metrics such as Fr√©chet Video Distance (FVD) and LPIPS, especially under high compression ratios.

  Despite remarkable progress in Text-to-Image models, many real-world applications require generating coherent image sets with diverse consistency requirements. Existing consistent methods often focus on a specific domain with specific aspects of consistency, which significantly constrains their generalizability to broader applications. In this paper, we propose a more challenging problem, Text-to-ImageSet (T2IS) generation, which aims to generate sets of images that meet various consistency requirements based on user instructions. To systematically study this problem, we first introduce $\textbf{T2IS-Bench}$ with 596 diverse instructions across 26 subcategories, providing comprehensive coverage for T2IS generation. Building on this, we propose $\textbf{T2IS-Eval}$, an evaluation framework that transforms user instructions into multifaceted assessment criteria and employs effective evaluators to adaptively assess consistency fulfillment between criteria and generated sets. Subsequently, we propose $\textbf{AutoT2IS}$, a training-free framework that maximally leverages pretrained Diffusion Transformers' in-context capabilities to harmonize visual elements to satisfy both image-level prompt alignment and set-level visual consistency. Extensive experiments on T2IS-Bench reveal that diverse consistency challenges all existing methods, while our AutoT2IS significantly outperforms current generalized and even specialized approaches. Our method also demonstrates the ability to enable numerous underexplored real-world applications, confirming its substantial practical value. Visit our project inthis https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recently, the application of deep learning in image colorization has received widespread attention. The maturation of diffusion models has further advanced the development of image colorization models. However, current mainstream image colorization models still face issues such as color bleeding and color binding errors, and cannot colorize images at the instance level. In this paper, we propose a diffusion-based colorization method MT-Color to achieve precise instance-aware colorization with use-provided guidance. To tackle color bleeding issue, we design a pixel-level mask attention mechanism that integrates latent features and conditional gray image features through cross-attention. We use segmentation masks to construct cross-attention masks, preventing pixel information from exchanging between different instances. We also introduce an instance mask and text guidance module that extracts instance masks and text representations of each instance, which are then fused with latent features through self-attention, utilizing instance masks to form self-attention masks to prevent instance texts from guiding the colorization of other areas, thus mitigating color binding errors. Furthermore, we apply a multi-instance sampling strategy, which involves sampling each instance region separately and then fusing the results. Additionally, we have created a specialized dataset for instance-level colorization tasks, GPT-color, by leveraging large visual language models on existing image datasets. Qualitative and quantitative experiments show that our model and dataset outperform previous methods and datasets.

- **[Dense Semantic Matching with VGGT Prior](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21263)**  `arXiv:2509.21263`  `cs.CV`  
  _Songlin Yang, Tianyi Wei, Yushi Lan, Zeqi Xiao, Anyi Rao, Xingang Pan_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Semantic matching aims to establish pixel-level correspondences between instances of the same category and represents a fundamental task in computer vision. Existing approaches suffer from two limitations: (i) Geometric Ambiguity: Their reliance on 2D foundation model features (e.g., Stable Diffusion, DINO) often fails to disambiguate symmetric structures, requiring extra fine-tuning yet lacking generalization; (ii) Nearest-Neighbor Rule: Their pixel-wise matching ignores cross-image invisibility and neglects manifold preservation. These challenges call for geometry-aware pixel descriptors and holistic dense correspondence mechanisms. Inspired by recent advances in 3D geometric foundation models, we turn to VGGT, which provides geometry-grounded features and holistic dense matching capabilities well aligned with these needs. However, directly transferring VGGT is challenging, as it was originally designed for geometry matching within cross views of a single instance, misaligned with cross-instance semantic matching, and further hindered by the scarcity of dense semantic annotations. To address this, we propose an approach that (i) retains VGGT's intrinsic strengths by reusing early feature stages, fine-tuning later ones, and adding a semantic head for bidirectional correspondences; and (ii) adapts VGGT to the semantic matching scenario under data scarcity through cycle-consistent training strategy, synthetic data augmentation, and progressive training recipe with aliasing artifact mitigation.

  Generating videos guided by camera trajectories poses significant challenges in achieving consistency and generalizability, particularly when both camera and object motions are present. Existing approaches often attempt to learn these motions separately, which may lead to confusion regarding the relative motion between the camera and the objects. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach that integrates both camera and object motions by converting them into the motion of corresponding pixels. Utilizing a stable diffusion network, we effectively learn reference motion maps in relation to the specified camera trajectory. These maps, along with an extracted semantic object prior, are then fed into an image-to-video network to generate the desired video that can accurately follow the designated camera trajectory while maintaining consistent object motions. Extensive experiments verify that our model outperforms SOTA methods by a large margin.

  We propose a novel architecture UniTransfer, which introduces both spatial and diffusion timestep decomposition in a progressive paradigm, achieving precise and controllable video concept transfer. Specifically, in terms of spatial decomposition, we decouple videos into three key components: the foreground subject, the background, and the motion flow. Building upon this decomposed formulation, we further introduce a dual-to-single-stream DiT-based architecture for supporting fine-grained control over different components in the videos. We also introduce a self-supervised pretraining strategy based on random masking to enhance the decomposed representation learning from large-scale unlabeled video data. Inspired by the Chain-of-Thought reasoning paradigm, we further revisit the denoising diffusion process and propose a Chain-of-Prompt (CoP) mechanism to achieve the timestep decomposition. We decompose the denoising process into three stages of different granularity and leverage large language models (LLMs) for stage-specific instructions to guide the generation progressively. We also curate an animal-centric video dataset called OpenAnimal to facilitate the advancement and benchmarking of research in video concept transfer. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves high-quality and controllable video concept transfer across diverse reference images and scenes, surpassing existing baselines in both visual fidelity and editability.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Text-to-image models exhibit remarkable capabilities in image generation. However, they also pose safety risks of generating harmful content. A key challenge of existing concept erasure methods is the precise removal of target concepts while minimizing degradation of image quality. In this paper, we propose Single Neuron-based Concept Erasure (SNCE), a novel approach that can precisely prevent harmful content generation by manipulating only a single neuron. Specifically, we train a Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) to map text embeddings into a sparse, disentangled latent space, where individual neurons align tightly with atomic semantic concepts. To accurately locate neurons responsible for harmful concepts, we design a novel neuron identification method based on the modulated frequency scoring of activation patterns. By suppressing activations of the harmful concept-specific neuron, SNCE achieves surgical precision in concept erasure with minimal disruption to image quality. Experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate that SNCE achieves state-of-the-art results in target concept erasure, while preserving the model's generation capabilities for non-target concepts. Additionally, our method exhibits strong robustness against adversarial attacks, significantly outperforming existing methods.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Generating physically plausible human motion is crucial for applications such as character animation and virtual reality. Existing approaches often incorporate a simulator-based motion projection layer to the diffusion process to enforce physical plausibility. However, such methods are computationally expensive due to the sequential nature of the simulator, which prevents parallelization. We show that simulator-based motion projection can be interpreted as a form of guidance, either classifier-based or classifier-free, within the diffusion process. Building on this insight, we propose SimDiff, a Simulator-constrained Diffusion Model that integrates environment parameters (e.g., gravity, wind) directly into the denoising process. By conditioning on these parameters, SimDiff generates physically plausible motions efficiently, without repeated simulator calls at inference, and also provides fine-grained control over different physical coefficients. Moreover, SimDiff successfully generalizes to unseen combinations of environmental parameters, demonstrating compositional generalization.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Text-to-image diffusion models have made significant progress in image generation, allowing for effortless customized generation. However, existing image editing methods still face certain limitations when dealing with personalized image composition tasks. First, there is the issue of lack of geometric control over the inserted objects. Current methods are confined to 2D space and typically rely on textual instructions, making it challenging to maintain precise geometric control over the objects. Second, there is the challenge of style consistency. Existing methods often overlook the style consistency between the inserted object and the background, resulting in a lack of realism. In addition, the challenge of inserting objects into images without extensive training remains significant. To address these issues, we propose \textit{FreeInsert}, a novel training-free framework that customizes object insertion into arbitrary scenes by leveraging 3D geometric information. Benefiting from the advances in existing 3D generation models, we first convert the 2D object into 3D, perform interactive editing at the 3D level, and then re-render it into a 2D image from a specified view. This process introduces geometric controls such as shape or view. The rendered image, serving as geometric control, is combined with style and content control achieved through diffusion adapters, ultimately producing geometrically controlled, style-consistent edited images via the diffusion model.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce Seedream 4.0, an efficient and high-performance multimodal image generation system that unifies text-to-image (T2I) synthesis, image editing, and multi-image composition within a single framework. We develop a highly efficient diffusion transformer with a powerful VAE which also can reduce the number of image tokens considerably. This allows for efficient training of our model, and enables it to fast generate native high-resolution images (e.g., 1K-4K). Seedream 4.0 is pretrained on billions of text-image pairs spanning diverse taxonomies and knowledge-centric concepts. Comprehensive data collection across hundreds of vertical scenarios, coupled with optimized strategies, ensures stable and large-scale training, with strong generalization. By incorporating a carefully fine-tuned VLM model, we perform multi-modal post-training for training both T2I and image editing tasks jointly. For inference acceleration, we integrate adversarial distillation, distribution matching, and quantization, as well as speculative decoding. It achieves an inference time of up to 1.8 seconds for generating a 2K image (without a LLM/VLM as PE model). Comprehensive evaluations reveal that Seedream 4.0 can achieve state-of-the-art results on both T2I and multimodal image editing. In particular, it demonstrates exceptional multimodal capabilities in complex tasks, including precise image editing and in-context reasoning, and also allows for multi-image reference, and can generate multiple output images. This extends traditional T2I systems into an more interactive and multidimensional creative tool, pushing the boundary of generative AI for both creativity and professional applications.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The reliance on implicit point matching via attention has become a core bottleneck in drag-based editing, resulting in a fundamental compromise on weakened inversion strength and costly test-time optimization (TTO). This compromise severely limits the generative capabilities of diffusion models, suppressing high-fidelity inpainting and text-guided creation. In this paper, we introduce LazyDrag, the first drag-based image editing method for Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformers, which directly eliminates the reliance on implicit point matching. In concrete terms, our method generates an explicit correspondence map from user drag inputs as a reliable reference to boost the attention control. This reliable reference opens the potential for a stable full-strength inversion process, which is the first in the drag-based editing task. It obviates the necessity for TTO and unlocks the generative capability of models. Therefore, LazyDrag naturally unifies precise geometric control with text guidance, enabling complex edits that were previously out of reach: opening the mouth of a dog and inpainting its interior, generating new objects like a ``tennis ball'', or for ambiguous drags, making context-aware changes like moving a hand into a pocket. Additionally, LazyDrag supports multi-round workflows with simultaneous move and scale operations. Evaluated on the DragBench, our method outperforms baselines in drag accuracy and perceptual quality, as validated by VIEScore and human evaluation. LazyDrag not only establishes new state-of-the-art performance, but also paves a new way to editing paradigms.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Human shape editing enables controllable transformation of a person's body shape, such as thin, muscular, or overweight, while preserving pose, identity, clothing, and background. Unlike human pose editing, which has advanced rapidly, shape editing remains relatively under-explored. Current approaches typically rely on 3D morphable models or image warping, often introducing unrealistic body proportions, texture distortions, and background inconsistencies due to alignment errors and deformations. A key limitation is the lack of large-scale, publicly available datasets for training and evaluating body shape manipulation methods. In this work, we introduce the first large-scale dataset of 18,573 images across 1523 subjects, specifically designed for controlled human shape editing. It features diverse variations in body shape, including fat, muscular and thin, captured under consistent identity, clothing, and background conditions. Using this dataset, we propose Odo, an end-to-end diffusion-based method that enables realistic and intuitive body reshaping guided by simple semantic attributes. Our approach combines a frozen UNet that preserves fine-grained appearance and background details from the input image with a ControlNet that guides shape transformation using target SMPL depth maps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms prior approaches, achieving per-vertex reconstruction errors as low as 7.5mm, significantly lower than the 13.6mm observed in baseline methods, while producing realistic results that accurately match the desired target shapes.

  An important challenge when using computer vision models in the real world is to evaluate their performance in potential out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. While simple synthetic corruptions are commonly applied to test OOD robustness, they often fail to capture nuisance shifts that occur in the real world. Recently, diffusion models have been applied to generate realistic images for benchmarking, but they are restricted to binary nuisance shifts. In this work, we introduce CNS-Bench, a Continuous Nuisance Shift Benchmark to quantify OOD robustness of image classifiers for continuous and realistic generative nuisance shifts. CNS-Bench allows generating a wide range of individual nuisance shifts in continuous severities by applying LoRA adapters to diffusion models. To address failure cases, we propose a filtering mechanism that outperforms previous methods, thereby enabling reliable benchmarking with generative models. With the proposed benchmark, we perform a large-scale study to evaluate the robustness of more than 40 classifiers under various nuisance shifts. Through carefully designed comparisons and analyses, we find that model rankings can change for varying shifts and shift scales, which cannot be captured when applying common binary shifts. Additionally, we show that evaluating the model performance on a continuous scale allows the identification of model failure points, providing a more nuanced understanding of model robustness.

  We introduce MMaDA, a novel class of multimodal diffusion foundation models designed to achieve superior performance across diverse domains such as textual reasoning, multimodal understanding, and text-to-image generation. The approach is distinguished by three key innovations: (i) MMaDA adopts a unified diffusion architecture with a shared probabilistic formulation and a modality-agnostic design, eliminating the need for modality-specific components. This architecture ensures seamless integration and processing across different data types. (ii) We implement a mixed long chain-of-thought (CoT) fine-tuning strategy that curates a unified CoT format across modalities. By aligning reasoning processes between textual and visual domains, this strategy facilitates cold-start training for the final reinforcement learning (RL) stage, thereby enhancing the model's ability to handle complex tasks from the outset. (iii) We propose UniGRPO, a unified policy-gradient-based RL algorithm specifically tailored for diffusion foundation models. Utilizing diversified reward modeling, UniGRPO unifies post-training across both reasoning and generation tasks, ensuring consistent performance improvements. Experimental results demonstrate that MMaDA-8B exhibits strong generalization capabilities as a unified multimodal foundation model. It surpasses powerful models like LLaMA-3-7B and Qwen2-7B in textual reasoning, outperforms Show-o and SEED-X in multimodal understanding, and excels over SDXL and Janus in text-to-image generation. These achievements highlight MMaDA's effectiveness in bridging the gap between pretraining and post-training within unified diffusion architectures, providing a comprehensive framework for future research and development.

  Establishing reliable correspondences is crucial for all registration tasks, including 2D image registration, 3D point cloud registration, and 2D-3D image-to-point cloud registration. However, these tasks are often complicated by challenges such as scale inconsistencies, symmetry, and large deformations, which can lead to ambiguous matches. Previous feature-based and correspondence-based methods typically rely on geometric or semantic features to generate or polish initial potential correspondences. Some methods typically leverage specific geometric priors, such as topological preservation, to devise diverse and innovative strategies tailored to a given enhancement goal, which cannot be exhaustively enumerated. Additionally, many previous approaches rely on a single-step prediction head, which can struggle with local minima in complex matching scenarios. To address these challenges, we introduce an innovative paradigm that leverages a diffusion model in matrix space for robust matching matrix estimation. Our model treats correspondence estimation as a denoising diffusion process in the matching matrix space, gradually refining the intermediate matching matrix to the optimal one. Specifically, we apply the diffusion model in the doubly stochastic matrix space for 3D-3D and 2D-3D registration tasks. In the 2D image registration task, we deploy the diffusion model in a matrix subspace where dual-softmax projection regularization is applied. For all three registration tasks, we provide adaptive matching matrix embedding implementations tailored to the specific characteristics of each task while maintaining a consistent "match-to-warp" encoding pattern. Furthermore, we adopt a lightweight design for the denoising module. In inference, once points or image features are extracted and fixed, this module performs multi-step denoising predictions through reverse sampling.

  The escalating demand for real-time image synthesis has driven significant advancements in one-step diffusion models, which inherently offer expedited generation speeds compared to traditional multi-step methods. However, this enhanced efficiency is frequently accompanied by a compromise in the controllability of image attributes. While negative prompting, typically implemented via classifier-free guidance (CFG), has proven effective for fine-grained control in multi-step models, its application to one-step generators remains largely unaddressed. Due to the lack of iterative refinement, as in multi-step diffusion, directly applying CFG to one-step generation leads to blending artifacts and diminished output quality. To fill this gap, we introduce \textbf{N}egative-\textbf{A}way \textbf{S}teer \textbf{A}ttention (NASA), an efficient method that integrates negative prompts into one-step diffusion models. NASA operates within the intermediate representation space by leveraging cross-attention mechanisms to suppress undesired visual attributes. This strategy avoids the blending artifacts inherent in output-space guidance and achieves high efficiency, incurring only a minimal 1.89\% increase in FLOPs compared to the computational doubling of CFG. Furthermore, NASA can be seamlessly integrated into existing timestep distillation frameworks, enhancing the student's output quality. Experimental results demonstrate that NASA substantially improves controllability and output quality, achieving an HPSv2 score of \textbf{31.21}, setting a new state-of-the-art benchmark for one-step diffusion models.

  Recently, many text-to-image diffusion models excel at generating high-resolution images from text but struggle with precise control over spatial composition and object counting. To address these challenges, prior works developed layout-to-image (L2I) approaches that incorporate layout instructions into text-to-image models. However, existing L2I methods typically require fine-tuning of pre-trained parameters or training additional control modules for the diffusion models. In this work, we propose a training-free L2I approach, MAC (Marginal Attention Constrained Generation), which eliminates the need for additional modules or fine-tuning. Specifically, we use text-visual cross-attention feature maps to quantify inconsistencies between the layout of the generated images and the provided instructions, and then compute loss functions to optimize latent features during the diffusion reverse process. To enhance spatial controllability and mitigate semantic failures in complex layout instructions, we leverage pixel-to-pixel correlations in the self-attention feature maps to align cross-attention maps and combine three loss functions constrained by boundary attention to update latent features. Comprehensive experimental results on both L2I and non-L2I pretrained diffusion models demonstrate that our method outperforms existing training-free L2I techniques both quantitatively and qualitatively in terms of image composition on the DrawBench and HRS benchmarks.

  Autoregressive language models (ARMs) deliver strong likelihoods, but are inherently serial: they generate one token per forward pass, which limits throughput and inflates latency for long sequences. Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) parallelize across positions and thus appear promising for language generation, yet standard discrete diffusion typically needs hundreds to thousands of model evaluations to reach high quality, trading serial depth for iterative breadth. We introduce FS-DFM, Few-Step Discrete Flow-Matching. A discrete flow-matching model designed for speed without sacrificing quality. The core idea is simple: make the number of sampling steps an explicit parameter and train the model to be consistent across step budgets, so one big move lands where many small moves would. We pair this with a reliable update rule that moves probability in the right direction without overshooting, and with strong teacher guidance distilled from long-run trajectories. Together, these choices make few-step sampling stable, accurate, and easy to control. On language modeling benchmarks, FS-DFM with 8 sampling steps achieves perplexity parity with a 1,024-step discrete-flow baseline for generating 1,024 tokens using a similar-size model, delivering up to 128 times faster sampling and corresponding latency/throughput gains.

  Homonyms are words with identical spelling but distinct meanings, which pose challenges for many generative models. When a homonym appears in a prompt, diffusion models may generate multiple senses of the word simultaneously, which is known as homonym duplication. This issue is further complicated by an Anglocentric bias, which includes an additional translation step before the text-to-image model pipeline. As a result, even words that are not homonymous in the original language may become homonyms and lose their meaning after translation into English. In this paper, we introduce a method for measuring duplication rates and conduct evaluations of different diffusion models using both automatic evaluation utilizing Vision-Language Models (VLM) and human evaluation. Additionally, we investigate methods to mitigate the homonym duplication problem through prompt expansion, demonstrating that this approach also effectively reduces duplication related to Anglocentric bias. The code for the automatic evaluation pipeline is publicly available.

  Diffusion models have recently shown strong potential in language modeling, offering faster generation compared to traditional autoregressive approaches. However, applying supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to diffusion models remains challenging, as they lack precise probability estimates at each denoising step. While the diffusion mechanism enables the model to reason over entire sequences, it also makes the generation process less predictable and often inconsistent. This highlights the importance of controlling key tokens that guide the direction of generation. To address this issue, we propose WeFT, a weighted SFT method for diffusion language models, where tokens are assigned different weights based on their entropy. Derived from diffusion theory, WeFT delivers substantial gains: training on s1K, s1K-1.1, and 3k samples from open-r1, it achieves relative improvements of 39%, 64%, and 83% over standard SFT on four widely used reasoning benchmarks (Sudoku, Countdown, GSM8K, and MATH-500). The code and models will be made publicly available.

  Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have attracted significant interest in extending their capabilities to multimodal scenarios, particularly for speech-to-speech conversational systems. However, existing multimodal models handling interleaved audio and text rely on autoregressive methods, overlooking that text depends on target-target relations whereas audio depends mainly on source-target relations. In this work, we propose Text-to-Talk (TtT), a unified audio-text framework that integrates autoregressive (AR) text generation with non-autoregressive (NAR) audio diffusion in a single Transformer. By leveraging the any-order autoregressive property of absorbing discrete diffusion, our approach provides a unified training objective for text and audio. To support this hybrid generation paradigm, we design a modality-aware attention mechanism that enforces causal decoding for text while allowing bidirectional modeling within audio spans, and further introduce three training strategies that reduce train-test discrepancies. During inference, TtT employs block-wise diffusion to synthesize audio in parallel while flexibly handling variable-length outputs. Extensive experiments across Audio-QA and ASR tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, with detailed ablation studies validating each proposed component. We will open-source our models, data and code to facilitate future research in this direction.

  Object manipulation is a common component of everyday tasks, but learning to manipulate objects from high-dimensional observations presents significant challenges. These challenges are heightened in multi-object environments due to the combinatorial complexity of the state space as well as of the desired behaviors. While recent approaches have utilized large-scale offline data to train models from pixel observations, achieving performance gains through scaling, these methods struggle with compositional generalization in unseen object configurations with constrained network and dataset sizes. To address these issues, we propose a novel behavioral cloning (BC) approach that leverages object-centric representations and an entity-centric Transformer with diffusion-based optimization, enabling efficient learning from offline image data. Our method first decomposes observations into an object-centric representation, which is then processed by our entity-centric Transformer that computes attention at the object level, simultaneously predicting object dynamics and the agent's actions. Combined with the ability of diffusion models to capture multi-modal behavior distributions, this results in substantial performance improvements in multi-object tasks and, more importantly, enables compositional generalization. We present BC agents capable of zero-shot generalization to tasks with novel compositions of objects and goals, including larger numbers of objects than seen during training.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We study reasoning tasks through a framework that integrates auto-regressive (AR) and non-autoregressive (NAR) language models. AR models, which generate text sequentially, excel at producing coherent outputs but often suffer from slow inference, particularly in reasoning-intensive domains such as mathematics and code, where lengthy chains of thought are required. In contrast, NAR models, such as discrete diffusion models, allow parallel generation and offer substantial speedups, though typically at the cost of reduced output quality. To address these limitations, we introduce a new paradigm in which an NAR model efficiently produces intermediate reasoning traces, which subsequently guide an AR model to deliver precise final answers. Experiments demonstrate that our approach yields significant 26% improvements over strong baselines while substantially reducing inference cost.
