- **[Tactile-Conditioned Diffusion Policy for Force-Aware Robotic Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13324)**  `arXiv:2510.13324`  `cs.RO`

  Contact-rich manipulation depends on applying the correct grasp forces throughout the manipulation task, especially when handling fragile or deformable objects. Most existing imitation learning approaches often treat visuotactile feedback only as an additional observation, leaving applied forces as an uncontrolled consequence of gripper commands. In this work, we present Force-Aware Robotic Manipulation (FARM), an imitation learning framework that integrates high-dimensional tactile data to infer tactile-conditioned force signals, which in turn define a matching force-based action space. We collect human demonstrations using a modified version of the handheld Universal Manipulation Interface (UMI) gripper that integrates a GelSight Mini visual tactile sensor. For deploying the learned policies, we developed an actuated variant of the UMI gripper with geometry matching our handheld version. During policy rollouts, the proposed FARM diffusion policy jointly predicts robot pose, grip width, and grip force. FARM outperforms several baselines across three tasks with distinct force requirements -- high-force, low-force, and dynamic force adaptation -- demonstrating the advantages of its two key components: leveraging force-grounded, high-dimensional tactile observations and a force-based control space. The codebase and design files are open-sourced and available atthis https URL.

- **[MTIL: Encoding Full History with Mamba for Temporal Imitation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12410)**  `arXiv:2505.12410`  `cs.RO`  
  _Yulin Zhou, Yuankai Lin, Fanzhe Peng, Jiahui Chen, Kaiji Huang, Hua Yang, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Standard imitation learning (IL) methods have achieved considerable success in robotics, yet often rely on the Markov assumption, which falters in long-horizon tasks where history is crucial for resolving perceptual ambiguity. This limitation stems not only from a conceptual gap but also from a fundamental computational barrier: prevailing architectures like Transformers are often constrained by quadratic complexity, rendering the processing of long, high-dimensional observation sequences infeasible. To overcome this dual challenge, we introduce Mamba Temporal Imitation Learning (MTIL). Our approach represents a new paradigm for robotic learning, which we frame as a practical synthesis of World Model and Dynamical System concepts. By leveraging the linear-time recurrent dynamics of State Space Models (SSMs), MTIL learns an implicit, action-oriented world model that efficiently encodes the entire trajectory history into a compressed, evolving state. This allows the policy to be conditioned on a comprehensive temporal context, transcending the confines of Markovian approaches. Through extensive experiments on simulated benchmarks (ACT, Robomimic, LIBERO) and on challenging real-world tasks, MTIL demonstrates superior performance against SOTA methods like ACT and Diffusion Policy, particularly in resolving long-term temporal ambiguities. Our findings not only affirm the necessity of full temporal context but also validate MTIL as a powerful and a computationally feasible approach for learning long-horizon, non-Markovian behaviors from high-dimensional observations.

- **[On the Reasoning Abilities of Masked Diffusion Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13117)**  `arXiv:2510.13117`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI` `cs.CL`  
  _Anej Svete, Ashish Sabharwal_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Masked diffusion models (MDMs) for text offer a compelling alternative to traditional autoregressive language models. Parallel generation makes them efficient, but their computational capabilities and the limitations inherent to their parallelism remain largely unexplored. To this end, we characterize what types of reasoning problems MDMs can provably solve and how efficiently. We do this by connecting MDMs to the well-understood reasoning frameworks of chain of thought (CoT) and padded looped transformers (PLTs) in the finite-precision log-width setting: We show that MDMs and polynomially-padded PLTs are, in fact, equivalent in this setting, and that MDMs can solve all problems that CoT-augmented transformers can. Moreover, we showcase classes of problems (including regular languages) for which MDMs are inherently more efficient than CoT transformers, where parallel generation allows for substantially faster reasoning.

- **[Manifold Decoders: A Framework for Generative Modeling from Nonlinear Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13622)**  `arXiv:2510.13622`  `cs.LG`  
  _Riddhish Thakare, Kingdom Mutala Akugri_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Classical nonlinear dimensionality reduction (NLDR) techniques like t-SNE, Isomap, and LLE excel at creating low-dimensional embeddings for data visualization but fundamentally lack the ability to map these embeddings back to the original high-dimensional space. This one-way transformation limits their use in generative applications. This paper addresses this critical gap by introducing a system- atic framework for constructing neural decoder architectures for prominent NLDR methods, enabling bidirectional mapping for the first time. We extend this framework by implementing a diffusion-based generative process that operates directly within these learned manifold spaces. Through experiments on the CelebA dataset, we evaluate the reconstruction and generative performance of our approach against autoencoder and standard diffusion model baselines. Our findings reveal a fundamental trade- off: while the decoders successfully reconstruct data, their quality is surpassed by end-to-end optimized autoencoders. Moreover, manifold-constrained diffusion yields poor-quality samples, suggesting that the discrete and sparse nature of classical NLDR embeddings is ill-suited for the continuous inter- polation required by generative models. This work highlights the inherent challenges in retrofitting generative capabilities onto NLDR methods designed primarily for visualization and analysis.

- **[Km-scale dynamical downscaling through conformalized latent diffusion models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13301)**  `arXiv:2510.13301`  `cs.LG`  
  _Alessandro Brusaferri, Andrea Ballarino_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Dynamical downscaling is crucial for deriving high-resolution meteorological fields from coarse-scale simulations, enabling detailed analysis for critical applications such as weather forecasting and renewable energy modeling. Generative Diffusion models (DMs) have recently emerged as powerful data-driven tools for this task, offering reconstruction fidelity and more scalable sampling supporting uncertainty quantification. However, DMs lack finite-sample guarantees against overconfident predictions, resulting in miscalibrated grid-point-level uncertainty estimates hindering their reliability in operational contexts. In this work, we tackle this issue by augmenting the downscaling pipeline with a conformal prediction framework. Specifically, the DM's samples are post-processed to derive conditional quantile estimates, incorporated into a conformalized quantile regression procedure targeting locally adaptive prediction intervals with finite-sample marginal validity. The proposed approach is evaluated on ERA5 reanalysis data over Italy, downscaled to a 2-km grid. Results demonstrate grid-point-level uncertainty estimates with markedly improved coverage and stable probabilistic scores relative to the DM baseline, highlighting the potential of conformalized generative models for more trustworthy probabilistic downscaling to high-resolution meteorological fields.

- **[Federated Conditional Conformal Prediction via Generative Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13297)**  `arXiv:2510.13297`  `cs.LG`  
  _Rui Xu, Sihong Xie_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Conformal Prediction (CP) provides distribution-free uncertainty quantification by constructing prediction sets that guarantee coverage of the true labels. This reliability makes CP valuable for high-stakes federated learning scenarios such as multi-center healthcare. However, standard CP assumes i.i.d. data, which is violated in federated settings where client distributions differ substantially. Existing federated CP methods address this by maintaining marginal coverage on each client, but such guarantees often fail to reflect input-conditional uncertainty. In this work, we propose Federated Conditional Conformal Prediction (Fed-CCP) via generative models, which aims for conditional coverage that adapts to local data heterogeneity. Fed-CCP leverages generative models, such as normalizing flows or diffusion models, to approximate conditional data distributions without requiring the sharing of raw data. This enables each client to locally calibrate conformal scores that reflect its unique uncertainty, while preserving global consistency through federated aggregation. Experiments on real datasets demonstrate that Fed-CCP achieves more adaptive prediction sets.

- **[Reference-Specific Unlearning Metrics Can Hide the Truth: A Reality Check](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12981)**  `arXiv:2510.12981`  `cs.LG`  
  _Sungjun Cho, Dasol Hwang, Frederic Sala, Sangheum Hwang, Kyunghyun Cho, Sungmin Cha_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Current unlearning metrics for generative models evaluate success based on reference responses or classifier outputs rather than assessing the core objective: whether the unlearned model behaves indistinguishably from a model that never saw the unwanted data. This reference-specific approach creates systematic blind spots, allowing models to appear successful while retaining unwanted knowledge accessible through alternative prompts or attacks. We address these limitations by proposing Functional Alignment for Distributional Equivalence (FADE), a novel metric that measures distributional similarity between unlearned and reference models by comparing bidirectional likelihood assignments over generated samples. Unlike existing approaches that rely on predetermined references, FADE captures functional alignment across the entire output distribution, providing a principled assessment of genuine unlearning. Our experiments on the TOFU benchmark for LLM unlearning and the UnlearnCanvas benchmark for text-to-image diffusion model unlearning reveal that methods achieving near-optimal scores on traditional metrics fail to achieve distributional equivalence, with many becoming more distant from the gold standard than before unlearning. These findings expose fundamental gaps in current evaluation practices and demonstrate that FADE provides a more robust foundation for developing and assessing truly effective unlearning methods.

- **[D2 Actor Critic: Diffusion Actor Meets Distributional Critic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03508)**  `arXiv:2510.03508`  `cs.LG`  
  _Lunjun Zhang, Shuo Han, Hanrui Lyu, Bradly C Stadie_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce D2AC, a new model-free reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm designed to train expressive diffusion policies online effectively. At its core is a policy improvement objective that avoids the high variance of typical policy gradients and the complexity of backpropagation through time. This stable learning process is critically enabled by our second contribution: a robust distributional critic, which we design through a fusion of distributional RL and clipped double Q-learning. The resulting algorithm is highly effective, achieving state-of-the-art performance on a benchmark of eighteen hard RL tasks, including Humanoid, Dog, and Shadow Hand domains, spanning both dense-reward and goal-conditioned RL scenarios. Beyond standard benchmarks, we also evaluate a biologically motivated predator-prey task to examine the behavioral robustness and generalization capacity of our approach.

- **[CanvasMAR: Improving Masked Autoregressive Video Generation With Canvas](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13669)**  `arXiv:2510.13669`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI` `cs.LG`  
  _Zian Li, Muhan Zhang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Masked autoregressive models (MAR) have recently emerged as a powerful paradigm for image and video generation, combining the flexibility of masked modeling with the potential of continuous tokenizer. However, video MAR models suffer from two major limitations: the slow-start problem, caused by the lack of a structured global prior at early sampling stages, and error accumulation across the autoregression in both spatial and temporal dimensions. In this work, we propose CanvasMAR, a novel video MAR model that mitigates these issues by introducing a canvas mechanism--a blurred, global prediction of the next frame, used as the starting point for masked generation. The canvas provides global structure early in sampling, enabling faster and more coherent frame synthesis. Furthermore, we introduce compositional classifier-free guidance that jointly enlarges spatial (canvas) and temporal conditioning, and employ noise-based canvas augmentation to enhance robustness. Experiments on the BAIR and Kinetics-600 benchmarks demonstrate that CanvasMAR produces high-quality videos with fewer autoregressive steps. Our approach achieves remarkable performance among autoregressive models on Kinetics-600 dataset and rivals diffusion-based methods.

- **[MVCustom: Multi-View Customized Diffusion via Geometric Latent Rendering and Completion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13702)**  `arXiv:2510.13702`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`  
  _Minjung Shin, Hyunin Cho, Sooyeon Go, Jin-Hwa Kim, Youngjung Uh_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multi-view generation with camera pose control and prompt-based customization are both essential elements for achieving controllable generative models. However, existing multi-view generation models do not support customization with geometric consistency, whereas customization models lack explicit viewpoint control, making them challenging to unify. Motivated by these gaps, we introduce a novel task, multi-view customization, which aims to jointly achieve multi-view camera pose control and customization. Due to the scarcity of training data in customization, existing multi-view generation models, which inherently rely on large-scale datasets, struggle to generalize to diverse prompts. To address this, we propose MVCustom, a novel diffusion-based framework explicitly designed to achieve both multi-view consistency and customization fidelity. In the training stage, MVCustom learns the subject's identity and geometry using a feature-field representation, incorporating the text-to-video diffusion backbone enhanced with dense spatio-temporal attention, which leverages temporal coherence for multi-view consistency. In the inference stage, we introduce two novel techniques: depth-aware feature rendering explicitly enforces geometric consistency, and consistent-aware latent completion ensures accurate perspective alignment of the customized subject and surrounding backgrounds. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MVCustom is the only framework that simultaneously achieves faithful multi-view generation and customization.

- **[SceneAdapt: Scene-aware Adaptation of Human Motion Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13044)**  `arXiv:2510.13044`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`  
  _Jungbin Cho, Minsu Kim, Jisoo Kim, Ce Zheng, Laszlo A. Jeni, Ming-Hsuan Yang, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Human motion is inherently diverse and semantically rich, while also shaped by the surrounding scene. However, existing motion generation approaches address either motion semantics or scene-awareness in isolation, since constructing large-scale datasets with both rich text--motion coverage and precise scene interactions is extremely challenging. In this work, we introduce SceneAdapt, a framework that injects scene awareness into text-conditioned motion models by leveraging disjoint scene--motion and text--motion datasets through two adaptation stages: inbetweening and scene-aware inbetweening. The key idea is to use motion inbetweening, learnable without text, as a proxy task to bridge two distinct datasets and thereby inject scene-awareness to text-to-motion models. In the first stage, we introduce keyframing layers that modulate motion latents for inbetweening while preserving the latent manifold. In the second stage, we add a scene-conditioning layer that injects scene geometry by adaptively querying local context through cross-attention. Experimental results show that SceneAdapt effectively injects scene awareness into text-to-motion models, and we further analyze the mechanisms through which this awareness emerges. Code and models will be released.

- **[On Robustness of Vision-Language-Action Model against Multi-Modal Perturbations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00037)**  `arXiv:2510.00037`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`  
  _Jianing Guo, Zhenhong Wu, Chang Tu, Yiyao Ma, Xiangqi Kong, Zhiqian Liu, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, robustness to real-world perturbations is critical for deployment. Existing methods target simple visual disturbances, overlooking the broader multi-modal perturbations that arise in actions, instructions, environments, and observations. Here, we first evaluate the robustness of mainstream VLAs under 17 perturbations across four modalities. We find (1) actions as the most fragile modality, (2) Existing visual-robust VLA do not gain robustness in other modality, and (3) pi0 demonstrates superior robustness with a diffusion-based action head. To build multi-modal robust VLAs, we propose RobustVLA against perturbations in VLA inputs and outputs. For output robustness, we perform offline robust optimization against worst-case action noise that maximizes mismatch in flow matching objective. This can be seen as adversarial training, label smoothing, and outlier penalization. For input robustness, we enforce consistent actions across input variations that preserve task semantics. To account for multiple perturbations, we formulate robustness as a multi-armed bandit problem and apply an upper confidence bound algorithm to automatically identify the most harmful noise. Experiments on LIBERO demonstrate our RobustVLA delivers absolute gains over baselines of 12.6% on the pi0 backbone and 10.4% on the OpenVLA backbone across all 17 perturbations, achieving 50.6x faster inference than existing visual-robust VLAs, and a 10.4% gain under mixed perturbations. Our RobustVLA is particularly effective on real-world FR5 robot with limited demonstrations, showing absolute gains by 65.6% under perturbations of four modalities.

- **[Adaptive Visual Conditioning for Semantic Consistency in Diffusion-Based Story Continuation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13787)**  `arXiv:2510.13787`  `cs.CV`  
  _Seyed Mohammad Mousavi, Morteza Analoui_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Story continuation focuses on generating the next image in a narrative sequence so that it remains coherent with both the ongoing text description and the previously observed images. A central challenge in this setting lies in utilizing prior visual context effectively, while ensuring semantic alignment with the current textual input. In this work, we introduce AVC (Adaptive Visual Conditioning), a framework for diffusion-based story continuation. AVC employs the CLIP model to retrieve the most semantically aligned image from previous frames. Crucially, when no sufficiently relevant image is found, AVC adaptively restricts the influence of prior visuals to only the early stages of the diffusion process. This enables the model to exploit visual context when beneficial, while avoiding the injection of misleading or irrelevant information. Furthermore, we improve data quality by re-captioning a noisy dataset using large language models, thereby strengthening textual supervision and semantic alignment. Quantitative results and human evaluations demonstrate that AVC achieves superior coherence, semantic consistency, and visual fidelity compared to strong baselines, particularly in challenging cases where prior visuals conflict with the current input.

  _Tianshuo Xu, Kai Wang, Zhifei Chen, Leyi Wu, Tianshui Wen, Fei Chao, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Computational replication of Chinese calligraphy remains challenging. Existing methods falter, either creating high-quality isolated characters while ignoring page-level aesthetics like ligatures and spacing, or attempting page synthesis at the expense of calligraphic correctness. We introduce \textbf{UniCalli}, a unified diffusion framework for column-level recognition and generation. Training both tasks jointly is deliberate: recognition constrains the generator to preserve character structure, while generation provides style and layout priors. This synergy fosters concept-level abstractions that improve both tasks, especially in limited-data regimes. We curated a dataset of over 8,000 digitized pieces, with ~4,000 densely annotated. UniCalli employs asymmetric noising and a rasterized box map for spatial priors, trained on a mix of synthetic, labeled, and unlabeled data. The model achieves state-of-the-art generative quality with superior ligature continuity and layout fidelity, alongside stronger recognition. The framework successfully extends to other ancient scripts, including Oracle bone inscriptions and Egyptian hieroglyphs. Code and data can be viewed in \href{this https URL}{this URL}.

- **[Cyclic Self-Supervised Diffusion for Ultra Low-field to High-field MRI Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13735)**  `arXiv:2510.13735`  `cs.CV`  
  _Zhenxuan Zhang, Peiyuan Jing, Zi Wang, Ula Briski, Coraline Beitone, Yue Yang, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Synthesizing high-quality images from low-field MRI holds significant potential. Low-field MRI is cheaper, more accessible, and safer, but suffers from low resolution and poor signal-to-noise ratio. This synthesis process can reduce reliance on costly acquisitions and expand data availability. However, synthesizing high-field MRI still suffers from a clinical fidelity gap. There is a need to preserve anatomical fidelity, enhance fine-grained structural details, and bridge domain gaps in image contrast. To address these issues, we propose a \emph{cyclic self-supervised diffusion (CSS-Diff)} framework for high-field MRI synthesis from real low-field MRI data. Our core idea is to reformulate diffusion-based synthesis under a cycle-consistent constraint. It enforces anatomical preservation throughout the generative process rather than just relying on paired pixel-level supervision. The CSS-Diff framework further incorporates two novel processes. The slice-wise gap perception network aligns inter-slice inconsistencies via contrastive learning. The local structure correction network enhances local feature restoration through self-reconstruction of masked and perturbed patches. Extensive experiments on cross-field synthesis tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, achieving state-of-the-art performance (e.g., 31.80 $\pm$ 2.70 dB in PSNR, 0.943 $\pm$ 0.102 in SSIM, and 0.0864 $\pm$ 0.0689 in LPIPS). Beyond pixel-wise fidelity, our method also preserves fine-grained anatomical structures compared with the original low-field MRI (e.g., left cerebral white matter error drops from 12.1$\%$ to 2.1$\%$, cortex from 4.2$\%$ to 3.7$\%$). To conclude, our CSS-Diff can synthesize images that are both quantitatively reliable and anatomically consistent.

- **[Generating healthy counterfactuals with denoising diffusion bridge models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13684)**  `arXiv:2510.13684`  `cs.CV`  
  _Ana Lawry Aguila, Peirong Liu, Marina Crespo Aguirre, Juan Eugenio Iglesias_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Generating healthy counterfactuals from pathological images holds significant promise in medical imaging, e.g., in anomaly detection or for application of analysis tools that are designed for healthy scans. These counterfactuals should represent what a patient's scan would plausibly look like in the absence of pathology, preserving individual anatomical characteristics while modifying only the pathological regions. Denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) have become popular methods for generating healthy counterfactuals of pathology data. Typically, this involves training on solely healthy data with the assumption that a partial denoising process will be unable to model disease regions and will instead reconstruct a closely matched healthy counterpart. More recent methods have incorporated synthetic pathological images to better guide the diffusion process. However, it remains challenging to guide the generative process in a way that effectively balances the removal of anomalies with the retention of subject-specific features. To solve this problem, we propose a novel application of denoising diffusion bridge models (DDBMs) - which, unlike DDPMs, condition the diffusion process not only on the initial point (i.e., the healthy image), but also on the final point (i.e., a corresponding synthetically generated pathological image). Treating the pathological image as a structurally informative prior enables us to generate counterfactuals that closely match the patient's anatomy while selectively removing pathology. The results show that our DDBM outperforms previously proposed diffusion models and fully supervised approaches at segmentation and anomaly detection tasks.

- **[FlashWorld: High-quality 3D Scene Generation within Seconds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13678)**  `arXiv:2510.13678`  `cs.CV`  
  _Xinyang Li, Tengfei Wang, Zixiao Gu, Shengchuan Zhang, Chunchao Guo, Liujuan Cao_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We propose FlashWorld, a generative model that produces 3D scenes from a single image or text prompt in seconds, 10~100$\times$ faster than previous works while possessing superior rendering quality. Our approach shifts from the conventional multi-view-oriented (MV-oriented) paradigm, which generates multi-view images for subsequent 3D reconstruction, to a 3D-oriented approach where the model directly produces 3D Gaussian representations during multi-view generation. While ensuring 3D consistency, 3D-oriented method typically suffers poor visual quality. FlashWorld includes a dual-mode pre-training phase followed by a cross-mode post-training phase, effectively integrating the strengths of both paradigms. Specifically, leveraging the prior from a video diffusion model, we first pre-train a dual-mode multi-view diffusion model, which jointly supports MV-oriented and 3D-oriented generation modes. To bridge the quality gap in 3D-oriented generation, we further propose a cross-mode post-training distillation by matching distribution from consistent 3D-oriented mode to high-quality MV-oriented mode. This not only enhances visual quality while maintaining 3D consistency, but also reduces the required denoising steps for inference. Also, we propose a strategy to leverage massive single-view images and text prompts during this process to enhance the model's generalization to out-of-distribution inputs. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority and efficiency of our method.

  _Sanchar Palit, Subhasis Chaudhuri, Biplab Banerjee_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Diffusion models have recently achieved significant success in various image manipulation tasks, including image super-resolution and perceptual quality enhancement. Pretrained text-to-image models, such as Stable Diffusion, have exhibited strong capabilities in synthesizing realistic image content, which makes them particularly attractive for addressing super-resolution tasks. While some existing approaches leverage these models to achieve state-of-the-art results, they often struggle when applied to diverse and highly degraded images, leading to noise amplification or incorrect content generation. To address these limitations, we propose a contextually precise image super-resolution framework that effectively maintains both local and global pixel relationships through Local-Global Context-Aware Attention, enabling the generation of high-quality images. Furthermore, we propose a distribution- and perceptual-aligned conditioning mechanism in the pixel space to enhance perceptual fidelity. This mechanism captures fine-grained pixel-level representations while progressively preserving and refining structural information, transitioning from local content details to the global structural composition. During inference, our method generates high-quality images that are structurally consistent with the original content, mitigating artifacts and ensuring realistic detail restoration. Extensive experiments on multiple super-resolution benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in producing high-fidelity, perceptually accurate reconstructions.

  _Jianhui Zhang, Sheng Cheng, Qirui Sun, Jia Liu, Wang Luyang, Chaoyu Feng, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this work, we present Patch-Adapter, an effective framework for high-resolution text-guided image inpainting. Unlike existing methods limited to lower resolutions, our approach achieves 4K+ resolution while maintaining precise content consistency and prompt alignment, two critical challenges in image inpainting that intensify with increasing resolution and texture complexity. Patch-Adapter leverages a two-stage adapter architecture to scale the diffusion model's resolution from 1K to 4K+ without requiring structural overhauls: (1) Dual Context Adapter learns coherence between masked and unmasked regions at reduced resolutions to establish global structural consistency; and (2) Reference Patch Adapter implements a patch-level attention mechanism for full-resolution inpainting, preserving local detail fidelity through adaptive feature fusion. This dual-stage architecture uniquely addresses the scalability gap in high-resolution inpainting by decoupling global semantics from localized refinement. Experiments demonstrate that Patch-Adapter not only resolves artifacts common in large-scale inpainting but also achieves state-of-the-art performance on the OpenImages and Photo-Concept-Bucket datasets, outperforming existing methods in both perceptual quality and text-prompt adherence.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reinforcement learning (RL) has garnered increasing attention in text-to-image (T2I) generation. However, most existing RL approaches are tailored to either diffusion models or autoregressive models, overlooking an important alternative: masked generative models. In this work, we propose Mask-GRPO, the first method to incorporate Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)-based RL into this overlooked paradigm. Our core insight is to redefine the transition probability, which is different from current approaches, and formulate the unmasking process as a multi-step decision-making problem. To further enhance our method, we explore several useful strategies, including removing the KL constraint, applying the reduction strategy, and filtering out low-quality samples. Using Mask-GRPO, we improve a base model, Show-o, with substantial improvements on standard T2I benchmarks and preference alignment, outperforming existing state-of-the-art approaches.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Current end-to-end multi-modal models utilize different encoders and decoders to process input and output information. This separation hinders the joint representation learning of various modalities. To unify multi-modal processing, we propose a novel architecture called MDM (Multi-modal Diffusion Mamba). MDM utilizes a Mamba-based multi-step selection diffusion model to progressively generate and refine modality-specific information through a unified variational autoencoder for both encoding and decoding. This innovative approach allows MDM to achieve superior performance when processing high-dimensional data, particularly in generating high-resolution images and extended text sequences simultaneously. Our evaluations in areas such as image generation, image captioning, visual question answering, text comprehension, and reasoning tasks demonstrate that MDM significantly outperforms existing end-to-end models (MonoFormer, LlamaGen, and Chameleon etc.) and competes effectively with SOTA models like GPT-4V, Gemini Pro, and Mistral. Our results validate MDM's effectiveness in unifying multi-modal processes while maintaining computational efficiency, establishing a new direction for end-to-end multi-modal architectures.

- **[CymbaDiff: Structured Spatial Diffusion for Sketch-based 3D Semantic Urban Scene Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13245)**  `arXiv:2510.13245`  `cs.CV`  
  _Li Liang, Bo Miao, Xinyu Wang, Naveed Akhtar, Jordan Vice, Ajmal Mian_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Outdoor 3D semantic scene generation produces realistic and semantically rich environments for applications such as urban simulation and autonomous driving. However, advances in this direction are constrained by the absence of publicly available, well-annotated datasets. We introduce SketchSem3D, the first large-scale benchmark for generating 3D outdoor semantic scenes from abstract freehand sketches and pseudo-labeled annotations of satellite images. SketchSem3D includes two subsets, Sketch-based SemanticKITTI and Sketch-based KITTI-360 (containing LiDAR voxels along with their corresponding sketches and annotated satellite images), to enable standardized, rigorous, and diverse evaluations. We also propose Cylinder Mamba Diffusion (CymbaDiff) that significantly enhances spatial coherence in outdoor 3D scene generation. CymbaDiff imposes structured spatial ordering, explicitly captures cylindrical continuity and vertical hierarchy, and preserves both physical neighborhood relationships and global context within the generated scenes. Extensive experiments on SketchSem3D demonstrate that CymbaDiff achieves superior semantic consistency, spatial realism, and cross-dataset generalization.

  Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have recently demonstrated significant progress in video editing.However, existing video editing methods are severely limited by their high computational overhead and memory consumption.Furthermore, these approaches often sacrifice visual fidelity, leading to undesirable temporal inconsistencies and artifacts such as blurring and pronounced mosaic-like patterns.We propose Edit-Your-Interest, a lightweight, text-driven, zero-shot video editing method.Edit-Your-Interest introduces a spatio-temporal feature memory to cache features from previous frames, significantly reducing computational overhead compared to full-sequence spatio-temporal modeling approaches.Specifically, we first introduce a Spatio-Temporal Feature Memory bank (SFM), which is designed to efficiently cache and retain the crucial image tokens processed by spatial attention.Second, we propose the Feature Most-Similar Propagation (FMP) method. FMP propagates the most relevant tokens from previous frames to subsequent ones, preserving temporal consistency.Finally, we introduce an SFM update algorithm that continuously refreshes the cached features, ensuring their long-term relevance and effectiveness throughout the video sequence.Furthermore, we leverage cross-attention maps to automatically extract masks for the instances of interest.These masks are seamlessly integrated into the diffusion denoising process, enabling fine-grained control over target objects and allowing Edit-Your-Interest to perform highly accurate edits while robustly preserving the background integrity.Extensive experiments decisively demonstrate that the proposed Edit-Your-Interest outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both efficiency and visual fidelity, validating its superior effectiveness and practicality.

  Diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs) have demonstrated remarkable progress in generative tasks, such as image and video synthesis. However, they still often produce hallucinated samples (hallucinations) that conflict with real-world knowledge, such as generating an implausible duplicate cup floating beside another cup. Despite their prevalence, the lack of feasible methodologies for systematically quantifying such hallucinations hinders progress in addressing this challenge and obscures potential pathways for designing next-generation generative models under factual constraints. In this work, we bridge this gap by focusing on a specific form of hallucination, which we term counting hallucination, referring to the generation of an incorrect number of instances or structured objects, such as a hand image with six fingers, despite such patterns being absent from the training data. To this end, we construct a dataset suite CountHalluSet, with well-defined counting criteria, comprising ToyShape, SimObject, and RealHand. Using these datasets, we develop a standardized evaluation protocol for quantifying counting hallucinations, and systematically examine how different sampling conditions in DPMs, including solver type, ODE solver order, sampling steps, and initial noise, affect counting hallucination levels. Furthermore, we analyze their correlation with common evaluation metrics such as FID, revealing that this widely used image quality metric fails to capture counting hallucinations consistently. This work aims to take the first step toward systematically quantifying hallucinations in diffusion models and offer new insights into the investigation of hallucination phenomena in image generation.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce CADE 2.5 (Comfy Adaptive Detail Enhancer), a sampler-level guidance stack for SD/SDXL latent diffusion models. The central module, ZeResFDG, unifies (i) frequency-decoupled guidance that reweights low- and high-frequency components of the guidance signal, (ii) energy rescaling that matches the per-sample magnitude of the guided prediction to the positive branch, and (iii) zero-projection that removes the component parallel to the unconditional direction. A lightweight spectral EMA with hysteresis switches between a conservative and a detail-seeking mode as structure crystallizes during sampling. Across SD/SDXL samplers, ZeResFDG improves sharpness, prompt adherence, and artifact control at moderate guidance scales without any retraining. In addition, we employ a training-free inference-time stabilizer, QSilk Micrograin Stabilizer (quantile clamp + depth/edge-gated micro-detail injection), which improves robustness and yields natural high-frequency micro-texture at high resolutions with negligible overhead. For completeness we note that the same rule is compatible with alternative parameterizations (e.g., velocity), which we briefly discuss in the Appendix; however, this paper focuses on SD/SDXL latent diffusion models.

  Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL) challenges models to sequentially learn new classes from minimal examples without forgetting prior knowledge, a task complicated by the stability-plasticity dilemma and data scarcity. Current FSCIL methods often struggle with generalization due to their reliance on limited datasets. While diffusion models offer a path for data augmentation, their direct application can lead to semantic misalignment or ineffective guidance. This paper introduces Diffusion-Classifier Synergy (DCS), a novel framework that establishes a mutual boosting loop between diffusion model and FSCIL classifier. DCS utilizes a reward-aligned learning strategy, where a dynamic, multi-faceted reward function derived from the classifier's state directs the diffusion model. This reward system operates at two levels: the feature level ensures semantic coherence and diversity using prototype-anchored maximum mean discrepancy and dimension-wise variance matching, while the logits level promotes exploratory image generation and enhances inter-class discriminability through confidence recalibration and cross-session confusion-aware mechanisms. This co-evolutionary process, where generated images refine the classifier and an improved classifier state yields better reward signals, demonstrably achieves state-of-the-art performance on FSCIL benchmarks, significantly enhancing both knowledge retention and new class learning.

  Generative diffusion models learn probability densities over diverse image datasets by estimating the score with a neural network trained to remove noise. Despite their remarkable success in generating high-quality images, the internal mechanisms of the underlying score networks are not well understood. Here, we examine the image representation that arises from score estimation in a {fully-convolutional unconditional UNet}. We show that the middle block of the UNet decomposes individual images into sparse subsets of active channels, and that the vector of spatial averages of these channels can provide a nonlinear representation of the underlying clean images. Euclidean distances in this representation space are semantically meaningful, even though no conditioning information is provided during training. We develop a novel algorithm for stochastic reconstruction of images conditioned on this representation: The synthesis using the unconditional model is "self-guided" by the representation extracted from that very same model. For a given representation, the common patterns in the set of reconstructed samples reveal the features captured in the middle block of the UNet. Together, these results show, for the first time, that a measure of semantic similarity emerges, unsupervised, solely from the denoising objective.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present a neural network structure, FramePack, to train next-frame (or next-frame-section) prediction models for video generation. FramePack compresses input frame contexts with frame-wise importance so that more frames can be encoded within a fixed context length, with more important frames having longer contexts. The frame importance can be measured using time proximity, feature similarity, or hybrid metrics. The packing method allows for inference with thousands of frames and training with relatively large batch sizes. We also present drift prevention methods to address observation bias (error accumulation), including early-established endpoints, adjusted sampling orders, and discrete history representation. Ablation studies validate the effectiveness of the anti-drifting methods in both single-directional video streaming and bi-directional video generation. Finally, we show that existing video diffusion models can be finetuned with FramePack, and analyze the differences between different packing schedules.

  In recent years, significant progress has been made in collecting large-scale datasets to improve segmentation and autonomous driving models. These large-scale datasets are often dominated by common environmental conditions such as "Clear and Day" weather, leading to decreased performance in under-represented conditions like "Rainy and Night". To address this issue, we introduce SynDiff-AD, a novel data augmentation pipeline that leverages diffusion models (DMs) to generate realistic images for such subgroups. SynDiff-AD uses ControlNet-a DM that guides data generation conditioned on semantic maps-along with a novel prompting scheme that generates subgroup-specific, semantically dense prompts. By augmenting datasets with SynDiff-AD, we improve the performance of segmentation models like Mask2Former and SegFormer by up to 1.2% and 2.3% on the Waymo dataset, and up to 1.4% and 0.7% on the DeepDrive dataset, respectively. Additionally, we demonstrate that our SynDiff-AD pipeline enhances the driving performance of end-to-end autonomous driving models, like AIM-2D and AIM-BEV, by up to 20% across diverse environmental conditions in the CARLA autonomous driving simulator, providing a more robust model. We release our code and pipeline atthis https URL.

  Recent advances in diffusion large language models (dLLMs) have introduced a promising alternative to autoregressive (AR) LLMs for natural language generation tasks, leveraging full attention and denoising-based decoding strategies. However, the deployment of these models on edge devices remains challenging due to their massive parameter scale and high resource demands. While post-training quantization (PTQ) has emerged as a widely adopted technique for compressing AR LLMs, its applicability to dLLMs remains largely unexplored. In this work, we present the first systematic study on quantizing diffusion-based language models. We begin by identifying the presence of activation outliers, characterized by abnormally large activation values that dominate the dynamic range. These outliers pose a key challenge to low-bit quantization, as they make it difficult to preserve precision for the majority of values. More importantly, we implement state-of-the-art PTQ methods and conduct a comprehensive evaluation across multiple task types and model variants. Our analysis is structured along four key dimensions: bit-width, quantization method, task category, and model type. Through this multi-perspective evaluation, we offer practical insights into the quantization behavior of dLLMs under different configurations. We hope our findings provide a foundation for future research in efficient dLLM deployment. Our code is publicly available atthis https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Autoregressive (AR) models remain the standard for natural language generation but still suffer from high latency due to strictly sequential decoding. Recent diffusion-inspired approaches, such as LlaDA and Dream, mitigate this by generating in parallel, yet they suffer from two core limitations: information loss, as predictive distributions for non-finalized tokens are discarded at each step, and premature commitment, where local decisions are made without sufficient global coordination. We introduce Latent Refinement Decoding (LRD), a two-stage framework with Latent Refinement and a Predictive Feedback Loop. The first stage maintains masked positions as distributional mixtures of predicted tokens and the mask embedding, allowing the model to establish more globally consistent beliefs. The second stage progressively finalizes confident tokens while retaining uncertain ones for iterative feedback. KL-divergence dynamics provide a principled and reliable criterion for convergence and early stopping. Experiments across coding (HumanEval +6.3, MBPP +2.6) and reasoning (GSM8K +2.9, MATH500 +3.8) show that LRD improves accuracy while delivering speedups of up to 10.6x, making it a strong and versatile alternative for parallel sequence generation.
