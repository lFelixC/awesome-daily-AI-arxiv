- **[VO-DP: Semantic-Geometric Adaptive Diffusion Policy for Vision-Only Robotic Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15530)**  `arXiv:2510.15530`  `cs.RO` `cs.CV` `cs.LG`

  In the context of imitation learning, visuomotor-based diffusion policy learning is one of the main directions in robotic manipulation. Most of these approaches rely on point clouds as observation inputs and construct scene representations through point clouds feature learning, which enables them to achieve remarkable accuracy. However, the existing literature lacks an in-depth exploration of vision-only solutions that have significant potential. In this paper, we propose a Vision-Only and single-view Diffusion Policy learning method (VO-DP) that leverages pretrained visual foundation models to achieve effective fusion of semantic and geometric features. We utilize intermediate features from VGGT incorporating semantic features from DINOv2 and geometric features from Alternating Attention blocks. Features are fused via cross-attention and spatially compressed with a CNN to form the input to the policy head. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VO-DP not only outperforms the vision-only baseline DP significantly but also exhibits distinct performance trends against the point cloud-based method DP3: in simulation tasks, VO-DP achieves an average success rate of 64.6% on par with DP3 64.0% and far higher than DP 34.8%, while in real-world tasks, it reaches 87.9%, outperforming both DP3 67.5% and DP 11.2% by a notable margin. Further robustness evaluations confirm that VO-DP remains highly stable under varying conditions including color, size, background, and lighting. Lastly, we open-source a training library for robotic manipulation. Built on Accelerate, this library supports multi-machine and multi-GPU parallel training, as well as mixed precision training. It is compatible with visuomotor policies such as DP, DP3 and VO-DP, and also supports the RoboTwin simulator.

- **[From Language to Locomotion: Retargeting-free Humanoid Control via Motion Latent Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14952)**  `arXiv:2510.14952`  `cs.RO` `cs.CV`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Natural language offers a natural interface for humanoid robots, but existing language-guided humanoid locomotion pipelines remain cumbersome and untrustworthy. They typically decode human motion, retarget it to robot morphology, and then track it with a physics-based controller. However, this multi-stage process is prone to cumulative errors, introduces high latency, and yields weak coupling between semantics and control. These limitations call for a more direct pathway from language to action, one that eliminates fragile intermediate stages. Therefore, we present RoboGhost, a retargeting-free framework that directly conditions humanoid policies on language-grounded motion latents. By bypassing explicit motion decoding and retargeting, RoboGhost enables a diffusion-based policy to denoise executable actions directly from noise, preserving semantic intent and supporting fast, reactive control. A hybrid causal transformer-diffusion motion generator further ensures long-horizon consistency while maintaining stability and diversity, yielding rich latent representations for precise humanoid behavior. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RoboGhost substantially reduces deployment latency, improves success rates and tracking precision, and produces smooth, semantically aligned locomotion on real humanoids. Beyond text, the framework naturally extends to other modalities such as images, audio, and music, providing a universal foundation for vision-language-action humanoid systems.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce Genie Envisioner (GE), a unified world foundation platform for robotic manipulation that integrates policy learning, evaluation, and simulation within a single video-generative framework. At its core, GE-Base is a large-scale, instruction-conditioned video diffusion model that captures the spatial, temporal, and semantic dynamics of real-world robotic interactions in a structured latent space. Built upon this foundation, GE-Act maps latent representations to executable action trajectories through a lightweight, flow-matching decoder, enabling precise and generalizable policy inference across diverse embodiments with minimal supervision. To support scalable evaluation and training, GE-Sim serves as an action-conditioned neural simulator, producing high-fidelity rollouts for closed-loop policy development. The platform is further equipped with EWMBench, a standardized benchmark suite measuring visual fidelity, physical consistency, and instruction-action alignment. Together, these components establish Genie Envisioner as a scalable and practical foundation for instruction-driven, general-purpose embodied intelligence. All code, models, and benchmarks will be released publicly.

- **[VDRive: Leveraging Reinforced VLA and Diffusion Policy for End-to-end Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15446)**  `arXiv:2510.15446`  `cs.RO`  
  _Ziang Guo, Zufeng Zhang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In autonomous driving, dynamic environment and corner cases pose significant challenges to the robustness of ego vehicle's state understanding and decision making. We introduce VDRive, a novel pipeline for end-to-end autonomous driving that explicitly models state-action mapping to address these challenges, enabling interpretable and robust decision making. By leveraging the advancement of the state understanding of the Vision Language Action Model (VLA) with generative diffusion policy-based action head, our VDRive guides the driving contextually and geometrically. Contextually, VLA predicts future observations through token generation pre-training, where the observations are represented as discrete codes by a Conditional Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (CVQ-VAE). Geometrically, we perform reinforcement learning fine-tuning of the VLA to predict future trajectories and actions based on current driving conditions. VLA supplies the current state tokens and predicted state tokens for the action policy head to generate hierarchical actions and trajectories. During policy training, a learned critic evaluates the actions generated by the policy and provides gradient-based feedback, forming an actor-critic framework that enables a reinforcement-based policy learning pipeline. Experiments show that our VDRive achieves state-of-the-art performance in the Bench2Drive closed-loop benchmark and nuScenes open-loop planning.

- **[Muddit: Liberating Generation Beyond Text-to-Image with a Unified Discrete Diffusion Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23606)**  `arXiv:2505.23606`  `cs.LG` `cs.CV`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Unified generation models aim to handle diverse tasks across modalities -- such as text generation, image generation, and vision-language reasoning -- within a single architecture and decoding paradigm. Autoregressive unified models suffer from slow inference due to sequential decoding, and non-autoregressive unified models suffer from weak generalization due to limited pretrained backbones. We introduce Muddit, a unified discrete diffusion transformer that enables fast and parallel generation across both text and image modalities. Unlike prior unified diffusion models trained from scratch, Muddit integrates strong visual priors from a pretrained text-to-image backbone with a lightweight text decoder, enabling flexible and high-quality multimodal generation under a unified architecture. Empirical results show that Muddit achieves competitive or superior performance compared to significantly larger autoregressive models in both quality and efficiency. The work highlights the potential of purely discrete diffusion, when equipped with strong visual priors, as a scalable and effective backbone for unified generation.

- **[Towards Robust Zero-Shot Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15382)**  `arXiv:2510.15382`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI` `cs.RO`  
  _Kexin Zheng, Lauriane Teyssier, Yinan Zheng, Yu Luo, Xiayuan Zhan_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The recent development of zero-shot reinforcement learning (RL) has opened a new avenue for learning pre-trained generalist policies that can adapt to arbitrary new tasks in a zero-shot manner. While the popular Forward-Backward representations (FB) and related methods have shown promise in zero-shot RL, we empirically found that their modeling lacks expressivity and that extrapolation errors caused by out-of-distribution (OOD) actions during offline learning sometimes lead to biased representations, ultimately resulting in suboptimal performance. To address these issues, we propose Behavior-REgularizEd Zero-shot RL with Expressivity enhancement (BREEZE), an upgraded FB-based framework that simultaneously enhances learning stability, policy extraction capability, and representation learning quality. BREEZE introduces behavioral regularization in zero-shot RL policy learning, transforming policy optimization into a stable in-sample learning paradigm. Additionally, BREEZE extracts the policy using a task-conditioned diffusion model, enabling the generation of high-quality and multimodal action distributions in zero-shot RL settings. Moreover, BREEZE employs expressive attention-based architectures for representation modeling to capture the complex relationships between environmental dynamics. Extensive experiments on ExORL and D4RL Kitchen demonstrate that BREEZE achieves the best or near-the-best performance while exhibiting superior robustness compared to prior offline zero-shot RL methods. The official implementation is available at:this https URL.

- **[Learning What Matters: Steering Diffusion via Spectrally Anisotropic Forward Noise](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09660)**  `arXiv:2510.09660`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI` `cs.CV`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs) have achieved strong generative performance, yet their inductive biases remain largely implicit. In this work, we aim to build inductive biases into the training and sampling of diffusion models to better accommodate the target distribution of the data to model. We introduce an anisotropic noise operator that shapes these biases by replacing the isotropic forward covariance with a structured, frequency-diagonal covariance. This operator unifies band-pass masks and power-law weightings, allowing us to emphasize or suppress designated frequency bands, while keeping the forward process Gaussian. We refer to this as spectrally anisotropic Gaussian diffusion (SAGD). In this work, we derive the score relation for anisotropic covariances and show that, under full support, the learned score converges to the true data score as $t\!\to\!0$, while anisotropy reshapes the probability-flow path from noise to data. Empirically, we show the induced anisotropy outperforms standard diffusion across several vision datasets, and enables selective omission: learning while ignoring known corruptions confined to specific bands. Together, these results demonstrate that carefully designed anisotropic forward noise provides a simple, yet principled, handle to tailor inductive bias in DPMs.

- **[Operator Flow Matching for Timeseries Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15101)**  `arXiv:2510.15101`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Yolanne Yi Ran Lee, Kyriakos Flouris_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Forecasting high-dimensional, PDE-governed dynamics remains a core challenge for generative modeling. Existing autoregressive and diffusion-based approaches often suffer cumulative errors and discretisation artifacts that limit long, physically consistent forecasts. Flow matching offers a natural alternative, enabling efficient, deterministic sampling. We prove an upper bound on FNO approximation error and propose TempO, a latent flow matching model leveraging sparse conditioning with channel folding to efficiently process 3D spatiotemporal fields using time-conditioned Fourier layers to capture multi-scale modes with high fidelity. TempO outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across three benchmark PDE datasets, and spectral analysis further demonstrates superior recovery of multi-scale dynamics, while efficiency studies highlight its parameter- and memory-light design compared to attention-based or convolutional regressors.

- **[Safe, Efficient, and Robust Reinforcement Learning for Ranking and Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15429)**  `arXiv:2510.15429`  `cs.LG`  
  _Shashank Gupta_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This dissertation investigates how reinforcement learning (RL) methods can be designed to be safe, sample-efficient, and robust. Framed through the unifying perspective of contextual-bandit RL, the work addresses two major application domains - ranking and recommendation, and text-to-image diffusion models. The first part of the thesis develops theory and algorithms for safe deployment in ranking systems. An exposure-based generalisation bound is derived, leading to a counterfactual risk-minimisation objective whose solution is guaranteed not to underperform the logging policy, even with sparse feedback. This guarantee is extended to doubly robust estimators, enabling safety even under adversarial or misspecified user models and offering practitioners explicit control over permissible utility loss. The second part turns to single-action bandits, where various off-policy estimators are unified within a baseline-correction framework. A closed-form optimal baseline is proposed and shown to minimise both evaluation and policy-gradient variance, thereby improving off-policy learning reliability. The final part examines the trade-offs between efficiency and effectiveness in generative RL. A systematic study of PPO and REINFORCE motivates the Leave-One-Out PPO (LOOP) algorithm, which combines multiple diffusion trajectories with a REINFORCE-style baseline inside PPO's clipped objective. LOOP achieves PPO-level sample efficiency while producing generations that align more faithfully with textual attributes.

  _Mingyang Sun, Pengxiang Ding, Weinan Zhang, Donglin Wang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  While behavior cloning with flow/diffusion policies excels at learning complex skills from demonstrations, it remains vulnerable to distributional shift, and standard RL methods struggle to fine-tune these models due to their iterative inference process and the limitations of existing workarounds. In this work, we introduce the Stepwise Flow Policy (SWFP) framework, founded on the key insight that discretizing the flow matching inference process via a fixed-step Euler scheme inherently aligns it with the variational Jordan-Kinderlehrer-Otto (JKO) principle from optimal transport. SWFP decomposes the global flow into a sequence of small, incremental transformations between proximate distributions. Each step corresponds to a JKO update, regularizing policy changes to stay near the previous iterate and ensuring stable online adaptation with entropic regularization. This decomposition yields an efficient algorithm that fine-tunes pre-trained flows via a cascade of small flow blocks, offering significant advantages: simpler/faster training of sub-models, reduced computational/memory costs, and provable stability grounded in Wasserstein trust regions. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate SWFP's enhanced stability, efficiency, and superior adaptation performance across diverse robotic control benchmarks.

  _Albert Matveev, Sanmitra Ghosh, Aamal Hussain, James-Michael Leahy, Michalis Michaelides_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Operator learning is a powerful paradigm for solving partial differential equations, with Fourier Neural Operators serving as a widely adopted foundation. However, FNOs face significant scalability challenges due to overparameterization and offer no native uncertainty quantification -- a key requirement for reliable scientific and engineering applications. Instead, neural operators rely on post hoc UQ methods that ignore geometric inductive biases. In this work, we introduce DINOZAUR: a diffusion-based neural operator parametrization with uncertainty quantification. Inspired by the structure of the heat kernel, DINOZAUR replaces the dense tensor multiplier in FNOs with a dimensionality-independent diffusion multiplier that has a single learnable time parameter per channel, drastically reducing parameter count and memory footprint without compromising predictive performance. By defining priors over those time parameters, we cast DINOZAUR as a Bayesian neural operator to yield spatially correlated outputs and calibrated uncertainty estimates. Our method achieves competitive or superior performance across several PDE benchmarks while providing efficient uncertainty quantification.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  While pre-trained visual representations have significantly advanced imitation learning, they are often task-agnostic as they remain frozen during policy learning. In this work, we explore leveraging pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models to obtain task-adaptive visual representations for robotic control, without fine-tuning the model itself. However, we find that naively applying textual conditions - a successful strategy in other vision domains - yields minimal or even negative gains in control tasks. We attribute this to the domain gap between the diffusion model's training data and robotic control environments, leading us to argue for conditions that consider the specific, dynamic visual information required for control. To this end, we propose ORCA, which introduces learnable task prompts that adapt to the control environment and visual prompts that capture fine-grained, frame-specific details. Through facilitating task-adaptive representations with our newly devised conditions, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on various robotic control benchmarks, significantly surpassing prior methods.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Environment prediction frameworks are critical for the safe navigation of autonomous vehicles (AVs) in dynamic settings. LiDAR-generated occupancy grid maps (L-OGMs) offer a robust bird's-eye view for the scene representation, enabling self-supervised joint scene predictions while exhibiting resilience to partial observability and perception detection failures. Prior approaches have focused on deterministic L-OGM prediction architectures within the grid cell space. While these methods have seen some success, they frequently produce unrealistic predictions and fail to capture the stochastic nature of the environment. Additionally, they do not effectively integrate additional sensor modalities present in AVs. Our proposed framework, Latent Occupancy Prediction (LOPR), performs stochastic L-OGM prediction in the latent space of a generative architecture and allows for conditioning on RGB cameras, maps, and planned trajectories. We decode predictions using either a single-step decoder, which provides high-quality predictions in real-time, or a diffusion-based batch decoder, which can further refine the decoded frames to address temporal consistency issues and reduce compression losses. Our experiments on the nuScenes and Waymo Open datasets show that all variants of our approach qualitatively and quantitatively outperform prior approaches.

- **[QSilk: Micrograin Stabilization and Adaptive Quantile Clipping for Detail-Friendly Latent Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15761)**  `arXiv:2510.15761`  `cs.CV` `cs.LG`  
  _Denis Rychkovskiy_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present QSilk, a lightweight, always-on stabilization layer for latent diffusion that improves high-frequency fidelity while suppressing rare activation spikes. QSilk combines (i) a per-sample micro clamp that gently limits extreme values without washing out texture, and (ii) Adaptive Quantile Clip (AQClip), which adapts the allowed value corridor per region. AQClip can operate in a proxy mode using local structure statistics or in an attention entropy guided mode (model confidence). Integrated into the CADE 2.5 rendering pipeline, QSilk yields cleaner, sharper results at low step counts and ultra-high resolutions with negligible overhead. It requires no training or fine-tuning and exposes minimal user controls. We report consistent qualitative improvements across SD/SDXL backbones and show synergy with CFG/Rescale, enabling slightly higher guidance without artifacts.

- **[LILAC: Long-sequence Incremental Low-latency Arbitrary Motion Stylization via Streaming VAE-Diffusion with Causal Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15392)**  `arXiv:2510.15392`  `cs.CV` `cs.LG`  
  _Peng Ren, Hai Yang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Generating long and stylized human motions in real time is critical for applications that demand continuous and responsive character control. Despite its importance, existing streaming approaches often operate directly in the raw motion space, leading to substantial computational overhead and making it difficult to maintain temporal stability. In contrast, latent-space VAE-Diffusion-based frameworks alleviate these issues and achieve high-quality stylization, but they are generally confined to offline processing. To bridge this gap, LILAC (Long-sequence Incremental Low-latency Arbitrary Motion Stylization via Streaming VAE-Diffusion with Causal Decoding) builds upon a recent high-performing offline framework for arbitrary motion stylization and extends it to an online setting through a latent-space streaming architecture with a sliding-window causal design and the injection of decoded motion features to ensure smooth motion transitions. This architecture enables long-sequence real-time arbitrary stylization without relying on future frames or modifying the diffusion model architecture, achieving a favorable balance between stylization quality and responsiveness as demonstrated by experiments on benchmark datasets.

  Diffusion models have recently emerged as powerful generative models in medical imaging. However, it remains a major challenge to combine these data-driven models with domain knowledge to guide brain imaging problems. In neuroimaging, Bayesian inverse problems have long provided a successful framework for inference tasks, where incorporating domain knowledge of the imaging process enables robust performance without requiring extensive training data. However, the anatomical modeling component of these approaches typically relies on classical mathematical priors that often fail to capture the complex structure of brain anatomy. In this work, we present the first general-purpose application of diffusion models as priors for solving a wide range of medical imaging inverse problems. Our approach leverages a score-based diffusion prior trained extensively on diverse brain MRI data, paired with flexible forward models that capture common image processing tasks such as super-resolution, bias field correction, inpainting, and combinations thereof. We further demonstrate how our framework can refine outputs from existing deep learning methods to improve anatomical fidelity. Experiments on heterogeneous clinical and research MRI data show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance producing consistent, high-quality solutions without requiring paired training datasets. These results highlight the potential of diffusion priors as versatile tools for brain MRI analysis.

- **[DeLeaker: Dynamic Inference-Time Reweighting For Semantic Leakage Mitigation in Text-to-Image Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15015)**  `arXiv:2510.15015`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI` `cs.CL`  
  _Mor Ventura, Michael Toker, Or Patashnik, Yonatan Belinkov, Roi Reichart_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Text-to-Image (T2I) models have advanced rapidly, yet they remain vulnerable to semantic leakage, the unintended transfer of semantically related features between distinct entities. Existing mitigation strategies are often optimization-based or dependent on external inputs. We introduce DeLeaker, a lightweight, optimization-free inference-time approach that mitigates leakage by directly intervening on the model's attention maps. Throughout the diffusion process, DeLeaker dynamically reweights attention maps to suppress excessive cross-entity interactions while strengthening the identity of each entity. To support systematic evaluation, we introduce SLIM (Semantic Leakage in IMages), the first dataset dedicated to semantic leakage, comprising 1,130 human-verified samples spanning diverse scenarios, together with a novel automatic evaluation framework. Experiments demonstrate that DeLeaker consistently outperforms all baselines, even when they are provided with external information, achieving effective leakage mitigation without compromising fidelity or quality. These results underscore the value of attention control and pave the way for more semantically precise T2I models.

- **[NDM: A Noise-driven Detection and Mitigation Framework against Implicit Sexual Intentions in Text-to-Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15752)**  `arXiv:2510.15752`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`  
  _Yitong Sun, Yao Huang, Ruochen Zhang, Huanran Chen, Shouwei Ruan, Ranjie Duan, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Despite the impressive generative capabilities of text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models, they remain vulnerable to generating inappropriate content, especially when confronted with implicit sexual prompts. Unlike explicit harmful prompts, these subtle cues, often disguised as seemingly benign terms, can unexpectedly trigger sexual content due to underlying model biases, raising significant ethical concerns. However, existing detection methods are primarily designed to identify explicit sexual content and therefore struggle to detect these implicit cues. Fine-tuning approaches, while effective to some extent, risk degrading the model's generative quality, creating an undesirable trade-off. To address this, we propose NDM, the first noise-driven detection and mitigation framework, which could detect and mitigate implicit malicious intention in T2I generation while preserving the model's original generative capabilities. Specifically, we introduce two key innovations: first, we leverage the separability of early-stage predicted noise to develop a noise-based detection method that could identify malicious content with high accuracy and efficiency; second, we propose a noise-enhanced adaptive negative guidance mechanism that could optimize the initial noise by suppressing the prominent region's attention, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of adaptive negative guidance for sexual mitigation. Experimentally, we validate NDM on both natural and adversarial datasets, demonstrating its superior performance over existing SOTA methods, including SLD, UCE, and RECE, etc. Code and resources are available atthis https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent progress in diffusion-based visual generation has largely relied on latent diffusion models with variational autoencoders (VAEs). While effective for high-fidelity synthesis, this VAE+diffusion paradigm suffers from limited training efficiency, slow inference, and poor transferability to broader vision tasks. These issues stem from a key limitation of VAE latent spaces: the lack of clear semantic separation and strong discriminative structure. Our analysis confirms that these properties are crucial not only for perception and understanding tasks, but also for the stable and efficient training of latent diffusion models. Motivated by this insight, we introduce SVG, a novel latent diffusion model without variational autoencoders, which leverages self-supervised representations for visual generation. SVG constructs a feature space with clear semantic discriminability by leveraging frozen DINO features, while a lightweight residual branch captures fine-grained details for high-fidelity reconstruction. Diffusion models are trained directly on this semantically structured latent space to facilitate more efficient learning. As a result, SVG enables accelerated diffusion training, supports few-step sampling, and improves generative quality. Experimental results further show that SVG preserves the semantic and discriminative capabilities of the underlying self-supervised representations, providing a principled pathway toward task-general, high-quality visual representations.

- **[Multi-identity Human Image Animation with Structural Video Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04126)**  `arXiv:2504.04126`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`  
  _Zhenzhi Wang, Yixuan Li, Yanhong Zeng, Yuwei Guo, Dahua Lin, Tianfan Xue, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Generating human videos from a single image while ensuring high visual quality and precise control is a challenging task, especially in complex scenarios involving multiple individuals and interactions with objects. Existing methods, while effective for single-human cases, often fail to handle the intricacies of multi-identity interactions because they struggle to associate the correct pairs of human appearance and pose condition and model the distribution of 3D-aware dynamics. To address these limitations, we present \emph{Structural Video Diffusion}, a novel framework designed for generating realistic multi-human videos. Our approach introduces two core innovations: identity-specific embeddings to maintain consistent appearances across individuals and a structural learning mechanism that incorporates depth and surface-normal cues to model human-object interactions. Additionally, we expand existing human video dataset with 25K new videos featuring diverse multi-human and object interaction scenarios, providing a robust foundation for training. Experimental results demonstrate that Structural Video Diffusion achieves superior performance in generating lifelike, coherent videos for multiple subjects with dynamic and rich interactions, advancing the state of human-centric video generation.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The proliferation of generative models, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Diffusion Models, and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), has enabled the synthesis of high-quality multimedia data. However, these advancements have also raised significant concerns regarding adversarial attacks, unethical usage, and societal harm. Recognizing these challenges, researchers have increasingly focused on developing methodologies to detect synthesized data effectively, aiming to mitigate potential risks. Prior reviews have predominantly focused on deepfake detection and often overlook recent advancements in synthetic image forensics, particularly approaches that incorporate multimodal frameworks, reasoning-based detection, and training-free methodologies. To bridge this gap, this survey provides a comprehensive and up-to-date review of state-of-the-art techniques for detecting and classifying synthetic images generated by advanced generative AI models. The review systematically examines core detection paradigms, categorizes them into spatial-domain, frequency-domain, fingerprint-based, patch-based, training-free, and multimodal reasoning-based frameworks, and offers concise descriptions of their underlying principles. We further provide detailed comparative analyses of these methods on publicly available datasets to assess their generalizability, robustness, and interpretability. Finally, the survey highlights open challenges and future directions, emphasizing the potential of hybrid frameworks that combine the efficiency of training-free approaches with the semantic reasoning of multimodal models to advance trustworthy and explainable synthetic image forensics.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Synthesizing large-scale, explorable, and geometrically accurate 3D urban scenes is a challenging yet valuable task in providing immersive and embodied applications. The challenges lie in the lack of large-scale and high-quality real-world 3D scans for training generalizable generative models. In this paper, we take an alternative route to create large-scale 3D scenes by synergizing the readily available satellite imagery that supplies realistic coarse geometry and the open-domain diffusion model for creating high-quality close-up appearances. We propose \textbf{Skyfall-GS}, the first city-block scale 3D scene creation framework without costly 3D annotations, also featuring real-time, immersive 3D exploration. We tailor a curriculum-driven iterative refinement strategy to progressively enhance geometric completeness and photorealistic textures.

  Lens flare significantly degrades image quality, impacting critical computer vision tasks like object detection and autonomous driving. Recent Single Image Flare Removal (SIFR) methods perform poorly when off-frame light sources are incomplete or absent. We propose LightsOut, a diffusion-based outpainting framework tailored to enhance SIFR by reconstructing off-frame light sources. Our method leverages a multitask regression module and LoRA fine-tuned diffusion model to ensure realistic and physically consistent outpainting results. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate LightsOut consistently boosts the performance of existing SIFR methods across challenging scenarios without additional retraining, serving as a universally applicable plug-and-play preprocessing solution.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present BLIP3o-NEXT, a fully open-source foundation model in the BLIP3 series that advances the next frontier of native image generation. BLIP3o-NEXT unifies text-to-image generation and image editing within a single architecture, demonstrating strong image generation and image editing capabilities. In developing the state-of-the-art native image generation model, we identify four key insights: (1) Most architectural choices yield comparable performance; an architecture can be deemed effective provided it scales efficiently and supports fast inference; (2) The successful application of reinforcement learning can further push the frontier of native image generation; (3) Image editing still remains a challenging task, yet instruction following and the consistency between generated and reference images can be significantly enhanced through post-training and data engine; (4) Data quality and scale continue to be decisive factors that determine the upper bound of model performance. Building upon these insights, BLIP3o-NEXT leverages an Autoregressive + Diffusion architecture in which an autoregressive model first generates discrete image tokens conditioned on multimodal inputs, whose hidden states are then used as conditioning signals for a diffusion model to generate high-fidelity images. This architecture integrates the reasoning strength and instruction following of autoregressive models with the fine-detail rendering ability of diffusion models, achieving a new level of coherence and realism. Extensive evaluations of various text-to-image and image-editing benchmarks show that BLIP3o-NEXT achieves superior performance over existing models.

  The scale and quality of datasets are crucial for training robust perception models. However, obtaining large-scale annotated data is both costly and time-consuming. Generative models have emerged as a powerful tool for data augmentation by synthesizing samples that adhere to desired distributions. However, current generative approaches often rely on complex post-processing or extensive fine-tuning on massive datasets to achieve satisfactory results, and they remain prone to content-position mismatches and semantic leakage. To overcome these limitations, we introduce ReCon, a novel augmentation framework that enhances the capacity of structure-controllable generative models for object detection. ReCon integrates region-guided rectification into the diffusion sampling process, using feedback from a pre-trained perception model to rectify misgenerated regions within diffusion sampling process. We further propose region-aligned cross-attention to enforce spatial-semantic alignment between image regions and their textual cues, thereby improving both semantic consistency and overall image fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ReCon substantially improve the quality and trainability of generated data, achieving consistent performance gains across various datasets, backbone architectures, and data scales.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Positron emission tomography (PET) with 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) is an established tool in the diagnostic workup of patients with suspected dementing disorders. However, compared to the routinely available magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), FDG-PET remains significantly less accessible and substantially more expensive. Here, we present SiM2P, a 3D diffusion bridge-based framework that learns a probabilistic mapping from MRI and auxiliary patient information to simulate FDG-PET images of diagnostic quality. In a blinded clinical reader study, two neuroradiologists and two nuclear medicine physicians rated the original MRI and SiM2P-simulated PET images of patients with Alzheimer's disease, behavioral-variant frontotemporal dementia, and cognitively healthy controls. SiM2P significantly improved the overall diagnostic accuracy of differentiating between three groups from 75.0% to 84.7% (p<0.05). Notably, the simulated PET images received higher diagnostic certainty ratings and achieved superior interrater agreement compared to the MRI images. Finally, we developed a practical workflow for local deployment of the SiM2P framework. It requires as few as 20 site-specific cases and only basic demographic information. This approach makes the established diagnostic benefits of FDG-PET imaging more accessible to patients with suspected dementing disorders, potentially improving early detection and differential diagnosis in resource-limited settings.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present DriveGen3D, a novel framework for generating high-quality and highly controllable dynamic 3D driving scenes that addresses critical limitations in existing methodologies. Current approaches to driving scene synthesis either suffer from prohibitive computational demands for extended temporal generation, focus exclusively on prolonged video synthesis without 3D representation, or restrict themselves to static single-scene reconstruction. Our work bridges this methodological gap by integrating accelerated long-term video generation with large-scale dynamic scene reconstruction through multimodal conditional control. DriveGen3D introduces a unified pipeline consisting of two specialized components: FastDrive-DiT, an efficient video diffusion transformer for high-resolution, temporally coherent video synthesis under text and Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) layout guidance; and FastRecon3D, a feed-forward reconstruction module that rapidly builds 3D Gaussian representations across time, ensuring spatial-temporal consistency. Together, these components enable real-time generation of extended driving videos (up to $424\times800$ at 12 FPS) and corresponding dynamic 3D scenes, achieving SSIM of 0.811 and PSNR of 22.84 on novel view synthesis, all while maintaining parameter efficiency.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Low-rank Adaptation (LoRA) models have revolutionized the personalization of pre-trained diffusion models by enabling fine-tuning through low-rank, factorized weight matrices specifically optimized for attention layers. These models facilitate the generation of highly customized content across a variety of objects, individuals, and artistic styles without the need for extensive retraining. Despite the availability of over 100K LoRA adapters on platforms likethis http URL, users often face challenges in navigating, selecting, and effectively utilizing the most suitable adapters due to their sheer volume, diversity, and lack of structured organization. This paper addresses the problem of selecting the most relevant and diverse LoRA models from this vast database by framing the task as a combinatorial optimization problem and proposing a novel submodular framework. Our quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that our method generates diverse outputs across a wide range of domains.

  _Denis Rychkovskiy_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce CADE 2.5 (Comfy Adaptive Detail Enhancer), a sampler-level guidance stack for SD/SDXL latent diffusion models. The central module, ZeResFDG, unifies (i) frequency-decoupled guidance that reweights low- and high-frequency components of the guidance signal, (ii) energy rescaling that matches the per-sample magnitude of the guided prediction to the positive branch, and (iii) zero-projection that removes the component parallel to the unconditional direction. A lightweight spectral EMA with hysteresis switches between a conservative and a detail-seeking mode as structure crystallizes during sampling. Across SD/SDXL samplers, ZeResFDG improves sharpness, prompt adherence, and artifact control at moderate guidance scales without any retraining. In addition, we employ a training-free inference-time stabilizer, QSilk Micrograin Stabilizer (quantile clamp + depth/edge-gated micro-detail injection), which improves robustness and yields natural high-frequency micro-texture at high resolutions with negligible overhead. For completeness we note that the same rule is compatible with alternative parameterizations (e.g., velocity), which we briefly discuss in the Appendix; however, this paper focuses on SD/SDXL latent diffusion models.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Capturing screens is now routine in our everyday lives. But the photographs of emissive displays are often influenced by the flicker-banding (FB), which is alternating bright%u2013dark stripes that arise from temporal aliasing between a camera's rolling-shutter readout and the display's brightness modulation. Unlike moire degradation, which has been extensively studied, the FB remains underexplored despite its frequent and severe impact on readability and perceived quality. We formulate FB removal as a dedicated restoration task and introduce Removal of Image Flicker-Banding via Latent Diffusion Enhancement, RIFLE, a diffusion-based framework designed to remove FB while preserving fine details. We propose the flicker-banding prior estimator (FPE) that predicts key banding attributes and injects it into the restoration network. Additionally, Masked Loss (ML) is proposed to concentrate supervision on banded regions without sacrificing global fidelity. To overcome data scarcity, we provide a simulation pipeline that synthesizes FB in the luminance domain with stochastic jitter in banding angle, banding spacing, and banding width. Feathered boundaries and sensor noise are also applied for a more realistic simulation. For evaluation, we collect a paired real-world FB dataset with pixel-aligned banding-free references captured via long exposure. Across quantitative metrics and visual comparisons on our real-world dataset, RIFLE consistently outperforms recent image reconstruction baselines from mild to severe flicker-banding. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first work to research the simulation and removal of FB. Our work establishes a great foundation for subsequent research in both the dataset construction and the removal model design. Our dataset and code will be released soon.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Training deep neural networks has become increasingly demanding, requiring large datasets and significant computational resources, especially as model complexity advances. Data distillation methods, which aim to improve data efficiency, have emerged as promising solutions to this challenge. In the field of single image super-resolution (SISR), the reliance on large training datasets highlights the importance of these techniques. Recently, a generative adversarial network (GAN) inversion-based data distillation framework for SR was proposed, showing potential for better data utilization. However, the current method depends heavily on pre-trained SR networks and class-specific information, limiting its generalizability and applicability. To address these issues, we introduce a new data distillation approach for image SR that does not need class labels or pre-trained SR models. In particular, we first extract high-gradient patches and categorize images based on CLIP features, then fine-tune a diffusion model on the selected patches to learn their distribution and synthesize distilled training images. Experimental results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance while using significantly less training data and requiring less computational time. Specifically, when we train a baseline Transformer model for SR with only 0.68\% of the original dataset, the performance drop is just 0.3 dB. In this case, diffusion model fine-tuning takes 4 hours, and SR model training completes within 1 hour, much shorter than the 11-hour training time with the full dataset.

  Reconstructing clothed humans from a single image is a fundamental task in computer vision with wide-ranging applications. Although existing monocular clothed human reconstruction solutions have shown promising results, they often rely on the assumption that the human subject is in an occlusion-free environment. Thus, when encountering in-the-wild occluded images, these algorithms produce multiview inconsistent and fragmented reconstructions. Additionally, most algorithms for monocular 3D human reconstruction leverage geometric priors such as SMPL annotations for training and inference, which are extremely challenging to acquire in real-world applications. To address these limitations, we propose CHROME: Clothed Human Reconstruction with Occlusion-Resilience and Multiview-ConsistEncy from a Single Image, a novel pipeline designed to reconstruct occlusion-resilient 3D humans with multiview consistency from a single occluded image, without requiring either ground-truth geometric prior annotations or 3D supervision. Specifically, CHROME leverages a multiview diffusion model to first synthesize occlusion-free human images from the occluded input, compatible with off-the-shelf pose control to explicitly enforce cross-view consistency during synthesis. A 3D reconstruction model is then trained to predict a set of 3D Gaussians conditioned on both the occluded input and synthesized views, aligning cross-view details to produce a cohesive and accurate 3D representation. CHROME achieves significant improvements in terms of both novel view synthesis (upto 3 db PSNR) and geometric reconstruction under challenging conditions.

  We present a latent diffusion model for fast feed-forward 3D scene generation. Given one or more images, our model Bolt3D directly samples a 3D scene representation in less than seven seconds on a single GPU. We achieve this by leveraging powerful and scalable existing 2D diffusion network architectures to produce consistent high-fidelity 3D scene representations. To train this model, we create a large-scale multiview-consistent dataset of 3D geometry and appearance by applying state-of-the-art dense 3D reconstruction techniques to existing multiview image datasets. Compared to prior multiview generative models that require per-scene optimization for 3D reconstruction, Bolt3D reduces the inference cost by a factor of up to 300 times.

  Domain-generalizable re-identification (DG Re-ID) aims to train a model on one or more source domains and evaluate its performance on unseen target domains, a task that has attracted growing attention due to its practical relevance. While numerous methods have been proposed, most rely on discriminative or contrastive learning frameworks to learn generalizable feature representations. However, these approaches often fail to mitigate shortcut learning, leading to suboptimal performance. In this work, we propose a novel method called diffusion model-assisted representation learning with a correlation-aware conditioning scheme (DCAC) to enhance DG Re-ID. Our method integrates a discriminative and contrastive Re-ID model with a pre-trained diffusion model through a correlation-aware conditioning scheme. By incorporating ID classification probabilities generated from the Re-ID model with a set of learnable ID-wise prompts, the conditioning scheme injects dark knowledge that captures ID correlations to guide the diffusion process. Simultaneously, feedback from the diffusion model is back-propagated through the conditioning scheme to the Re-ID model, effectively improving the generalization capability of Re-ID features. Extensive experiments on both single-source and multi-source DG Re-ID tasks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance. Comprehensive ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, providing insights into its robustness. Codes will be available atthis https URL.

  Despite remarkable progress having been made on the problem of 3D human pose and shape estimation (HPS), current state-of-the-art methods rely heavily on either confined indoor mocap datasets or datasets generated by a rendering engine using computer graphics (CG). Both categories of datasets exhibit inadequacies in furnishing adequate human identities and authentic in-the-wild background scenes, which are crucial for accurately simulating real-world distributions. In this work, we show that synthetic data created by generative models is complementary to CG-rendered data for achieving remarkable generalization performance on diverse real-world scenes. We propose an effective data generation pipeline based on recent diffusion models, termed HumanWild, which can effortlessly generate human images and corresponding 3D mesh annotations. Specifically, we first collect a large-scale human-centric dataset with comprehensive annotations, e.g, text captions, the depth map, and surface normal images. To generate a wide variety of human images with initial labels, we train a customized, multi-condition ControlNet model. The key to this process is using a 3D parametric model, e.g, SMPL-X, to create various condition inputs easily. Our data generation pipeline is both flexible and customizable, making it adaptable to multiple real-world tasks, such as human interaction in complex scenes and humans captured by wide-angle lenses. By relying solely on generative models, we can produce large-scale, in-the-wild human images with high-quality annotations, significantly reducing the need for manual image collection and annotation. The generated dataset encompasses a wide range of viewpoints, environments, and human identities, ensuring its versatility across different scenarios. We hope that our work could pave the way for scaling up 3D human recovery to in-the-wild scenes.

  Current autoregressive language models (ARMs) achieve high accuracy but require long token sequences, making them costly. Discrete diffusion language models (DDLMs) enable parallel and flexible generation within a fixed number of steps and have recently emerged for their strong performance in complex reasoning and long-term planning tasks. We present a study exploring hybrid architectures that couple DDLMs with ARMs to assess whether their collaboration can yield complementary benefits. We first examine collaboration in text space, where one model plans the reasoning process and another executes the final answer based on that plan. We then extend this setup to latent-space communication, introducing a learned projector that maps DDLM latents into the ARM's embedding space, potentially bypassing some of the text-generation limitations of diffusion models. We find that shifting DDLM --> ARM communication from text space to latent space yields significant accuracy gains, for example increasing from 27.0% to 54.0% on DART-5 and from 0.0% to 14.0% on AIME24. We also find that combining a DDLM planner with an ARM executor can provide substantial computational savings with little to no impact on accuracy. For example, the latent-space pipeline, using 64 tokens for planning and roughly 5 for execution, surpasses Qwen3.1-7B on DART-5 and AIME, despite Qwen using 44 times more tokens. Overall, our study offers new insights into reasoning with DDLMs and highlights their potential in hybrid architectures.

  Masked Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) have recently emerged as a promising alternative to traditional Autoregressive Models (ARMs). DLMs employ transformer encoders with bidirectional attention, enabling parallel token generation while maintaining competitive performance. Although their efficiency and effectiveness have been extensively studied, the internal mechanisms that govern DLMs remain largely unexplored. In this work, we conduct an empirical analysis of DLM attention patterns, focusing on the attention sinking phenomenon, an effect previously observed in various transformer-based architectures. Our findings reveal that DLMs also exhibit attention sinks, but with distinct characteristics. First, unlike in ARMs, the sink positions in DLMs tend to shift throughout the generation process, displaying a dynamic behaviour. Second, while ARMs are highly sensitive to the removal of attention sinks, DLMs remain robust: masking sinks leads to only a minor degradation in performance. These results provide new insights into the inner workings of diffusion-based language models and highlight fundamental differences in how they allocate and utilize attention compared to autoregressive models.
