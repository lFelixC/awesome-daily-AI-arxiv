- **[mindmap: Spatial Memory in Deep Feature Maps for 3D Action Policies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20297)**  `arXiv:2509.20297`  `cs.RO`

  End-to-end learning of robot control policies, structured as neural networks, has emerged as a promising approach to robotic manipulation. To complete many common tasks, relevant objects are required to pass in and out of a robot's field of view. In these settings, spatial memory - the ability to remember the spatial composition of the scene - is an important competency. However, building such mechanisms into robot learning systems remains an open research problem. We introduce mindmap (Spatial Memory in Deep Feature Maps for 3D Action Policies), a 3D diffusion policy that generates robot trajectories based on a semantic 3D reconstruction of the environment. We show in simulation experiments that our approach is effective at solving tasks where state-of-the-art approaches without memory mechanisms struggle. We release our reconstruction system, training code, and evaluation tasks to spur research in this direction.

- **[Uni-Instruct: One-step Diffusion Model through Unified Diffusion Divergence Instruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20755)**  `arXiv:2505.20755`  `cs.LG` `cs.CV`

  In this paper, we unify more than 10 existing one-step diffusion distillation approaches, such as Diff-Instruct, DMD, SIM, SiD, $f$-distill, etc, inside a theory-driven framework which we name the \textbf{\emph{Uni-Instruct}}. Uni-Instruct is motivated by our proposed diffusion expansion theory of the $f$-divergence family. Then we introduce key theories that overcome the intractability issue of the original expanded $f$-divergence, resulting in an equivalent yet tractable loss that effectively trains one-step diffusion models by minimizing the expanded $f$-divergence family. The novel unification introduced by Uni-Instruct not only offers new theoretical contributions that help understand existing approaches from a high-level perspective but also leads to state-of-the-art one-step diffusion generation performances. On the CIFAR10 generation benchmark, Uni-Instruct achieves record-breaking Frechet Inception Distance (FID) values of \textbf{\emph{1.46}} for unconditional generation and \textbf{\emph{1.38}} for conditional generation. On the ImageNet-$64\times 64$ generation benchmark, Uni-Instruct achieves a new SoTA one-step generation FID of \textbf{\emph{1.02}}, which outperforms its 79-step teacher diffusion with a significant improvement margin of 1.33 (1.02 vs 2.35). We also apply Uni-Instruct on broader tasks like text-to-3D generation. For text-to-3D generation, Uni-Instruct gives decent results, which slightly outperforms previous methods, such as SDS and VSD, in terms of both generation quality and diversity. Both the solid theoretical and empirical contributions of Uni-Instruct will potentially help future studies on one-step diffusion distillation and knowledge transferring of diffusion models.

- **[Improving Discrete Diffusion Unmasking Policies Beyond Explicit Reference Policies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05725)**  `arXiv:2510.05725`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI` `cs.CL`  
  _Chunsan Hong, Seonho An, Min-Soo Kim, Jong Chul Ye_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Masked diffusion models (MDMs) have recently emerged as a novel framework for language modeling. MDMs generate sentences by iteratively denoising masked sequences, filling in [MASK] tokens step by step. Although MDMs support any-order sampling, performance is highly sensitive to the choice of which position to unmask next. Prior work typically relies on rule-based schedules (e.g., max-confidence, max-margin), which provide ad hoc improvements. In contrast, we replace these heuristics with a learned scheduler. Specifically, we cast denoising as a KL-regularized Markov decision process (MDP) with an explicit reference policy and optimize a regularized objective that admits policy improvement and convergence guarantees under standard assumptions. We prove that the optimized policy under this framework generates samples that more closely match the data distribution than heuristic schedules. Empirically, across four benchmarks, our learned policy consistently outperforms max-confidence: for example, on SUDOKU, where unmasking order is critical, it yields a 20.1% gain over random and a 11.2% gain over max-confidence.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate their reasoning ability through chain-of-thought (CoT) generation. However, LLM's autoregressive decoding may limit the ability to revisit and refine earlier tokens in a holistic manner, which can also lead to inefficient exploration for diverse solutions. In this paper, we propose LaDiR (Latent Diffusion Reasoner), a novel reasoning framework that unifies the expressiveness of continuous latent representation with the iterative refinement capabilities of latent diffusion models for an existing LLM. We first construct a structured latent reasoning space using a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) that encodes text reasoning steps into blocks of thought tokens, preserving semantic information and interpretability while offering compact but expressive representations. Subsequently, we utilize a latent diffusion model that learns to denoise a block of latent thought tokens with a blockwise bidirectional attention mask, enabling longer horizon and iterative refinement with adaptive test-time compute. This design allows efficient parallel generation of diverse reasoning trajectories, allowing the model to plan and revise the reasoning process holistically. We conduct evaluations on a suite of mathematical reasoning and planning benchmarks. Empirical results show that LaDiR consistently improves accuracy, diversity, and interpretability over existing autoregressive, diffusion-based, and latent reasoning methods, revealing a new paradigm for text reasoning with latent diffusion.

  The development of machine learning for cardiac care is severely hampered by privacy restrictions on sharing real patient electrocardiogram (ECG) data. Although generative AI offers a promising solution, the real-world use of existing model-synthesized ECGs is limited by persistent gaps in trustworthiness and clinical utility. In this work, we address two major shortcomings of current generative ECG methods: insufficient morphological fidelity and the inability to generate personalized, patient-specific physiological signals. To address these gaps, we build on a conditional diffusion-based Structured State Space Model (SSSD-ECG) with two principled innovations: (1) MIDT-ECG (Mel-Spectrogram Informed Diffusion Training), a novel training paradigm with time-frequency domain supervision to enforce physiological structural realism, and (2) multi-modal demographic conditioning to enable patient-specific synthesis. We comprehensively evaluate our approach on the PTB-XL dataset, assessing the synthesized ECG signals on fidelity, clinical coherence, privacy preservation, and downstream task utility. MIDT-ECG achieves substantial gains: it improves morphological coherence, preserves strong privacy guarantees with all metrics evaluated exceeding the baseline by 4-8%, and notably reduces the interlead correlation error by an average of 74%, while demographic conditioning enhances signal-to-noise ratio and personalization. In critical low-data regimes, a classifier trained on datasets supplemented with our synthetic ECGs achieves performance comparable to a classifier trained solely on real data. Together, we demonstrate that ECG synthesizers, trained with the proposed time-frequency structural regularization scheme, can serve as personalized, high-fidelity, privacy-preserving surrogates when real data are scarce, advancing the responsible use of generative AI in healthcare.

- **[On Powerful Ways to Generate: Autoregression, Diffusion, and Beyond](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06190)**  `arXiv:2510.06190`  `cs.LG`  
  _Chenxiao Yang, Cai Zhou, David Wipf, Zhiyuan Li_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper formally studies generation processes, including auto-regressive next-token prediction and masked diffusion, that abstract beyond architectural specifics. At this level of abstraction, we quantify their benefits and limitations through measurable criteria such as computational hardness and learnability. In particular, we demonstrate that allowing generation to proceed beyond autoregression and current masked diffusion, with capabilities to rewrite and length-variable edit, can bring significant theoretical and empirical advantages, with important implications for frontier LLMs that aspire to tackle increasingly hard problems and work universally across domains beyond natural language, such as coding and science.

- **[Edit-Based Flow Matching for Temporal Point Processes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06050)**  `arXiv:2510.06050`  `cs.LG`  
  _David L√ºdke, Marten Lienen, Marcel Kollovieh, Stephan G√ºnnemann_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Temporal point processes (TPPs) are a fundamental tool for modeling event sequences in continuous time, but most existing approaches rely on autoregressive parameterizations that are limited by their sequential sampling. Recent non-autoregressive, diffusion-style models mitigate these issues by jointly interpolating between noise and data through event insertions and deletions in a discrete Markov chain. In this work, we generalize this perspective and introduce an Edit Flow process for TPPs that transports noise to data via insert, delete, and substitute edit operations. By learning the instantaneous edit rates within a continuous-time Markov chain framework, we attain a flexible and efficient model that effectively reduces the total number of necessary edit operations during generation. Empirical results demonstrate the generative flexibility of our unconditionally trained model in a wide range of unconditional and conditional generation tasks on benchmark TPPs.

- **[DiffSDA: Unsupervised Diffusion Sequential Disentanglement Across Modalities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05717)**  `arXiv:2510.05717`  `cs.LG`  
  _Hedi Zisling, Ilan Naiman, Nimrod Berman, Supasorn Suwajanakorn, Omri Azencot_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Unsupervised representation learning, particularly sequential disentanglement, aims to separate static and dynamic factors of variation in data without relying on labels. This remains a challenging problem, as existing approaches based on variational autoencoders and generative adversarial networks often rely on multiple loss terms, complicating the optimization process. Furthermore, sequential disentanglement methods face challenges when applied to real-world data, and there is currently no established evaluation protocol for assessing their performance in such settings. Recently, diffusion models have emerged as state-of-the-art generative models, but no theoretical formalization exists for their application to sequential disentanglement. In this work, we introduce the Diffusion Sequential Disentanglement Autoencoder (DiffSDA), a novel, modal-agnostic framework effective across diverse real-world data modalities, including time series, video, and audio. DiffSDA leverages a new probabilistic modeling, latent diffusion, and efficient samplers, while incorporating a challenging evaluation protocol for rigorous testing. Our experiments on diverse real-world benchmarks demonstrate that DiffSDA outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods in sequential disentanglement.

- **[Unifying Autoregressive and Diffusion-Based Sequence Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06416)**  `arXiv:2504.06416`  `cs.LG`  
  _Nima Fathi, Torsten Scholak, Pierre-Andr√© No√´l_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present significant extensions to diffusion-based sequence generation models, blurring the line with autoregressive language models. We introduce hyperschedules, which assign distinct noise schedules to individual token positions, generalizing both autoregressive models (e.g., GPT) and conventional diffusion models (e.g., SEDD, MDLM) as special cases. Second, we propose two hybrid token-wise noising processes that interpolate between absorbing and uniform processes, enabling the model to fix past mistakes, and we introduce a novel inference algorithm that leverages this new feature in a simplified context inspired from MDLM. To support efficient training and inference, we design attention masks compatible with KV-caching. Our methods achieve state-of-the-art perplexity and generate diverse, high-quality sequences across standard benchmarks, suggesting a promising path for autoregressive diffusion-based sequence generation.

- **[Cross-Domain Graph Data Scaling: A Showcase with Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01899)**  `arXiv:2406.01899`  `cs.LG`  
  _Wenzhuo Tang, Haitao Mao, Danial Dervovic, Ivan Brugere, Saumitra Mishra, Yuying Xie, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Models for natural language and images benefit from data scaling behavior: the more data fed into the model, the better they perform. This 'better with more' phenomenon enables the effectiveness of large-scale pre-training on vast amounts of data. However, current graph pre-training methods struggle to scale up data due to heterogeneity across graphs. To achieve effective data scaling, we aim to develop a general model that is able to capture diverse data patterns of graphs and can be utilized to adaptively help the downstream tasks. To this end, we propose UniAug, a universal graph structure augmentor built on a diffusion model. We first pre-train a discrete diffusion model on thousands of graphs across domains to learn the graph structural patterns. In the downstream phase, we provide adaptive enhancement by conducting graph structure augmentation with the help of the pre-trained diffusion model via guided generation. By leveraging the pre-trained diffusion model for structure augmentation, we consistently achieve performance improvements across various downstream tasks in a plug-and-play manner. To the best of our knowledge, this study represents the first demonstration of a data-scaling graph structure augmentor on graphs across domains.

- **[LightCache: Memory-Efficient, Training-Free Acceleration for Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05367)**  `arXiv:2510.05367`  `cs.CV` `cs.LG`  
  _Yang Xiao, Gen Li, Kaiyuan Deng, Yushu Wu, Zheng Zhan, Yanzhi Wang, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Training-free acceleration has emerged as an advanced research area in video generation based on diffusion models. The redundancy of latents in diffusion model inference provides a natural entry point for acceleration. In this paper, we decompose the inference process into the encoding, denoising, and decoding stages, and observe that cache-based acceleration methods often lead to substantial memory surges in the latter two stages. To address this problem, we analyze the characteristics of inference across different stages and propose stage-specific strategies for reducing memory consumption: 1) Asynchronous Cache Swapping. 2) Feature chunk. 3) Slicing latents to decode. At the same time, we ensure that the time overhead introduced by these three strategies remains lower than the acceleration gains themselves. Compared with the baseline, our approach achieves faster inference speed and lower memory usage, while maintaining quality degradation within an acceptable range.

- **[Mitigating Diffusion Model Hallucinations with Dynamic Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05356)**  `arXiv:2510.05356`  `cs.CV` `cs.LG`  
  _Kostas Triaridis, Alexandros Graikos, Aggelina Chatziagapi, Grigorios G. Chrysos, Dimitris Samaras_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Diffusion models, despite their impressive demos, often produce hallucinatory samples with structural inconsistencies that lie outside of the support of the true data distribution. Such hallucinations can be attributed to excessive smoothing between modes of the data distribution. However, semantic interpolations are often desirable and can lead to generation diversity, thus we believe a more nuanced solution is required. In this work, we introduce Dynamic Guidance, which tackles this issue. Dynamic Guidance mitigates hallucinations by selectively sharpening the score function only along the pre-determined directions known to cause artifacts, while preserving valid semantic variations. To our knowledge, this is the first approach that addresses hallucinations at generation time rather than through post-hoc filtering. Dynamic Guidance substantially reduces hallucinations on both controlled and natural image datasets, significantly outperforming baselines.

- **[A weakly-supervised deep learning model for fast localisation and delineation of the skeleton, internal organs, and spinal canal on Whole-Body Diffusion-Weighted MRI (WB-DWI)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20722)**  `arXiv:2503.20722`  `cs.CV` `cs.LG`  
  _A. Candito, A. Dragan, R. Holbrey, A. Ribeiro, R. Donners, C. Messiou, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Background: Apparent Diffusion Coefficient (ADC) values and Total Diffusion Volume (TDV) from Whole-body diffusion-weighted MRI (WB-DWI) are recognized cancer imaging biomarkers. However, manual disease delineation for ADC and TDV measurements is unfeasible in clinical practice, demanding automation. As a first step, we propose an algorithm to generate fast and reproducible probability maps of the skeleton, adjacent internal organs (liver, spleen, urinary bladder, and kidneys), and spinal canal. Methods: We developed an automated deep-learning pipeline based on a 3D patch-based Residual U-Net architecture that localises and delineates these anatomical structures on WB-DWI. The algorithm was trained using "soft labels" (non-binary segmentations) derived from a computationally intensive atlas-based approach. For training and validation, we employed a multi-centre WB-DWI dataset comprising 532 scans from patients with Advanced Prostate Cancer (APC) or Multiple Myeloma (MM), with testing on 45 patients. Results: Our weakly-supervised deep learning model achieved an average dice score of 0.67 for whole skeletal delineation, 0.76 when excluding ribcage, 0.83 for internal organs, and 0.86 for spinal canal, with average surface distances below 3mm. Relative median ADC differences between automated and manual full-body delineations were below 10%. The model was 12x faster than the atlas-based registration algorithm (25 sec vs. 5 min). Two experienced radiologists rated the model's outputs as either "good" or "excellent" on test scans, with inter-reader agreement from fair to substantial (Gwet's AC1 = 0.27-0.72). Conclusion: The model offers fast, reproducible probability maps for localising and delineating body regions on WB-DWI, potentially enabling non-invasive imaging biomarker quantification to support disease staging and treatment response assessment.

  _Aditya Prakash, David Forsyth, Saurabh Gupta_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We tackle the problem of forecasting bimanual 3D hand motion & articulation from a single image in everyday settings. To address the lack of 3D hand annotations in diverse settings, we design an annotation pipeline consisting of a diffusion model to lift 2D hand keypoint sequences to 4D hand motion. For the forecasting model, we adopt a diffusion loss to account for the multimodality in hand motion distribution. Extensive experiments across 6 datasets show the benefits of training on diverse data with imputed labels (14% improvement) and effectiveness of our lifting (42% better) & forecasting (16.4% gain) models, over the best baselines, especially in zero-shot generalization to everyday images.

  Low-light image enhancement (LLIE) is vital for safety-critical applications such as surveillance, autonomous navigation, and medical imaging, where visibility degradation can impair downstream task performance. Recently, diffusion models have emerged as a promising generative paradigm for LLIE due to their capacity to model complex image distributions via iterative denoising. This survey provides an up-to-date critical analysis of diffusion models for LLIE, distinctively featuring an in-depth comparative performance evaluation against Generative Adversarial Network and Transformer-based state-of-the-art methods, a thorough examination of practical deployment challenges, and a forward-looking perspective on the role of emerging paradigms like foundation models. We propose a multi-perspective taxonomy encompassing six categories: Intrinsic Decomposition, Spectral & Latent, Accelerated, Guided, Multimodal, and Autonomous; that map enhancement methods across physical priors, conditioning schemes, and computational efficiency. Our taxonomy is grounded in a hybrid view of both the model mechanism and the conditioning signals. We evaluate qualitative failure modes, benchmark inconsistencies, and trade-offs between interpretability, generalization, and inference efficiency. We also discuss real-world deployment constraints (e.g., memory, energy use) and ethical considerations. This survey aims to guide the next generation of diffusion-based LLIE research by highlighting trends and surfacing open research questions, including novel conditioning, real-time adaptation, and the potential of foundation models.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Autoregressive point cloud generation has long lagged behind diffusion-based approaches in quality. The performance gap stems from the fact that autoregressive models impose an artificial ordering on inherently unordered point sets, forcing shape generation to proceed as a sequence of local predictions. This sequential bias emphasizes short-range continuity but undermines the model's capacity to capture long-range dependencies, hindering its ability to enforce global structural properties such as symmetry, consistent topology, and large-scale geometric regularities. Inspired by the level-of-detail (LOD) principle in shape modeling, we propose PointNSP, a coarse-to-fine generative framework that preserves global shape structure at low resolutions and progressively refines fine-grained geometry at higher scales through a next-scale prediction paradigm. This multi-scale factorization aligns the autoregressive objective with the permutation-invariant nature of point sets, enabling rich intra-scale interactions while avoiding brittle fixed orderings. Experiments on ShapeNet show that PointNSP establishes state-of-the-art (SOTA) generation quality for the first time within the autoregressive paradigm. In addition, it surpasses strong diffusion-based baselines in parameter, training, and inference efficiency. Finally, in dense generation with 8,192 points, PointNSP's advantages become even more pronounced, underscoring its scalability potential.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in generative medical models are constrained by modality-specific scenarios that hinder the integration of complementary evidence from imaging, pathology, and clinical notes. This fragmentation limits their evolution into foundation models that can learn and reason across the full spectrum of biomedical data. We propose MeDiM, the first medical discrete diffusion model that learns shared distributions across modalities without modality-specific components. MeDiM unifies multiple generative tasks: translating between images and text, and jointly producing image-report pairs across domains in response to prompts. Built on a discrete diffusion framework, MeDiM bridges vision and language representations through a shared probabilistic space. To enable unified and flexible medical generation, we employ a multimodal large language model (MLLM) as the diffusion backbone, leveraging its prior knowledge and cross-modal reasoning. Two key designs are introduced: (1) removing the causal attention mask for bidirectional context, and (2) injecting continuous timestep embeddings for diffusion awareness. Experiments demonstrate high-fidelity medical generation (FID 16.60 on MIMIC-CXR and FID 24.19 on PathGen) and accurate report generation (METEOR 0.2650 and 0.2580). Jointly generated image-report pairs further enhance downstream performance (plus6.43 percent BLEU-1, plus18.57 percent BLEU-2, plus31.58 percent BLEU-3, plus4.80 percent METEOR), showing that MeDiM supports coherent and clinically grounded multimodal outputs.

  The emergence of visual autoregressive (AR) models has revolutionized image generation while presenting new challenges for synthetic image detection. Unlike previous GAN or diffusion-based methods, AR models generate images through discrete token prediction, exhibiting both marked improvements in image synthesis quality and unique characteristics in their vector-quantized representations. In this paper, we propose to leverage Discrete Distribution Discrepancy-aware Quantization Error (D$^3$QE) for autoregressive-generated image detection that exploits the distinctive patterns and the frequency distribution bias of the codebook existing in real and fake images. We introduce a discrete distribution discrepancy-aware transformer that integrates dynamic codebook frequency statistics into its attention mechanism, fusing semantic features and quantization error latent. To evaluate our method, we construct a comprehensive dataset termed ARForensics covering 7 mainstream visual AR models. Experiments demonstrate superior detection accuracy and strong generalization of D$^3$QE across different AR models, with robustness to real-world perturbations.

- **[See the past: Time-Reversed Scene Reconstruction from Thermal Traces Using Visual Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05408)**  `arXiv:2510.05408`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`  
  _Kebin Contreras, Luis Toscano-Palomino, Mauro Dalla Mura, Jorge Bacca_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recovering the past from present observations is an intriguing challenge with potential applications in forensics and scene analysis. Thermal imaging, operating in the infrared range, provides access to otherwise invisible information. Since humans are typically warmer (37 C -98.6 F) than their surroundings, interactions such as sitting, touching, or leaning leave residual heat traces. These fading imprints serve as passive temporal codes, allowing for the inference of recent events that exceed the capabilities of RGB cameras. This work proposes a time-reversed reconstruction framework that uses paired RGB and thermal images to recover scene states from a few seconds earlier. The proposed approach couples Visual-Language Models (VLMs) with a constrained diffusion process, where one VLM generates scene descriptions and another guides image reconstruction, ensuring semantic and structural consistency. The method is evaluated in three controlled scenarios, demonstrating the feasibility of reconstructing plausible past frames up to 120 seconds earlier, providing a first step toward time-reversed imaging from thermal traces.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Current text-to-image diffusion models excel at generating diverse, high-quality images, yet they struggle to incorporate fine-grained camera metadata such as precise aperture settings. In this work, we introduce a novel text-to-image diffusion framework that leverages camera metadata, or EXIF data, which is often embedded in image files, with an emphasis on generating controllable lens blur. Our method mimics the physical image formation process by first generating an all-in-focus image, estimating its monocular depth, predicting a plausible focus distance with a novel focus distance transformer, and then forming a defocused image with an existing differentiable lens blur model. Gradients flow backwards through this whole process, allowing us to learn without explicit supervision to generate defocus effects based on content elements and the provided EXIF data. At inference time, this enables precise interactive user control over defocus effects while preserving scene contents, which is not achievable with existing diffusion models. Experimental results demonstrate that our model enables superior fine-grained control without altering the depicted scene.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Robust invisible watermarking aims to embed hidden information into images such that the watermark can survive various image manipulations. However, the rise of powerful diffusion-based image generation and editing techniques poses a new threat to these watermarking schemes. In this paper, we present a theoretical study and method demonstrating that diffusion models can effectively break robust image watermarks that were designed to resist conventional perturbations. We show that a diffusion-driven ``image regeneration'' process can erase embedded watermarks while preserving perceptual image content. We further introduce a novel guided diffusion attack that explicitly targets the watermark signal during generation, significantly degrading watermark detectability. Theoretically, we prove that as an image undergoes sufficient diffusion-based transformation, the mutual information between the watermarked image and the embedded watermark payload vanishes, resulting in decoding failure. Experimentally, we evaluate our approach on multiple state-of-the-art watermarking schemes (including the deep learning-based methods StegaStamp, TrustMark, and VINE) and demonstrate near-zero watermark recovery rates after attack, while maintaining high visual fidelity of the regenerated images. Our findings highlight a fundamental vulnerability in current robust watermarking techniques against generative model-based attacks, underscoring the need for new watermarking strategies in the era of generative AI.

  Generating enough and diverse data through augmentation offers an efficient solution to the time-consuming and labour-intensive process of collecting and annotating pixel-wise images. Traditional data augmentation techniques often face challenges in manipulating high-level semantic attributes, such as materials and textures. In contrast, diffusion models offer a robust alternative, by effectively utilizing text-to-image or image-to-image transformation. However, existing diffusion-based methods are either computationally expensive or compromise on performance. To address this issue, we introduce a novel training-free pipeline that integrates pretrained ControlNet and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to generate synthetic images paired with pixel-level labels. This approach eliminates the need for manual annotations and significantly improves downstream tasks. To improve the fidelity and diversity, we add a Multi-way Prompt Generator, Mask Generator and High-quality Image Selection module. Our results on PASCAL-5i and COCO-20i present promising performance and outperform concurrent work for one-shot semantic segmentation.

  Recent diffusion model research focuses on generating identity-consistent images from a reference photo, but they struggle to accurately control age while preserving identity, and fine-tuning such models often requires costly paired images across ages. In this paper, we propose AgeBooth, a novel age-specific finetuning approach that can effectively enhance the age control capability of adapterbased identity personalization models without the need for expensive age-varied datasets. To reduce dependence on a large amount of age-labeled data, we exploit the linear nature of aging by introducing age-conditioned prompt blending and an age-specific LoRA fusion strategy that leverages SVDMix, a matrix fusion technique. These techniques enable high-quality generation of intermediate-age portraits. Our AgeBooth produces realistic and identity-consistent face images across different ages from a single reference image. Experiments show that AgeBooth achieves superior age control and visual quality compared to previous state-of-the-art editing-based methods.

  The task of realistically inserting a human from a reference image into a background scene is highly challenging, requiring the model to (1) determine the correct location and poses of the person and (2) perform high-quality personalization conditioned on the background. Previous approaches often treat them as separate problems, overlooking their interconnections, and typically rely on training to achieve high performance. In this work, we introduce a unified training-free pipeline that leverages pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models. We show that diffusion models inherently possess the knowledge to place people in complex scenes without requiring task-specific training. By combining inversion techniques with classifier-free guidance, our method achieves affordance-aware global editing, seamlessly inserting people into scenes. Furthermore, our proposed mask-guided self-attention mechanism ensures high-quality personalization, preserving the subject's identity, clothing, and body features from just a single reference image. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to perform realistic human insertions into scenes in a training-free manner and achieve state-of-the-art results in diverse composite scene images with excellent identity preservation in backgrounds and subjects.

  Recent advances in autoregressive (AR) models have demonstrated their potential to rival diffusion models in image synthesis. However, for complex spatially-conditioned generation, current AR approaches rely on fine-tuning the pre-trained model, leading to significant training costs. In this paper, we propose the Efficient Control Model (ECM), a plug-and-play framework featuring a lightweight control module that introduces control signals via a distributed architecture. This architecture consists of context-aware attention layers that refine conditional features using real-time generated tokens, and a shared gated feed-forward network (FFN) designed to maximize the utilization of its limited capacity and ensure coherent control feature learning. Furthermore, recognizing the critical role of early-stage generation in determining semantic structure, we introduce an early-centric sampling strategy that prioritizes learning early control sequences. This approach reduces computational cost by lowering the number of training tokens per iteration, while a complementary temperature scheduling during inference compensates for the resulting insufficient training of late-stage tokens. Extensive experiments on scale-based AR models validate that our method achieves high-fidelity and diverse control over image generation, surpassing existing baselines while significantly improving both training and inference efficiency.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Diffusion models are powerful deep generative models (DGMs) that generate high-fidelity, diverse content. However, unlike classical DGMs, they lack an explicit, tractable low-dimensional latent space that parameterizes the data manifold. This absence limits manifold-aware analysis and operations, such as interpolation and editing. Existing interpolation methods for diffusion models typically follow paths through high-density regions, which are not necessarily aligned with the data manifold and can yield perceptually unnatural transitions. To exploit the data manifold learned by diffusion models, we propose a novel Riemannian metric on the noise space, inspired by recent findings that the Jacobian of the score function captures the tangent spaces to the local data manifold. This metric encourages geodesics in the noise space to stay within or run parallel to the learned data manifold. Experiments on image interpolation show that our metric produces perceptually more natural and faithful transitions than existing density-based and naive baselines.

  Neural scene representations, such as 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), have enabled high-quality neural rendering; however, their large storage and transmission costs hinder deployment in resource-constrained environments. Existing compression methods either rely on costly optimization, which is slow and scene-specific, or adopt training-free pruning and quantization, which degrade rendering quality under high compression ratios. In contrast, recent data-driven approaches provide a promising direction to overcome this trade-off, enabling efficient compression while preserving high rendering quality. We introduce ExGS, a novel feed-forward framework that unifies Universal Gaussian Compression (UGC) with GaussPainter for Extreme 3DGS compression. UGC performs re-optimization-free pruning to aggressively reduce Gaussian primitives while retaining only essential information, whereas GaussPainter leverages powerful diffusion priors with mask-guided refinement to restore high-quality renderings from heavily pruned Gaussian scenes. Unlike conventional inpainting, GaussPainter not only fills in missing regions but also enhances visible pixels, yielding substantial improvements in degraded renderings. To ensure practicality, it adopts a lightweight VAE and a one-step diffusion design, enabling real-time restoration. Our framework can even achieve over 100X compression (reducing a typical 354.77 MB model to about 3.31 MB) while preserving fidelity and significantly improving image quality under challenging conditions. These results highlight the central role of diffusion priors in bridging the gap between extreme compression and high-quality neural rendering. Our code repository will be released at:this https URL

  Recent advances in diffusion models have revolutionized text-guided image editing, yet existing editing methods face critical challenges in hyperparameter identification. To get the reasonable editing performance, these methods often require the user to brute-force tune multiple interdependent hyperparameters, such as inversion timesteps and attention modification. This process incurs high computational costs due to the huge hyperparameter search space. We consider searching optimal editing's hyperparameters as a sequential decision-making task within the diffusion denoising process. Specifically, we propose a reinforcement learning framework, which establishes a Markov Decision Process that dynamically adjusts hyperparameters across denoising steps, integrating editing objectives into a reward function. The method achieves time efficiency through proximal policy optimization while maintaining optimal hyperparameter configurations. Experiments demonstrate significant reduction in search time and computational overhead compared to existing brute-force approaches, advancing the practical deployment of a diffusion-based image editing framework in the real world.

  Diffusion models have achieved unprecedented success in image generation but pose increasing risks in terms of privacy, fairness, and security. A growing demand exists to \emph{erase} sensitive or harmful concepts (e.g., NSFW content, private individuals, artistic styles) from these models while preserving their overall generative capabilities. We introduce \textbf{SCORE} (Secure and Concept-Oriented Robust Erasure), a novel framework for robust concept removal in diffusion models. SCORE formulates concept erasure as an \emph{adversarial independence} problem, theoretically guaranteeing that the model's outputs become statistically independent of the erased concept. Unlike prior heuristic methods, SCORE minimizes the mutual information between a target concept and generated outputs, yielding provable erasure guarantees. We provide formal proofs establishing convergence properties and derive upper bounds on residual concept leakage. Empirically, we evaluate SCORE on Stable Diffusion and FLUX across four challenging benchmarks: object erasure, NSFW removal, celebrity face suppression, and artistic style unlearning. SCORE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods including EraseAnything, ANT, MACE, ESD, and UCE, achieving up to \textbf{12.5\%} higher erasure efficacy while maintaining comparable or superior image quality. By integrating adversarial optimization, trajectory consistency, and saliency-driven fine-tuning, SCORE sets a new standard for secure and robust concept erasure in diffusion models.

  We introduce OneCAT, a unified multimodal model that seamlessly integrates understanding, generation, and editing within a novel, pure decoder-only transformer architecture. Our framework uniquely eliminates the need for external components such as Vision Transformers (ViT) or vision tokenizer during inference, leading to significant efficiency gains, especially for high-resolution inputs. This is achieved through a modality-specific Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) structure trained with a single autoregressive (AR) objective, which also natively supports dynamic resolutions. Furthermore, we pioneer a multi-scale visual autoregressive mechanism within the Large Language Model (LLM) that drastically reduces decoding steps compared to diffusion-based methods while maintaining state-of-the-art performance. Our findings demonstrate the powerful potential of pure autoregressive modeling as a sufficient and elegant foundation for unified multimodal intelligence. As a result, OneCAT sets a new performance standard, outperforming existing open-source unified multimodal models across benchmarks for multimodal generation, editing, and understanding.

  While multi-step diffusion models have advanced both forward and inverse rendering, existing approaches often treat these problems independently, leading to cycle inconsistency and slow inference speed. In this work, we present Ouroboros, a framework composed of two single-step diffusion models that handle forward and inverse rendering with mutual reinforcement. Our approach extends intrinsic decomposition to both indoor and outdoor scenes and introduces a cycle consistency mechanism that ensures coherence between forward and inverse rendering outputs. Experimental results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across diverse scenes while achieving substantially faster inference speed compared to other diffusion-based methods. We also demonstrate that Ouroboros can transfer to video decomposition in a training-free manner, reducing temporal inconsistency in video sequences while maintaining high-quality per-frame inverse rendering.

  Recent video diffusion models have demonstrated their great capability in generating visually-pleasing results, while synthesizing the correct physical effects in generated videos remains challenging. The complexity of real-world motions, interactions, and dynamics introduce great difficulties when learning physics from data. In this work, we propose DiffPhy, a generic framework that enables physically-correct and photo-realistic video generation by fine-tuning a pre-trained video diffusion model. Our method leverages large language models (LLMs) to infer rich physical context from the text prompt. To incorporate this context into the video diffusion model, we use a multimodal large language model (MLLM) to verify intermediate latent variables against the inferred physical rules, guiding the gradient updates of model accordingly. Textual output of LLM is transformed into continuous signals. We then formulate a set of training objectives that jointly ensure physical accuracy and semantic alignment with the input text. Additionally, failure facts of physical phenomena are corrected via attention injection. We also establish a high-quality physical video dataset containing diverse phyiscal actions and events to facilitate effective finetuning. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks demonstrate that DiffPhy is able to produce state-of-the-art results across diverse physics-related scenarios.

  Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) are essential for video generation but suffer from significant latency due to the quadratic complexity of attention. By computing only critical tokens, sparse attention reduces computational costs and offers a promising acceleration approach. However, we identify that existing methods fail to approach optimal generation quality under the same computation budget for two reasons: (1) Inaccurate critical token identification: current methods cluster tokens based on position rather than semantics, leading to imprecise aggregated representations. (2) Excessive computation waste: critical tokens are scattered among non-critical ones, leading to wasted computation on GPUs, which are optimized for processing contiguous tokens. In this paper, we propose SVG2, a training-free framework that maximizes identification accuracy and minimizes computation waste, achieving a Pareto frontier trade-off between generation quality and efficiency. The core of SVG2 is semantic-aware permutation, which clusters and reorders tokens based on semantic similarity using k-means. This approach ensures both a precise cluster representation, improving identification accuracy, and a densified layout of critical tokens, enabling efficient computation without padding. Additionally, SVG2 integrates top-p dynamic budget control and customized kernel implementations, achieving up to 2.30x and 1.89x speedup while maintaining a PSNR of up to 30 and 26 on HunyuanVideo and Wan 2.1, respectively.

  The remarkable progress in text-to-video diffusion models enables the generation of photorealistic videos, although the content of these generated videos often includes unnatural movement or deformation, reverse playback, and motionless scenes. Recently, an alignment problem has attracted huge attention, where we steer the output of diffusion models based on some measure of the content's goodness. Because there is a large room for improvement of perceptual quality along the frame direction, we should address which metrics we should optimize and how we can optimize them in the video generation. In this paper, we propose diffusion latent beam search with lookahead estimator, which can select a better diffusion latent to maximize a given alignment reward at inference time. We then point out that improving perceptual video quality with respect to alignment to prompts requires reward calibration by weighting existing metrics. This is because when humans or vision language models evaluate outputs, many previous metrics to quantify the naturalness of video do not always correlate with the evaluation. We demonstrate that our method improves the perceptual quality evaluated on the calibrated reward, VLMs, and human assessment, without model parameter update, and outputs the best generation compared to greedy search and best-of-N sampling under much more efficient computational cost. The experiments highlight that our method is beneficial to many capable generative models, and provide a practical guideline: we should prioritize the inference-time compute allocation into enabling the lookahead estimator and increasing the search budget, rather than expanding the denoising steps.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) generate text through iterative denoising steps, achieving parallel decoding by denoising only high-confidence positions at each step. However, existing approaches often repetitively remask tokens due to initially low confidence scores, leading to redundant iterations and limiting overall acceleration. Through the analysis of dLLM decoding traces, we observe that the model often determines the final prediction for a token several steps before the decoding step. To leverage this historical information and avoid redundant steps, we introduce the concept of Trace Credit, which quantifies each token's convergence potential by accumulating historical logits. Furthermore, we propose CreditDecoding, a training-free parallel decoding algorithm that accelerates the confidence convergence of correct but underconfident tokens by fusing current logits with Trace Credit. This process significantly reduces redundant iterations and enhances decoding robustness. On eight benchmarks, CreditDecoding achieves a 5.48 times speedup and a 0.48 performance improvement over LLaDA-8B-Instruct, and a 4.11 times speedup with a 0.15 performance improvement over LLaDA-MoE-Instruct. Importantly, CreditDecoding scales effectively to long sequences and is orthogonal to mainstream inference optimizations, making it a readily integrable and versatile solution.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Discrete Diffusion Large Language Models (dLLMs) have recently emerged as a competitive paradigm for non-autoregressive language modeling. Their distinctive decoding mechanism enables faster inference speed and strong performance in code generation and mathematical tasks. In this work, we show that the decoding mechanism of dLLMs not only enhances model utility but also can be used as a powerful tool for model attribution. A key challenge in this problem lies in the diversity of attribution scenarios, including distinguishing between different models as well as between different checkpoints or backups of the same model. To ensure broad applicability, we identify two fundamental problems: what information to extract from the decoding trajectory, and how to utilize it effectively. We first observe that relying directly on per-step model confidence yields poor performance. This is mainly due to the bidirectional decoding nature of dLLMs: each newly decoded token influences the confidence of other decoded tokens, making model confidence highly redundant and washing out structural signal regarding decoding order or dependencies. To overcome this, we propose a novel information extraction scheme called the Directed Decoding Map (DDM), which captures structural relationships between decoding steps and better reveals model-specific behaviors. Furthermore, to make full use of the extracted structural information during attribution, we propose Gaussian-Trajectory Attribution (GTA), where we fit a cell-wise Gaussian distribution at each decoding position for each target model, and define the likelihood of a trajectory as the attribution score: if a trajectory exhibits higher log-likelihood under the distribution of a specific model, it is more likely to have been generated by that model. Extensive experiments under different settings validate the utility of our methods.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Predicting the virality of online content remains challenging, especially for culturally complex, fast-evolving memes. This study investigates the feasibility of early prediction of meme virality using a large-scale, cross-lingual dataset from 25 diverse Reddit communities. We propose a robust, data-driven method to define virality based on a hybrid engagement score, learning a percentile-based threshold from a chronologically held-out training set to prevent data leakage. We evaluated a suite of models, including Logistic Regression, XGBoost, and a Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP), with a comprehensive, multimodal feature set across increasing time windows (30-420 min). Crucially, useful signals emerge quickly: our best-performing model, XGBoost, achieves a PR-AUC $>$ 0.52 in just 30 minutes. Our analysis reveals a clear "evidentiary transition," in which the importance of the feature dynamically shifts from the static context to the temporal dynamics as a meme gains traction. This work establishes a robust, interpretable, and practical benchmark for early virality prediction in scenarios where full diffusion cascade data is unavailable, contributing a novel cross-lingual dataset and a methodologically sound definition of virality. To our knowledge, this study is the first to combine time series data with static content and network features to predict early meme virality.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Cognitive diagnostics in the Web-based Intelligent Education System (WIES) aims to assess students' mastery of knowledge concepts from heterogeneous, noisy interactions. Recent work has tried to utilize Large Language Models (LLMs) for cognitive diagnosis, yet LLMs struggle with structured data and are prone to noise-induced misjudgments. Specially, WIES's open environment continuously attracts new students and produces vast amounts of response logs, exacerbating the data imbalance and noise issues inherent in traditional educational systems. To address these challenges, we propose DLLM, a Diffusion-based LLM framework for noise-robust cognitive diagnosis. DLLM first constructs independent subgraphs based on response correctness, then applies relation augmentation alignment module to mitigate data imbalance. The two subgraph representations are then fused and aligned with LLM-derived, semantically augmented representations. Importantly, before each alignment step, DLLM employs a two-stage denoising diffusion module to eliminate intrinsic noise while assisting structural representation alignment. Specifically, unconditional denoising diffusion first removes erroneous information, followed by conditional denoising diffusion based on graph-guided to eliminate misleading information. Finally, the noise-robust representation that integrates semantic knowledge and structural information is fed into existing cognitive diagnosis models for prediction. Experimental results on three publicly available web-based educational platform datasets demonstrate that our DLLM achieves optimal predictive performance across varying noise levels, which demonstrates that DLLM achieves noise robustness while effectively leveraging semantic knowledge from LLM.
