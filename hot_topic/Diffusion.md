- **[Compose by Focus: Scene Graph-based Atomic Skills](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16053)**  `arXiv:2509.16053`  `cs.RO` `cs.AI`  
  _Han Qi, Changhe Chen, Heng Yang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  A key requirement for generalist robots is compositional generalization - the ability to combine atomic skills to solve complex, long-horizon tasks. While prior work has primarily focused on synthesizing a planner that sequences pre-learned skills, robust execution of the individual skills themselves remains challenging, as visuomotor policies often fail under distribution shifts induced by scene composition. To address this, we introduce a scene graph-based representation that focuses on task-relevant objects and relations, thereby mitigating sensitivity to irrelevant variation. Building on this idea, we develop a scene-graph skill learning framework that integrates graph neural networks with diffusion-based imitation learning, and further combine "focused" scene-graph skills with a vision-language model (VLM) based task planner. Experiments in both simulation and real-world manipulation tasks demonstrate substantially higher success rates than state-of-the-art baselines, highlighting improved robustness and compositional generalization in long-horizon tasks.

  Although humanoid and quadruped robots provide a wide range of capabilities, current control methods, such as Deep Reinforcement Learning, focus mainly on single skills. This approach is inefficient for solving more complicated tasks where high-level goals, physical robot limitations and desired motion style might all need to be taken into account. A more effective approach is to first train a multipurpose motion policy that acquires low-level skills through imitation, while providing latent space control over skill execution. Then, this policy can be used to efficiently solve downstream tasks. This method has already been successful for controlling characters in computer graphics. In this work, we apply the approach to humanoid and quadrupedal loco-manipulation by imitating either simple synthetic motions or kinematically retargeted dog motions. We extend the original formulation to handle constraints, ensuring deployment safety, and use a diffusion discriminator for better imitation quality. We verify our methods by performing loco-manipulation in simulation for the H1 humanoid and Solo12 quadruped, as well as deploying policies on Solo12 hardware.

- **[Imagination at Inference: Synthesizing In-Hand Views for Robust Visuomotor Policy Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15717)**  `arXiv:2509.15717`  `cs.RO`  
  _Haoran Ding, Anqing Duan, Zezhou Sun, Dezhen Song, Yoshihiko Nakamura_

  Visual observations from different viewpoints can significantly influence the performance of visuomotor policies in robotic manipulation. Among these, egocentric (in-hand) views often provide crucial information for precise control. However, in some applications, equipping robots with dedicated in-hand cameras may pose challenges due to hardware constraints, system complexity, and cost. In this work, we propose to endow robots with imaginative perception - enabling them to 'imagine' in-hand observations from agent views at inference time. We achieve this via novel view synthesis (NVS), leveraging a fine-tuned diffusion model conditioned on the relative pose between the agent and in-hand views cameras. Specifically, we apply LoRA-based fine-tuning to adapt a pretrained NVS model (ZeroNVS) to the robotic manipulation domain. We evaluate our approach on both simulation benchmarks (RoboMimic and MimicGen) and real-world experiments using a Unitree Z1 robotic arm for a strawberry picking task. Results show that synthesized in-hand views significantly enhance policy inference, effectively recovering the performance drop caused by the absence of real in-hand cameras. Our method offers a scalable and hardware-light solution for deploying robust visuomotor policies, highlighting the potential of imaginative visual reasoning in embodied agents.

- **[Ask-to-Clarify: Resolving Instruction Ambiguity through Multi-turn Dialogue](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15061)**  `arXiv:2509.15061`  `cs.RO`  
  _Xingyao Lin, Xinghao Zhu, Tianyi Lu, Sicheng Xie, Hui Zhang, Xipeng Qiu, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The ultimate goal of embodied agents is to create collaborators that can interact with humans, not mere executors that passively follow instructions. This requires agents to communicate, coordinate, and adapt their actions based on human feedback. Recently, advances in VLAs have offered a path toward this goal. However, most current VLA-based embodied agents operate in a one-way mode: they receive an instruction and execute it without feedback. This approach fails in real-world scenarios where instructions are often ambiguous. In this paper, we address this problem with the Ask-to-Clarify framework. Our framework first resolves ambiguous instructions by asking questions in a multi-turn dialogue. Then it generates low-level actions end-to-end. Specifically, the Ask-to-Clarify framework consists of two components, one VLM for collaboration and one diffusion for action. We also introduce a connection module that generates conditions for the diffusion based on the output of the VLM. This module adjusts the observation by instructions to create reliable conditions. We train our framework with a two-stage knowledge-insulation strategy. First, we fine-tune the collaboration component using ambiguity-solving dialogue data to handle ambiguity. Then, we integrate the action component while freezing the collaboration one. This preserves the interaction abilities while fine-tuning the diffusion to generate actions. The training strategy guarantees our framework can first ask questions, then generate actions. During inference, a signal detector functions as a router that helps our framework switch between asking questions and taking actions. We evaluate the Ask-to-Clarify framework in 8 real-world tasks, where it outperforms existing state-of-the-art VLAs. The results suggest that our proposed framework, along with the training strategy, provides a path toward collaborative embodied agents.

- **[FlightDiffusion: Revolutionising Autonomous Drone Training with Diffusion Models Generating FPV Video](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14082)**  `arXiv:2509.14082`  `cs.RO`  
  _Valerii Serpiva, Artem Lykov, Faryal Batool, Vladislav Kozlovskiy, Miguel Altamirano Cabrera, Dzmitry Tsetserukou_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present FlightDiffusion, a diffusion-model-based framework for training autonomous drones from first-person view (FPV) video. Our model generates realistic video sequences from a single frame, enriched with corresponding action spaces to enable reasoning-driven navigation in dynamic environments. Beyond direct policy learning, FlightDiffusion leverages its generative capabilities to synthesize diverse FPV trajectories and state-action pairs, facilitating the creation of large-scale training datasets without the high cost of real-world data collection. Our evaluation demonstrates that the generated trajectories are physically plausible and executable, with a mean position error of 0.25 m (RMSE 0.28 m) and a mean orientation error of 0.19 rad (RMSE 0.24 rad). This approach enables improved policy learning and dataset scalability, leading to superior performance in downstream navigation tasks. Results in simulated environments highlight enhanced robustness, smoother trajectory planning, and adaptability to unseen conditions. An ANOVA revealed no statistically significant difference between performance in simulation and reality (F(1, 16) = 0.394, p = 0.541), with success rates of M = 0.628 (SD = 0.162) and M = 0.617 (SD = 0.177), respectively, indicating strong sim-to-real transfer. The generated datasets provide a valuable resource for future UAV research. This work introduces diffusion-based reasoning as a promising paradigm for unifying navigation, action generation, and data synthesis in aerial robotics.

- **[Dynamic Classifier-Free Diffusion Guidance via Online Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16131)**  `arXiv:2509.16131`  `cs.LG` `cs.CV`  
  _Pinelopi Papalampidi, Olivia Wiles, Ira Ktena, Aleksandar Shtedritski, Emanuele Bugliarello, Ivana Kajic, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Classifier-free guidance (CFG) is a cornerstone of text-to-image diffusion models, yet its effectiveness is limited by the use of static guidance scales. This "one-size-fits-all" approach fails to adapt to the diverse requirements of different prompts; moreover, prior solutions like gradient-based correction or fixed heuristic schedules introduce additional complexities and fail to generalize. In this work, we challeng this static paradigm by introducing a framework for dynamic CFG scheduling. Our method leverages online feedback from a suite of general-purpose and specialized small-scale latent-space evaluations, such as CLIP for alignment, a discriminator for fidelity and a human preference reward model, to assess generation quality at each step of the reverse diffusion process. Based on this feedback, we perform a greedy search to select the optimal CFG scale for each timestep, creating a unique guidance schedule tailored to every prompt and sample. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on both small-scale models and the state-of-the-art Imagen 3, showing significant improvements in text alignment, visual quality, text rendering and numerical reasoning. Notably, when compared against the default Imagen 3 baseline, our method achieves up to 53.8% human preference win-rate for overall preference, a figure that increases up to to 55.5% on prompts targeting specific capabilities like text rendering. Our work establishes that the optimal guidance schedule is inherently dynamic and prompt-dependent, and provides an efficient and generalizable framework to achieve it.

- **[DiffusionNFT: Online Diffusion Reinforcement with Forward Process](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16117)**  `arXiv:2509.16117`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI` `cs.CV`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Online reinforcement learning (RL) has been central to post-training language models, but its extension to diffusion models remains challenging due to intractable likelihoods. Recent works discretize the reverse sampling process to enable GRPO-style training, yet they inherit fundamental drawbacks, including solver restrictions, forward-reverse inconsistency, and complicated integration with classifier-free guidance (CFG). We introduce Diffusion Negative-aware FineTuning (DiffusionNFT), a new online RL paradigm that optimizes diffusion models directly on the forward process via flow matching. DiffusionNFT contrasts positive and negative generations to define an implicit policy improvement direction, naturally incorporating reinforcement signals into the supervised learning objective. This formulation enables training with arbitrary black-box solvers, eliminates the need for likelihood estimation, and requires only clean images rather than sampling trajectories for policy optimization. DiffusionNFT is up to $25\times$ more efficient than FlowGRPO in head-to-head comparisons, while being CFG-free. For instance, DiffusionNFT improves the GenEval score from 0.24 to 0.98 within 1k steps, while FlowGRPO achieves 0.95 with over 5k steps and additional CFG employment. By leveraging multiple reward models, DiffusionNFT significantly boosts the performance of SD3.5-Medium in every benchmark tested.

- **[Enhancing Generative Auto-bidding with Offline Reward Evaluation and Policy Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15927)**  `arXiv:2509.15927`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Zhiyu Mou, Yiqin Lv, Miao Xu, Cheems Wang, Yixiu Mao, Qichen Ye, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Auto-bidding is an essential tool for advertisers to enhance their advertising performance. Recent progress has shown that AI-Generated Bidding (AIGB), which formulates the auto-bidding as a trajectory generation task and trains a conditional diffusion-based planner on offline data, achieves superior and stable performance compared to typical offline reinforcement learning (RL)-based auto-bidding methods. However, existing AIGB methods still encounter a performance bottleneck due to their neglect of fine-grained generation quality evaluation and inability to explore beyond static datasets. To address this, we propose AIGB-Pearl (\emph{Planning with EvAluator via RL}), a novel method that integrates generative planning and policy optimization. The key to AIGB-Pearl is to construct a non-bootstrapped \emph{trajectory evaluator} to assign rewards and guide policy search, enabling the planner to optimize its generation quality iteratively through interaction. Furthermore, to enhance trajectory evaluator accuracy in offline settings, we incorporate three key techniques: (i) a Large Language Model (LLM)-based architecture for better representational capacity, (ii) hybrid point-wise and pair-wise losses for better score learning, and (iii) adaptive integration of expert feedback for better generalization ability. Extensive experiments on both simulated and real-world advertising systems demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our approach.

- **[Discrete Diffusion in Large Language and Multimodal Models: A Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13759)**  `arXiv:2506.13759`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Runpeng Yu, Qi Li, Xinchao Wang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this work, we provide a systematic survey of Discrete Diffusion Language Models (dLLMs) and Discrete Diffusion Multimodal Language Models (dMLLMs). Unlike autoregressive (AR) models, dLLMs and dMLLMs adopt a multi-token, parallel decoding paradigm using full attention and a denoising-based generation strategy. This paradigm naturally enables parallel generation, fine-grained output control, and dynamic perception. These capabilities are previously difficult to achieve with AR models. A growing number of industrial-scale proprietary d(M)LLMs, as well as a large number of open-source academic d(M)LLMs, have demonstrated performance comparable to their autoregressive counterparts, while achieving up to 10$\times$ acceleration in inference speed. These developments position discrete diffusion models as a promising alternative to intelligence based on the traditional autoregressive approach. In this work, we present a comprehensive overview of the research in the dLLM and dMLLM domains. We trace the historical development of dLLMs and dMLLMs, formalize the underlying mathematical frameworks, list commonly-used modeling methods, and categorize representative models. We further analyze key techniques for training, inference, quantization. We also discuss the trustworthy issues and summarize emerging applications across language, vision-language, and biological domains and etc.. We conclude by discussing future directions for research and deployment. Relative papers are collected inthis https URL

- **[UniTac2Pose: A Unified Approach Learned in Simulation for Category-level Visuotactile In-hand Pose Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15934)**  `arXiv:2509.15934`  `cs.LG`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Accurate estimation of the in-hand pose of an object based on its CAD model is crucial in both industrial applications and everyday tasks, ranging from positioning workpieces and assembling components to seamlessly inserting devices like USB connectors. While existing methods often rely on regression, feature matching, or registration techniques, achieving high precision and generalizability to unseen CAD models remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose a novel three-stage framework for in-hand pose estimation. The first stage involves sampling and pre-ranking pose candidates, followed by iterative refinement of these candidates in the second stage. In the final stage, post-ranking is applied to identify the most likely pose candidates. These stages are governed by a unified energy-based diffusion model, which is trained solely on simulated data. This energy model simultaneously generates gradients to refine pose estimates and produces an energy scalar that quantifies the quality of the pose estimates. Additionally, borrowing the idea from the computer vision domain, we incorporate a render-compare architecture within the energy-based score network to significantly enhance sim-to-real performance, as demonstrated by our ablation studies. We conduct comprehensive experiments to show that our method outperforms conventional baselines based on regression, matching, and registration techniques, while also exhibiting strong intra-category generalization to previously unseen CAD models. Moreover, our approach integrates tactile object pose estimation, pose tracking, and uncertainty estimation into a unified framework, enabling robust performance across a variety of real-world conditions.

- **[SAGE: Semantic-Aware Shared Sampling for Efficient Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15865)**  `arXiv:2509.15865`  `cs.LG`  
  _Haoran Zhao, Tong Bai, Lei Huang, Xiaoyu Liang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Diffusion models manifest evident benefits across diverse domains, yet their high sampling cost, requiring dozens of sequential model evaluations, remains a major limitation. Prior efforts mainly accelerate sampling via optimized solvers or distillation, which treat each query independently. In contrast, we reduce total number of steps by sharing early-stage sampling across semantically similar queries. To enable such efficiency gains without sacrificing quality, we propose SAGE, a semantic-aware shared sampling framework that integrates a shared sampling scheme for efficiency and a tailored training strategy for quality preservation. Extensive experiments show that SAGE reduces sampling cost by 25.5%, while improving generation quality with 5.0% lower FID, 5.4% higher CLIP, and 160% higher diversity over baselines.

- **[MaskAttn-SDXL: Controllable Region-Level Text-To-Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15357)**  `arXiv:2509.15357`  `cs.CV` `cs.LG`  
  _Yu Chang, Jiahao Chen, Anzhe Cheng, Paul Bogdan_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Text-to-image diffusion models achieve impressive realism but often suffer from compositional failures on prompts with multiple objects, attributes, and spatial relations, resulting in cross-token interference where entities entangle, attributes mix across objects, and spatial cues are violated. To address these failures, we propose MaskAttn-SDXL,a region-level gating mechanism applied to the cross-attention logits of Stable Diffusion XL(SDXL)'s UNet. MaskAttn-SDXL learns a binary mask per layer, injecting it into each cross-attention logit map before softmax to sparsify token-to-latent interactions so that only semantically relevant connections remain active. The method requires no positional encodings, auxiliary tokens, or external region masks, and preserves the original inference path with negligible overhead. In practice, our model improves spatial compliance and attribute binding in multi-object prompts while preserving overall image quality and diversity. These findings demonstrate that logit-level maksed cross-attention is an data-efficient primitve for enforcing compositional control, and our method thus serves as a practical extension for spatial control in text-to-image generation.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The rapid advancement of diffusion models has enabled high-fidelity and semantically rich text-to-image generation; however, ensuring fairness and safety remains an open challenge. Existing methods typically improve fairness and safety at the expense of semantic fidelity and image quality. In this work, we propose RespoDiff, a novel framework for responsible text-to-image generation that incorporates a dual-module transformation on the intermediate bottleneck representations of diffusion models. Our approach introduces two distinct learnable modules: one focused on capturing and enforcing responsible concepts, such as fairness and safety, and the other dedicated to maintaining semantic alignment with neutral prompts. To facilitate the dual learning process, we introduce a novel score-matching objective that enables effective coordination between the modules. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in responsible generation by ensuring semantic alignment while optimizing both objectives without compromising image fidelity. Our approach improves responsible and semantically coherent generation by 20% across diverse, unseen prompts. Moreover, it integrates seamlessly into large-scale models like SDXL, enhancing fairness and safety. Code will be released upon acceptance.

- **[SCoT: Straight Consistent Trajectory for Pre-Trained Diffusion Model Distillations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16972)**  `arXiv:2502.16972`  `cs.CV` `cs.LG`  
  _Zhangkai Wu, Xuhui Fan, Hongyu Wu, Longbing Cao_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Pre-trained diffusion models are commonly used to generate clean data (e.g., images) from random noises, effectively forming pairs of noises and corresponding clean images. Distillation on these pre-trained models can be viewed as the process of constructing advanced trajectories within the pair to accelerate sampling. For instance, consistency model distillation develops consistent projection functions to regulate trajectories, although sampling efficiency remains a concern. Rectified flow method enforces straight trajectories to enable faster sampling, yet relies on numerical ODE solvers, which may introduce approximation errors. In this work, we bridge the gap between the consistency model and the rectified flow method by proposing a Straight Consistent Trajectory~(SCoT) model. SCoT enjoys the benefits of both approaches for fast sampling, producing trajectories with consistent and straight properties simultaneously. These dual properties are strategically balanced by targeting two critical objectives: (1) regulating the gradient of SCoT's mapping to a constant, (2) ensuring trajectory consistency. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of SCoT.

- **[MANZANO: A Simple and Scalable Unified Multimodal Model with a Hybrid Vision Tokenizer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16197)**  `arXiv:2509.16197`  `cs.CV` `cs.CL` `cs.LG`  
  _Yanghao Li, Rui Qian, Bowen Pan, Haotian Zhang, Haoshuo Huang, Bowen Zhang, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Unified multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs) that can both understand and generate visual content hold immense potential. However, existing open-source models often suffer from a performance trade-off between these capabilities. We present Manzano, a simple and scalable unified framework that substantially reduces this tension by coupling a hybrid image tokenizer with a well-curated training recipe. A single shared vision encoder feeds two lightweight adapters that produce continuous embeddings for image-to-text understanding and discrete tokens for text-to-image generation within a common semantic space. A unified autoregressive LLM predicts high-level semantics in the form of text and image tokens, with an auxiliary diffusion decoder subsequently translating the image tokens into pixels. The architecture, together with a unified training recipe over understanding and generation data, enables scalable joint learning of both capabilities. Manzano achieves state-of-the-art results among unified models, and is competitive with specialist models, particularly on text-rich evaluation. Our studies show minimal task conflicts and consistent gains from scaling model size, validating our design choice of a hybrid tokenizer.

  _Valeria Pais, Luis Oala, Daniele Faccio, Marco Aversa_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The costs of generative model compute rekindled promises and hopes for efficient data curation. In this work, we investigate whether recently developed autoguidance and online data selection methods can improve the time and sample efficiency of training generative diffusion models. We integrate joint example selection (JEST) and autoguidance into a unified code base for fast ablation and benchmarking. We evaluate combinations of data curation on a controlled 2-D synthetic data generation task as well as (3x64x64)-D image generation. Our comparisons are made at equal wall-clock time and equal number of samples, explicitly accounting for the overhead of selection. Across experiments, autoguidance consistently improves sample quality and diversity. Early AJEST (applying selection only at the beginning of training) can match or modestly exceed autoguidance alone in data efficiency on both tasks. However, its time overhead and added complexity make autoguidance or uniform random data selection preferable in most situations. These findings suggest that while targeted online selection can yield efficiency gains in early training, robust sample quality improvements are primarily driven by autoguidance. We discuss limitations and scope, and outline when data selection may be beneficial.

- **[G2D2: Gradient-Guided Discrete Diffusion for Inverse Problem Solving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14710)**  `arXiv:2410.14710`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI` `cs.LG`  
  _Naoki Murata, Chieh-Hsin Lai, Yuhta Takida, Toshimitsu Uesaka, Bac Nguyen, Stefano Ermon, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent literature has effectively leveraged diffusion models trained on continuous variables as priors for solving inverse problems. Notably, discrete diffusion models with discrete latent codes have shown strong performance, particularly in modalities suited for discrete compressed representations, such as image and motion generation. However, their discrete and non-differentiable nature has limited their application to inverse problems formulated in continuous spaces. This paper presents a novel method for addressing linear inverse problems by leveraging generative models based on discrete diffusion as priors. We overcome these limitations by approximating the true posterior distribution with a variational distribution constructed from categorical distributions and continuous relaxation techniques. Furthermore, we employ a star-shaped noise process to mitigate the drawbacks of traditional discrete diffusion models with absorbing states, demonstrating that our method performs comparably to continuous diffusion techniques with a lower GPU memory consumption. Our code is available atthis https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  A critical need has emerged for generative AI: attribution methods. That is, solutions that can identify the model originating AI-generated content. This feature, generally relevant in multimodal applications, is especially sensitive in commercial settings where users subscribe to paid proprietary services and expect guarantees about the source of the content they receive. To address these issues, we introduce PRISM, a scalable Phase-enhanced Radial-based Image Signature Mapping framework for fingerprinting AI-generated images. PRISM is based on a radial reduction of the discrete Fourier transform that leverages amplitude and phase information to capture model-specific signatures. The output of the above process is subsequently clustered via linear discriminant analysis to achieve reliable model attribution in diverse settings, even if the model's internal details are inaccessible. To support our work, we construct PRISM-36K, a novel dataset of 36,000 images generated by six text-to-image GAN- and diffusion-based models. On this dataset, PRISM achieves an attribution accuracy of 92.04%. We additionally evaluate our method on four benchmarks from the literature, reaching an average accuracy of 81.60%. Finally, we evaluate our methodology also in the binary task of detecting real vs fake images, achieving an average accuracy of 88.41%. We obtain our best result on GenImage with an accuracy of 95.06%, whereas the original benchmark achieved 82.20%. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of frequency-domain fingerprinting for cross-architecture and cross-dataset model attribution, offering a viable solution for enforcing accountability and trust in generative AI systems.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Automatic indoor layout generation has attracted increasing attention due to its potential in interior design, virtual environment construction, and embodied AI. Existing methods fall into two categories: prompt-driven approaches that leverage proprietary LLM services (e.g., GPT APIs) and learning-based methods trained on layout data upon diffusion-based models. Prompt-driven methods often suffer from spatial inconsistency and high computational costs, while learning-based methods are typically constrained by coarse relational graphs and limited datasets, restricting their generalization to diverse room categories. In this paper, we revisit LLM-based indoor layout generation and present 3D-SynthPlace, a large-scale dataset that combines synthetic layouts generated via a 'GPT synthesize, Human inspect' pipeline, upgraded from the 3D-Front dataset. 3D-SynthPlace contains nearly 17,000 scenes, covering four common room types -- bedroom, living room, kitchen, and bathroom -- enriched with diverse objects and high-level spatial annotations. We further introduce OptiScene, a strong open-source LLM optimized for indoor layout generation, fine-tuned based on our 3D-SynthPlace dataset through our two-stage training. For the warum-up stage I, we adopt supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which is taught to first generate high-level spatial descriptions then conditionally predict concrete object placements. For the reinforcing stage II, to better align the generated layouts with human design preferences, we apply multi-turn direct preference optimization (DPO), which significantly improving layout quality and generation success rates. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OptiScene outperforms traditional prompt-driven and learning-based baselines. Moreover, OptiScene shows promising potential in interactive tasks such as scene editing and robot navigation.

  _Shen Cheng, Haipeng Li, Haibin Huang, Xiaohong Liu, Shuaicheng Liu_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this work, we present Blind-Spot Guided Diffusion, a novel self-supervised framework for real-world image denoising. Our approach addresses two major challenges: the limitations of blind-spot networks (BSNs), which often sacrifice local detail and introduce pixel discontinuities due to spatial independence assumptions, and the difficulty of adapting diffusion models to self-supervised denoising. We propose a dual-branch diffusion framework that combines a BSN-based diffusion branch, generating semi-clean images, with a conventional diffusion branch that captures underlying noise distributions. To enable effective training without paired data, we use the BSN-based branch to guide the sampling process, capturing noise structure while preserving local details. Extensive experiments on the SIDD and DND datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, establishing our method as a highly effective self-supervised solution for real-world denoising. Code and pre-trained models are released at:this https URL.

- **[Vision-Language Models as Differentiable Semantic and Spatial Rewards for Text-to-3D Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15772)**  `arXiv:2509.15772`  `cs.CV`

  Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) enables high-quality text-to-3D generation by supervising 3D models through the denoising of multi-view 2D renderings, using a pretrained text-to-image diffusion model to align with the input prompt and ensure 3D consistency. However, existing SDS-based methods face two fundamental limitations: (1) their reliance on CLIP-style text encoders leads to coarse semantic alignment and struggles with fine-grained prompts; and (2) 2D diffusion priors lack explicit 3D spatial constraints, resulting in geometric inconsistencies and inaccurate object relationships in multi-object scenes. To address these challenges, we propose VLM3D, a novel text-to-3D generation framework that integrates large vision-language models (VLMs) into the SDS pipeline as differentiable semantic and spatial priors. Unlike standard text-to-image diffusion priors, VLMs leverage rich language-grounded supervision that enables fine-grained prompt alignment. Moreover, their inherent vision language modeling provides strong spatial understanding, which significantly enhances 3D consistency for single-object generation and improves relational reasoning in multi-object scenes. We instantiate VLM3D based on the open-source Qwen2.5-VL model and evaluate it on the GPTeval3D benchmark. Experiments across diverse objects and complex scenes show that VLM3D significantly outperforms prior SDS-based methods in semantic fidelity, geometric coherence, and spatial correctness.

  Handwriting stroke generation is crucial for improving the performance of tasks such as handwriting recognition and writers order recovery. In handwriting stroke generation, it is significantly important to imitate the sample calligraphic style. The previous studies have suggested utilizing the calligraphic features of the handwriting. However, they had not considered word spacing (word layout) as an explicit handwriting feature, which results in inconsistent word spacing for style imitation. Firstly, this work proposes multi-scale attention features for calligraphic style imitation. These multi-scale feature embeddings highlight the local and global style features. Secondly, we propose to include the words layout, which facilitates word spacing for handwriting stroke generation. Moreover, we propose a conditional diffusion model to predict strokes in contrast to previous work, which directly generated style images. Stroke generation provides additional temporal coordinate information, which is lacking in image generation. Hence, our proposed conditional diffusion model for stroke generation is guided by calligraphic style and word layout for better handwriting imitation and stroke generation in a calligraphic style. Our experimentation shows that the proposed diffusion model outperforms the current state-of-the-art stroke generation and is competitive with recent image generation networks.

  We present Lynx, a high-fidelity model for personalized video synthesis from a single input image. Built on an open-source Diffusion Transformer (DiT) foundation model, Lynx introduces two lightweight adapters to ensure identity fidelity. The ID-adapter employs a Perceiver Resampler to convert ArcFace-derived facial embeddings into compact identity tokens for conditioning, while the Ref-adapter integrates dense VAE features from a frozen reference pathway, injecting fine-grained details across all transformer layers through cross-attention. These modules collectively enable robust identity preservation while maintaining temporal coherence and visual realism. Through evaluation on a curated benchmark of 40 subjects and 20 unbiased prompts, which yielded 800 test cases, Lynx has demonstrated superior face resemblance, competitive prompt following, and strong video quality, thereby advancing the state of personalized video generation.

  AI generative models leave implicit traces in their generated images, which are commonly referred to as model fingerprints and are exploited for source attribution. Prior methods rely on model-specific cues or synthesis artifacts, yielding limited fingerprints that may generalize poorly across different generative models. We argue that a complete model fingerprint should reflect the causality between image provenance and model traces, a direction largely unexplored. To this end, we conceptualize the \emph{causal fingerprint} of generative models, and propose a causality-decoupling framework that disentangles it from image-specific content and style in a semantic-invariant latent space derived from pre-trained diffusion reconstruction residual. We further enhance fingerprint granularity with diverse feature representations. We validate causality by assessing attribution performance across representative GANs and diffusion models and by achieving source anonymization using counterfactual examples generated from causal fingerprints. Experiments show our approach outperforms existing methods in model attribution, indicating strong potential for forgery detection, model copyright tracing, and identity protection.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in image generation but their practical application is often hindered by the slow sampling speed. Prior efforts of improving efficiency primarily focus on compressing models or reducing the total number of denoising steps, largely neglecting the possibility to leverage multiple input resolutions in the generation process. In this work, we propose LowDiff, a novel and efficient diffusion framework based on a cascaded approach by generating increasingly higher resolution outputs. Besides, LowDiff employs a unified model to progressively refine images from low resolution to the desired resolution. With the proposed architecture design and generation techniques, we achieve comparable or even superior performance with much fewer high-resolution sampling steps. LowDiff is applicable to diffusion models in both pixel space and latent space. Extensive experiments on both conditional and unconditional generation tasks across CIFAR-10, FFHQ and ImageNet demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of our method. Results show over 50% throughput improvement across all datasets and settings while maintaining comparable or better quality. On unconditional CIFAR-10, LowDiff achieves an FID of 2.11 and IS of 9.87, while on conditional CIFAR-10, an FID of 1.94 and IS of 10.03. On FFHQ 64x64, LowDiff achieves an FID of 2.43, and on ImageNet 256x256, LowDiff built on LightningDiT-B/1 produces high-quality samples with a FID of 4.00 and an IS of 195.06, together with substantial efficiency gains.

  AI-based in silico methods have improved protein structure prediction but often struggle with large protein complexes (PCs) involving multiple interacting proteins due to missing 3D spatial cues. Experimental techniques like Cryo-EM are accurate but costly and time-consuming. We present ProFusion, a hybrid framework that integrates a deep learning model with Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), which provides high-resolution height maps from random orientations, naturally yielding multi-view data for 3D reconstruction. However, generating a large-scale AFM imaging data set sufficient to train deep learning models is impractical. Therefore, we developed a virtual AFM framework that simulates the imaging process and generated a dataset of ~542,000 proteins with multi-view synthetic AFM images. We train a conditional diffusion model to synthesize novel views from unposed inputs and an instance-specific Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) model to reconstruct 3D structures. Our reconstructed 3D protein structures achieve an average Chamfer Distance within the AFM imaging resolution, reflecting high structural fidelity. Our method is extensively validated on experimental AFM images of various PCs, demonstrating strong potential for accurate, cost-effective protein complex structure prediction and rapid iterative validation using AFM experiments.

  Creating high-fidelity 3D models of indoor environments is essential for applications in design, virtual reality, and robotics. However, manual 3D modeling remains time-consuming and labor-intensive. While recent advances in generative AI have enabled automated scene synthesis, existing methods often face challenges in balancing visual quality, diversity, semantic consistency, and user control. A major bottleneck is the lack of a large-scale, high-quality dataset tailored to this task. To address this gap, we introduce a comprehensive synthetic dataset, featuring 12,328 structured annotated scenes with 57,440 rooms, and 4.7M photorealistic 2D renderings. Leveraging this dataset, we present SpatialGen, a novel multi-view multi-modal diffusion model that generates realistic and semantically consistent 3D indoor scenes. Given a 3D layout and a reference image (derived from a text prompt), our model synthesizes appearance (color image), geometry (scene coordinate map), and semantic (semantic segmentation map) from arbitrary viewpoints, while preserving spatial consistency across modalities. SpatialGen consistently generates superior results to previous methods in our experiments. We are open-sourcing our data and models to empower the community and advance the field of indoor scene understanding and generation.

- **[Towards Robust Defense against Customization via Protective Perturbation Resistant to Diffusion-based Purification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13922)**  `arXiv:2509.13922`  `cs.CV`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Diffusion models like Stable Diffusion have become prominent in visual synthesis tasks due to their powerful customization capabilities, which also introduce significant security risks, including deepfakes and copyright infringement. In response, a class of methods known as protective perturbation emerged, which mitigates image misuse by injecting imperceptible adversarial noise. However, purification can remove protective perturbations, thereby exposing images again to the risk of malicious forgery. In this work, we formalize the anti-purification task, highlighting challenges that hinder existing approaches, and propose a simple diagnostic protective perturbation named AntiPure. AntiPure exposes vulnerabilities of purification within the "purification-customization" workflow, owing to two guidance mechanisms: 1) Patch-wise Frequency Guidance, which reduces the model's influence over high-frequency components in the purified image, and 2) Erroneous Timestep Guidance, which disrupts the model's denoising strategy across different timesteps. With additional guidance, AntiPure embeds imperceptible perturbations that persist under representative purification settings, achieving effective post-customization distortion. Experiments show that, as a stress test for purification, AntiPure achieves minimal perceptual discrepancy and maximal distortion, outperforming other protective perturbation methods within the purification-customization workflow.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have enabled models to perform both understanding and generation of multimodal data in a unified manner. However, achieving a fine-grained alignment between input prompts and generated images remains a major challenge especially in text-to-image generation. Therefore, recent works have introduced self-improving mechanisms based on self-generated data and self-feedback to efficiently mitigate this challenge without relying on external large-scale data or models. However, existing self-improving approaches have not focused on fine-grained visual details especially at the object level in generating training data or providing a feedback, and thus they still struggle to resolve the object hallucination problem in text-to-image generation. To tackle this problem, we propose an Object-centric Self-improving Preference Optimization (OSPO), a self-improving framework for enhancing object-level text-image alignment. OSPO is designed to explicitly address the need for constructing and leveraging object-level hard negative data and an object-centric optimization in improving object-specific fidelity. In specific, OSPO consists of: (1) Initial Prompt Generation (2) Hard Preference Pair Generation (3) Filtering and Selection (4) Object-centric Preference Optimization with Conditional Preference Loss. Extensive experiments on compositional image generation benchmarks demonstrate that OSPO significantly improves fine-grained alignment in text-to-image generation, surpassing not only prior self-improving methods but also diffusion-based specialized image generation models.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The emergence and popularity of facial deepfake methods spur the vigorous development of deepfake datasets and facial forgery detection, which to some extent alleviates the security concerns about facial-related artificial intelligence technologies. However, when it comes to human body forgery, there has been a persistent lack of datasets and detection methods, due to the later inception and complexity of human body generation methods. To mitigate this issue, we introduce TikTok-DeepFake (TT-DF), a novel large-scale diffusion-based dataset containing 6,120 forged videos with 1,378,857 synthetic frames, specifically tailored for body forgery detection. TT-DF offers a wide variety of forgery methods, involving multiple advanced human image animation models utilized for manipulation, two generative configurations based on the disentanglement of identity and pose information, as well as different compressed versions. The aim is to simulate any potential unseen forged data in the wild as comprehensively as possible, and we also furnish a benchmark on TT-DF. Additionally, we propose an adapted body forgery detection model, Temporal Optical Flow Network (TOF-Net), which exploits the spatiotemporal inconsistencies and optical flow distribution differences between natural data and forged data. Our experiments demonstrate that TOF-Net achieves favorable performance on TT-DF, outperforming current state-of-the-art extendable facial forgery detection models.

  Transparent and reflective objects, which are common in our everyday lives, present a significant challenge to 3D imaging techniques due to their unique visual and optical properties. Faced with these types of objects, RGB-D cameras fail to capture the real depth value with their accurate spatial information. To address this issue, we propose DITR, a diffusion-based Depth Inpainting framework specifically designed for Transparent and Reflective objects. This network consists of two stages, including a Region Proposal stage and a Depth Inpainting stage. DITR dynamically analyzes the optical and geometric depth loss and inpaints them automatically. Furthermore, comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that DITR is highly effective in depth inpainting tasks of transparent and reflective objects with robust adaptability.
