  Learning methods excel at motion generation in the information domain but are not primarily designed for physical interaction in the energy domain. Impedance Control shapes physical interaction but requires task-aware tuning by selecting feasible impedance parameters. We present Diffusion-Based Impedance Learning, a framework that combines both domains. A Transformer-based Diffusion Model with cross-attention to external wrenches reconstructs a simulated Zero-Force Trajectory (sZFT). This captures both translational and rotational task-space behavior. For rotations, we introduce a novel SLERP-based quaternion noise scheduler that ensures geometric consistency. The reconstructed sZFT is then passed to an energy-based estimator that updates stiffness and damping parameters. A directional rule is applied that reduces impedance along non task axes while preserving rigidity along task directions. Training data were collected for a parkour scenario and robotic-assisted therapy tasks using teleoperation with Apple Vision Pro. With only tens of thousands of samples, the model achieved sub-millimeter positional accuracy and sub-degree rotational accuracy. Its compact model size enabled real-time torque control and autonomous stiffness adaptation on a KUKA LBR iiwa robot. The controller achieved smooth parkour traversal within force and velocity limits and 30/30 success rates for cylindrical, square, and star peg insertions without any peg-specific demonstrations in the training data set. All code for the Transformer-based Diffusion Model, the robot controller, and the Apple Vision Pro telemanipulation framework is publicly available. These results mark an important step towards Physical AI, fusing model-based control for physical interaction with learning-based methods for trajectory generation.

  In robot imitation learning, policy performance is tightly coupled with the quality and composition of the demonstration data. Yet, developing a precise understanding of how individual demonstrations contribute to downstream outcomes - such as closed-loop task success or failure - remains a persistent challenge. We propose CUPID, a robot data curation method based on a novel influence function-theoretic formulation for imitation learning policies. Given a set of evaluation rollouts, CUPID estimates the influence of each training demonstration on the policy's expected return. This enables ranking and selection of demonstrations according to their impact on the policy's closed-loop performance. We use CUPID to curate data by 1) filtering out training demonstrations that harm policy performance and 2) subselecting newly collected trajectories that will most improve the policy. Extensive simulated and hardware experiments show that our approach consistently identifies which data drives test-time performance. For example, training with less than 33% of curated data can yield state-of-the-art diffusion policies on the simulated RoboMimic benchmark, with similar gains observed in hardware. Furthermore, hardware experiments show that our method can identify robust strategies under distribution shift, isolate spurious correlations, and even enhance the post-training of generalist robot policies.

- **[ROPA: Synthetic Robot Pose Generation for RGB-D Bimanual Data Augmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19454)**  `arXiv:2509.19454`  `cs.RO` `cs.AI` `cs.CV` `cs.LG`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Training robust bimanual manipulation policies via imitation learning requires demonstration data with broad coverage over robot poses, contacts, and scene contexts. However, collecting diverse and precise real-world demonstrations is costly and time-consuming, which hinders scalability. Prior works have addressed this with data augmentation, typically for either eye-in-hand (wrist camera) setups with RGB inputs or for generating novel images without paired actions, leaving augmentation for eye-to-hand (third-person) RGB-D training with new action labels less explored. In this paper, we propose Synthetic Robot Pose Generation for RGB-D Bimanual Data Augmentation (ROPA), an offline imitation learning data augmentation method that fine-tunes Stable Diffusion to synthesize third-person RGB and RGB-D observations of novel robot poses. Our approach simultaneously generates corresponding joint-space action labels while employing constrained optimization to enforce physical consistency through appropriate gripper-to-object contact constraints in bimanual scenarios. We evaluate our method on 5 simulated and 3 real-world tasks. Our results across 2625 simulation trials and 300 real-world trials demonstrate that ROPA outperforms baselines and ablations, showing its potential for scalable RGB and RGB-D data augmentation in eye-to-hand bimanual manipulation.

- **[SEM: Enhancing Spatial Understanding for Robust Robot Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16196)**  `arXiv:2505.16196`  `cs.RO` `cs.AI` `cs.CV`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  A key challenge in robot manipulation lies in developing policy models with strong spatial understanding, the ability to reason about 3D geometry, object relations, and robot embodiment. Existing methods often fall short: 3D point cloud models lack semantic abstraction, while 2D image encoders struggle with spatial reasoning. To address this, we propose SEM (Spatial Enhanced Manipulation model), a novel diffusion-based policy framework that explicitly enhances spatial understanding from two complementary perspectives. A spatial enhancer augments visual representations with 3D geometric context, while a robot state encoder captures embodiment-aware structure through graphbased modeling of joint dependencies. By integrating these modules, SEM significantly improves spatial understanding, leading to robust and generalizable manipulation across diverse tasks that outperform existing baselines.

- **[Discrete Diffusion for Reflective Vision-Language-Action Models in Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20109)**  `arXiv:2509.20109`  `cs.RO` `cs.AI` `cs.CL`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  End-to-End (E2E) solutions have emerged as a mainstream approach for autonomous driving systems, with Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models representing a new paradigm that leverages pre-trained multimodal knowledge from Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to interpret and interact with complex real-world environments. However, these methods remain constrained by the limitations of imitation learning, which struggles to inherently encode physical rules during training. Existing approaches often rely on complex rule-based post-refinement, employ reinforcement learning that remains largely limited to simulation, or utilize diffusion guidance that requires computationally expensive gradient calculations. To address these challenges, we introduce ReflectDrive, a novel learning-based framework that integrates a reflection mechanism for safe trajectory generation via discrete diffusion. We first discretize the two-dimensional driving space to construct an action codebook, enabling the use of pre-trained Diffusion Language Models for planning tasks through fine-tuning. Central to our approach is a safety-aware reflection mechanism that performs iterative self-correction without gradient computation. Our method begins with goal-conditioned trajectory generation to model multi-modal driving behaviors. Based on this, we apply local search methods to identify unsafe tokens and determine feasible solutions, which then serve as safe anchors for inpainting-based regeneration. Evaluated on the NAVSIM benchmark, ReflectDrive demonstrates significant advantages in safety-critical trajectory generation, offering a scalable and reliable solution for autonomous driving systems.

- **[AnchDrive: Bootstrapping Diffusion Policies with Hybrid Trajectory Anchors for End-to-End Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20253)**  `arXiv:2509.20253`  `cs.RO` `cs.AI`  
  _Jinhao Chai, Anqing Jiang, Hao Jiang, Shiyi Mu, Zichong Gu, Shugong Xu_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  End-to-end multi-modal planning has become a transformative paradigm in autonomous driving, effectively addressing behavioral multi-modality and the generalization challenge in long-tail scenarios. We propose AnchDrive, a framework for end-to-end driving that effectively bootstraps a diffusion policy to mitigate the high computational cost of traditional generative models. Rather than denoising from pure noise, AnchDrive initializes its planner with a rich set of hybrid trajectory anchors. These anchors are derived from two complementary sources: a static vocabulary of general driving priors and a set of dynamic, context-aware trajectories. The dynamic trajectories are decoded in real-time by a Transformer that processes dense and sparse perceptual features. The diffusion model then learns to refine these anchors by predicting a distribution of trajectory offsets, enabling fine-grained refinement. This anchor-based bootstrapping design allows for efficient generation of diverse, high-quality trajectories. Experiments on the NAVSIM benchmark confirm that AnchDrive sets a new state-of-the-art and shows strong gen?eralizability

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  End-to-end learning of robot control policies, structured as neural networks, has emerged as a promising approach to robotic manipulation. To complete many common tasks, relevant objects are required to pass in and out of a robot's field of view. In these settings, spatial memory - the ability to remember the spatial composition of the scene - is an important competency. However, building such mechanisms into robot learning systems remains an open research problem. We introduce mindmap (Spatial Memory in Deep Feature Maps for 3D Action Policies), a 3D diffusion policy that generates robot trajectories based on a semantic 3D reconstruction of the environment. We show in simulation experiments that our approach is effective at solving tasks where state-of-the-art approaches without memory mechanisms struggle. We release our reconstruction system, training code, and evaluation tasks to spur research in this direction.

  _Zijun Che, Yinghong Zhang, Shengyi Liang, Boyu Zhou, Jun Ma, Jinni Zhou_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Autonomous exploration in structured and complex indoor environments remains a challenging task, as existing methods often struggle to appropriately model unobserved space and plan globally efficient paths. To address these limitations, we propose GUIDE, a novel exploration framework that synergistically combines global graph inference with diffusion-based decision-making. We introduce a region-evaluation global graph representation that integrates both observed environmental data and predictions of unexplored areas, enhanced by a region-level evaluation mechanism to prioritize reliable structural inferences while discounting uncertain predictions. Building upon this enriched representation, a diffusion policy network generates stable, foresighted action sequences with significantly reduced denoising steps. Extensive simulations and real-world deployments demonstrate that GUIDE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to 18.3% faster coverage completion and a 34.9% reduction in redundant movements.

- **[Beyond Human Demonstrations: Diffusion-Based Reinforcement Learning to Generate Data for VLA Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19752)**  `arXiv:2509.19752`  `cs.RO`  
  _Rushuai Yang, Hangxing Wei, Ran Zhang, Zhiyuan Feng, Xiaoyu Chen, Tong Li, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision-language-action (VLA) models have shown strong generalization across tasks and embodiments; however, their reliance on large-scale human demonstrations limits their scalability owing to the cost and effort of manual data collection. Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a potential alternative to generate demonstrations autonomously, yet conventional RL algorithms often struggle on long-horizon manipulation tasks with sparse rewards. In this paper, we propose a modified diffusion policy optimization algorithm to generate high-quality and low-variance trajectories, which contributes to a diffusion RL-powered VLA training pipeline. Our algorithm benefits from not only the high expressiveness of diffusion models to explore complex and diverse behaviors but also the implicit regularization of the iterative denoising process to yield smooth and consistent demonstrations. We evaluate our approach on the LIBERO benchmark, which includes 130 long-horizon manipulation tasks, and show that the generated trajectories are smoother and more consistent than both human demonstrations and those from standard Gaussian RL policies. Further, training a VLA model exclusively on the diffusion RL-generated data achieves an average success rate of 81.9%, which outperforms the model trained on human data by +5.3% and that on Gaussian RL-generated data by +12.6%. The results highlight our diffusion RL as an effective alternative for generating abundant, high-quality, and low-variance demonstrations for VLA models.

  _Liquan Wang, Jiangjie Bian, Eric Heiden, Animesh Garg_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Robotic manipulation tasks involving cutting deformable objects remain challenging due to complex topological behaviors, difficulties in perceiving dense object states, and the lack of efficient evaluation methods for cutting outcomes. In this paper, we introduce TopoCut, a comprehensive benchmark for multi-step robotic cutting tasks that integrates a cutting environment and generalized policy learning. TopoCut is built upon three core components: (1) We introduce a high-fidelity simulation environment based on a particle-based elastoplastic solver with compliant von Mises constitutive models, augmented by a novel damage-driven topology discovery mechanism that enables accurate tracking of multiple cutting pieces. (2) We develop a comprehensive reward design that integrates the topology discovery with a pose-invariant spectral reward model based on Laplace-Beltrami eigenanalysis, facilitating consistent and robust assessment of cutting quality. (3) We propose an integrated policy learning pipeline, where a dynamics-informed perception module predicts topological evolution and produces particle-wise, topology-aware embeddings to support PDDP (Particle-based Score-Entropy Discrete Diffusion Policy) for goal-conditioned policy learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TopoCut supports trajectory generation, scalable learning, precise evaluation, and strong generalization across diverse object geometries, scales, poses, and cutting goals.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Closed-loop control remains an open challenge in soft robotics. The nonlinear responses of soft actuators under dynamic loading conditions limit the use of analytic models for soft robot control. Traditional methods of controlling soft robots underutilize their configuration spaces to avoid nonlinearity, hysteresis, large deformations, and the risk of actuator damage. Furthermore, episodic data-driven control approaches such as reinforcement learning (RL) are traditionally limited by sample efficiency and inconsistency across initializations. In this work, we demonstrate RL for reliably learning control policies for dynamic balancing tasks in real-time single-shot hardware deployments. We use a deformable Stewart platform constructed using parallel, 3D-printed soft actuators based on motorized handed shearing auxetic (HSA) structures. By introducing a curriculum learning approach based on expanding neighborhoods of a known equilibrium, we achieve reliable single-deployment balancing at arbitrary coordinates. In addition to benchmarking the performance of model-based and model-free methods, we demonstrate that in a single deployment, Maximum Diffusion RL is capable of learning dynamic balancing after half of the actuators are effectively disabled, by inducing buckling and by breaking actuators with bolt cutters. Training occurs with no prior data, in as fast as 15 minutes, with performance nearly identical to the fully-intact platform. Single-shot learning on hardware facilitates soft robotic systems reliably learning in the real world and will enable more diverse and capable soft robots.

  Generating high-quality synthetic time series is a fundamental yet challenging task across domains such as forecasting and anomaly detection, where real data can be scarce, noisy, or costly to collect. Unlike static data generation, synthesizing time series requires modeling both the marginal distribution of observations and the conditional temporal dependencies that govern sequential dynamics. We propose TIMED, a unified generative framework that integrates a denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) to capture global structure via a forward-reverse diffusion process, a supervisor network trained with teacher forcing to learn autoregressive dependencies through next-step prediction, and a Wasserstein critic that provides adversarial feedback to ensure temporal smoothness and fidelity. To further align the real and synthetic distributions in feature space, TIMED incorporates a Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) loss, promoting both diversity and sample quality. All components are built using masked attention architectures optimized for sequence modeling and are trained jointly to effectively capture both unconditional and conditional aspects of time series data. Experimental results across diverse multivariate time series benchmarks demonstrate that TIMED generates more realistic and temporally coherent sequences than state-of-the-art generative models.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  For learned image representations, basic autoencoders often produce blurry results. Reconstruction quality can be improved by incorporating additional penalties such as adversarial (GAN) and perceptual losses. Arguably, these approaches lack a principled interpretation. Concurrently, in generative settings diffusion has demonstrated a remarkable ability to create crisp, high quality results and has solid theoretical underpinnings (from variational inference to direct study as the Fisher Divergence). Our work combines autoencoder representation learning with diffusion and is, to our knowledge, the first to demonstrate jointly learning a continuous encoder and decoder under a diffusion-based loss and showing that it can lead to higher compression and better generation. We demonstrate that this approach yields better reconstruction quality as compared to GAN-based autoencoders while being easier to tune. We also show that the resulting representation is easier to model with a latent diffusion model as compared to the representation obtained from a state-of-the-art GAN-based loss. Since our decoder is stochastic, it can generate details not encoded in the otherwise deterministic latent representation; we therefore name our approach "Sample what you can't compress", or SWYCC for short.

- **[DAWM: Diffusion Action World Models for Offline Reinforcement Learning via Action-Inferred Transitions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19538)**  `arXiv:2509.19538`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Zongyue Li, Xiao Han, Yusong Li, Niklas Strauss, Matthias Schubert_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Diffusion-based world models have demonstrated strong capabilities in synthesizing realistic long-horizon trajectories for offline reinforcement learning (RL). However, many existing methods do not directly generate actions alongside states and rewards, limiting their compatibility with standard value-based offline RL algorithms that rely on one-step temporal difference (TD) learning. While prior work has explored joint modeling of states, rewards, and actions to address this issue, such formulations often lead to increased training complexity and reduced performance in practice. We propose \textbf{DAWM}, a diffusion-based world model that generates future state-reward trajectories conditioned on the current state, action, and return-to-go, paired with an inverse dynamics model (IDM) for efficient action inference. This modular design produces complete synthetic transitions suitable for one-step TD-based offline RL, enabling effective and computationally efficient training. Empirically, we show that conservative offline RL algorithms such as TD3BC and IQL benefit significantly from training on these augmented trajectories, consistently outperforming prior diffusion-based baselines across multiple tasks in the D4RL benchmark.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Learning physical dynamics from data is a fundamental challenge in machine learning and scientific modeling. Real-world observational data are inherently incomplete and irregularly sampled, posing significant challenges for existing data-driven approaches. In this work, we propose a principled diffusion-based framework for learning physical systems from incomplete training samples. To this end, our method strategically partitions each such sample into observed context and unobserved query components through a carefully designed splitting strategy, then trains a conditional diffusion model to reconstruct the missing query portions given available contexts. This formulation enables accurate imputation across arbitrary observation patterns without requiring complete data supervision. Specifically, we provide theoretical analysis demonstrating that our diffusion training paradigm on incomplete data achieves asymptotic convergence to the true complete generative process under mild regularity conditions. Empirically, we show that our method significantly outperforms existing baselines on synthetic and real-world physical dynamics benchmarks, including fluid flows and weather systems, with particularly strong performance in limited and irregular observation regimes. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of our theoretically principled approach for learning and imputing partially observed dynamics.

- **[An Efficient Conditional Score-based Filter for High Dimensional Nonlinear Filtering Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19816)**  `arXiv:2509.19816`  `cs.LG`  
  _Zhijun Zeng, Weiye Gan, Junqing Chen, Zuoqiang Shi_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In many engineering and applied science domains, high-dimensional nonlinear filtering is still a challenging problem. Recent advances in score-based diffusion models offer a promising alternative for posterior sampling but require repeated retraining to track evolving priors, which is impractical in high dimensions. In this work, we propose the Conditional Score-based Filter (CSF), a novel algorithm that leverages a set-transformer encoder and a conditional diffusion model to achieve efficient and accurate posterior sampling without retraining. By decoupling prior modeling and posterior sampling into offline and online stages, CSF enables scalable score-based filtering across diverse nonlinear systems. Extensive experiments on benchmark problems show that CSF achieves superior accuracy, robustness, and efficiency across diverse nonlinear filtering scenarios.

- **[Frame-based Equivariant Diffusion Models for 3D Molecular Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19506)**  `arXiv:2509.19506`  `cs.LG`  
  _Mohan Guo, Cong Liu, Patrick Forr√©_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent methods for molecular generation face a trade-off: they either enforce strict equivariance with costly architectures or relax it to gain scalability and flexibility. We propose a frame-based diffusion paradigm that achieves deterministic E(3)-equivariance while decoupling symmetry handling from the backbone. Building on this paradigm, we investigate three variants: Global Frame Diffusion (GFD), which assigns a shared molecular frame; Local Frame Diffusion (LFD), which constructs node-specific frames and benefits from additional alignment constraints; and Invariant Frame Diffusion (IFD), which relies on pre-canonicalized invariant representations. To enhance expressivity, we further utilize EdgeDiT, a Diffusion Transformer with edge-aware attention.On the QM9 dataset, GFD with EdgeDiT achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a test NLL of -137.97 at standard scale and -141.85 at double scale, alongside atom stability of 98.98%, and molecular stability of 90.51%. These results surpass all equivariant baselines while maintaining high validity and uniqueness and nearly 2x faster sampling compared to EDM. Altogether, our study establishes frame-based diffusion as a scalable, flexible, and physically grounded paradigm for molecular generation, highlighting the critical role of global structure preservation.

- **[DS-Diffusion: Data Style-Guided Diffusion Model for Time-Series Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18584)**  `arXiv:2509.18584`  `cs.LG`  
  _Mingchun Sun, Rongqiang Zhao, Hengrui Hu, Songyu Ding, Jie Liu_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Diffusion models are the mainstream approach for time series generation tasks. However, existing diffusion models for time series generation require retraining the entire framework to introduce specific conditional guidance. There also exists a certain degree of distributional bias between the generated data and the real data, which leads to potential model biases in downstream tasks. Additionally, the complexity of diffusion models and the latent spaces leads to an uninterpretable inference process. To address these issues, we propose the data style-guided diffusion model (DS-Diffusion). In the DS-Diffusion, a diffusion framework based on style-guided kernels is developed to avoid retraining for specific conditions. The time-information based hierarchical denoising mechanism (THD) is developed to reduce the distributional bias between the generated data and the real data. Furthermore, the generated samples can clearly indicate the data style from which they originate. We conduct comprehensive evaluations using multiple public datasets to validate our approach. Experimental results show that, compared to the state-of-the-art model such as ImagenTime, the predictive score and the discriminative score decrease by 5.56% and 61.55%, respectively. The distributional bias between the generated data and the real data is further reduced, the inference process is also more interpretable. Moreover, by eliminating the need to retrain the diffusion model, the flexibility and adaptability of the model to specific conditions are also enhanced.

- **[Diffusion Classifier-Driven Reward for Offline Preference-based Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01143)**  `arXiv:2503.01143`  `cs.LG`  
  _Teng Pang, Bingzheng Wang, Guoqiang Wu, Yilong Yin_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Offline preference-based reinforcement learning (PbRL) mitigates the need for reward definition, aligning with human preferences via preference-driven reward feedback without interacting with the environment. However, trajectory-wise preference labels are difficult to meet the precise learning of step-wise reward, thereby affecting the performance of downstream algorithms. To alleviate the insufficient step-wise reward caused by trajectory-wise preferences, we propose a novel preference-based reward acquisition method: Diffusion Preference-based Reward (DPR). DPR directly treats step-wise preference-based reward acquisition as a binary classification and utilizes the robustness of diffusion classifiers to infer step-wise rewards discriminatively. In addition, to further utilize trajectory-wise preference information, we propose Conditional Diffusion Preference-based Reward (C-DPR), which conditions on trajectory-wise preference labels to enhance reward inference. We apply the above methods to existing offline RL algorithms, and a series of experimental results demonstrate that the diffusion classifier-driven reward outperforms the previous reward acquisition method with the Bradley-Terry model.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Low-quality or scarce data has posed significant challenges for training deep neural networks in practice. While classical data augmentation cannot contribute very different new data, diffusion models opens up a new door to build self-evolving AI by generating high-quality and diverse synthetic data through text-guided prompts. However, text-only guidance cannot control synthetic images' proximity to the original images, resulting in out-of-distribution data detrimental to the model performance. To overcome the limitation, we study image guidance to achieve a spectrum of interpolations between synthetic and real images. With stronger image guidance, the generated images are similar to the training data but hard to learn. While with weaker image guidance, the synthetic images will be easier for model but contribute to a larger distribution gap with the original data. The generated full spectrum of data enables us to build a novel "Diffusion Curriculum (DisCL)". DisCL adjusts the image guidance level of image synthesis for each training stage: It identifies and focuses on hard samples for the model and assesses the most effective guidance level of synthetic images to improve hard data learning. We apply DisCL to two challenging tasks: long-tail (LT) classification and learning from low-quality data. It focuses on lower-guidance images of high-quality to learn prototypical features as a warm-up of learning higher-guidance images that might be weak on diversity or quality. Extensive experiments showcase a gain of 2.7% and 2.1% in OOD and ID macro-accuracy when applying DisCL to iWildCam dataset. On ImageNet-LT, DisCL improves the base model's tail-class accuracy from 4.4% to 23.64% and leads to a 4.02% improvement in all-class accuracy.

  Existing video generation models excel at producing photo-realistic videos from text or images, but often lack physical plausibility and 3D controllability. To overcome these limitations, we introduce PhysCtrl, a novel framework for physics-grounded image-to-video generation with physical parameters and force control. At its core is a generative physics network that learns the distribution of physical dynamics across four materials (elastic, sand, plasticine, and rigid) via a diffusion model conditioned on physics parameters and applied forces. We represent physical dynamics as 3D point trajectories and train on a large-scale synthetic dataset of 550K animations generated by physics simulators. We enhance the diffusion model with a novel spatiotemporal attention block that emulates particle interactions and incorporates physics-based constraints during training to enforce physical plausibility. Experiments show that PhysCtrl generates realistic, physics-grounded motion trajectories which, when used to drive image-to-video models, yield high-fidelity, controllable videos that outperform existing methods in both visual quality and physical plausibility.

- **[FAST: Foreground-aware Diffusion with Accelerated Sampling Trajectory for Segmentation-oriented Anomaly Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20295)**  `arXiv:2509.20295`  `cs.CV`  
  _Xichen Xu, Yanshu Wang, Jinbao Wang, Xiaoning Lei, Guoyang Xie, Guannan Jiang, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Industrial anomaly segmentation relies heavily on pixel-level annotations, yet real-world anomalies are often scarce, diverse, and costly to label. Segmentation-oriented industrial anomaly synthesis (SIAS) has emerged as a promising alternative; however, existing methods struggle to balance sampling efficiency and generation quality. Moreover, most approaches treat all spatial regions uniformly, overlooking the distinct statistical differences between anomaly and background areas. This uniform treatment hinders the synthesis of controllable, structure-specific anomalies tailored for segmentation tasks. In this paper, we propose FAST, a foreground-aware diffusion framework featuring two novel modules: the Anomaly-Informed Accelerated Sampling (AIAS) and the Foreground-Aware Reconstruction Module (FARM). AIAS is a training-free sampling algorithm specifically designed for segmentation-oriented industrial anomaly synthesis, which accelerates the reverse process through coarse-to-fine aggregation and enables the synthesis of state-of-the-art segmentation-oriented anomalies in as few as 10 steps. Meanwhile, FARM adaptively adjusts the anomaly-aware noise within the masked foreground regions at each sampling step, preserving localized anomaly signals throughout the denoising trajectory. Extensive experiments on multiple industrial benchmarks demonstrate that FAST consistently outperforms existing anomaly synthesis methods in downstream segmentation tasks.

  Current generative models struggle to synthesize dynamic 4D driving scenes that simultaneously support temporal extrapolation and spatial novel view synthesis (NVS) without per-scene optimization. Bridging generation and novel view synthesis remains a major challenge. We present PhiGenesis, a unified framework for 4D scene generation that extends video generation techniques with geometric and temporal consistency. Given multi-view image sequences and camera parameters, PhiGenesis produces temporally continuous 4D Gaussian splatting representations along target 3D trajectories. In its first stage, PhiGenesis leverages a pre-trained video VAE with a novel range-view adapter to enable feed-forward 4D reconstruction from multi-view images. This architecture supports single-frame or video inputs and outputs complete 4D scenes including geometry, semantics, and motion. In the second stage, PhiGenesis introduces a geometric-guided video diffusion model, using rendered historical 4D scenes as priors to generate future views conditioned on trajectories. To address geometric exposure bias in novel views, we propose Stereo Forcing, a novel conditioning strategy that integrates geometric uncertainty during denoising. This method enhances temporal coherence by dynamically adjusting generative influence based on uncertainty-aware perturbations. Our experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both appearance and geometric reconstruction, temporal generation and novel view synthesis (NVS) tasks, while simultaneously delivering competitive performance in downstream evaluations.

  Diffusion models have recently been investigated as powerful generative solvers for image dehazing, owing to their remarkable capability to model the data distribution. However, the massive computational burden imposed by the retraining of diffusion models, coupled with the extensive sampling steps during the inference, limit the broader application of diffusion models in image dehazing. To address these issues, we explore the properties of hazy images in the semantic latent space of frozen pre-trained diffusion models, and propose a Diffusion Latent Inspired network for Image Dehazing, dubbed DiffLI$^2$D. Specifically, we first reveal that the semantic latent space of pre-trained diffusion models can represent the content and haze characteristics of hazy images, as the diffusion time-step changes. Building upon this insight, we integrate the diffusion latent representations at different time-steps into a delicately designed dehazing network to provide instructions for image dehazing. Our DiffLI$^2$D avoids re-training diffusion models and iterative sampling process by effectively utilizing the informative representations derived from the pre-trained diffusion models, which also offers a novel perspective for introducing diffusion models to image dehazing. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior performance to existing image dehazing methods. Code is available atthis https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recently, camera-controlled video generation has seen rapid development, offering more precise control over video generation. However, existing methods predominantly focus on camera control in perspective projection video generation, while geometrically consistent panoramic video generation remains challenging. This limitation is primarily due to the inherent complexities in panoramic pose representation and spherical projection. To address this issue, we propose CamPVG, the first diffusion-based framework for panoramic video generation guided by precise camera poses. We achieve camera position encoding for panoramic images and cross-view feature aggregation based on spherical projection. Specifically, we propose a panoramic Pl√ºcker embedding that encodes camera extrinsic parameters through spherical coordinate transformation. This pose encoder effectively captures panoramic geometry, overcoming the limitations of traditional methods when applied to equirectangular projections. Additionally, we introduce a spherical epipolar module that enforces geometric constraints through adaptive attention masking along epipolar lines. This module enables fine-grained cross-view feature aggregation, substantially enhancing the quality and consistency of generated panoramic videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method generates high-quality panoramic videos consistent with camera trajectories, far surpassing existing methods in panoramic video generation.

  This paper presents GS-RoadPatching, an inpainting method for driving scene completion by referring to completely reconstructed regions, which are represented by 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). Unlike existing 3DGS inpainting methods that perform generative completion relying on 2D perspective-view-based diffusion or GAN models to predict limited appearance or depth cues for missing regions, our approach enables substitutional scene inpainting and editing directly through the 3DGS modality, extricating it from requiring spatial-temporal consistency of 2D cross-modals and eliminating the need for time-intensive retraining of Gaussians. Our key insight is that the highly repetitive patterns in driving scenes often share multi-modal similarities within the implicit 3DGS feature space and are particularly suitable for structural matching to enable effective 3DGS-based substitutional inpainting. Practically, we construct feature-embedded 3DGS scenes to incorporate a patch measurement method for abstracting local context at different scales and, subsequently, propose a structural search method to find candidate patches in 3D space effectively. Finally, we propose a simple yet effective substitution-and-fusion optimization for better visual harmony. We conduct extensive experiments on multiple publicly available datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed method in driving scenes, and the results validate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to the baseline methods in terms of both quality and interoperability. Additional experiments in general scenes also demonstrate the applicability of the proposed 3D inpainting strategy. The project page and code are available at:this https URL

  We propose a two-stage framework for audio-driven talking head generation with fine-grained expression control via facial Action Units (AUs). Unlike prior methods relying on emotion labels or implicit AU conditioning, our model explicitly maps AUs to 2D facial landmarks, enabling physically grounded, per-frame expression control. In the first stage, a variational motion generator predicts temporally coherent landmark sequences from audio and AU intensities. In the second stage, a diffusion-based synthesizer generates realistic, lip-synced videos conditioned on these landmarks and a reference image. This separation of motion and appearance improves expression accuracy, temporal stability, and visual realism. Experiments on the MEAD dataset show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across multiple metrics, demonstrating the effectiveness of explicit AU-to-landmark modeling for expressive talking head generation.

  Existing models often struggle with complex temporal changes, particularly when generating videos with gradual attribute transitions. The most common prompt interpolation approach for motion transitions often fails to handle gradual attribute transitions, where inconsistencies tend to become more pronounced. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective method to extend existing models for smooth and consistent attribute transitions, through introducing frame-wise guidance during the denoising process. Our approach constructs a data-specific transitional direction for each noisy latent, guiding the gradual shift from initial to final attributes frame by frame while preserving the motion dynamics of the video. Moreover, we present the Controlled-Attribute-Transition Benchmark (CAT-Bench), which integrates both attribute and motion dynamics, to comprehensively evaluate the performance of different models. We further propose two metrics to assess the accuracy and smoothness of attribute transitions. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach performs favorably against existing baselines, achieving visual fidelity, maintaining alignment with text prompts, and delivering seamless attribute transitions.

  We propose Lavida-O, a unified Masked Diffusion Model (MDM) for multimodal understanding and generation. Unlike existing multimodal MDMs such as MMaDa and Muddit which only support simple image-level understanding tasks and low-resolution image generation, Lavida-O presents a single framework that enables image-level understanding, object grounding, image editing, and high-resolution (1024px) text-to-image synthesis. Lavida-O incorporates a novel Elastic Mixture-of-Transformers (Elastic-MoT) architecture that couples a lightweight generation branch with a larger understanding branch, supported by token compression, universal text conditioning and stratified sampling for efficient and high-quality generation. Lavida-O further incorporates planning and iterative self-reflection in image generation and editing tasks, seamlessly boosting generation quality with its understanding capabilities. Lavida-O achieves state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of benchmarks including RefCOCO object grounding, GenEval text-to-image generation, and ImgEdit image editing, outperforming existing autoregressive models and continuous diffusion models such as Qwen2.5-VL and FluxKontext-dev, while offering considerable speedup at inference. These advances establish Lavida-O as a new paradigm for scalable multimodal reasoning and generation.

  Image fusion is a fundamental and important task in computer vision, aiming to combine complementary information from different modalities to fuse images. In recent years, diffusion models have made significant developments in the field of image fusion. However, diffusion models often require complex computations and redundant inference time, which reduces the applicability of these methods. To address this issue, we propose RFfusion, an efficient one-step diffusion model for image fusion based on Rectified Flow. We incorporate Rectified Flow into the image fusion task to straighten the sampling path in the diffusion model, achieving one-step sampling without the need for additional training, while still maintaining high-quality fusion results. Furthermore, we propose a task-specific variational autoencoder (VAE) architecture tailored for image fusion, where the fusion operation is embedded within the latent space to further reduce computational complexity. To address the inherent discrepancy between conventional reconstruction-oriented VAE objectives and the requirements of image fusion, we introduce a two-stage training strategy. This approach facilitates the effective learning and integration of complementary information from multi-modal source images, thereby enabling the model to retain fine-grained structural details while significantly enhancing inference efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in terms of both inference speed and fusion quality. Code is available atthis https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) are essential for video generation but suffer from significant latency due to the quadratic complexity of attention. By computing only critical tokens, sparse attention reduces computational costs and offers a promising acceleration approach. However, we identify that existing methods fail to approach optimal generation quality under the same computation budget for two reasons: (1) Inaccurate critical token identification: current methods cluster tokens based on position rather than semantics, leading to imprecise aggregated representations. (2) Excessive computation waste: critical tokens are scattered among non-critical ones, leading to wasted computation on GPUs, which are optimized for processing contiguous tokens. In this paper, we propose SVG2, a training-free framework that maximizes identification accuracy and minimizes computation waste, achieving a Pareto frontier trade-off between generation quality and efficiency. The core of SVG2 is semantic-aware permutation, which clusters and reorders tokens based on semantic similarity using k-means. This approach ensures both a precise cluster representation, improving identification accuracy, and a densified layout of critical tokens, enabling efficient computation without padding. Additionally, SVG2 integrates top-p dynamic budget control and customized kernel implementations, achieving up to 2.30x and 1.89x speedup while maintaining a PSNR of up to 30 and 26 on HunyuanVideo and Wan 2.1, respectively.

  Diffusion transformers (DiTs) struggle to generate images at resolutions higher than their training resolutions. The primary obstacle is that the explicit positional encodings(PE), such as RoPE, need extrapolating to unseen positions which degrades performance when the inference resolution differs from training. In this paper, We propose a Length-Extrapolatable Diffusion Transformer~(LEDiT) to overcome this limitation. LEDiT needs no explicit PEs, thereby avoiding PE extrapolation. The key innovation of LEDiT lies in the use of causal attention. We demonstrate that causal attention can implicitly encode global positional information and show that such information facilitates extrapolation. We further introduce a locality enhancement module, which captures fine-grained local information to complement the global coarse-grained position information encoded by causal attention. Experimental results on both conditional and text-to-image generation tasks demonstrate that LEDiT supports up to 4x resolution scaling (e.g., from 256x256 to 512x512), achieving better image quality compared to the state-of-the-art length extrapolation methods. We believe that LEDiT marks a departure from the standard RoPE-based methods and offers a promising insight into length extrapolation. Project page:this https URL

  Current video diffusion models achieve impressive generation quality but struggle in interactive applications due to bidirectional attention dependencies. The generation of a single frame requires the model to process the entire sequence, including the future. We address this limitation by adapting a pretrained bidirectional diffusion transformer to an autoregressive transformer that generates frames on-the-fly. To further reduce latency, we extend distribution matching distillation (DMD) to videos, distilling 50-step diffusion model into a 4-step generator. To enable stable and high-quality distillation, we introduce a student initialization scheme based on teacher's ODE trajectories, as well as an asymmetric distillation strategy that supervises a causal student model with a bidirectional teacher. This approach effectively mitigates error accumulation in autoregressive generation, allowing long-duration video synthesis despite training on short clips. Our model achieves a total score of 84.27 on the VBench-Long benchmark, surpassing all previous video generation models. It enables fast streaming generation of high-quality videos at 9.4 FPS on a single GPU thanks to KV caching. Our approach also enables streaming video-to-video translation, image-to-video, and dynamic prompting in a zero-shot manner.

  Subject-driven image inpainting has recently gained prominence in image editing with the rapid advancement of diffusion models. Beyond image guidance, recent studies have explored incorporating text guidance to achieve identity-preserved yet locally editable object inpainting. However, these methods still suffer from identity overfitting, where original attributes remain entangled with target textual instructions. To overcome this limitation, we propose DreamMix, a diffusion-based framework adept at inserting target objects into user-specified regions while concurrently enabling arbitrary text-driven attribute modifications. DreamMix introduces three key components: (i) an Attribute Decoupling Mechanism (ADM) that synthesizes diverse attribute-augmented image-text pairs to mitigate overfitting; (ii) a Textual Attribute Substitution (TAS) module that isolates target attributes via orthogonal decomposition, and (iii) a Disentangled Inpainting Framework (DIF) that seperates local generation from global harmonization. Extensive experiments across multiple inpainting backbones demonstrate that DreamMix achieves a superior balance between identity preservation and attribute editability across diverse applications, including object insertion, attribute editing, and small object inpainting.

  Text-driven 3D indoor scene generation is useful for gaming, the film industry, and AR/VR applications. However, existing methods cannot faithfully capture the room layout, nor do they allow flexible editing of individual objects in the room. To address these problems, we present Ctrl-Room, which can generate convincing 3D rooms with designer-style layouts and high-fidelity textures from just a text prompt. Moreover, Ctrl-Room enables versatile interactive editing operations such as resizing or moving individual furniture items. Our key insight is to separate the modeling of layouts and appearance. Our proposed method consists of two stages: a Layout Generation Stage and an Appearance Generation Stage. The Layout Generation Stage trains a text-conditional diffusion model to learn the layout distribution with our holistic scene code parameterization. Next, the Appearance Generation Stage employs a fine-tuned ControlNet to produce a vivid panoramic image of the room guided by the 3D scene layout and text prompt. We thus achieve a high-quality 3D room generation with convincing layouts and lively textures. Benefiting from the scene code parameterization, we can easily edit the generated room model through our mask-guided editing module, without expensive edit-specific training. Extensive experiments on the Structured3D dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms existing methods in producing more reasonable, view-consistent, and editable 3D rooms from natural language prompts.

  Recent advances in large language models have attracted significant interest in extending their capabilities to multimodal scenarios, particularly for speech-in speech-out conversational systems. However, existing multimodal models handling interleaved audio and text, such as MOSHI require complex multi stage training pipelines, incurring substantial computational costs. Moreover, these models uniformly apply autoregressive generation to both text and audio tokens, overlooking a fundamental asymmetry in their dependency structures: while text tokens exhibit strong target target dependencies requiring causal ordering, audio tokens are predominantly driven by source target dependencies, where audio outputs primarily condition on source text rather than preceding audio tokens. In this work, we propose TtT, a unified audio-text modeling framework that integrates AR text generation with non-autoregressive audio diffusion within a single Transformer architecture initialized from a pretrained LLM.
