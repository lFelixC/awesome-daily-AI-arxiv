- **[Query-Centric Diffusion Policy for Generalizable Robotic Assembly](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18686)**  `arXiv:2509.18686`  `cs.RO` `cs.LG`  
  _Ziyi Xu, Haohong Lin, Shiqi Liu, Ding Zhao_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The robotic assembly task poses a key challenge in building generalist robots due to the intrinsic complexity of part interactions and the sensitivity to noise perturbations in contact-rich settings. The assembly agent is typically designed in a hierarchical manner: high-level multi-part reasoning and low-level precise control. However, implementing such a hierarchical policy is challenging in practice due to the mismatch between high-level skill queries and low-level execution. To address this, we propose the Query-centric Diffusion Policy (QDP), a hierarchical framework that bridges high-level planning and low-level control by utilizing queries comprising objects, contact points, and skill information. QDP introduces a query-centric mechanism that identifies task-relevant components and uses them to guide low-level policies, leveraging point cloud observations to improve the policy's robustness. We conduct comprehensive experiments on the FurnitureBench in both simulation and real-world settings, demonstrating improved performance in skill precision and long-horizon success rate. In the challenging insertion and screwing tasks, QDP improves the skill-wise success rate by over 50% compared to baselines without structured queries.

- **[FUNCanon: Learning Pose-Aware Action Primitives via Functional Object Canonicalization for Generalizable Robotic Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19102)**  `arXiv:2509.19102`  `cs.RO` `cs.AI` `cs.CV`  
  _Hongli Xu, Lei Zhang, Xiaoyue Hu, Boyang Zhong, Kaixin Bai, Zolt√°n-Csaba M√°rton, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  General-purpose robotic skills from end-to-end demonstrations often leads to task-specific policies that fail to generalize beyond the training distribution. Therefore, we introduce FunCanon, a framework that converts long-horizon manipulation tasks into sequences of action chunks, each defined by an actor, verb, and object. These chunks focus policy learning on the actions themselves, rather than isolated tasks, enabling compositionality and reuse. To make policies pose-aware and category-general, we perform functional object canonicalization for functional alignment and automatic manipulation trajectory transfer, mapping objects into shared functional frames using affordance cues from large vision language models. An object centric and action centric diffusion policy FuncDiffuser trained on this aligned data naturally respects object affordances and poses, simplifying learning and improving generalization ability. Experiments on simulated and real-world benchmarks demonstrate category-level generalization, cross-task behavior reuse, and robust sim2real deployment, showing that functional canonicalization provides a strong inductive bias for scalable imitation learning in complex manipulation domains.

- **[World4RL: Diffusion World Models for Policy Refinement with Reinforcement Learning for Robotic Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19080)**  `arXiv:2509.19080`  `cs.RO` `cs.AI`  
  _Zhennan Jiang, Kai Liu, Yuxin Qin, Shuai Tian, Yupeng Zheng, Mingcai Zhou, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Robotic manipulation policies are commonly initialized through imitation learning, but their performance is limited by the scarcity and narrow coverage of expert data. Reinforcement learning can refine polices to alleviate this limitation, yet real-robot training is costly and unsafe, while training in simulators suffers from the sim-to-real gap. Recent advances in generative models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in real-world simulation, with diffusion models in particular excelling at generation. This raises the question of how diffusion model-based world models can be combined to enhance pre-trained policies in robotic manipulation. In this work, we propose World4RL, a framework that employs diffusion-based world models as high-fidelity simulators to refine pre-trained policies entirely in imagined environments for robotic manipulation. Unlike prior works that primarily employ world models for planning, our framework enables direct end-to-end policy optimization. World4RL is designed around two principles: pre-training a diffusion world model that captures diverse dynamics on multi-task datasets and refining policies entirely within a frozen world model to avoid online real-world interactions. We further design a two-hot action encoding scheme tailored for robotic manipulation and adopt diffusion backbones to improve modeling fidelity. Extensive simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate that World4RL provides high-fidelity environment modeling and enables consistent policy refinement, yielding significantly higher success rates compared to imitation learning and other baselines.

  The emergence of Vision Language Action (VLA) models marks a paradigm shift from traditional policy-based control to generalized robotics, reframing Vision Language Models (VLMs) from passive sequence generators into active agents for manipulation and decision-making in complex, dynamic environments. This survey delves into advanced VLA methods, aiming to provide a clear taxonomy and a systematic, comprehensive review of existing research. It presents a comprehensive analysis of VLA applications across different scenarios and classifies VLA approaches into several paradigms: autoregression-based, diffusion-based, reinforcement-based, hybrid, and specialized methods; while examining their motivations, core strategies, and implementations in detail. In addition, foundational datasets, benchmarks, and simulation platforms are introduced. Building on the current VLA landscape, the review further proposes perspectives on key challenges and future directions to advance research in VLA models and generalizable robotics. By synthesizing insights from over three hundred recent studies, this survey maps the contours of this rapidly evolving field and highlights the opportunities and challenges that will shape the development of scalable, general-purpose VLA methods.

- **[ManipForce: Force-Guided Policy Learning with Frequency-Aware Representation for Contact-Rich Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19047)**  `arXiv:2509.19047`  `cs.RO`  
  _Geonhyup Lee, Yeongjin Lee, Kangmin Kim, Seongju Lee, Sangjun Noh, Seunghyeok Back, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Contact-rich manipulation tasks such as precision assembly require precise control of interaction forces, yet existing imitation learning methods rely mainly on vision-only demonstrations. We propose ManipForce, a handheld system designed to capture high-frequency force-torque (F/T) and RGB data during natural human demonstrations for contact-rich manipulation. Building on these demonstrations, we introduce the Frequency-Aware Multimodal Transformer (FMT). FMT encodes asynchronous RGB and F/T signals using frequency- and modality-aware embeddings and fuses them via bi-directional cross-attention within a transformer diffusion policy. Through extensive experiments on six real-world contact-rich manipulation tasks - such as gear assembly, box flipping, and battery insertion - FMT trained on ManipForce demonstrations achieves robust performance with an average success rate of 83% across all tasks, substantially outperforming RGB-only baselines. Ablation and sampling-frequency analyses further confirm that incorporating high-frequency F/T data and cross-modal integration improves policy performance, especially in tasks demanding high precision and stable contact.

- **[Learning Geometry-Aware Nonprehensile Pushing and Pulling with Dexterous Hands](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18455)**  `arXiv:2509.18455`  `cs.RO`  
  _Yunshuang Li, Yiyang Ling, Gaurav S. Sukhatme, Daniel Seita_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Nonprehensile manipulation, such as pushing and pulling, enables robots to move, align, or reposition objects that may be difficult to grasp due to their geometry, size, or relationship to the robot or the environment. Much of the existing work in nonprehensile manipulation relies on parallel-jaw grippers or tools such as rods and spatulas. In contrast, multi-fingered dexterous hands offer richer contact modes and versatility for handling diverse objects to provide stable support over the objects, which compensates for the difficulty of modeling the dynamics of nonprehensile manipulation. Therefore, we propose Geometry-aware Dexterous Pushing and Pulling (GD2P) for nonprehensile manipulation with dexterous robotic hands. We study pushing and pulling by framing the problem as synthesizing and learning pre-contact dexterous hand poses that lead to effective manipulation. We generate diverse hand poses via contact-guided sampling, filter them using physics simulation, and train a diffusion model conditioned on object geometry to predict viable poses. At test time, we sample hand poses and use standard motion planners to select and execute pushing and pulling actions. We perform 840 real-world experiments with an Allegro Hand, comparing our method to baselines. The results indicate that GD2P offers a scalable route for training dexterous nonprehensile manipulation policies. We further demonstrate GD2P on a LEAP Hand, highlighting its applicability to different hand morphologies. Our pre-trained models and dataset, including 1.3 million hand poses across 2.3k objects, will be open-source to facilitate further research. Our project website is available at:this http URL.

- **[Latent Danger Zone: Distilling Unified Attention for Cross-Architecture Black-box Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19044)**  `arXiv:2509.19044`  `cs.LG` `cs.CV`  
  _Yang Li, Chenyu Wang, Tingrui Wang, Yongwei Wang, Haonan Li, Zhunga Liu, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Black-box adversarial attacks remain challenging due to limited access to model internals. Existing methods often depend on specific network architectures or require numerous queries, resulting in limited cross-architecture transferability and high query costs. To address these limitations, we propose JAD, a latent diffusion model framework for black-box adversarial attacks. JAD generates adversarial examples by leveraging a latent diffusion model guided by attention maps distilled from both a convolutional neural network (CNN) and a Vision Transformer (ViT) models. By focusing on image regions that are commonly sensitive across architectures, this approach crafts adversarial perturbations that transfer effectively between different model types. This joint attention distillation strategy enables JAD to be architecture-agnostic, achieving superior attack generalization across diverse models. Moreover, the generative nature of the diffusion framework yields high adversarial sample generation efficiency by reducing reliance on iterative queries. Experiments demonstrate that JAD offers improved attack generalization, generation efficiency, and cross-architecture transferability compared to existing methods, providing a promising and effective paradigm for black-box adversarial attacks.

- **[Foresight: Adaptive Layer Reuse for Accelerated and High-Quality Text-to-Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00329)**  `arXiv:2506.00329`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI` `cs.CV`  
  _Muhammad Adnan, Nithesh Kurella, Akhil Arunkumar, Prashant J. Nair_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) achieve state-of-the-art results in text-to-image, text-to-video generation, and editing. However, their large model size and the quadratic cost of spatial-temporal attention over multiple denoising steps make video generation computationally expensive. Static caching mitigates this by reusing features across fixed steps but fails to adapt to generation dynamics, leading to suboptimal trade-offs between speed and quality.We propose Foresight, an adaptive layer-reuse technique that reduces computational redundancy across denoising steps while preserving baseline performance. Foresight dynamically identifies and reuses DiT block outputs for all layers across steps, adapting to generation parameters such as resolution and denoising schedules to optimize efficiency. Applied to OpenSora, Latte, and CogVideoX, Foresight achieves up to \latencyimprv end-to-end speedup, while maintaining video quality.

- **[Flow marching for a generative PDE foundation model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18611)**  `arXiv:2509.18611`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Zituo Chen, Sili Deng_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Pretraining on large-scale collections of PDE-governed spatiotemporal trajectories has recently shown promise for building generalizable models of dynamical systems. Yet most existing PDE foundation models rely on deterministic Transformer architectures, which lack generative flexibility for many science and engineering applications. We propose Flow Marching, an algorithm that bridges neural operator learning with flow matching motivated by an analysis of error accumulation in physical dynamical systems, and we build a generative PDE foundation model on top of it. By jointly sampling the noise level and the physical time step between adjacent states, the model learns a unified velocity field that transports a noisy current state toward its clean successor, reducing long-term rollout drift while enabling uncertainty-aware ensemble generations. Alongside this core algorithm, we introduce a Physics-Pretrained Variational Autoencoder (P2VAE) to embed physical states into a compact latent space, and an efficient Flow Marching Transformer (FMT) that combines a diffusion-forcing scheme with latent temporal pyramids, achieving up to 15x greater computational efficiency than full-length video diffusion models and thereby enabling large-scale pretraining at substantially reduced cost. We curate a corpus of ~2.5M trajectories across 12 distinct PDE families and train suites of P2VAEs and FMTs at multiple scales. On downstream evaluation, we benchmark on unseen Kolmogorov turbulence with few-shot adaptation, demonstrate long-term rollout stability over deterministic counterparts, and present uncertainty-stratified ensemble results, highlighting the importance of generative PDE foundation models for real-world applications.

- **[AdaSTI: Conditional Diffusion Models with Adaptive Dependency Modeling for Spatio-Temporal Imputation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18144)**  `arXiv:2509.18144`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Yubo Yang, Yichen Zhu, Bo Jiang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Spatio-temporal data abounds in domain like traffic and environmental monitoring. However, it often suffers from missing values due to sensor malfunctions, transmission failures, etc. Recent years have seen continued efforts to improve spatio-temporal data imputation performance. Recently diffusion models have outperformed other approaches in various tasks, including spatio-temporal imputation, showing competitive performance. Extracting and utilizing spatio-temporal dependencies as conditional information is vital in diffusion-based methods. However, previous methods introduce error accumulation in this process and ignore the variability of the dependencies in the noisy data at different diffusion steps. In this paper, we propose AdaSTI (Adaptive Dependency Model in Diffusion-based Spatio-Temporal Imputation), a novel spatio-temporal imputation approach based on conditional diffusion model. Inside AdaSTI, we propose a BiS4PI network based on a bi-directional S4 model for pre-imputation with the imputed result used to extract conditional information by our designed Spatio-Temporal Conditionalizer (STC)network. We also propose a Noise-Aware Spatio-Temporal (NAST) network with a gated attention mechanism to capture the variant dependencies across diffusion steps. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets show that AdaSTI outperforms existing methods in all the settings, with up to 46.4% reduction in imputation error.

- **[ToMA: Token Merge with Attention for Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10918)**  `arXiv:2509.10918`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Wenbo Lu, Shaoyi Zheng, Yuxuan Xia, Shengjie Wang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Diffusion models excel in high-fidelity image generation but face scalability limits due to transformers' quadratic attention complexity. Plug-and-play token reduction methods like ToMeSD and ToFu reduce FLOPs by merging redundant tokens in generated images but rely on GPU-inefficient operations (e.g., sorting, scattered writes), introducing overheads that negate theoretical speedups when paired with optimized attention implementations (e.g., FlashAttention). To bridge this gap, we propose Token Merge with Attention (ToMA), an off-the-shelf method that redesigns token reduction for GPU-aligned efficiency, with three key contributions: 1) a reformulation of token merge as a submodular optimization problem to select diverse tokens; 2) merge/unmerge as an attention-like linear transformation via GPU-friendly matrix operations; and 3) exploiting latent locality and sequential redundancy (pattern reuse) to minimize overhead. ToMA reduces SDXL/Flux generation latency by 24%/23%, respectively (with DINO $\Delta < 0.07$), outperforming prior methods. This work bridges the gap between theoretical and practical efficiency for transformers in diffusion.

- **[Diffusion Bridge Variational Inference for Deep Gaussian Processes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19078)**  `arXiv:2509.19078`  `cs.LG`  
  _Jian Xu, Qibin Zhao, John Paisley, Delu Zeng_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Deep Gaussian processes (DGPs) enable expressive hierarchical Bayesian modeling but pose substantial challenges for posterior inference, especially over inducing variables. Denoising diffusion variational inference (DDVI) addresses this by modeling the posterior as a time-reversed diffusion from a simple Gaussian prior. However, DDVI's fixed unconditional starting distribution remains far from the complex true posterior, resulting in inefficient inference trajectories and slow convergence. In this work, we propose Diffusion Bridge Variational Inference (DBVI), a principled extension of DDVI that initiates the reverse diffusion from a learnable, data-dependent initial distribution. This initialization is parameterized via an amortized neural network and progressively adapted using gradients from the ELBO objective, reducing the posterior gap and improving sample efficiency. To enable scalable amortization, we design the network to operate on the inducing inputs, which serve as structured, low-dimensional summaries of the dataset and naturally align with the inducing variables' shape. DBVI retains the mathematical elegance of DDVI, including Girsanov-based ELBOs and reverse-time SDEs,while reinterpreting the prior via a Doob-bridged diffusion process. We derive a tractable training objective under this formulation and implement DBVI for scalable inference in large-scale DGPs. Across regression, classification, and image reconstruction tasks, DBVI consistently outperforms DDVI and other variational baselines in predictive accuracy, convergence speed, and posterior quality.

- **[OmniBridge: Unified Multimodal Understanding, Generation, and Retrieval via Latent Space Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19018)**  `arXiv:2509.19018`  `cs.LG`  
  _Teng Xiao, Zuchao Li, Lefei Zhang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in multimodal large language models (LLMs) have led to significant progress in understanding, generation, and retrieval tasks. However, current solutions often treat these tasks in isolation or require training LLMs from scratch, resulting in high computational costs and limited generalization across modalities. In this work, we present OmniBridge, a unified and modular multimodal framework that supports vision-language understanding, generation, and retrieval within a unified architecture. OmniBridge adopts a language-centric design that reuses pretrained LLMs and introduces a lightweight bidirectional latent alignment module. To address the challenge of task interference, we propose a two-stage decoupled training strategy: supervised fine-tuning and latent space alignment for aligning LLM behavior with multimodal reasoning, and semantic-guided diffusion training to align cross-modal latent spaces via learnable query embeddings. Extensive experiments across a wide range of benchmarks demonstrate that OmniBridge achieves competitive or state-of-the-art performance in all three tasks. Moreover, our results highlight the effectiveness of latent space alignment for unifying multimodal modeling under a shared representation space. Code and models are released atthis https URL.

- **[DS-Diffusion: Data Style-Guided Diffusion Model for Time-Series Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18584)**  `arXiv:2509.18584`  `cs.LG`  
  _Mingchun Sun, Rongqiang Zhao, Jie Liu_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Diffusion models are the mainstream approach for time series generation tasks. However, existing diffusion models for time series generation require retraining the entire framework to introduce specific conditional guidance. There also exists a certain degree of distributional bias between the generated data and the real data, which leads to potential model biases in downstream tasks. Additionally, the complexity of diffusion models and the latent spaces leads to an uninterpretable inference process. To address these issues, we propose the data style-guided diffusion model (DS-Diffusion). In the DS-Diffusion, a diffusion framework based on style-guided kernels is developed to avoid retraining for specific conditions. The time-information based hierarchical denoising mechanism (THD) is developed to reduce the distributional bias between the generated data and the real data. Furthermore, the generated samples can clearly indicate the data style from which they originate. We conduct comprehensive evaluations using multiple public datasets to validate our approach. Experimental results show that, compared to the state-of-the-art model such as ImagenTime, the predictive score and the discriminative score decrease by 5.56% and 61.55%, respectively. The distributional bias between the generated data and the real data is further reduced, the inference process is also more interpretable. Moreover, by eliminating the need to retrain the diffusion model, the flexibility and adaptability of the model to specific conditions are also enhanced.

- **[Diffusion Policies with Offline and Inverse Reinforcement Learning for Promoting Physical Activity in Older Adults Using Wearable Sensors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18433)**  `arXiv:2509.18433`  `cs.LG`  
  _Chang Liu, Ladda Thiamwong, Yanjie Fu, Rui Xie_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Utilizing offline reinforcement learning (RL) with real-world clinical data is getting increasing attention in AI for healthcare. However, implementation poses significant challenges. Defining direct rewards is difficult, and inverse RL (IRL) struggles to infer accurate reward functions from expert behavior in complex environments. Offline RL also encounters challenges in aligning learned policies with observed human behavior in healthcare applications. To address challenges in applying offline RL to physical activity promotion for older adults at high risk of falls, based on wearable sensor activity monitoring, we introduce Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks and Diffusion Policies for Offline Inverse Reinforcement Learning (KANDI). By leveraging the flexible function approximation in Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks, we estimate reward functions by learning free-living environment behavior from low-fall-risk older adults (experts), while diffusion-based policies within an Actor-Critic framework provide a generative approach for action refinement and efficiency in offline RL. We evaluate KANDI using wearable activity monitoring data in a two-arm clinical trial from our Physio-feedback Exercise Program (PEER) study, emphasizing its practical application in a fall-risk intervention program to promote physical activity among older adults. Additionally, KANDI outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the D4RL benchmark. These results underscore KANDI's potential to address key challenges in offline RL for healthcare applications, offering an effective solution for activity promotion intervention strategies in healthcare.

- **[DSFT: Inspiring Diffusion Large Language Models to Comprehend Mathematical and Logical Patterns](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18164)**  `arXiv:2509.18164`  `cs.LG`  
  _Ranfei Chen, Ming Chen_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) have emerged as a new architecture following auto regressive models. Their denoising process offers a powerful generative advantage, but they present significant challenges in learning and understanding numerically sensitive mathematical and order-sensitive logical tasks. Current training methods, including pre-training, fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning, focus primarily on improving general knowledge retention and reasoning abilities, but lack a comprehensive understanding of mathematical and logical patterns. We propose DSFT, a simple yet effective Diffusion SFT strategy, by adjusting the masking strategy and loss function, guiding models to understand mathematical and logical patterns. This strategy can be flexibly combined with pre-training, reinforcement learning, and other training methods. Validated on models such as LLaDA and Dream series, we prove that DSFT on small-scale data can achieve improvements of 5-10% and approximately 2% on mathematical and logical problems, respectively. This inspiring masking approach offers insights for future learning of specific patterns, which can be easily and efficiently combined with other training methods and applied to various dLLMs. Our code is publicly available atthis https URL

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Efficient inference is a critical challenge in deep generative modeling, particularly as diffusion models grow in capacity and complexity. While increased complexity often improves accuracy, it raises compute costs, latency, and memory requirements. This work investigates techniques such as pruning, quantization, knowledge distillation, and simplified attention to reduce computational overhead without impacting performance. The study also explores the Mixture of Experts (MoE) approach to further enhance efficiency. These experiments provide insights into optimizing inference for the state-of-the-art Fast Diffusion Transformer (fast-DiT) model.

  _Xin Lei Lin, Soroush Mehraban, Abhishek Moturu, Babak Taati_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Automated pain assessment from facial expressions is crucial for non-communicative patients, such as those with dementia. Progress has been limited by two challenges: (i) existing datasets exhibit severe demographic and label imbalance due to ethical constraints, and (ii) current generative models cannot precisely control facial action units (AUs), facial structure, or clinically validated pain levels.We present 3DPain, a large-scale synthetic dataset specifically designed for automated pain assessment, featuring unprecedented annotation richness and demographic diversity. Our three-stage framework generates diverse 3D meshes, textures them with diffusion models, and applies AU-driven face rigging to synthesize multi-view faces with paired neutral and pain images, AU configurations, PSPI scores, and the first dataset-level annotations of pain-region heatmaps. The dataset comprises 82,500 samples across 25,000 pain expression heatmaps and 2,500 synthetic identities balanced by age, gender, and ethnicity.We further introduce ViTPain, a Vision Transformer based cross-modal distillation framework in which a heatmap-trained teacher guides a student trained on RGB images, enhancing accuracy, interpretability, and clinical reliability. Together, 3DPain and ViTPain establish a controllable, diverse, and clinically grounded foundation for generalizable automated pain assessment.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Video-based AI systems are increasingly adopted in safety-critical domains such as autonomous driving and healthcare. However, interpreting their decisions remains challenging due to the inherent spatiotemporal complexity of video data and the opacity of deep learning models. Existing explanation techniques often suffer from limited temporal coherence, insufficient robustness, and a lack of actionable causal insights. Current counterfactual explanation methods typically do not incorporate guidance from the target model, reducing semantic fidelity and practical utility. We introduce Latent Diffusion for Video Counterfactual Explanations (LD-ViCE), a novel framework designed to explain the behavior of video-based AI models. Compared to previous approaches, LD-ViCE reduces the computational costs of generating explanations by operating in latent space using a state-of-the-art diffusion model, while producing realistic and interpretable counterfactuals through an additional refinement step. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of LD-ViCE across three diverse video datasets, including EchoNet-Dynamic (cardiac ultrasound), FERV39k (facial expression), and Something-Something V2 (action recognition). LD-ViCE outperforms a recent state-of-the-art method, achieving an increase in R2 score of up to 68% while reducing inference time by half. Qualitative analysis confirms that LD-ViCE generates semantically meaningful and temporally coherent explanations, offering valuable insights into the target model behavior. LD-ViCE represents a valuable step toward the trustworthy deployment of AI in safety-critical domains.

- **[SCoT: Straight Consistent Trajectory for Pre-Trained Diffusion Model Distillations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16972)**  `arXiv:2502.16972`  `cs.CV` `cs.LG`  
  _Zhangkai Wu, Xuhui Fan, Hongyu Wu, Longbing Cao_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Pre-trained diffusion models are commonly used to generate clean data (e.g., images) from random noises, effectively forming pairs of noises and corresponding clean images. Distillation on these pre-trained models can be viewed as the process of constructing advanced trajectories within the pair to accelerate sampling. For instance, consistency model distillation develops consistent projection functions to regulate trajectories, although sampling efficiency remains a concern. Rectified flow method enforces straight trajectories to enable faster sampling, yet relies on numerical ODE solvers, which may introduce approximation errors. In this work, we bridge the gap between the consistency model and the rectified flow method by proposing a Straight Consistent Trajectory~(SCoT) model. SCoT enjoys the benefits of both approaches for fast sampling, producing trajectories with consistent and straight properties simultaneously. These dual properties are strategically balanced by targeting two critical objectives: (1) regulating the gradient of SCoT's mapping to a constant, (2) ensuring trajectory consistency. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of SCoT.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Deep learning algorithms require extensive data to achieve robust performance. However, data availability is often restricted in the medical domain due to patient privacy concerns. Synthetic data presents a possible solution to these challenges. Recently, image generative models have found increasing use for medical applications but are often designed for singular medical specialties and imaging modalities, thus limiting their broader utility. To address this, we introduce MediSyn: a text-guided, latent diffusion model capable of generating synthetic images from 6 medical specialties and 10 image types. Through extensive experimentation, we first demonstrate that MediSyn quantitatively matches or surpasses the performance of specialist models. Second, we show that our synthetic images are realistic and exhibit strong alignment with their corresponding text prompts, as validated by a team of expert physicians. Third, we provide empirical evidence that our synthetic images are visually distinct from their corresponding real patient images. Finally, we demonstrate that in data-limited settings, classifiers trained solely on synthetic data or real data supplemented with synthetic data can outperform those trained solely on real data. Our findings highlight the immense potential of generalist image generative models to accelerate algorithmic research and development in medicine.

  Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are expected to revolutionize transportation by improving efficiency and safety. Their success relies on 3D vision systems that effectively sense the environment and detect traffic agents. Among sensors AVs use to create a comprehensive view of surroundings, LiDAR provides high-resolution depth data enabling accurate object detection, safe navigation, and collision avoidance. However, collecting real-world LiDAR data is time-consuming and often affected by noise and sparsity due to adverse weather or sensor limitations. This work applies a denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM), enhanced with novel noise scheduling and time-step embedding techniques to generate high-quality synthetic data for augmentation, thereby improving performance across a range of computer vision tasks, particularly in AV perception. These modifications impact the denoising process and the model's temporal awareness, allowing it to produce more realistic point clouds based on the projection. The proposed method was extensively evaluated under various configurations using the IAMCV and KITTI-360 datasets, with four performance metrics compared against state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. The results demonstrate the model's superior performance over most existing baselines and its effectiveness in mitigating the effects of noisy and sparse LiDAR data, producing diverse point clouds with rich spatial relationships and structural detail.

  Remote sensing visual grounding (RSVG) aims to localize objects in remote sensing images based on free-form natural language expressions. Existing approaches are typically constrained to closed-set vocabularies, limiting their applicability in open-world scenarios. While recent attempts to leverage generic foundation models for open-vocabulary RSVG, they overly rely on expensive high-quality datasets and time-consuming fine-tuning. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{RSVG-ZeroOV}, a training-free framework that aims to explore the potential of frozen generic foundation models for zero-shot open-vocabulary RSVG. Specifically, RSVG-ZeroOV comprises three key stages: (i) Overview: We utilize a vision-language model (VLM) to obtain cross-attention\footnote[1]{In this paper, although decoder-only VLMs use self-attention over all tokens, we refer to the image-text interaction part as cross-attention to distinguish it from pure visual self-attention.}maps that capture semantic correlations between text queries and visual regions. (ii) Focus: By leveraging the fine-grained modeling priors of a diffusion model (DM), we fill in gaps in structural and shape information of objects, which are often overlooked by VLM. (iii) Evolve: A simple yet effective attention evolution module is introduced to suppress irrelevant activations, yielding purified segmentation masks over the referred objects. Without cumbersome task-specific training, RSVG-ZeroOV offers an efficient and scalable solution. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework consistently outperforms existing weakly-supervised and zero-shot methods.

  Conditional generative modeling aims to learn a conditional data distribution from samples containing data-condition pairs. For this, diffusion and flow-based methods have attained compelling results. These methods use a learned (flow) model to transport an initial standard Gaussian noise that ignores the condition to the conditional data distribution. The model is hence required to learn both mass transport and conditional injection. To ease the demand on the model, we propose Condition-Aware Reparameterization for Flow Matching (CAR-Flow) -- a lightweight, learned shift that conditions the source, the target, or both distributions. By relocating these distributions, CAR-Flow shortens the probability path the model must learn, leading to faster training in practice. On low-dimensional synthetic data, we visualize and quantify the effects of CAR. On higher-dimensional natural image data (ImageNet-256), equipping SiT-XL/2 with CAR-Flow reduces FID from 2.07 to 1.68, while introducing less than 0.6% additional parameters.

  We proposed Lavida-O, a unified multi-modal Masked Diffusion Model (MDM) capable of image understanding and generation tasks. Unlike existing multimodal diffsion language models such as MMaDa and Muddit which only support simple image-level understanding tasks and low-resolution image generation, Lavida-O exhibits many new capabilities such as object grounding, image-editing, and high-resolution (1024px) image synthesis. It is also the first unified MDM that uses its understanding capabilities to improve image generation and editing results through planning and iterative self-reflection. To allow effective and efficient training and sampling, Lavida-O ntroduces many novel techniques such as Elastic Mixture-of-Transformer architecture, universal text conditioning, and stratified sampling. \ours~achieves state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of benchmarks such as RefCOCO object grounding, GenEval text-to-image generation, and ImgEdit image editing, outperforming existing autoregressive and continuous diffusion models such as Qwen2.5-VL and FluxKontext-dev, while offering considerable speedup at inference.

  Unified multimodal models have recently attracted considerable attention for their remarkable abilities in jointly understanding and generating diverse content. However, as contexts integrate increasingly numerous interleaved multimodal tokens, the iterative processes of diffusion denoising and autoregressive decoding impose significant computational overhead. To address this, we propose Hyper-Bagel, a unified acceleration framework designed to simultaneously speed up both multimodal understanding and generation tasks. Our approach uses a divide-and-conquer strategy, employing speculative decoding for next-token prediction and a multi-stage distillation process for diffusion denoising. The framework delivers substantial performance gains, achieving over a 2x speedup in multimodal understanding. For generative tasks, our resulting lossless 6-NFE model yields a 16.67x speedup in text-to-image generation and a 22x speedup in image editing, all while preserving the high-quality output of the original model. We further develop a highly efficient 1-NFE model that enables near real-time interactive editing and generation. By combining advanced adversarial distillation with human feedback learning, this model achieves ultimate cost-effectiveness and responsiveness, making complex multimodal interactions seamless and instantaneous.

  The scarcity of annotated surgical data poses a significant challenge for developing deep learning systems in computer-assisted interventions. While diffusion models can synthesize realistic images, they often suffer from data memorization, resulting in inconsistent or non-diverse samples that may fail to improve, or even harm, downstream performance. We introduce \emph{Surgical Application-Aligned Diffusion} (SAADi), a new framework that aligns diffusion models with samples preferred by downstream models. Our method constructs pairs of \emph{preferred} and \emph{non-preferred} synthetic images and employs lightweight fine-tuning of diffusion models to align the image generation process with downstream objectives explicitly. Experiments on three surgical datasets demonstrate consistent gains of $7$--$9\%$ in classification and $2$--$10\%$ in segmentation tasks, with the considerable improvements observed for underrepresented classes. Iterative refinement of synthetic samples further boosts performance by $4$--$10\%$. Unlike baseline approaches, our method overcomes sample degradation and establishes task-aware alignment as a key principle for mitigating data scarcity and advancing surgical vision applications.

  Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated remarkable success in 3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis. However, reconstructing 3D scenes from sparse viewpoints remains highly challenging due to insufficient visual information, which results in noticeable artifacts persisting across the 3D representation. To address this limitation, recent methods have resorted to generative priors to remove artifacts and complete missing content in under-constrained areas. Despite their effectiveness, these approaches struggle to ensure multi-view consistency, resulting in blurred structures and implausible details. In this work, we propose FixingGS, a training-free method that fully exploits the capabilities of the existing diffusion model for sparse-view 3DGS reconstruction enhancement. At the core of FixingGS is our distillation approach, which delivers more accurate and cross-view coherent diffusion priors, thereby enabling effective artifact removal and inpainting. In addition, we propose an adaptive progressive enhancement scheme that further refines reconstructions in under-constrained regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FixingGS surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods with superior visual quality and reconstruction performance. Our code will be released publicly.

  Inverting corrupted images into the latent space of diffusion models is challenging. Current methods, which encode an image into a single latent vector, struggle to balance structural fidelity with semantic accuracy, leading to reconstructions with semantic drift, such as blurred details or incorrect attributes. To overcome this, we introduce Prompt-Guided Dual Latent Steering (PDLS), a novel, training-free framework built upon Rectified Flow models for their stable inversion paths. PDLS decomposes the inversion process into two complementary streams: a structural path to preserve source integrity and a semantic path guided by a prompt. We formulate this dual guidance as an optimal control problem and derive a closed-form solution via a Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR). This controller dynamically steers the generative trajectory at each step, preventing semantic drift while ensuring the preservation of fine detail without costly, per-image optimization. Extensive experiments on FFHQ-1K and ImageNet-1K under various inversion tasks, including Gaussian deblurring, motion deblurring, super-resolution and freeform inpainting, demonstrate that PDLS produces reconstructions that are both more faithful to the original image and better aligned with the semantic information than single-latent baselines.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We propose Adaptive Multi-Style Fusion (AMSF), a reference-based training-free framework that enables controllable fusion of multiple reference styles in diffusion models. Most of the existing reference-based methods are limited by (a) acceptance of only one style image, thus prohibiting hybrid aesthetics and scalability to more styles, and (b) lack of a principled mechanism to balance several stylistic influences. AMSF mitigates these challenges by encoding all style images and textual hints with a semantic token decomposition module that is adaptively injected into every cross-attention layer of an frozen diffusion model. A similarity-aware re-weighting module then recalibrates, at each denoising step, the attention allocated to every style component, yielding balanced and user-controllable blends without any fine-tuning or external adapters. Both qualitative and quantitative evaluations show that AMSF produces multi-style fusion results that consistently outperform the state-of-the-art approaches, while its fusion design scales seamlessly to two or more styles. These capabilities position AMSF as a practical step toward expressive multi-style generation in diffusion models.

  Research on unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) for semantic segmentation of remote sensing images has been extensively conducted. However, research on how to achieve domain adaptation in practical scenarios where source domain data is inaccessible namely, source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) remains limited. Self-training has been widely used in SFDA, which requires obtaining as many high-quality pseudo-labels as possible to train models on target domain data. Most existing methods optimize the entire pseudo-label set to obtain more supervisory information. However, as pseudo-label sets often contain substantial noise, simultaneously optimizing all labels is challenging. This limitation undermines the effectiveness of optimization approaches and thus restricts the performance of self-training. To address this, we propose a novel pseudo-label optimization framework called Diffusion-Guided Label Enrichment (DGLE), which starts from a few easily obtained high-quality pseudo-labels and propagates them to a complete set of pseudo-labels while ensuring the quality of newly generated labels. Firstly, a pseudo-label fusion method based on confidence filtering and super-resolution enhancement is proposed, which utilizes cross-validation of details and contextual information to obtain a small number of high-quality pseudo-labels as initial seeds. Then, we leverage the diffusion model to propagate incomplete seed pseudo-labels with irregular distributions due to its strong denoising capability for randomly distributed noise and powerful modeling capacity for complex distributions, thereby generating complete and high-quality pseudo-labels. This method effectively avoids the difficulty of directly optimizing the complete set of pseudo-labels, significantly improves the quality of pseudo-labels, and thus enhances the model's performance in the target domain.

  The advancement of diffusion models has enhanced the realism of AI-generated content but also raised concerns about misuse, necessitating robust copyright protection and tampering localization. Although recent methods have made progress toward unified solutions, their reliance on post hoc processing introduces considerable application inconvenience and compromises forensic reliability. We propose StableGuard, a novel framework that seamlessly integrates a binary watermark into the diffusion generation process, ensuring copyright protection and tampering localization in Latent Diffusion Models through an end-to-end design. We develop a Multiplexing Watermark VAE (MPW-VAE) by equipping a pretrained Variational Autoencoder (VAE) with a lightweight latent residual-based adapter, enabling the generation of paired watermarked and watermark-free images. These pairs, fused via random masks, create a diverse dataset for training a tampering-agnostic forensic network. To further enhance forensic synergy, we introduce a Mixture-of-Experts Guided Forensic Network (MoE-GFN) that dynamically integrates holistic watermark patterns, local tampering traces, and frequency-domain cues for precise watermark verification and tampered region detection. The MPW-VAE and MoE-GFN are jointly optimized in a self-supervised, end-to-end manner, fostering a reciprocal training between watermark embedding and forensic accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that StableGuard consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in image fidelity, watermark verification, and tampering localization.

  With the development of deep learning technology, virtual try-on technology has become an important application value in the fields of e-commerce, fashion, and entertainment. The recently proposed Leffa has improved the texture distortion problem of diffu-sion-based models, but there are limitations in that the bottom detection inaccuracy and the existing clothing silhouette remain in the synthesis results. To solve this problem, this study proposes CaP-VTON (Clothing agnostic Pre-inpainting Virtual Try-ON). CaP-VTON has improved the naturalness and consistency of whole-body clothing syn-thesis by integrating multi-category masking based on Dress Code and skin inpainting based on Stable Diffusion. In particular, a generate skin module was introduced to solve the skin restoration problem that occurs when long-sleeved images are converted into short-sleeved or sleeveless ones, and high-quality restoration was implemented consider-ing the human body posture and color. As a result, CaP-VTON recorded 92.5%, which is 15.4% better than Leffa in short-sleeved synthesis accuracy, and showed the performance of consistently reproducing the style and shape of reference clothing in visual evaluation. These structures maintain model-agnostic properties and are applicable to various diffu-sion-based virtual inspection systems, and can contribute to applications that require high-precision virtual wearing, such as e-commerce, custom styling, and avatar creation.

  Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful technique for text-to-image (T2I) generation, creating high-quality, diverse images across various domains. However, a common limitation in these models is the incomplete display of objects, where fragments or missing parts undermine the model's performance in downstream applications. In this study, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the incompleteness issue and reveal that the primary factor behind incomplete object generation is the usage of RandomCrop during model training. This widely used data augmentation method, though enhances model generalization ability, disrupts object continuity during training. To address this, we propose a training-free solution that penalizes activation values at image boundaries during the early denoising steps. Our method is easily applicable to pre-trained Stable Diffusion models with minimal modifications and negligible computational overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, showing substantial improvements in object integrity and image quality.

  Humans can recognize the same actions despite large context and viewpoint variations, such as differences between species (walking in spiders vs. horses), viewpoints (egocentric vs. third-person), and contexts (real life vs movies). Current deep learning models struggle with such generalization. We propose using features generated by a Vision Diffusion Model (VDM), aggregated via a transformer, to achieve human-like action recognition across these challenging conditions. We find that generalization is enhanced by the use of a model conditioned on earlier timesteps of the diffusion process to highlight semantic information over pixel level details in the extracted features. We experimentally explore the generalization properties of our approach in classifying actions across animal species, across different viewing angles, and different recording contexts. Our model sets a new state-of-the-art across all three generalization benchmarks, bringing machine action recognition closer to human-like robustness. Project page:this https URL. Code:this https URL

  Recent advancements in text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in generating high-fidelity images. However, these models often struggle to faithfully render complex user prompts, particularly in aspects like attribute binding, negation, and compositional relationships. This leads to a significant mismatch between user intent and the generated output. To address this challenge, we introduce PromptEnhancer, a novel and universal prompt rewriting framework that enhances any pretrained T2I model without requiring modifications to its weights. Unlike prior methods that rely on model-specific fine-tuning or implicit reward signals like image-reward scores, our framework decouples the rewriter from the generator. We achieve this by training a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) rewriter through reinforcement learning, guided by a dedicated reward model we term the AlignEvaluator. The AlignEvaluator is trained to provide explicit and fine-grained feedback based on a systematic taxonomy of 24 key points, which are derived from a comprehensive analysis of common T2I failure modes. By optimizing the CoT rewriter to maximize the reward from our AlignEvaluator, our framework learns to generate prompts that are more precisely interpreted by T2I models. Extensive experiments on the HunyuanImage 2.1 model demonstrate that PromptEnhancer significantly improves image-text alignment across a wide range of semantic and compositional challenges. Furthermore, we introduce a new, high-quality human preference benchmark to facilitate future research in this direction.

  Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have achieved impressive performance in text-to-image and text-to-video generation. However, their high computational cost and large parameter sizes pose significant challenges for usage in resource-constrained scenarios. Effective compression of models has become a crucial issue that urgently needs to be addressed. Post-training quantization (PTQ) is a promising solution to reduce memory usage and accelerate inference, but existing PTQ methods suffer from severe performance degradation under extreme low-bit settings. After experiments and analysis, we identify two key obstacles to low-bit PTQ for DiTs: (1) the weights of DiT models follow a Gaussian-like distribution with long tails, causing uniform quantization to poorly allocate intervals and leading to significant quantization errors. This issue has been observed in the linear layer weights of different DiT models, which deeply limits the performance. (2) two types of activation outliers in DiT models: (i) Mild Outliers with slightly elevated values, and (ii) Salient Outliers with large magnitudes concentrated in specific channels, which disrupt activation quantization. To address these issues, we propose LRQ-DiT, an efficient and accurate post-training quantization framework for image and video generation. First, we introduce Twin-Log Quantization (TLQ), a log-based method that allocates more quantization intervals to the intermediate dense regions, effectively achieving alignment with the weight distribution and reducing quantization errors. Second, we propose an Adaptive Rotation Scheme (ARS) that dynamically applies Hadamard or outlier-aware rotations based on activation fluctuation, effectively mitigating the impact of both types of outliers. Extensive experiments on various text-to-image and text-to-video DiT models demonstrate that LRQ-DiT preserves high generation quality.

  Instruction-based image editing enables precise modifications via natural language prompts, but existing methods face a precision-efficiency tradeoff: fine-tuning demands massive datasets (>10M) and computational resources, while training-free approaches suffer from weak instruction comprehension. We address this by proposing ICEdit, which leverages the inherent comprehension and generation abilities of large-scale Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) through three key innovations: (1) An in-context editing paradigm without architectural modifications; (2) Minimal parameter-efficient fine-tuning for quality improvement; (3) Early Filter Inference-Time Scaling, which uses VLMs to select high-quality noise samples for efficiency. Experiments show that ICEdit achieves state-of-the-art editing performance with only 0.1\% of the training data and 1\% trainable parameters compared to previous methods. Our approach establishes a new paradigm for balancing precision and efficiency in instructional image editing. Codes and demos can be found inthis https URL.

  Despite recent progress in diffusion models, generating realistic head portraits from novel viewpoints remains a significant challenge. Most current approaches are constrained to limited angular ranges, predominantly focusing on frontal or near-frontal views. Moreover, although the recent emerging large-scale diffusion models have been proven robust in handling 3D scenes, they underperform on facial data, given their complex structure and the uncanny valley pitfalls. In this paper, we propose SpinMeRound, a diffusion-based approach designed to generate consistent and accurate head portraits from novel viewpoints. By leveraging a number of input views alongside an identity embedding, our method effectively synthesizes diverse viewpoints of a subject whilst robustly maintaining its unique identity features. Through experimentation, we showcase our model's generation capabilities in 360 head synthesis, while beating current state-of-the-art multiview diffusion models.

  While diffusion models excel at generating high-quality images from text prompts, they struggle with visual consistency when generating image sequences. Existing methods generate each image independently, leading to disjointed narratives - a challenge further exacerbated in non-linear storytelling, where scenes must connect beyond adjacent images. We introduce a novel beam search strategy for latent space exploration, enabling conditional generation of full image sequences with beam search decoding. In contrast to earlier methods that rely on fixed latent priors, our method dynamically samples past latents to search for an optimal sequence of latent representations, ensuring coherent visual transitions. As the latent denoising space is explored, the beam search graph is pruned with a cross-attention mechanism that efficiently scores search paths, prioritizing alignment with both textual prompts and visual context. Human and automatic evaluations confirm that BeamDiffusion outperforms other baseline methods, producing full sequences with superior coherence, visual continuity, and textual alignment.

  Image anomaly detection plays a vital role in applications such as industrial quality inspection and medical imaging, where it directly contributes to improving product quality and system reliability. However, existing methods often struggle with complex and diverse anomaly patterns. In particular, the separation between generation and discrimination tasks limits the effective coordination between anomaly sample generation and anomaly region detection. To address these challenges, we propose a novel hybrid diffusion model (HDM) that integrates generation and discrimination into a unified framework. The model consists of three key modules: the Diffusion Anomaly Generation Module (DAGM), the Diffusion Discriminative Module (DDM), and the Probability Optimization Module (POM). DAGM generates realistic and diverse anomaly samples, improving their representativeness. DDM then applies a reverse diffusion process to capture the differences between generated and normal samples, enabling precise anomaly region detection and localization based on probability distributions. POM refines the probability distributions during both the generation and discrimination phases, ensuring high-quality samples are used for training. Extensive experiments on multiple industrial image datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, significantly improving both image-level and pixel-level anomaly detection performance, as measured by AUROC.

  Diffusion Transformers (DiT) are renowned for their impressive generative performance; however, they are significantly constrained by considerable computational costs due to the quadratic complexity in self-attention and the extensive sampling steps required. While advancements have been made in expediting the sampling process, the underlying architectural inefficiencies within DiT remain underexplored. We introduce SparseDiT, a novel framework that implements token sparsification across spatial and temporal dimensions to enhance computational efficiency while preserving generative quality. Spatially, SparseDiT employs a tri-segment architecture that allocates token density based on feature requirements at each layer: Poolingformer in the bottom layers for efficient global feature extraction, Sparse-Dense Token Modules (SDTM) in the middle layers to balance global context with local detail, and dense tokens in the top layers to refine high-frequency details. Temporally, SparseDiT dynamically modulates token density across denoising stages, progressively increasing token count as finer details emerge in later timesteps. This synergy between SparseDiT spatially adaptive architecture and its temporal pruning strategy enables a unified framework that balances efficiency and fidelity throughout the generation process. Our experiments demonstrate SparseDiT effectiveness, achieving a 55% reduction in FLOPs and a 175% improvement in inference speed on DiT-XL with similar FID score on 512x512 ImageNet, a 56% reduction in FLOPs across video generation datasets, and a 69% improvement in inference speed on PixArt-$\alpha$ on text-to-image generation task with a 0.24 FID score decrease. SparseDiT provides a scalable solution for high-quality diffusion-based generation compatible with sampling optimization techniques.
