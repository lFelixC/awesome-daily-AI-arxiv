- **[DreamControl: Human-Inspired Whole-Body Humanoid Control for Scene Interaction via Guided Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14353)**  `arXiv:2509.14353`  `cs.RO` `cs.AI` `cs.LG`

  We introduce DreamControl, a novel methodology for learning autonomous whole-body humanoid skills. DreamControl leverages the strengths of diffusion models and Reinforcement Learning (RL): our core innovation is the use of a diffusion prior trained on human motion data, which subsequently guides an RL policy in simulation to complete specific tasks of interest (e.g., opening a drawer or picking up an object). We demonstrate that this human motion-informed prior allows RL to discover solutions unattainable by direct RL, and that diffusion models inherently promote natural looking motions, aiding in sim-to-real transfer. We validate DreamControl's effectiveness on a Unitree G1 robot across a diverse set of challenging tasks involving simultaneous lower and upper body control and object interaction.

  Navigation by scent is a capability in robotic systems that is rising in demand. However, current methods often suffer from ambiguities, particularly when robots misattribute odours to incorrect objects due to limitations in olfactory datasets and sensor resolutions. To address challenges in olfactory navigation, we introduce a multimodal olfaction dataset along with a novel machine learning method using diffusion-based molecular generation that can be used by itself or with automated olfactory dataset construction pipelines. This generative process of our diffusion model expands the chemical space beyond the limitations of both current olfactory datasets and training methods, enabling the identification of potential odourant molecules not previously documented. The generated molecules can then be more accurately validated using advanced olfactory sensors, enabling them to detect more compounds and inform better hardware design. By integrating visual analysis, language processing, and molecular generation, our framework enhances the ability of olfaction-vision models on robots to accurately associate odours with their correct sources, thereby improving navigation and decision-making through better sensor selection for a target compound in critical applications such as explosives detection, narcotics screening, and search and rescue. Our methodology represents a foundational advancement in the field of artificial olfaction, offering a scalable solution to challenges posed by limited olfactory data and sensor ambiguities.

- **[ComposableNav: Instruction-Following Navigation in Dynamic Environments via Composable Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17941)**  `arXiv:2509.17941`  `cs.RO` `cs.AI` `cs.CV` `cs.LG`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper considers the problem of enabling robots to navigate dynamic environments while following instructions. The challenge lies in the combinatorial nature of instruction specifications: each instruction can include multiple specifications, and the number of possible specification combinations grows exponentially as the robot's skill set expands. For example, "overtake the pedestrian while staying on the right side of the road" consists of two specifications: "overtake the pedestrian" and "walk on the right side of the road." To tackle this challenge, we propose ComposableNav, based on the intuition that following an instruction involves independently satisfying its constituent specifications, each corresponding to a distinct motion primitive. Using diffusion models, ComposableNav learns each primitive separately, then composes them in parallel at deployment time to satisfy novel combinations of specifications unseen in training. Additionally, to avoid the onerous need for demonstrations of individual motion primitives, we propose a two-stage training procedure: (1) supervised pre-training to learn a base diffusion model for dynamic navigation, and (2) reinforcement learning fine-tuning that molds the base model into different motion primitives. Through simulation and real-world experiments, we show that ComposableNav enables robots to follow instructions by generating trajectories that satisfy diverse and unseen combinations of specifications, significantly outperforming both non-compositional VLM-based policies and costmap composing baselines.

- **[SocialTraj: Two-Stage Socially-Aware Trajectory Prediction for Autonomous Driving via Conditional Diffusion Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17850)**  `arXiv:2509.17850`  `cs.RO`  
  _Xiao Zhou, Zengqi Peng, Jun Ma_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Accurate trajectory prediction of surrounding vehicles (SVs) is crucial for autonomous driving systems to avoid misguided decisions and potential accidents. However, achieving reliable predictions in highly dynamic and complex traffic scenarios remains a significant challenge. One of the key impediments lies in the limited effectiveness of current approaches to capture the multi-modal behaviors of drivers, which leads to predicted trajectories that deviate from actual future motions. To address this issue, we propose SocialTraj, a novel trajectory prediction framework integrating social psychology principles through social value orientation (SVO). By utilizing Bayesian inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) to estimate the SVO of SVs, we obtain the critical social context to infer the future interaction trend. To ensure modal consistency in predicted behaviors, the estimated SVOs of SVs are embedded into a conditional denoising diffusion model that aligns generated trajectories with historical driving styles. Additionally, the planned future trajectory of the ego vehicle (EV) is explicitly incorporated to enhance interaction modeling. Extensive experiments on NGSIM and HighD datasets demonstrate that SocialTraj is capable of adapting to highly dynamic and interactive scenarios while generating socially compliant and behaviorally consistent trajectory predictions, outperforming existing baselines. Ablation studies demonstrate that dynamic SVO estimation and explicit ego-planning components notably improve prediction accuracy and substantially reduce inference time.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We propose MADP, a novel diffusion-model-based approach for collaboration in decentralized robot swarms. MADP leverages diffusion models to generate samples from complex and high-dimensional action distributions that capture the interdependencies between agents' actions. Each robot conditions policy sampling on a fused representation of its own observations and perceptual embeddings received from peers. To evaluate this approach, we task a team of holonomic robots piloted by MADP to address coverage control-a canonical multi agent navigation problem. The policy is trained via imitation learning from a clairvoyant expert on the coverage control problem, with the diffusion process parameterized by a spatial transformer architecture to enable decentralized inference. We evaluate the system under varying numbers, locations, and variances of importance density functions, capturing the robustness demands of real-world coverage tasks. Experiments demonstrate that our model inherits valuable properties from diffusion models, generalizing across agent densities and environments, and consistently outperforming state-of-the-art baselines.

- **[CoPlanner: An Interactive Motion Planner with Contingency-Aware Diffusion for Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17080)**  `arXiv:2509.17080`  `cs.RO`  
  _Ruiguo Zhong, Ruoyu Yao, Pei Liu, Xiaolong Chen, Rui Yang, Jun Ma_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Accurate trajectory prediction and motion planning are crucial for autonomous driving systems to navigate safely in complex, interactive environments characterized by multimodal uncertainties. However, current generation-then-evaluation frameworks typically construct multiple plausible trajectory hypotheses but ultimately adopt a single most likely outcome, leading to overconfident decisions and a lack of fallback strategies that are vital for safety in rare but critical scenarios. Moreover, the usual decoupling of prediction and planning modules could result in socially inconsistent or unrealistic joint trajectories, especially in highly interactive traffic. To address these challenges, we propose a contingency-aware diffusion planner (CoPlanner), a unified framework that jointly models multi-agent interactive trajectory generation and contingency-aware motion planning. Specifically, the pivot-conditioned diffusion mechanism anchors trajectory sampling on a validated, shared short-term segment to preserve temporal consistency, while stochastically generating diverse long-horizon branches that capture multimodal motion evolutions. In parallel, we design a contingency-aware multi-scenario scoring strategy that evaluates candidate ego trajectories across multiple plausible long-horizon evolution scenarios, balancing safety, progress, and comfort. This integrated design preserves feasible fallback options and enhances robustness under uncertainty, leading to more realistic interaction-aware planning. Extensive closed-loop experiments on the nuPlan benchmark demonstrate that CoPlanner consistently surpasses state-of-the-art methods on both Val14 and Test14 datasets, achieving significant improvements in safety and comfort under both reactive and non-reactive settings. Code and model will be made publicly available upon acceptance.

  _Yitian Shi, Zicheng Guo, Rosa Wolf, Edgar Welte, Rania Rayyes_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We propose Hand-Object\emph{(HO)GraspFlow}, an affordance-centric approach that retargets a single RGB with hand-object interaction (HOI) into multi-modal executable parallel jaw grasps without explicit geometric priors on target objects. Building on foundation models for hand reconstruction and vision, we synthesize $SE(3)$ grasp poses with denoising flow matching (FM), conditioned on the following three complementary cues: RGB foundation features as visual semantics, HOI contact reconstruction, and taxonomy-aware prior on grasp types. Our approach demonstrates high fidelity in grasp synthesis without explicit HOI contact input or object geometry, while maintaining strong contact and taxonomy recognition. Another controlled comparison shows that \emph{HOGraspFlow} consistently outperforms diffusion-based variants (\emph{HOGraspDiff}), achieving high distributional fidelity and more stable optimization in $SE(3)$. We demonstrate a reliable, object-agnostic grasp synthesis from human demonstrations in real-world experiments, where an average success rate of over $83\%$ is achieved.

- **[Factorizing Diffusion Policies for Observation Modality Prioritization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16830)**  `arXiv:2509.16830`  `cs.RO`  
  _Omkar Patil, Prabin Rath, Kartikay Pangaonkar, Eric Rosen, Nakul Gopalan_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Diffusion models have been extensively leveraged for learning robot skills from demonstrations. These policies are conditioned on several observational modalities such as proprioception, vision and tactile. However, observational modalities have varying levels of influence for different tasks that diffusion polices fail to capture. In this work, we propose 'Factorized Diffusion Policies' abbreviated as FDP, a novel policy formulation that enables observational modalities to have differing influence on the action diffusion process by design. This results in learning policies where certain observations modalities can be prioritized over the others such as $\texttt{vision>tactile}$ or $\texttt{proprioception>vision}$. FDP achieves modality prioritization by factorizing the observational conditioning for diffusion process, resulting in more performant and robust policies. Our factored approach shows strong performance improvements in low-data regimes with $15\%$ absolute improvement in success rate on several simulated benchmarks when compared to a standard diffusion policy that jointly conditions on all input modalities. Moreover, our benchmark and real-world experiments show that factored policies are naturally more robust with $40\%$ higher absolute success rate across several visuomotor tasks under distribution shifts such as visual distractors or camera occlusions, where existing diffusion policies fail catastrophically. FDP thus offers a safer and more robust alternative to standard diffusion policies for real-world deployment. Videos are available atthis https URL.

- **[Diffusion-Based Approximate MPC: Fast and Consistent Imitation of Multi-Modal Action Distributions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04603)**  `arXiv:2504.04603`  `cs.RO`  
  _Pau Marquez Julbe, Julian Nubert, Henrik Hose, Sebastian Trimpe, Katherine J. Kuchenbecker_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Approximating model predictive control (MPC) using imitation learning (IL) allows for fast control without solving expensive optimization problems online. However, methods that use neural networks in a simple L2-regression setup fail to approximate multi-modal (set-valued) solution distributions caused by local optima found by the numerical solver or non-convex constraints, such as obstacles, significantly limiting the applicability of approximate MPC in practice. We solve this issue by using diffusion models to accurately represent the complete solution distribution (i.e., all modes) up to kilohertz sampling rates. This work shows that diffusion-based AMPC significantly outperforms L2-regression-based approximate MPC for multi-modal action distributions. In contrast to most earlier work on IL, we also focus on running the diffusion-based controller at a higher rate and in joint space instead of end-effector space. Additionally, we propose the use of gradient guidance during the denoising process to consistently pick the same mode in closed loop to prevent switching between solutions. We propose using the cost and constraint satisfaction of the original MPC problem during parallel sampling of solutions from the diffusion model to pick a better mode online. We evaluate our method on the fast and accurate control of a 7-DoF robot manipulator both in simulation and on hardware deployed at 250 Hz, achieving a speedup of more than 70 times compared to solving the MPC problem online and also outperforming the numerical optimization (used for training) in success ratio.

- **[Dynamic Classifier-Free Diffusion Guidance via Online Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16131)**  `arXiv:2509.16131`  `cs.LG` `cs.CV`  
  _Pinelopi Papalampidi, Olivia Wiles, Ira Ktena, Aleksandar Shtedritski, Emanuele Bugliarello, Ivana Kajic, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Classifier-free guidance (CFG) is a cornerstone of text-to-image diffusion models, yet its effectiveness is limited by the use of static guidance scales. This "one-size-fits-all" approach fails to adapt to the diverse requirements of different prompts; moreover, prior solutions like gradient-based correction or fixed heuristic schedules introduce additional complexities and fail to generalize. In this work, we challeng this static paradigm by introducing a framework for dynamic CFG scheduling. Our method leverages online feedback from a suite of general-purpose and specialized small-scale latent-space evaluations, such as CLIP for alignment, a discriminator for fidelity and a human preference reward model, to assess generation quality at each step of the reverse diffusion process. Based on this feedback, we perform a greedy search to select the optimal CFG scale for each timestep, creating a unique guidance schedule tailored to every prompt and sample. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on both small-scale models and the state-of-the-art Imagen 3, showing significant improvements in text alignment, visual quality, text rendering and numerical reasoning. Notably, when compared against the default Imagen 3 baseline, our method achieves up to 53.8% human preference win-rate for overall preference, a figure that increases up to to 55.5% on prompts targeting specific capabilities like text rendering. Our work establishes that the optimal guidance schedule is inherently dynamic and prompt-dependent, and provides an efficient and generalizable framework to achieve it.

- **[Side Effects of Erasing Concepts from Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15124)**  `arXiv:2508.15124`  `cs.LG` `cs.CV`  
  _Shaswati Saha, Sourajit Saha, Manas Gaur, Tejas Gokhale_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Concerns about text-to-image (T2I) generative models infringing on privacy, copyright, and safety have led to the development of concept erasure techniques (CETs). The goal of an effective CET is to prohibit the generation of undesired "target" concepts specified by the user, while preserving the ability to synthesize high-quality images of other concepts. In this work, we demonstrate that concept erasure has side effects and CETs can be easily circumvented. For a comprehensive measurement of the robustness of CETs, we present the Side Effect Evaluation (SEE) benchmark that consists of hierarchical and compositional prompts describing objects and their attributes. The dataset and an automated evaluation pipeline quantify side effects of CETs across three aspects: impact on neighboring concepts, evasion of targets, and attribute leakage. Our experiments reveal that CETs can be circumvented by using superclass-subclass hierarchy, semantically similar prompts, and compositional variants of the target. We show that CETs suffer from attribute leakage and a counterintuitive phenomenon of attention concentration or dispersal. We release our benchmark and evaluation tools to aid future work on robust concept erasure.

- **[Spiffy: Multiplying Diffusion LLM Acceleration via Lossless Speculative Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18085)**  `arXiv:2509.18085`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI` `cs.CL`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Diffusion LLMs (dLLMs) have recently emerged as a powerful alternative to autoregressive LLMs (AR-LLMs) with the potential to operate at significantly higher token generation rates. However, currently available open-source dLLMs often generate at much lower rates, typically decoding only a single token at every denoising timestep in order to maximize output quality. We present Spiffy, a speculative decoding algorithm that accelerates dLLM inference by $\mathbf{2.8{-}3.1\times}$ while provably preserving the model's output distribution. This work addresses the unique challenges involved in applying ideas from speculative decoding of AR-LLMs to the dLLM setting. Spiffy proposes draft states by leveraging the dLLM's distribution itself in an auto-speculative manner. This approach is efficient and effective, and eliminates the overheads of training and running an independent draft model. To structure the candidate draft states, we propose a novel directed draft graph which is uniquely designed to take advantage of the bidirectional, block-wise nature of dLLM generation and can be verified in parallel by the dLLM. To further optimize the structure of these draft graphs, we introduce an efficient, offline calibration algorithm that procedurally determines high-quality graph configurations. These optimized draft graphs, enabling increased acceptance rates, lead to a significant boost in the overall speedup achieved by the system. Crucially, Spiffy is also complementary to other recent innovations in improving dLLM generation speeds such as KV-caching and multi-token unmasking. We demonstrate that when combined with such parallel decoding algorithms, Spiffy is able to effectively multiply the benefits of these methods leading to total speedups of up to $\mathbf{7.9\times}$.

- **[Modeling Edge-Specific Node Features through Co-Representation Neural Hypergraph Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14286)**  `arXiv:2405.14286`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Yijia Zheng, Marcel Worring_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Hypergraphs are widely being employed to represent complex higher-order relations in real-world applications. Most existing research on hypergraph learning focuses on node-level or edge-level tasks. A practically relevant and more challenging task, edge-dependent node classification (ENC), is still under-explored. In ENC, a node can have different labels across different hyperedges, which requires the modeling of node features unique to each hyperedge. The state-of-the-art ENC solution, WHATsNet, only outputs single node and edge representations, leading to the limitations of \textbf{entangled edge-specific features} and \textbf{non-adaptive representation sizes} when applied to ENC. Additionally, WHATsNet suffers from the common \textbf{oversmoothing issue} in most HGNNs. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{CoNHD}, a novel HGNN architecture specifically designed to model edge-specific features for ENC. Instead of learning separate representations for nodes and edges, CoNHD reformulates within-edge and within-node interactions as a hypergraph diffusion process over node-edge co-representations. We develop a neural implementation of the proposed diffusion process, leveraging equivariant networks as diffusion operators to effectively learn the diffusion dynamics from data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CoNHD achieves the best performance across all benchmark ENC datasets and several downstream tasks without sacrificing efficiency. Our implementation is available atthis https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Efficient inference is a critical challenge in deep generative modeling, particularly as diffusion models grow in capacity and complexity. While increased complexity often improves accuracy, it raises compute costs, latency, and memory requirements. This work investigates techniques such as pruning, quantization, knowledge distillation, and simplified attention to reduce computational overhead without impacting performance. The study also explores the Mixture of Experts (MoE) approach to further enhance efficiency. These experiments provide insights into optimizing inference for the state-of-the-art Fast Diffusion Transformer (fast-DiT) model.

- **[Elucidating the Design Space of FP4 training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17791)**  `arXiv:2509.17791`  `cs.LG`  
  _Robert Hu, Carlo Luschi, Paul Balanca_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The increasing computational demands of foundation models have spurred research into low-precision training, with 4-bit floating-point (\texttt{FP4}) formats emerging as a frontier for maximizing hardware throughput. While numerous techniques have been proposed to stabilize \texttt{FP4} training, they often present isolated solutions with varying, and not always clear, computational overheads. This paper aims to provide a unified view of the design space of \texttt{FP4} training. We introduce a comprehensive, quantisation gradient-based framework for microscaling quantization that allows for a theoretical analysis of the computational costs associated with different stabilization methods on both the forward and backward passes. Using a simulator built on this framework, we conduct an extensive empirical study across a wide range of machine learning tasks, including regression, image classification, diffusion models, and language models. By systematically evaluating thousands of combinations of techniques, such as novel gradient approximations, rounding strategies, and scaling methods, we identify which configurations offer the most favourable performance-to-overhead trade-off. We find that the techniques enabling the best trade-off involve carefully combining Hadamard transformations, tensor scaling and stochastic rounding. We further find that using \texttt{UE5M3} as a scaling factor potentially offers a good compromise between range and precision with manageable computational overhead.

- **[GraphWeave: Interpretable and Robust Graph Generation via Random Walk Trajectories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17291)**  `arXiv:2509.17291`  `cs.LG`  
  _Rahul Nandakumar, Deepayan Chakrabarti_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Given a set of graphs from some unknown family, we want to generate new graphs from that family. Recent methods use diffusion on either graph embeddings or the discrete space of nodes and edges. However, simple changes to embeddings (say, adding noise) can mean uninterpretable changes in the graph. In discrete-space diffusion, each step may add or remove many nodes/edges. It is hard to predict what graph patterns we will observe after many diffusion steps. Our proposed method, called GraphWeave, takes a different approach. We separate pattern generation and graph construction. To find patterns in the training graphs, we see how they transform vectors during random walks. We then generate new graphs in two steps. First, we generate realistic random walk "trajectories" which match the learned patterns. Then, we find the optimal graph that fits these trajectories. The optimization infers all edges jointly, which improves robustness to errors. On four simulated and five real-world benchmark datasets, GraphWeave outperforms existing methods. The most significant differences are on large-scale graph structures such as PageRank, cuts, communities, degree distributions, and flows. GraphWeave is also 10x faster than its closest competitor. Finally, GraphWeave is simple, needing only a transformer and standard optimizers.

- **[A Closer Look at Model Collapse: From a Generalization-to-Memorization Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16499)**  `arXiv:2509.16499`  `cs.LG`  
  _Lianghe Shi, Meng Wu, Huijie Zhang, Zekai Zhang, Molei Tao, Qing Qu_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The widespread use of diffusion models has led to an abundance of AI-generated data, raising concerns about model collapse -- a phenomenon in which recursive iterations of training on synthetic data lead to performance degradation. Prior work primarily characterizes this collapse via variance shrinkage or distribution shift, but these perspectives miss practical manifestations of model collapse. This paper identifies a transition from generalization to memorization during model collapse in diffusion models, where models increasingly replicate training data instead of generating novel content during iterative training on synthetic samples. This transition is directly driven by the declining entropy of the synthetic training data produced in each training cycle, which serves as a clear indicator of model degradation. Motivated by this insight, we propose an entropy-based data selection strategy to mitigate the transition from generalization to memorization and alleviate model collapse. Empirical results show that our approach significantly enhances visual quality and diversity in recursive generation, effectively preventing collapse.

- **[Local Mechanisms of Compositional Generalization in Conditional Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16447)**  `arXiv:2509.16447`  `cs.LG`  
  _Arwen Bradley_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Conditional diffusion models appear capable of compositional generalization, i.e., generating convincing samples for out-of-distribution combinations of conditioners, but the mechanisms underlying this ability remain unclear. To make this concrete, we study length generalization, the ability to generate images with more objects than seen during training. In a controlled CLEVR setting (Johnson et al., 2017), we find that length generalization is achievable in some cases but not others, suggesting that models only sometimes learn the underlying compositional structure. We then investigate locality as a structural mechanism for compositional generalization. Prior works proposed score locality as a mechanism for creativity in unconditional diffusion models (Kamb & Ganguli, 2024; Niedoba et al., 2024), but did not address flexible conditioning or compositional generalization. In this paper, we prove an exact equivalence between a specific compositional structure ("conditional projective composition") (Bradley et al., 2025) and scores with sparse dependencies on both pixels and conditioners ("local conditional scores"). This theory also extends to feature-space compositionality. We validate our theory empirically: CLEVR models that succeed at length generalization exhibit local conditional scores, while those that fail do not. Furthermore, we show that a causal intervention explicitly enforcing local conditional scores restores length generalization in a previously failing model. Finally, we investigate feature-space compositionality in color-conditioned CLEVR, and find preliminary evidence of compositional structure in SDXL.

- **[Guided Sequence-Structure Generative Modeling for Iterative Antibody Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16357)**  `arXiv:2509.16357`  `cs.LG`  
  _Aniruddh Raghu, Sebastian Ober, Maxwell Kazman, Hunter Elliott_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Therapeutic antibody candidates often require extensive engineering to improve key functional and developability properties before clinical development. This can be achieved through iterative design, where starting molecules are optimized over several rounds of in vitro experiments. While protein structure can provide a strong inductive bias, it is rarely used in iterative design due to the lack of structural data for continually evolving lead molecules over the course of optimization. In this work, we propose a strategy for iterative antibody optimization that leverages both sequence and structure as well as accumulating lab measurements of binding and developability. Building on prior work, we first train a sequence-structure diffusion generative model that operates on antibody-antigen complexes. We then outline an approach to use this model, together with carefully predicted antibody-antigen complexes, to optimize lead candidates throughout the iterative design process. Further, we describe a guided sampling approach that biases generation toward desirable properties by integrating models trained on experimental data from iterative design. We evaluate our approach in multiple in silico and in vitro experiments, demonstrating that it produces high-affinity binders at multiple stages of an active antibody optimization campaign.

- **[Efficient Neural SDE Training using Wiener-Space Cubature](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12395)**  `arXiv:2502.12395`  `cs.LG`  
  _Luke Snow, Vikram Krishnamurthy_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  A neural stochastic differential equation (SDE) is an SDE with drift and diffusion terms parametrized by neural networks. The training procedure for neural SDEs consists of optimizing the SDE vector field (neural network) parameters to minimize the expected value of an objective functional on infinite-dimensional path-space. Existing training techniques focus on methods to efficiently compute path-wise gradients of the objective functional with respect to these parameters, then pair this with Monte-Carlo simulation to estimate the gradient expectation. In this work we introduce a novel training technique which bypasses and improves upon this Monte-Carlo simulation; we extend results in the theory of Wiener space cubature to approximate the expected objective functional value by a weighted sum of functional evaluations of deterministic ODE solutions. Our main mathematical contribution enabling this approximation is an extension of cubature bounds to the setting of Lipschitz-nonlinear functionals acting on path-space. Our resulting constructive algorithm allows for more computationally efficient training along several lines. First, it circumvents Brownian motion simulation and enables the use of efficient parallel ODE solvers, thus decreasing the complexity of path-functional evaluation. Furthermore, and more surprisingly, we show that the number of paths required to achieve a given (expected loss functional oracle value) approximation can be reduced in this deterministic cubature regime. Specifically, we show that under reasonable regularity assumptions we can observe a O(1/n) convergence rate, where n is the number of path evaluations; in contrast with the standard O(1/sqrt(n)) rate of naive Monte-Carlo or the O(log(n)^d /n) rate of quasi-Monte-Carlo.

  This paper evaluates DINOv3, a recent large-scale self-supervised vision backbone, for visuomotor diffusion policy learning in robotic manipulation. We investigate whether a purely self-supervised encoder can match or surpass conventional supervised ImageNet-pretrained backbones (e.g., ResNet-18) under three regimes: training from scratch, frozen, and finetuned. Across four benchmark tasks (Push-T, Lift, Can, Square) using a unified FiLM-conditioned diffusion policy, we find that (i) finetuned DINOv3 matches or exceeds ResNet-18 on several tasks, (ii) frozen DINOv3 remains competitive, indicating strong transferable priors, and (iii) self-supervised features improve sample efficiency and robustness. These results support self-supervised large visual models as effective, generalizable perceptual front-ends for action diffusion policies, motivating further exploration of scalable label-free pretraining in robotic manipulation. Compared to using ResNet18 as a backbone, our approach with DINOv3 achieves up to a 10% absolute increase in test-time success rates on challenging tasks such as Can, and on-the-par performance in tasks like Lift, PushT, and Square.

  Amodal completion, generating invisible parts of occluded objects, is vital for applications like image editing and AR. Prior methods face challenges with data needs, generalization, or error accumulation in progressive pipelines. We propose a Collaborative Multi-Agent Reasoning Framework based on upfront collaborative reasoning to overcome these issues. Our framework uses multiple agents to collaboratively analyze occlusion relationships and determine necessary boundary expansion, yielding a precise mask for inpainting. Concurrently, an agent generates fine-grained textual descriptions, enabling Fine-Grained Semantic Guidance. This ensures accurate object synthesis and prevents the regeneration of occluders or other unwanted elements, especially within large inpainting areas. Furthermore, our method directly produces layered RGBA outputs guided by visible masks and attention maps from a Diffusion Transformer, eliminating extra segmentation. Extensive evaluations demonstrate our framework achieves state-of-the-art visual quality.

  Automated pain assessment from facial expressions is crucial for non-communicative patients, such as those with dementia. Progress has been limited by two challenges: (i) existing datasets exhibit severe demographic and label imbalance due to ethical constraints, and (ii) current generative models cannot precisely control facial action units (AUs), facial structure, or clinically validated pain levels.We present 3DPain, a large-scale synthetic dataset specifically designed for automated pain assessment, featuring unprecedented annotation richness and demographic diversity. Our three-stage framework generates diverse 3D meshes, textures them with diffusion models, and applies AU-driven face rigging to synthesize multi-view faces with paired neutral and pain images, AU configurations, PSPI scores, and the first dataset-level annotations of pain-region heatmaps. The dataset comprises 82,500 samples across 25,000 pain expression heatmaps and 2,500 synthetic identities balanced by age, gender, and ethnicity.We further introduce ViTPain, a Vision Transformer based cross-modal distillation framework in which a heatmap-trained teacher guides a student trained on RGB images, enhancing accuracy, interpretability, and clinical reliability. Together, 3DPain and ViTPain establish a controllable, diverse, and clinically grounded foundation for generalizable automated pain assessment.

  Deep generative models have emerged as a transformative tool in medical imaging, offering substantial potential for synthetic data generation. However, recent empirical studies highlight a critical vulnerability: these models can memorize sensitive training data, posing significant risks of unauthorized patient information disclosure. Detecting memorization in generative models remains particularly challenging, necessitating scalable methods capable of identifying training data leakage across large sets of generated samples. In this work, we propose DeepSSIM, a novel self-supervised metric for quantifying memorization in generative models. DeepSSIM is trained to: i) project images into a learned embedding space and ii) force the cosine similarity between embeddings to match the ground-truth SSIM (Structural Similarity Index) scores computed in the image space. To capture domain-specific anatomical features, training incorporates structure-preserving augmentations, allowing DeepSSIM to estimate similarity reliably without requiring precise spatial alignment. We evaluate DeepSSIM in a case study involving synthetic brain MRI data generated by a Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) trained under memorization-prone conditions, using 2,195 MRI scans from two publicly available datasets (IXI and CoRR). Compared to state-of-the-art memorization metrics, DeepSSIM achieves superior performance, improving F1 scores by an average of +52.03% over the best existing method.

  Recent advances in diffusion models have revolutionized video generation, offering superior temporal consistency and visual quality compared to traditional generative adversarial networks-based approaches. While this emerging field shows tremendous promise in applications, it faces significant challenges in motion consistency, computational efficiency, and ethical considerations. This survey provides a comprehensive review of diffusion-based video generation, examining its evolution, technical foundations, and practical applications. We present a systematic taxonomy of current methodologies, analyze architectural innovations and optimization strategies, and investigate applications across low-level vision tasks such as denoising and super-resolution. Additionally, we explore the synergies between diffusionbased video generation and related domains, including video representation learning, question answering, and retrieval. Compared to the existing surveys (Lei et al., 2024a;b; Melnik et al., 2024; Cao et al., 2023; Xing et al., 2024c) which focus on specific aspects of video generation, such as human video synthesis (Lei et al., 2024a) or long-form content generation (Lei et al., 2024b), our work provides a broader, more updated, and more fine-grained perspective on diffusion-based approaches with a special section for evaluation metrics, industry solutions, and training engineering techniques in video generation. This survey serves as a foundational resource for researchers and practitioners working at the intersection of diffusion models and video generation, providing insights into both the theoretical frameworks and practical implementations that drive this rapidly evolving field.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Generating realistic 3D point clouds is a fundamental problem in computer vision with applications in remote sensing, robotics, and digital object modeling. Existing generative approaches primarily capture geometry, and when semantics are considered, they are typically imposed post hoc through external segmentation or clustering rather than integrated into the generative process itself. We propose a diffusion-based framework that embeds per-point semantic conditioning directly within generation. Each point is associated with a conditional variable corresponding to its semantic label, which guides the diffusion dynamics and enables the joint synthesis of geometry and semantics. This design produces point clouds that are both structurally coherent and segmentation-aware, with object parts explicitly represented during synthesis. Through a comparative analysis of guided and unguided diffusion processes, we demonstrate the significant impact of conditional variables on diffusion dynamics and generation quality. Extensive experiments validate the efficacy of our approach, producing detailed and accurate 3D point clouds tailored to specific parts and features.

  Accurate segmentation of medical images is challenging due to unclear lesion boundaries and mask variability. We introduce \emph{Segmentation Sch√∂dinger Bridge (SSB)}, the first application of Sch√∂dinger Bridge for ambiguous medical image segmentation, modelling joint image-mask dynamics to enhance performance. SSB preserves structural integrity, delineates unclear boundaries without additional guidance, and maintains diversity using a novel loss function. We further propose the \emph{Diversity Divergence Index} ($D_{DDI}$) to quantify inter-rater variability, capturing both diversity and consensus. SSB achieves state-of-the-art performance on LIDC-IDRI, COCA, and RACER (in-house) datasets.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Adverse Weather Image Restoration (AWIR) is a highly challenging task due to the unpredictable and dynamic nature of weather-related degradations. Traditional task-specific methods often fail to generalize to unseen or complex degradation types, while recent prompt-learning approaches depend heavily on the degradation estimation capabilities of vision-language models, resulting in inconsistent restorations. In this paper, we propose \textbf{LCDiff}, a novel framework comprising two key components: \textit{Lumina-Chroma Decomposition Network} (LCDN) and \textit{Lumina-Guided Diffusion Model} (LGDM). LCDN processes degraded images in the YCbCr color space, separately handling degradation-related luminance and degradation-invariant chrominance components. This decomposition effectively mitigates weather-induced degradation while preserving color fidelity. To further enhance restoration quality, LGDM leverages degradation-related luminance information as a guiding condition, eliminating the need for explicit degradation prompts. Additionally, LGDM incorporates a \textit{Dynamic Time Step Loss} to optimize the denoising network, ensuring a balanced recovery of both low- and high-frequency features in the image. Finally, we present DriveWeather, a comprehensive all-weather driving dataset designed to enable robust evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods, setting a new benchmark in AWIR. The dataset and code are available at:this https URL.

  Multi-step or hybrid deepfakes, created by sequentially applying different deepfake creation methods such as Face-Swapping, GAN-based generation, and Diffusion methods, can pose an emerging and unforseen technical challenge for detection models trained on single-step forgeries. While prior studies have mainly focused on detecting isolated single manipulation, little is known about the detection model behavior under such compositional, hybrid, and complex manipulation pipelines. In this work, we introduce \textbf{FakeChain}, a large-scale benchmark comprising 1-, 2-, and 3-Step forgeries synthesized using five state-of-the-art representative generators. Using this approach, we analyze detection performance and spectral properties across hybrid manipulation at different step, along with varying generator combinations and quality settings. Surprisingly, our findings reveal that detection performance highly depends on the final manipulation type, with F1-score dropping by up to \textbf{58.83\%} when it differs from training distribution. This clearly demonstrates that detectors rely on last-stage artifacts rather than cumulative manipulation traces, limiting generalization. Such findings highlight the need for detection models to explicitly consider manipulation history and sequences. Our results highlight the importance of benchmarks such as FakeChain, reflecting growing synthesis complexity and diversity in real-world scenarios.

  Recent black-box counterfactual generation frameworks fail to take into account the semantic content of the proposed edits, while relying heavily on training to guide the generation process. We propose a novel, plug-and-play black-box counterfactual generation framework, which suggests step-by-step edits based on theoretical guarantees of optimal edits to produce human-level counterfactual explanations with zero training. Our framework utilizes a pre-trained image editing diffusion model, and operates without access to the internals of the classifier, leading to an explainable counterfactual generation process. Throughout our experimentation, we showcase the explanatory gap between human reasoning and neural model behavior by utilizing both Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Vision Transformer (ViT) and Large Vision Language Model (LVLM) classifiers, substantiated through a comprehensive human evaluation.

  The 3D structure of living and non-living components in ecosystems plays a critical role in determining ecological processes and feedbacks from both natural and human-driven disturbances. Anticipating the effects of wildfire, drought, disease, or atmospheric deposition depends on accurate characterization of 3D vegetation structure, yet widespread measurement remains prohibitively expensive and often infeasible. We introduce ForestGen3D, a novel generative modeling framework that synthesizes high-fidelity 3D forest structure using only aerial LiDAR (ALS) inputs. ForestGen3D is based on conditional denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) trained on co-registered ALS/TLS (terrestrial LiDAR) data. The model learns to generate TLS-like 3D point clouds conditioned on sparse ALS observations, effectively reconstructing occluded sub-canopy detail at scale. To ensure ecological plausibility, we introduce a geometric containment prior based on the convex hull of ALS observations and provide theoretical and empirical guarantees that generated structures remain spatially consistent. We evaluate ForestGen3D at tree, plot, and landscape scales using real-world data from mixed conifer ecosystems, and show that it produces high-fidelity reconstructions that closely match TLS references in terms of geometric similarity and biophysical metrics, such as tree height, DBH, crown diameter and crown volume. Additionally, we demonstrate that the containment property can serve as a practical proxy for generation quality in settings where TLS ground truth is unavailable. Our results position ForestGen3D as a scalable tool for ecological modeling, wildfire simulation, and structural fuel characterization in ALS-only environments.

  Garment sewing patterns are fundamental design elements that bridge the gap between design concepts and practical manufacturing. The generative modeling of sewing patterns is crucial for creating diversified garments. However, existing approaches are limited either by reliance on a single input modality or by suboptimal generation efficiency. In this work, we present GarmentDiffusion, a new generative model capable of producing centimeter-precise, vectorized 3D sewing patterns from multimodal inputs (text, image, and incomplete sewing pattern). Our method efficiently encodes 3D sewing pattern parameters into compact edge token representations, achieving a sequence length that is 10 times shorter than that of the autoregressive SewingGPT in DressCode. By employing a diffusion transformer, we simultaneously denoise all edge tokens along the temporal axis, while maintaining a constant number of denoising steps regardless of dataset-specific edge and panel statistics. With all combination of designs of our model, the sewing pattern generation speed is accelerated by 100 times compared to SewingGPT. We achieve new state-of-the-art results on DressCodeData, as well as on the largest sewing pattern dataset, namely GarmentCodeData. The project website is available atthis https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Text-to-image diffusion models excel at translating language prompts into photorealistic images by implicitly grounding textual concepts through their cross-modal attention mechanisms. Recent multi-modal diffusion transformers extend this by introducing joint self-attention over concatenated image and text tokens, enabling richer and more scalable cross-modal alignment. However, a detailed understanding of how and where these attention maps contribute to image generation remains limited. In this paper, we introduce Seg4Diff (Segmentation for Diffusion), a systematic framework for analyzing the attention structures of MM-DiT, with a focus on how specific layers propagate semantic information from text to image. Through comprehensive analysis, we identify a semantic grounding expert layer, a specific MM-DiT block that consistently aligns text tokens with spatially coherent image regions, naturally producing high-quality semantic segmentation masks. We further demonstrate that applying a lightweight fine-tuning scheme with mask-annotated image data enhances the semantic grouping capabilities of these layers and thereby improves both segmentation performance and generated image fidelity. Our findings demonstrate that semantic grouping is an emergent property of diffusion transformers and can be selectively amplified to advance both segmentation and generation performance, paving the way for unified models that bridge visual perception and generation.

  Generating high-fidelity images of humans with fine-grained control over attributes such as hairstyle and clothing remains a core challenge in personalized text-to-image synthesis. While prior methods emphasize identity preservation from a reference image, they lack modularity and fail to provide disentangled control over specific visual attributes. We introduce a new paradigm for attribute-specific image prompting, in which distinct sets of reference images are used to guide the generation of individual aspects of human appearance, such as hair, clothing, and identity. Our method encodes these inputs into attribute-specific tokens, which are injected into a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model. This enables compositional and disentangled control over multiple visual factors, even across multiple people within a single image. To promote natural composition and robust disentanglement, we curate a cross-reference training dataset featuring subjects in diverse poses and expressions, and propose a multi-attribute cross-reference training strategy that encourages the model to generate faithful outputs from misaligned attribute inputs while adhering to both identity and textual conditioning. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in accurately following both visual and textual prompts. Our framework paves the way for more configurable human image synthesis by combining visual prompting with text-driven generation. Webpage is available at:this https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The advancement of diffusion models has enhanced the realism of AI-generated content but also raised concerns about misuse, necessitating robust copyright protection and tampering localization. Although recent methods have made progress toward unified solutions, their reliance on post hoc processing introduces considerable application inconvenience and compromises forensic reliability. We propose StableGuard, a novel framework that seamlessly integrates a binary watermark into the diffusion generation process, ensuring copyright protection and tampering localization in Latent Diffusion Models through an end-to-end design. We develop a Multiplexing Watermark VAE (MPW-VAE) by equipping a pretrained Variational Autoencoder (VAE) with a lightweight latent residual-based adapter, enabling the generation of paired watermarked and watermark-free images. These pairs, fused via random masks, create a diverse dataset for training a tampering-agnostic forensic network. To further enhance forensic synergy, we introduce a Mixture-of-Experts Guided Forensic Network (MoE-GFN) that dynamically integrates holistic watermark patterns, local tampering traces, and frequency-domain cues for precise watermark verification and tampered region detection. The MPW-VAE and MoE-GFN are jointly optimized in a self-supervised, end-to-end manner, fostering a reciprocal training between watermark embedding and forensic accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that StableGuard consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in image fidelity, watermark verification, and tampering localization.

  Synthetic data generation in histopathology faces unique challenges: preserving tissue heterogeneity, capturing subtle morphological features, and scaling to unannotated datasets. We present a latent diffusion model that generates realistic heterogeneous histopathology images through a novel dual-conditioning approach combining semantic segmentation maps with tissue-specific visual crops. Unlike existing methods that rely on text prompts or abstract visual embeddings, our approach preserves critical morphological details by directly incorporating raw tissue crops from corresponding semantic regions. For annotated datasets (i.e., Camelyon16, Panda), we extract patches ensuring 20-80% tissue heterogeneity. For unannotated data (i.e., TCGA), we introduce a self-supervised extension that clusters whole-slide images into 100 tissue types using foundation model embeddings, automatically generating pseudo-semantic maps for training. Our method synthesizes high-fidelity images with precise region-wise annotations, achieving superior performance on downstream segmentation tasks. When evaluated on annotated datasets, models trained on our synthetic data show competitive performance to those trained on real data, demonstrating the utility of controlled heterogeneous tissue generation. In quantitative evaluation, prompt-guided synthesis reduces Frechet Distance by up to 6X on Camelyon16 (from 430.1 to 72.0) and yields 2-3x lower FD across Panda and TCGA. Downstream DeepLabv3+ models trained solely on synthetic data attain test IoU of 0.71 and 0.95 on Camelyon16 and Panda, within 1-2% of real-data baselines (0.72 and 0.96). By scaling to 11,765 TCGA whole-slide images without manual annotations, our framework offers a practical solution for an urgent need for generating diverse, annotated histopathology data, addressing a critical bottleneck in computational pathology.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Training-free video object editing aims to achieve precise object-level manipulation, including object insertion, swapping, and deletion. However, it faces significant challenges in maintaining fidelity and temporal consistency. Existing methods, often designed for U-Net architectures, suffer from two primary limitations: inaccurate inversion due to first-order solvers, and contextual conflicts caused by crude "hard" feature replacement. These issues are more challenging in Diffusion Transformers (DiTs), where the unsuitability of prior layer-selection heuristics makes effective guidance challenging. To address these limitations, we introduce ContextFlow, a novel training-free framework for DiT-based video object editing. In detail, we first employ a high-order Rectified Flow solver to establish a robust editing foundation. The core of our framework is Adaptive Context Enrichment (for specifying what to edit), a mechanism that addresses contextual conflicts. Instead of replacing features, it enriches the self-attention context by concatenating Key-Value pairs from parallel reconstruction and editing paths, empowering the model to dynamically fuse information. Additionally, to determine where to apply this enrichment (for specifying where to edit), we propose a systematic, data-driven analysis to identify task-specific vital layers. Based on a novel Guidance Responsiveness Metric, our method pinpoints the most influential DiT blocks for different tasks (e.g., insertion, swapping), enabling targeted and highly effective guidance. Extensive experiments show that ContextFlow significantly outperforms existing training-free methods and even surpasses several state-of-the-art training-based approaches, delivering temporally coherent, high-fidelity results.

  The rapid progress of image-guided video generation (I2V) has raised concerns about its potential misuse in misinformation and fraud, underscoring the urgent need for effective digital watermarking. While existing watermarking methods demonstrate robustness within a single modality, they fail to trace source images in I2V settings. To address this gap, we introduce the concept of Robust Diffusion Distance, which measures the temporal persistence of watermark signals in generated videos. Building on this, we propose I2VWM, a cross-modal watermarking framework designed to enhance watermark robustness across time. I2VWM leverages a video-simulation noise layer during training and employs an optical-flow-based alignment module during inference. Experiments on both open-source and commercial I2V models demonstrate that I2VWM significantly improves robustness while maintaining imperceptibility, establishing a new paradigm for cross-modal watermarking in the era of generative video. \href{this https URL}{Code Released.}

  With the development of deep learning technology, virtual try-on technology has become an important application value in the fields of e-commerce, fashion, and entertainment. The recently proposed Leffa has improved the texture distortion problem of diffu-sion-based models, but there are limitations in that the bottom detection inaccuracy and the existing clothing silhouette remain in the synthesis results. To solve this problem, this study proposes CaP-VTON (Clothing agnostic Pre-inpainting Virtual Try-ON). CaP-VTON has improved the naturalness and consistency of whole-body clothing syn-thesis by integrating multi-category masking based on Dress Code and skin inpainting based on Stable Diffusion. In particular, a generate skin module was introduced to solve the skin restoration problem that occurs when long-sleeved images are converted into short-sleeved or sleeveless ones, and high-quality restoration was implemented consider-ing the human body posture and color. As a result, CaP-VTON recorded 92.5\%, which is 15.4\% better than Leffa in short-sleeved synthesis accuracy, and showed the performance of consistently reproducing the style and shape of reference clothing in visual evaluation. These structures maintain model-agnostic properties and are applicable to various diffu-sion-based virtual inspection systems, and can contribute to applications that require high-precision virtual wearing, such as e-commerce, custom styling, and avatar creation.

  Diffusion Models have become very popular for Semantic Image Synthesis (SIS) of human faces. Nevertheless, their training and inference is computationally expensive and their computational requirements are high due to the quadratic complexity of attention layers. In this paper, we propose a novel architecture called SISMA, based on the recently proposed Mamba. SISMA generates high quality samples by controlling their shape using a semantic mask at a reduced computational demand. We validated our approach through comprehensive experiments with CelebAMask-HQ, revealing that our architecture not only achieves a better FID score yet also operates at three times the speed of state-of-the-art architectures. This indicates that the proposed design is a viable, lightweight substitute to transformer-based models.

  Recent advances in video insertion based on diffusion models are impressive. However, existing methods rely on complex control signals but struggle with subject consistency, limiting their practical applicability. In this paper, we focus on the task of Mask-free Video Insertion and aim to resolve three key challenges: data scarcity, subject-scene equilibrium, and insertion harmonization. To address the data scarcity, we propose a new data pipeline InsertPipe, constructing diverse cross-pair data automatically. Building upon our data pipeline, we develop OmniInsert, a novel unified framework for mask-free video insertion from both single and multiple subject references. Specifically, to maintain subject-scene equilibrium, we introduce a simple yet effective Condition-Specific Feature Injection mechanism to distinctly inject multi-source conditions and propose a novel Progressive Training strategy that enables the model to balance feature injection from subjects and source video. Meanwhile, we design the Subject-Focused Loss to improve the detailed appearance of the subjects. To further enhance insertion harmonization, we propose an Insertive Preference Optimization methodology to optimize the model by simulating human preferences, and incorporate a Context-Aware Rephraser module during reference to seamlessly integrate the subject into the original scenes. To address the lack of a benchmark for the field, we introduce InsertBench, a comprehensive benchmark comprising diverse scenes with meticulously selected subjects. Evaluation on InsertBench indicates OmniInsert outperforms state-of-the-art closed-source commercial solutions. The code will be released.

  Portrait animation aims to generate photo-realistic videos from a single source image by reenacting the expression and pose from a driving video. While early methods relied on 3D morphable models or feature warping techniques, they often suffered from limited expressivity, temporal inconsistency, and poor generalization to unseen identities or large pose variations. Recent advances using diffusion models have demonstrated improved quality but remain constrained by weak control signals and architectural limitations. In this work, we propose a novel diffusion based framework that leverages masked facial regions specifically the eyes, nose, and mouth from the driving video as strong motion control cues. To enable robust training without appearance leakage, we adopt cross identity supervision. To leverage the strong prior from the pretrained diffusion model, our novel architecture introduces minimal new parameters that converge faster and help in better generalization. We introduce spatial temporal attention mechanisms that allow inter frame and intra frame interactions, effectively capturing subtle motions and reducing temporal artifacts. Our model uses history frames to ensure continuity across segments. At inference, we propose a novel signal fusion strategy that balances motion fidelity with identity preservation. Our approach achieves superior temporal consistency and accurate expression control, enabling high-quality, controllable portrait animation suitable for real-world applications.

  Text-to-image diffusion models, such as Stable Diffusion, can produce high-quality and diverse images but often fail to achieve compositional alignment, particularly when prompts describe complex object relationships, attributes, or spatial arrangements. Recent inference-time approaches address this by optimizing or exploring the initial noise under the guidance of reward functions that score text-image alignment without requiring model fine-tuning. While promising, each strategy has intrinsic limitations when used alone: optimization can stall due to poor initialization or unfavorable search trajectories, whereas exploration may require a prohibitively large number of samples to locate a satisfactory output. Our analysis further shows that neither single reward metrics nor ad-hoc combinations reliably capture all aspects of compositionality, leading to weak or inconsistent guidance. To overcome these challenges, we present Category-Aware Reward-based Initial Noise Optimization and Exploration (CARINOX), a unified framework that combines noise optimization and exploration with a principled reward selection procedure grounded in correlation with human judgments. Evaluations on two complementary benchmarks covering diverse compositional challenges show that CARINOX raises average alignment scores by +16% on T2I-CompBench++ and +11% on the HRS benchmark, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art optimization and exploration-based methods across all major categories, while preserving image quality and diversity.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We propose a single-snapshot depth-from-defocus (DFD) reconstruction method for coded-aperture imaging that replaces hand-crafted priors with a learned diffusion prior used purely as regularization. Our optimization framework enforces measurement consistency via a differentiable forward model while guiding solutions with the diffusion prior in the denoised image domain, yielding higher accuracy and stability than clas- sical optimization. Unlike U-Net-style regressors, our approach requires no paired defocus-RGBD training data and does not tie training to a specific camera configuration. Experiments on comprehensive simulations and a prototype camera demonstrate consistently strong RGBD reconstructions across noise levels, outperforming both U-Net baselines and a classical coded- aperture DFD method.

  _Bo Liu, Runlong Li, Li Zhou, Yan Zhou_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper proposes a Diffusion Model-Optimized Neural Radiance Field (DT-NeRF) method, aimed at enhancing detail recovery and multi-view consistency in 3D scene reconstruction. By combining diffusion models with Transformers, DT-NeRF effectively restores details under sparse viewpoints and maintains high accuracy in complex geometric scenes. Experimental results demonstrate that DT-NeRF significantly outperforms traditional NeRF and other state-of-the-art methods on the Matterport3D and ShapeNet datasets, particularly in metrics such as PSNR, SSIM, Chamfer Distance, and Fidelity. Ablation experiments further confirm the critical role of the diffusion and Transformer modules in the model's performance, with the removal of either module leading to a decline in performance. The design of DT-NeRF showcases the synergistic effect between modules, providing an efficient and accurate solution for 3D scene reconstruction. Future research may focus on further optimizing the model, exploring more advanced generative models and network architectures to enhance its performance in large-scale dynamic scenes.

  _Djamel Eddine Boukhari_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The automated prediction of facial beauty is a benchmark task in affective computing that requires a sophisticated understanding of both local aesthetic details (e.g., skin texture) and global facial harmony (e.g., symmetry, proportions). Existing models, based on either Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) or Vision Transformers (ViTs), exhibit inherent architectural biases that limit their performance; CNNs excel at local feature extraction but struggle with long-range dependencies, while ViTs model global relationships at a significant computational cost. This paper introduces the \textbf{Mamba-Diffusion Network (MD-Net)}, a novel dual-stream architecture that resolves this trade-off by delegating specialized roles to state-of-the-art models. The first stream leverages a frozen U-Net encoder from a pre-trained latent diffusion model, providing a powerful generative prior for fine-grained aesthetic qualities. The second stream employs a Vision Mamba (Vim), a modern state-space model, to efficiently capture global facial structure with linear-time complexity. By synergistically integrating these complementary representations through a cross-attention mechanism, MD-Net creates a holistic and nuanced feature space for prediction. Evaluated on the SCUT-FBP5500 benchmark, MD-Net sets a new state-of-the-art, achieving a Pearson Correlation of \textbf{0.9235} and demonstrating the significant potential of hybrid architectures that fuse generative and sequential modeling paradigms for complex visual assessment tasks.

  Recent text-to-image diffusion models can generate striking visuals from text prompts, but they often fail to maintain subject consistency across generations and contexts. One major limitation of current fine-tuning approaches is the inherent trade-off between quality and efficiency. Fine-tuning large models improves fidelity but is computationally expensive, while fine-tuning lightweight models improves efficiency but compromises image fidelity. Moreover, fine-tuning pre-trained models on a small set of images of the subject can damage the existing priors, resulting in suboptimal results. To this end, we present Stencil, a novel framework that jointly employs two diffusion models during inference. Stencil efficiently fine-tunes a lightweight model on images of the subject, while a large frozen pre-trained model provides contextual guidance during inference, injecting rich priors to enhance generation with minimal overhead. Stencil excels at generating high-fidelity, novel renditions of the subject in less than a minute, delivering state-of-the-art performance and setting a new benchmark in subject-driven generation.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Despite their generative power, diffusion models struggle to maintain style consistency across images conditioned on the same style prompt, hindering their practical deployment in creative workflows. While several training-free methods attempt to solve this, they are constrained to the U-Net architecture, which not only leads to low-quality results and artifacts like object repetition but also renders them incompatible with superior Diffusion Transformer (DiT). To address these issues, we introduce AlignedGen, a novel training-free framework that enhances style consistency across images generated by DiT models. Our work first reveals a critical insight: naive attention sharing fails in DiT due to conflicting positional signals from improper position embeddings. We introduce Shifted Position Embedding (ShiftPE), an effective solution that resolves this conflict by allocating a non-overlapping set of positional indices to each image. Building on this foundation, we develop Advanced Attention Sharing (AAS), a suite of three techniques meticulously designed to fully unleash the potential of attention sharing within the DiT. Furthermore, to broaden the applicability of our method, we present an efficient query, key, and value feature extraction algorithm, enabling our method to seamlessly incorporate external images as style references. Extensive experimental results validate that our method effectively enhances style consistency across generated images while maintaining precise text-to-image alignment.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Nonlinear manifolds are widespread in deep visual features, where Euclidean distances often fail to capture true similarity. This limitation becomes particularly severe in prototype-based interpretable fine-grained recognition, where subtle semantic distinctions are essential. To address this challenge, we propose a novel paradigm for prototype-based recognition that anchors similarity within the intrinsic geometry of deep features. Specifically, we distill the latent manifold structure of each class into a diffusion space and introduce a differentiable Nystr√∂m interpolation, making the geometry accessible to both unseen samples and learnable prototypes. To ensure efficiency, we employ compact per-class landmark sets with periodic updates. This design keeps the embedding aligned with the evolving backbone, enabling fast and scalable inference. Extensive experiments on the CUB-200-2011 and Stanford Cars datasets show that our GeoProto framework produces prototypes focusing on semantically aligned parts, significantly outperforming Euclidean prototype networks.

  Recently, autoregressive image generation models have wowed audiences with their remarkable capability in creating surprisingly realistic images. Models such as GPT-4o and LlamaGen can not only produce images that faithfully mimic renowned artistic styles like Ghibli, Van Gogh, or Picasso, but also potentially generate Not-Safe-For-Work (NSFW) content, raising significant concerns regarding copyright infringement and ethical use. Despite these concerns, methods to safeguard autoregressive text-to-image models remain underexplored. Previous concept erasure methods, primarily designed for diffusion models that operate in denoising latent space, are not directly applicable to autoregressive models that generate images token by token. To address this critical gap, we propose Visual Contrast Exploitation (VCE), a novel framework comprising: (1) an innovative contrastive image pair construction paradigm that precisely decouples unsafe concepts from their associated content semantics, and (2) a sophisticated DPO-based training approach that enhances the model's ability to identify and leverage visual contrastive features from image pairs, enabling precise concept erasure. Our comprehensive experiments across three challenging tasks-artist style erasure, explicit content erasure, and object removal-demonstrate that our method effectively secures the model, achieving state-of-the-art results while erasing unsafe concepts and maintaining the integrity of unrelated safe concepts.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful technique for text-to-image (T2I) generation, creating high-quality, diverse images across various domains. However, a common limitation in these models is the incomplete display of objects, where fragments or missing parts undermine the model's performance in downstream applications. In this study, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the incompleteness issue and reveal that the primary factor behind incomplete object generation is the usage of RandomCrop during model training. This widely used data augmentation method, though enhances model generalization ability, disrupts object continuity during training. To address this, we propose a training-free solution that penalizes activation values at image boundaries during the early denoising steps. Our method is easily applicable to pre-trained Stable Diffusion models with minimal modifications and negligible computational overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, showing substantial improvements in object integrity and image quality.

  Text-to-video generation is an emerging field in generative AI, enabling the creation of realistic, semantically accurate videos from text prompts. While current models achieve impressive visual quality and alignment with input text, they typically rely on static knowledge, making it difficult to incorporate new data without retraining from scratch. To address this limitation, we propose VidCLearn, a continual learning framework for diffusion-based text-to-video generation. VidCLearn features a student-teacher architecture where the student model is incrementally updated with new text-video pairs, and the teacher model helps preserve previously learned knowledge through generative replay. Additionally, we introduce a novel temporal consistency loss to enhance motion smoothness and a video retrieval module to provide structural guidance at inference. Our architecture is also designed to be more computationally efficient than existing models while retaining satisfactory generation performance. Experimental results show VidCLearn's superiority over baseline methods in terms of visual quality, semantic alignment, and temporal coherence.

  Data-free knowledge distillation (DFKD) transfers knowledge from a teacher to a student without access to the real in-distribution (ID) data. While existing methods perform well on small-scale images, they suffer from mode collapse when synthesizing large-scale images, resulting in limited knowledge transfer. Recently, leveraging advanced generative models to synthesize photorealistic images has emerged as a promising alternative. Nevertheless, directly using off-the-shelf diffusion to generate datasets faces the precision-recall challenges: 1) ensuring synthetic data aligns with the real distribution, and 2) ensuring coverage of the real ID manifold. In response, we propose PRISM, a precision-recall informed synthesis method. Specifically, we introduce Energy-guided Distribution Alignment to avoid the generation of out-of-distribution samples, and design the Diversified Prompt Engineering to enhance coverage of the real ID manifold. Extensive experiments on various large-scale image datasets demonstrate the superiority of PRISM. Moreover, we demonstrate that models trained with PRISM exhibit strong domain generalization.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Numerous models have been developed for scanpath and saliency prediction, which are typically trained on scanpaths, which model eye movement as a sequence of discrete fixation points connected by saccades, while the rich information contained in the raw trajectories is often discarded. Moreover, most existing approaches fail to capture the variability observed among human subjects viewing the same image. They generally predict a single scanpath of fixed, pre-defined length, which conflicts with the inherent diversity and stochastic nature of real-world visual attention. To address these challenges, we propose DiffEye, a diffusion-based training framework designed to model continuous and diverse eye movement trajectories during free viewing of natural images. Our method builds on a diffusion model conditioned on visual stimuli and introduces a novel component, namely Corresponding Positional Embedding (CPE), which aligns spatial gaze information with the patch-based semantic features of the visual input. By leveraging raw eye-tracking trajectories rather than relying on scanpaths, DiffEye captures the inherent variability in human gaze behavior and generates high-quality, realistic eye movement patterns, despite being trained on a comparatively small dataset. The generated trajectories can also be converted into scanpaths and saliency maps, resulting in outputs that more accurately reflect the distribution of human visual attention. DiffEye is the first method to tackle this task on natural images using a diffusion model while fully leveraging the richness of raw eye-tracking data. Our extensive evaluation shows that DiffEye not only achieves state-of-the-art performance in scanpath generation but also enables, for the first time, the generation of continuous eye movement trajectories.

  Personalized animal image generation is challenging due to rich appearance cues and large morphological variability. Existing approaches often exhibit feature misalignment across domains, which leads to identity drift. We present AnimalBooth, a framework that strengthens identity preservation with an Animal Net and an adaptive attention module, mitigating cross domain alignment errors. We further introduce a frequency controlled feature integration module that applies Discrete Cosine Transform filtering in the latent space to guide the diffusion process, enabling a coarse to fine progression from global structure to detailed texture. To advance research in this area, we curate AnimalBench, a high resolution dataset for animal personalization. Extensive experiments show that AnimalBooth consistently outperforms strong baselines on multiple benchmarks and improves both identity fidelity and perceptual quality.

  Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in generating high-quality images. Recent advancements in Layout-to-Image (L2I) generation have leveraged positional conditions and textual descriptions to facilitate precise and controllable image synthesis. Despite overall progress, current L2I methods still exhibit suboptimal performance. Therefore, we propose InstanceAssemble, a novel architecture that incorporates layout conditions via instance-assembling attention, enabling position control with bounding boxes (bbox) and multimodal content control including texts and additional visual content. Our method achieves flexible adaption to existing DiT-based T2I models through light-weighted LoRA modules. Additionally, we propose a Layout-to-Image benchmark, Denselayout, a comprehensive benchmark for layout-to-image generation, containing 5k images with 90k instances in total. We further introduce Layout Grounding Score (LGS), an interpretable evaluation metric to more precisely assess the accuracy of L2I generation. Experiments demonstrate that our InstanceAssemble method achieves state-of-the-art performance under complex layout conditions, while exhibiting strong compatibility with diverse style LoRA modules.

  We present Follow-Your-Emoji-Faster, an efficient diffusion-based framework for freestyle portrait animation driven by facial landmarks. The main challenges in this task are preserving the identity of the reference portrait, accurately transferring target expressions, and maintaining long-term temporal consistency while ensuring generation efficiency. To address identity preservation and accurate expression retargeting, we enhance Stable Diffusion with two key components: a expression-aware landmarks as explicit motion signals, which improve motion alignment, support exaggerated expressions, and reduce identity leakage; and a fine-grained facial loss that leverages both expression and facial masks to better capture subtle expressions and faithfully preserve the reference appearance. With these components, our model supports controllable and expressive animation across diverse portrait types, including real faces, cartoons, sculptures, and animals. However, diffusion-based frameworks typically struggle to efficiently generate long-term stable animation results, which remains a core challenge in this task. To address this, we propose a progressive generation strategy for stable long-term animation, and introduce a Taylor-interpolated cache, achieving a 2.6X lossless acceleration. These two strategies ensure that our method produces high-quality results efficiently, making it user-friendly and accessible. Finally, we introduce EmojiBench++, a more comprehensive benchmark comprising diverse portraits, driving videos, and landmark sequences. Extensive evaluations on EmojiBench++ demonstrate that Follow-Your-Emoji-Faster achieves superior performance in both animation quality and controllability.

  Image fusion is a fundamental and important task in computer vision, aiming to combine complementary information from different modalities to fuse images. In recent years, diffusion models have made significant developments in the field of image fusion. However, diffusion models often require complex computations and redundant inference time, which reduces the applicability of these methods. To address this issue, we propose RFfusion, an efficient one-step diffusion model for image fusion based on Rectified Flow. We incorporate Rectified Flow into the image fusion task to straighten the sampling path in the diffusion model, achieving one-step sampling without the need for additional training, while still maintaining high-quality fusion results. Furthermore, we propose a task-specific variational autoencoder (VAE) architecture tailored for image fusion, where the fusion operation is embedded within the latent space to further reduce computational complexity. To address the inherent discrepancy between conventional reconstruction-oriented VAE objectives and the requirements of image fusion, we introduce a two-stage training strategy. This approach facilitates the effective learning and integration of complementary information from multi-modal source images, thereby enabling the model to retain fine-grained structural details while significantly enhancing inference efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in terms of both inference speed and fusion quality. Code is available atthis https URL.

  Recently, latent diffusion models has demonstrated promising performance in real-world video super-resolution (VSR) task, which can reconstruct high-quality videos from distorted low-resolution input through multiple diffusion steps. Compared to image super-resolution (ISR), VSR methods needs to process each frame in a video, which poses challenges to its inference efficiency. However, video quality and inference efficiency have always been a trade-off for the diffusion-based VSR methods. In this work, we propose One-Step Diffusion model for real-world Video Super-Resolution, namely OS-DiffVSR. Specifically, we devise a novel adjacent frame adversarial training paradigm, which can significantly improve the quality of synthetic videos. Besides, we devise a multi-frame fusion mechanism to maintain inter-frame temporal consistency and reduce the flicker in video. Extensive experiments on several popular VSR benchmarks demonstrate that OS-DiffVSR can even achieve better quality than existing diffusion-based VSR methods that require dozens of sampling steps.

  Synthetic data is crucial for advancing autonomous driving (AD) systems, yet current state-of-the-art video generation models, despite their visual realism, suffer from subtle geometric distortions that limit their utility for downstream perception tasks. We identify and quantify this critical issue, demonstrating a significant performance gap in 3D object detection when using synthetic versus real data. To address this, we introduce Reinforcement Learning with Geometric Feedback (RLGF), RLGF uniquely refines video diffusion models by incorporating rewards from specialized latent-space AD perception models. Its core components include an efficient Latent-Space Windowing Optimization technique for targeted feedback during diffusion, and a Hierarchical Geometric Reward (HGR) system providing multi-level rewards for point-line-plane alignment, and scene occupancy coherence. To quantify these distortions, we propose GeoScores. Applied to models like DiVE on nuScenes, RLGF substantially reduces geometric errors (e.g., VP error by 21\%, Depth error by 57\%) and dramatically improves 3D object detection mAP by 12.7\%, narrowing the gap to real-data performance. RLGF offers a plug-and-play solution for generating geometrically sound and reliable synthetic videos for AD development.

  The completion, extension, and generation of 3D semantic scenes are an interrelated set of capabilities that are useful for robotic navigation and exploration. Existing approaches seek to decouple these problems and solve them oneoff. Additionally, these approaches are often domain-specific, requiring separate models for different data distributions, e.g. indoor vs. outdoor scenes. To unify these techniques and provide cross-domain compatibility, we develop a single framework that can perform scene completion, extension, and generation in both indoor and outdoor scenes, which we term Octree Latent Semantic Diffusion. Our approach operates directly on an efficient dual octree graph latent representation: a hierarchical, sparse, and memory-efficient occupancy structure. This technique disentangles synthesis into two stages: (i) structure diffusion, which predicts binary split signals to construct a coarse occupancy octree, and (ii) latent semantic diffusion, which generates semantic embeddings decoded by a graph VAE into voxellevel semantic labels. To perform semantic scene completion or extension, our model leverages inference-time latent inpainting, or outpainting respectively. These inference-time methods use partial LiDAR scans or maps to condition generation, without the need for retraining or finetuning. We demonstrate highquality structure, coherent semantics, and robust completion from single LiDAR scans, as well as zero-shot generalization to out-of-distribution LiDAR data. These results indicate that completion-through-generation in a dual octree graph latent space is a practical and scalable alternative to regression-based pipelines for real-world robotic perception tasks.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In real-world clinical settings, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) frequently suffers from missing modalities due to equipment variability or patient cooperation issues, which can significantly affect model performance. To address this issue, we propose a multimodal MRI classification model based on the mmFormer architecture with an adaptive module for handling arbitrary combinations of missing modalities. Specifically, this model retains the hybrid modality-specific encoders and the modality-correlated encoder from mmFormer to extract consistent lesion features across available modalities. In addition, we integrate a missing-modality compensation module which leverages zero-padding, modality availability masks, and a Delta Function with learnable statistical parameters to dynamically synthesize proxy features for recovering missing information. To further improve prediction performance, we adopt a cross-validation ensemble strategy by training multiple models on different folds and applying soft voting during inference. This method is evaluated on the test set of Comprehensive Analysis & Computing of REal-world medical images (CARE) 2025 challenge, targeting the Liver Fibrosis Staging (LiFS) task based on non-contrast dynamic MRI scans including T1-weighted imaging (T1WI), T2-weighted imaging (T2WI), and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI). For Cirrhosis Detection and Substantial Fibrosis Detection on in-distribution vendors, our model obtains accuracies of 66.67%, and 74.17%, and corresponding area under the curve (AUC) scores of 71.73% and 68.48%, respectively.

  White matter tractography is an advanced neuroimaging technique that reconstructs the 3D white matter pathways of the brain from diffusion MRI data. It can be framed as a pathfinding problem aiming to infer neural fiber trajectories from noisy and ambiguous measurements, facing challenges such as crossing, merging, and fanning white-matter configurations. In this paper, we propose a novel tractography method that leverages Transformers to model the sequential nature of white matter streamlines, enabling the prediction of fiber directions by integrating both the trajectory context and current diffusion MRI measurements. To incorporate spatial information, we utilize CNNs that extract microstructural features from local neighborhoods around each voxel. By combining these complementary sources of information, our approach improves the precision and completeness of neural pathway mapping compared to traditional tractography models. We evaluate our method with the Tractometer toolkit, achieving competitive performance against state-of-the-art approaches, and present qualitative results on the TractoInferno dataset, demonstrating strong generalization to real-world data.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Visual prostheses hold great promise for restoring vision in blind individuals. While researchers have successfully utilized M/EEG signals to evoke visual perceptions during the brain decoding stage of visual prostheses, the complementary process of converting images into M/EEG signals in the brain encoding stage remains largely unexplored, hindering the formation of a complete functional pipeline. In this work, we present, to our knowledge, the first image-to-brain signal framework that generates M/EEG from images by leveraging denoising diffusion probabilistic models enhanced with cross-attention mechanisms. Specifically, the proposed framework comprises two key components: a pretrained CLIP visual encoder that extracts rich semantic representations from input images, and a cross-attention enhanced U-Net diffusion model that reconstructs brain signals through iterative denoising. Unlike conventional generative models that rely on simple concatenation for conditioning, our cross-attention modules capture the complex interplay between visual features and brain signal representations, enabling fine-grained alignment during generation. We evaluate the framework on two multimodal benchmark datasets and demonstrate that it generates biologically plausible brain signals. We also present visualizations of M/EEG topographies across all subjects in both datasets, providing intuitive demonstrations of intra-subject and inter-subject variations in brain signals.

However, their high computational cost and large parameter sizes pose significant challenges for usage in resource-constrained scenarios. Effective compression of models has become a crucial issue that urgently needs to be addressed. Post-training quantization (PTQ) is a promising solution to reduce memory usage and accelerate inference, but existing PTQ methods suffer from severe performance degradation under extreme low-bit settings. After experiments and analysis, we identify two key obstacles to low-bit PTQ for DiTs: (1) the weights of DiT models follow a Gaussian-like distribution with long tails, causing uniform quantization to poorly allocate intervals and leading to significant quantization errors. This issue has been observed in the linear layer weights of different DiT models, which deeply limits the performance. (2) two types of activation outliers in DiT models: (i) Mild Outliers with slightly elevated values, and (ii) Salient Outliers with large magnitudes concentrated in specific channels, which disrupt activation quantization. To address these issues, we propose LRQ-DiT, an efficient and accurate post-training quantization framework for image and video generation. First, we introduce Twin-Log Quantization (TLQ), a log-based method that allocates more quantization intervals to the intermediate dense regions, effectively achieving alignment with the weight distribution and reducing quantization errors. Second, we propose an Adaptive Rotation Scheme (ARS) that dynamically applies Hadamard or outlier-aware rotations based on activation fluctuation, effectively mitigating the impact of both types ofthis http URLexperiments on various text-to-image and text-to-video DiT models demonstrate that LRQ-DiT preserves high generation quality.

  Image editing in rectified flow models remains challenging due to the fundamental trade-off between reconstruction fidelity and editing flexibility. While inversion-based methods suffer from trajectory deviation, recent inversion-free approaches like FlowEdit offer direct editing pathways but can benefit from additional guidance to improve structure preservation. In this work, we demonstrate that optimal transport theory provides a unified framework for improving both paradigms in rectified flow editing. We introduce a zero-shot transport-guided inversion framework that leverages optimal transport during the reverse diffusion process, and extend optimal transport principles to enhance inversion-free methods through transport-optimized velocity field corrections. Incorporating transport-based guidance can effectively balance reconstruction accuracy and editing controllability across different rectified flow editing approaches. For inversion-based editing, our method achieves high-fidelity reconstruction with LPIPS scores of 0.001 and SSIM of 0.992 on face editing benchmarks, observing 7.8% to 12.9% improvements over RF-Inversion on LSUN datasets. For inversion-free editing with FlowEdit on FLUX and Stable Diffusion 3, we demonstrate consistent improvements in semantic consistency and structure preservation across diverse editing scenarios. Our semantic face editing experiments show an 11.2% improvement in identity preservation and enhanced perceptual quality. The unified optimal transport framework produces visually compelling edits with superior detail preservation across both inversion-based and direct editing paradigms.

  Blind Face Restoration aims to recover high-fidelity, detail-rich facial images from unknown degraded inputs, presenting significant challenges in preserving both identity and detail. Pre-trained diffusion models have been increasingly used as image priors to generate fine details. Still, existing methods often use fixed diffusion sampling timesteps and a global guidance scale, assuming uniform degradation. This limitation and potentially imperfect degradation kernel estimation frequently lead to under- or over-diffusion, resulting in an imbalance between fidelity and quality. We propose DynFaceRestore, a novel blind face restoration approach that learns to map any blindly degraded input to Gaussian blurry images. By leveraging these blurry images and their respective Gaussian kernels, we dynamically select the starting timesteps for each blurry image and apply closed-form guidance during the diffusion sampling process to maintain fidelity. Additionally, we introduce a dynamic guidance scaling adjuster that modulates the guidance strength across local regions, enhancing detail generation in complex areas while preserving structural fidelity in contours. This strategy effectively balances the trade-off between fidelity and quality. DynFaceRestore achieves state-of-the-art performance in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations, demonstrating robustness and effectiveness in blind face restoration.

  We introduce the concept of a subjective camera to reconstruct meaningful moments that physical cameras fail to capture. We propose Subjective Camera 1.0, a framework for reconstructing real-world scenes from readily accessible subjective readouts, i.e., textual descriptions and progressively drawn rough sketches. Built on optimization-based alignment of diffusion models, our approach avoids large-scale paired training data and mitigates generalization issues. To address the challenge of integrating multiple abstract concepts in real-world scenarios, we design a Sequence-Aware Sketch-Guided Diffusion framework with three loss terms for concept-wise sequential optimization, following the natural order of subjective readouts. Experiments on two datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in image quality as well as spatial and semantic alignment with target scenes. User studies with 40 participants further confirm that our approach is consistently preferred. Our project page is at:this http URL

  Recent Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) demonstrate promising capabilities in unifying visual understanding and generative modeling, enabling both accurate content understanding and flexible editing. However, current approaches treat "what to see" and "how to edit" separately: they either perform isolated object segmentation or utilize segmentation masks merely as conditional prompts for local edit generation tasks, often relying on multiple disjointed models. To bridge these gaps, we introduce FOCUS, a unified LVLM that integrates segmentation-aware perception and controllable object-centric generation within an end-to-end framework. FOCUS employs a dual-branch visual encoder to simultaneously capture global semantic context and fine-grained spatial details. In addition, we leverage a MoVQGAN-based visual tokenizer to produce discrete visual tokens that enhance generation quality. To enable accurate and controllable image editing, we propose a progressive multi-stage training pipeline, where segmentation masks are jointly optimized and used as spatial condition prompts to guide the diffusion decoder. This strategy aligns visual encoding, segmentation, and generation modules, effectively bridging segmentation-aware perception with fine-grained visual synthesis. Extensive experiments across three core tasks, including multimodal understanding, referring segmentation accuracy, and controllable image generation, demonstrate that FOCUS achieves strong performance by jointly optimizing visual perception and generative capabilities.

  Video diffusion models (DMs) have enabled high-quality video synthesis. Yet, their substantial computational and memory demands pose serious challenges to real-world deployment, even on high-end GPUs. As a commonly adopted solution, quantization has proven notable success in reducing cost for image DMs, while its direct application to video DMs remains ineffective. In this paper, we present QVGen, a novel quantization-aware training (QAT) framework tailored for high-performance and inference-efficient video DMs under extremely low-bit quantization (e.g., 4-bit or below). We begin with a theoretical analysis demonstrating that reducing the gradient norm is essential to facilitate convergence for QAT. To this end, we introduce auxiliary modules ($\Phi$) to mitigate large quantization errors, leading to significantly enhanced convergence. To eliminate the inference overhead of $\Phi$, we propose a rank-decay strategy that progressively eliminates $\Phi$. Specifically, we repeatedly employ singular value decomposition (SVD) and a proposed rank-based regularization $\mathbf{\gamma}$ to identify and decay low-contributing components. This strategy retains performance while zeroing out inference overhead. Extensive experiments across $4$ state-of-the-art (SOTA) video DMs, with parameter sizes ranging from $1.3$B $\sim14$B, show that QVGen is the first to reach full-precision comparable quality under 4-bit settings. Moreover, it significantly outperforms existing methods. For instance, our 3-bit CogVideoX-2B achieves improvements of $+25.28$ in Dynamic Degree and $+8.43$ in Scene Consistency on VBench.

  Diffusion Transformer (DiT), a promising diffusion model for visual generation, demonstrates impressive performance but incurs significant computational overhead. Intriguingly, analysis of pre-trained DiT models reveals that global self-attention is often redundant, predominantly capturing local patterns-highlighting the potential for more efficient alternatives. In this paper, we revisit convolution as an alternative building block for constructing efficient and expressive diffusion models. However, naively replacing self-attention with convolution typically results in degraded performance. Our investigations attribute this performance gap to the higher channel redundancy in ConvNets compared to Transformers. To resolve this, we introduce a compact channel attention mechanism that promotes the activation of more diverse channels, thereby enhancing feature diversity. This leads to Diffusion ConvNet (DiCo), a family of diffusion models built entirely from standard ConvNet modules, offering strong generative performance with significant efficiency gains. On class-conditional ImageNet generation benchmarks, DiCo-XL achieves an FID of 2.05 at 256x256 resolution and 2.53 at 512x512, with a 2.7x and 3.1x speedup over DiT-XL/2, respectively. Furthermore, experimental results on MS-COCO demonstrate that the purely convolutional DiCo exhibits strong potential for text-to-image generation. Code:this https URL.

  Instruction-based image editing enables precise modifications via natural language prompts, but existing methods face a precision-efficiency tradeoff: fine-tuning demands massive datasets (>10M) and computational resources, while training-free approaches suffer from weak instruction comprehension. We address this by proposing ICEdit, which leverages the inherent comprehension and generation abilities of large-scale Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) through three key innovations: (1) An in-context editing paradigm without architectural modifications; (2) Minimal parameter-efficient fine-tuning for quality improvement; (3) Early Filter Inference-Time Scaling, which uses VLMs to select high-quality noise samples for efficiency. Experiments show that ICEdit achieves state-of-the-art editing performance with only 0.1\% of the training data and 1\% trainable parameters compared to previous methods. Our approach establishes a new paradigm for balancing precision and efficiency in instructional image editing. Codes and demos can be found inthis https URL.

  Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) are known to have an unstable generation process, where even small perturbations or shifts in the input noise can lead to significantly different outputs. This hinders their applicability in applications requiring consistent results. In this work, we redesign LDMs to enhance consistency by making them shift-equivariant. While introducing anti-aliasing operations can partially improve shift-equivariance, significant aliasing and inconsistency persist due to the unique challenges in LDMs, including 1) aliasing amplification during VAE training and multiple U-Net inferences, and 2) self-attention modules that inherently lack shift-equivariance. To address these issues, we redesign the attention modules to be shift-equivariant and propose an equivariance loss that effectively suppresses the frequency bandwidth of the features in the continuous domain. The resulting alias-free LDM (AF-LDM) achieves strong shift-equivariance and is also robust to irregular warping. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AF-LDM produces significantly more consistent results than vanilla LDM across various applications, including video editing and image-to-image translation.

  Masked diffusion models (MDMs) offer a promising non-autoregressive alternative for large language modeling. Standard decoding methods for MDMs, such as confidence-based sampling, select tokens independently based on individual token confidences at each diffusion step. However, we observe that this independent token selection often results in generation orders resembling sequential autoregressive processes, limiting the advantages of non-autoregressive modeling. To mitigate this pheonomenon, we propose Reward-Weighted Sampling (RWS), a novel decoding strategy that leverages an external reward model to provide a principled global signal during the iterative diffusion process. Specifically, at each diffusion step, RWS evaluates the quality of the entire intermediate sequence and scales token logits accordingly, guiding token selection by integrating global sequence-level coherence. This method selectively increases the confidence of tokens that initially have lower scores, thereby promoting a more non-autoregressive generation order. Furthermore, we provide theoretical justification showing that reward-weighted logit scaling induces beneficial rank reversals in token selection and consistently improves expected reward. Experiments demonstrate that RWS significantly promotes non-autoregressive generation orders, leading to improvements across multiple evaluation metrics. These results highlight the effectiveness of integrating global signals in enhancing both the non-autoregressive properties and overall performance of MDMs.

  Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) generate text through iterative denoising, yet current decoding strategies discard rich intermediate predictions in favor of the final output. Our work here reveals a critical phenomenon, temporal oscillation, where correct answers often emerge in the middle process, but are overwritten in later denoising steps. To address this issue, we introduce two complementary methods that exploit temporal consistency: 1) Temporal Self-Consistency Voting, a training-free, test-time decoding strategy that aggregates predictions across denoising steps to select the most consistent output; and 2) a post-training method termed Temporal Consistency Reinforcement, which uses Temporal Semantic Entropy (TSE), a measure of semantic stability across intermediate predictions, as a reward signal to encourage stable generations. Empirical results across multiple benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Using the negative TSE reward alone, we observe a remarkable average improvement of 24.7% on the Countdown dataset over an existing dLLM. Combined with the accuracy reward, we achieve absolute gains of 2.0% on GSM8K, 4.3% on MATH500, 6.6% on SVAMP, and 25.3% on Countdown, respectively. Our findings underscore the untapped potential of temporal dynamics in dLLMs and offer two simple yet effective tools to harness them.

  Long-term trajectory anomaly detection is a challenging problem due to the diversity and complex spatiotemporal dependencies in trajectory data. Existing trajectory anomaly detection methods fail to simultaneously consider both the high-level intentions of agents as well as the low-level details of the agent's navigation when analysing an agent's trajectories. This limits their ability to capture the full diversity of normal trajectories. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised trajectory anomaly detection method named Intention-aware Hierarchical Diffusion model (IHiD), which detects anomalies through both high-level intent evaluation and low-level sub-trajectory analysis. Our approach leverages Inverse Q Learning as the high-level model to assess whether a selected subgoal aligns with an agent's intention based on predicted Q-values. Meanwhile, a diffusion model serves as the low-level model to generate sub-trajectories conditioned on subgoal information, with anomaly detection based on reconstruction error. By integrating both models, IHiD effectively utilises subgoal transition knowledge and is designed to capture the diverse distribution of normal trajectories. Our experiments show that the proposed method IHiD achieves up to 30.2% improvement in anomaly detection performance in terms of F1 score over state-of-the-art baselines.

  Long-term multi-agent systems inevitably generate vast amounts of trajectories and historical interactions, which makes efficient memory management essential for both performance and scalability. Existing methods typically depend on vector retrieval and hierarchical storage, yet they are prone to noise accumulation, uncontrolled memory expansion, and limited generalization across domains. To address these challenges, we present SEDM, Self-Evolving Distributed Memory, a verifiable and adaptive framework that transforms memory from a passive repository into an active, self-optimizing component. SEDM integrates verifiable write admission based on reproducible replay, a self-scheduling memory controller that dynamically ranks and consolidates entries according to empirical utility, and cross-domain knowledge diffusion that abstracts reusable insights to support transfer across heterogeneous tasks. Evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate that SEDM improves reasoning accuracy while reducing token overhead compared with strong memory baselines, and further enables knowledge distilled from fact verification to enhance multi-hop reasoning. The results highlight SEDM as a scalable and sustainable memory mechanism for open-ended multi-agent collaboration. The code will be released in the later stage of this project.
