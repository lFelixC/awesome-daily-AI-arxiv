- **[Exploring the Limits of Vision-Language-Action Manipulations in Cross-task Generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15660)**  `arXiv:2505.15660`  `cs.RO` `cs.CV`  
  _Jiaming Zhou, Ke Ye, Jiayi Liu, Teli Ma, Zifan Wang, Ronghe Qiu, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The generalization capabilities of vision-language-action (VLA) models to unseen tasks are crucial to achieving general-purpose robotic manipulation in open-world settings. However, the cross-task generalization capabilities of existing VLA models remain significantly underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce AGNOSTOS, a novel simulation benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate cross-task zero-shot generalization in manipulation. AGNOSTOS comprises 23 unseen manipulation tasks for testing, distinct from common training task distributions, and incorporates two levels of generalization difficulty to assess robustness. Our systematic evaluation reveals that current VLA models, despite being trained on diverse datasets, struggle to generalize effectively to these unseen tasks. To overcome this limitation, we propose Cross-Task In-Context Manipulation (X-ICM), a method that conditions large language models (LLMs) on in-context demonstrations from seen tasks to predict action sequences for unseen tasks. Additionally, we introduce a dynamics-guided sample selection strategy that identifies relevant demonstrations by capturing cross-task dynamics. On AGNOSTOS, X-ICM significantly improves cross-task zero-shot generalization performance over leading VLAs. We believe AGNOSTOS and X-ICM will serve as valuable tools for advancing general-purpose robotic manipulation.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) have demonstrated remarkable performance on complex robotic manipulation tasks through imitation learning. However, existing imitation learning datasets contain only successful trajectories and lack failure or recovery data, especially for out-of-distribution (OOD) states where the robot deviates from the main policy due to minor perturbations or errors, leading VLA models to struggle with states deviating from the training distribution. To this end, we propose an automated OOD data augmentation framework named RESample through exploratory sampling. Specifically, we first leverage offline reinforcement learning to obtain an action-value network that accurately identifies sub-optimal actions under the current manipulation policy. We further sample potential OOD states from trajectories via rollout, and design an exploratory sampling mechanism that adaptively incorporates these action proxies into the training dataset to ensure efficiency. Subsequently, our framework explicitly encourages the VLAs to recover from OOD states and enhances their robustness against distributional shifts. We conduct extensive experiments on the LIBERO benchmark as well as real-world robotic manipulation tasks, demonstrating that RESample consistently improves the stability and generalization ability of VLA models.

- **[From Spatial to Actions: Grounding Vision-Language-Action Model in Spatial Foundation Priors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17439)**  `arXiv:2510.17439`  `cs.RO` `cs.AI` `cs.CV` `cs.LG`  
  _Zhengshen Zhang, Hao Li, Yalun Dai, Zhengbang Zhu, Lei Zhou, Chenchen Liu, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Existing vision-language-action (VLA) models act in 3D real-world but are typically built on 2D encoders, leaving a spatial reasoning gap that limits generalization and adaptability. Recent 3D integration techniques for VLAs either require specialized sensors and transfer poorly across modalities, or inject weak cues that lack geometry and degrade vision-language alignment. In this work, we introduce FALCON (From Spatial to Action), a novel paradigm that injects rich 3D spatial tokens into the action head. FALCON leverages spatial foundation models to deliver strong geometric priors from RGB alone, and includes an Embodied Spatial Model that can optionally fuse depth, or pose for higher fidelity when available, without retraining or architectural changes. To preserve language reasoning, spatial tokens are consumed by a Spatial-Enhanced Action Head rather than being concatenated into the vision-language backbone. These designs enable FALCON to address limitations in spatial representation, modality transferability, and alignment. In comprehensive evaluations across three simulation benchmarks and eleven real-world tasks, our proposed FALCON achieves state-of-the-art performance, consistently surpasses competitive baselines, and remains robust under clutter, spatial-prompt conditioning, and variations in object scale and height.

- **[RoboRefer: Towards Spatial Referring with Reasoning in Vision-Language Models for Robotics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04308)**  `arXiv:2506.04308`  `cs.RO` `cs.AI` `cs.CV`  
  _Enshen Zhou, Jingkun An, Cheng Chi, Yi Han, Shanyu Rong, Chi Zhang, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Spatial referring is a fundamental capability of embodied robots to interact with the 3D physical world. However, even with the powerful pretrained vision language models (VLMs), recent approaches are still not qualified to accurately understand the complex 3D scenes and dynamically reason about the instruction-indicated locations for interaction. To this end, we propose RoboRefer, a 3D-aware VLM that can first achieve precise spatial understanding by integrating a disentangled but dedicated depth encoder via supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Moreover, RoboRefer advances generalized multi-step spatial reasoning via reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT), with metric-sensitive process reward functions tailored for spatial referring tasks. To support SFT and RFT training, we introduce RefSpatial, a large-scale dataset of 20M QA pairs (2x prior), covering 31 spatial relations (vs. 15 prior) and supporting complex reasoning processes (up to 5 steps). In addition, we introduce RefSpatial-Bench, a challenging benchmark filling the gap in evaluating spatial referring with multi-step reasoning. Experiments show that SFT-trained RoboRefer achieves state-of-the-art spatial understanding, with an average success rate of 89.6%. RFT-trained RoboRefer further outperforms all other baselines by a large margin, even surpassing Gemini-2.5-Pro by 17.4% in average accuracy on RefSpatial-Bench. Notably, RoboRefer can be integrated with various control policies to execute long-horizon, dynamic tasks across diverse robots (e,g., UR5, G1 humanoid) in cluttered real-world scenes.

- **[DIV-Nav: Open-Vocabulary Spatial Relationships for Multi-Object Navigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16518)**  `arXiv:2510.16518`  `cs.RO` `cs.AI`  
  _Jes√∫s Ortega-Peimbert, Finn Lukas Busch, Timon Homberger, Quantao Yang, Olov Andersson_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Advances in open-vocabulary semantic mapping and object navigation have enabled robots to perform an informed search of their environment for an arbitrary object. However, such zero-shot object navigation is typically designed for simple queries with an object name like "television" or "blue rug". Here, we consider more complex free-text queries with spatial relationships, such as "find the remote on the table" while still leveraging robustness of a semantic map. We present DIV-Nav, a real-time navigation system that efficiently addresses this problem through a series of relaxations: i) Decomposing natural language instructions with complex spatial constraints into simpler object-level queries on a semantic map, ii) computing the Intersection of individual semantic belief maps to identify regions where all objects co-exist, and iii) Validating the discovered objects against the original, complex spatial constrains via a LVLM. We further investigate how to adapt the frontier exploration objectives of online semantic mapping to such spatial search queries to more effectively guide the search process. We validate our system through extensive experiments on the MultiON benchmark and real-world deployment on a Boston Dynamics Spot robot using a Jetson Orin AGX.

- **[GeNIE: A Generalizable Navigation System for In-the-Wild Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17960)**  `arXiv:2506.17960`  `cs.RO` `cs.AI`  
  _Jiaming Wang, Diwen Liu, Jizhuo Chen, Jiaxuan Da, Nuowen Qian, Tram Minh Man, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reliable navigation in unstructured, real-world environments remains a significant challenge for embodied agents, especially when operating across diverse terrains, weather conditions, and sensor configurations. In this paper, we introduce GeNIE (Generalizable Navigation System for In-the-Wild Environments), a robust navigation framework designed for global deployment. GeNIE integrates a generalizable traversability prediction model built on SAM2 with a novel path fusion strategy that enhances planning stability in noisy and ambiguous settings. We deployed GeNIE in the Earth Rover Challenge (ERC) at ICRA 2025, where it was evaluated across six countries spanning three continents. GeNIE took first place and achieved 79% of the maximum possible score, outperforming the second-best team by 17%, and completed the entire competition without a single human intervention. These results set a new benchmark for robust, generalizable outdoor robot navigation. We will release the codebase, pretrained model weights, and newly curated datasets to support future research in real-world navigation.

- **[Robobench: A Comprehensive Evaluation Benchmark for Multimodal Large Language Models as Embodied Brain](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17801)**  `arXiv:2510.17801`  `cs.RO`  
  _Yulin Luo, Chun-Kai Fan, Menghang Dong, Jiayu Shi, Mengdi Zhao, Bo-Wen Zhang, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Building robots that can perceive, reason, and act in dynamic, unstructured environments remains a core challenge. Recent embodied systems often adopt a dual-system paradigm, where System 2 handles high-level reasoning while System 1 executes low-level control. In this work, we refer to System 2 as the embodied brain, emphasizing its role as the cognitive core for reasoning and decision-making in manipulation tasks. Given this role, systematic evaluation of the embodied brain is essential. Yet existing benchmarks emphasize execution success, or when targeting high-level reasoning, suffer from incomplete dimensions and limited task realism, offering only a partial picture of cognitive capability. To bridge this gap, we introduce RoboBench, a benchmark that systematically evaluates multimodal large language models (MLLMs) as embodied brains. Motivated by the critical roles across the full manipulation pipeline, RoboBench defines five dimensions-instruction comprehension, perception reasoning, generalized planning, affordance prediction, and failure analysis-spanning 14 capabilities, 25 tasks, and 6092 QA pairs. To ensure realism, we curate datasets across diverse embodiments, attribute-rich objects, and multi-view scenes, drawing from large-scale real robotic data. For planning, RoboBench introduces an evaluation framework, MLLM-as-world-simulator. It evaluate embodied feasibility by simulating whether predicted plans can achieve critical object-state changes. Experiments on 14 MLLMs reveal fundamental limitations: difficulties with implicit instruction comprehension, spatiotemporal reasoning, cross-scenario planning, fine-grained affordance understanding, and execution failure diagnosis. RoboBench provides a comprehensive scaffold to quantify high-level cognition, and guide the development of next-generation embodied MLLMs. The project page is inthis https URL.

- **[DDBot: Differentiable Physics-based Digging Robot for Unknown Granular Materials](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17335)**  `arXiv:2510.17335`  `cs.RO`  
  _Xintong Yang, Minglun Wei, Ze Ji, Yu-Kun Lai_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Automating the manipulation of granular materials poses significant challenges due to complex contact dynamics, unpredictable material properties, and intricate system states. Existing approaches often fail to achieve efficiency and accuracy in such tasks. To fill the research gap, this paper studies the small-scale and high-precision granular material digging task with unknown physical properties. A new framework, named differentiable digging robot (DDBot), is proposed to manipulate granular materials, including sand and soil.Specifically, we equip DDBot with a differentiable physics-based simulator, tailored for granular material manipulation, powered by GPU-accelerated parallel computing and automatic differentiation. DDBot can perform efficient differentiable system identification and high-precision digging skill optimisation for unknown granular materials, which is enabled by a differentiable skill-to-action mapping, a task-oriented demonstration method, gradient clipping and line search-based gradient descent.Experimental results show that DDBot can efficiently (converge within 5 to 20 minutes) identify unknown granular material dynamics and optimise digging skills, with high-precision results in zero-shot real-world deployments, highlighting its practicality. Benchmark results against state-of-the-art baselines also confirm the robustness and efficiency of DDBot in such digging tasks.

- **[Implicit State Estimation via Video Replanning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17315)**  `arXiv:2510.17315`  `cs.RO`  
  _Po-Chen Ko, Jiayuan Mao, Yu-Hsiang Fu, Hsien-Jeng Yeh, Chu-Rong Chen, Wei-Chiu Ma, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Video-based representations have gained prominence in planning and decision-making due to their ability to encode rich spatiotemporal dynamics and geometric relationships. These representations enable flexible and generalizable solutions for complex tasks such as object manipulation and navigation. However, existing video planning frameworks often struggle to adapt to failures at interaction time due to their inability to reason about uncertainties in partially observed environments. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a novel framework that integrates interaction-time data into the planning process. Our approach updates model parameters online and filters out previously failed plans during generation. This enables implicit state estimation, allowing the system to adapt dynamically without explicitly modeling unknown state variables. We evaluate our framework through extensive experiments on a new simulated manipulation benchmark, demonstrating its ability to improve replanning performance and advance the field of video-based decision-making.

- **[Advancing Off-Road Autonomous Driving: The Large-Scale ORAD-3D Dataset and Comprehensive Benchmarks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16500)**  `arXiv:2510.16500`  `cs.RO`  
  _Chen Min, Jilin Mei, Heng Zhai, Shuai Wang, Tong Sun, Fanjie Kong, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  A major bottleneck in off-road autonomous driving research lies in the scarcity of large-scale, high-quality datasets and benchmarks. To bridge this gap, we present ORAD-3D, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the largest dataset specifically curated for off-road autonomous driving. ORAD-3D covers a wide spectrum of terrains, including woodlands, farmlands, grasslands, riversides, gravel roads, cement roads, and rural areas, while capturing diverse environmental variations across weather conditions (sunny, rainy, foggy, and snowy) and illumination levels (bright daylight, daytime, twilight, and nighttime). Building upon this dataset, we establish a comprehensive suite of benchmark evaluations spanning five fundamental tasks: 2D free-space detection, 3D occupancy prediction, rough GPS-guided path planning, vision-language model-driven autonomous driving, and world model for off-road environments. Together, the dataset and benchmarks provide a unified and robust resource for advancing perception and planning in challenging off-road scenarios. The dataset and code will be made publicly available atthis https URL.

- **[Cosmos-Surg-dVRK: World Foundation Model-based Automated Online Evaluation of Surgical Robot Policy Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16240)**  `arXiv:2510.16240`  `cs.RO`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The rise of surgical robots and vision-language-action models has accelerated the development of autonomous surgical policies and efficient assessment strategies. However, evaluating these policies directly on physical robotic platforms such as the da Vinci Research Kit (dVRK) remains hindered by high costs, time demands, reproducibility challenges, and variability in execution. World foundation models (WFM) for physical AI offer a transformative approach to simulate complex real-world surgical tasks, such as soft tissue deformation, with high fidelity. This work introduces Cosmos-Surg-dVRK, a surgical finetune of the Cosmos WFM, which, together with a trained video classifier, enables fully automated online evaluation and benchmarking of surgical policies. We evaluate Cosmos-Surg-dVRK using two distinct surgical datasets. On tabletop suture pad tasks, the automated pipeline achieves strong correlation between online rollouts in Cosmos-Surg-dVRK and policy outcomes on the real dVRK Si platform, as well as good agreement between human labelers and the V-JEPA 2-derived video classifier. Additionally, preliminary experiments with ex-vivo porcine cholecystectomy tasks in Cosmos-Surg-dVRK demonstrate promising alignment with real-world evaluations, highlighting the platform's potential for more complex surgical procedures.

- **[Learn2Decompose: Learning Problem Decomposition for Efficient Sequential Multi-object Manipulation Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06843)**  `arXiv:2408.06843`  `cs.RO`  
  _Yan Zhang, Teng Xue, Amirreza Razmjoo, Sylvain Calinon_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present a Reactive Task and Motion Planning (TAMP) approach for efficient sequential multi-object manipulation in dynamic environments. Conventional TAMP solvers experience an exponential increase in planning time as the planning horizon and number of objects grow, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios. To address this, we propose learning problem decomposition from demonstrations to accelerate TAMP solvers. Our approach consists of three key components: goal decomposition learning, temporal distance learning, and object reduction. Goal decomposition identifies the necessary sequences of states that the system must pass through before reaching the final goal, treating them as subgoal sequences. Temporal distance learning predicts the temporal distance between two states, enabling the system to identify the closest subgoal from a disturbed state. Object reduction minimizes the set of active objects considered during replanning, further improving efficiency. We evaluate our approach on three benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness in improving replanning efficiency for sequential multi-object manipulation tasks in dynamic environments.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  What if artificial agents could not just communicate, but also evolve, adapt, and reshape their worlds in ways we cannot fully predict? With llm now powering multi-agent systems and social simulations, we are witnessing new possibilities for modeling open-ended, ever-changing environments. Yet, most current simulations remain constrained within static sandboxes, characterized by predefined tasks, limited dynamics, and rigid evaluation criteria. These limitations prevent them from capturing the complexity of real-world societies. In this paper, we argue that static, task-specific benchmarks are fundamentally inadequate and must be rethought. We critically review emerging architectures that blend llm with multi-agent dynamics, highlight key hurdles such as balancing stability and diversity, evaluating unexpected behaviors, and scaling to greater complexity, and introduce a fresh taxonomy for this rapidly evolving field. Finally, we present a research roadmap centered on open-endedness, continuous co-evolution, and the development of resilient, socially aligned AI ecosystems. We call on the community to move beyond static paradigms and help shape the next generation of adaptive, socially-aware multi-agent simulations.

  _Om Tailor_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multi-agent deployments of large language models (LLMs) are increasingly embedded in market, allocation, and governance workflows, yet covert coordination among agents can silently erode trust and social welfare. Existing audits are dominated by heuristics that lack theoretical guarantees, struggle to transfer across tasks, and seldom ship with the infrastructure needed for independent replication. We introduce Audit the Whisper, a conference-grade research artifact that spans theory, benchmark design, detection, and reproducibility. Our contributions are: (i) a channel-capacity analysis showing how interventions such as paraphrase, rate limiting, and role permutation impose quantifiable capacity penalties-operationalised via paired-run Kullback--Leibler diagnostics-that tighten mutual-information thresholds with finite-sample guarantees and full proofs; (ii) ColludeBench-v0, covering pricing, first-price auctions, peer review, and hosted Gemini/Groq APIs with configurable covert schemes, deterministic manifests, and reward instrumentation; and (iii) a calibrated auditing pipeline that fuses cross-run mutual information, permutation invariance, watermark variance, and fairness-aware acceptance bias, each tuned to a $10^{-3}$ false-positive budget and validated by 10k honest runs plus an e-value martingale. Across ColludeBench and external suites including Secret Collusion, CASE, Perfect Collusion Benchmark, and SentinelAgent, the union meta-test attains state-of-the-art power at fixed FPR while ablations surface price-of-auditing trade-offs and fairness-driven colluders invisible to MI alone. We release regeneration scripts, anonymized manifests, and documentation so that external auditors can reproduce every figure, satisfy double-blind requirements, and extend the framework with minimal effort.

- **[MiCRO for Multilateral Negotiations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17401)**  `arXiv:2510.17401`  `cs.MA`  
  _David Aguilera-Luzon, Dave de Jonge, Javier Larrosa_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recently, a very simple new bilateral negotiation strategy called MiCRO was introduced that does not make use of any kind of opponent modeling or machine learning techniques and that does not require fine-tuning of any parameters. Despite its simplicity, it was shown that MiCRO performs similar to -- or even better than -- most state-of-the-art negotiation strategies. This lead its authors to argue that the benchmark domains on which negotiation algorithms are typically tested may be too simplistic. However, one question that was left open, was how MiCRO could be generalized to multilateral negotiations. In this paper we fill this gap by introducing a multilateral variant of MiCRO. We compare it with the winners of the Automated Negotiating Agents Competitions (ANAC) of 2015, 2017 and 2018 and show that it outperforms them. Furthermore, we perform an empirical game-theoretical analysis to show that our new version of MiCRO forms an empirical Nash equilibrium.

- **[Robust Federated Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00310)**  `arXiv:2510.00310`  `cs.LG` `cs.MA`  
  _Akash Dhasade, Sadegh Farhadkhani, Rachid Guerraoui, Nirupam Gupta, Maxime Jacovella, Anne-Marie Kermarrec, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Federated inference, in the form of one-shot federated learning, edge ensembles, or federated ensembles, has emerged as an attractive solution to combine predictions from multiple models. This paradigm enables each model to remain local and proprietary while a central server queries them and aggregates predictions. Yet, the robustness of federated inference has been largely neglected, leaving them vulnerable to even simple attacks. To address this critical gap, we formalize the problem of robust federated inference and provide the first robustness analysis of this class of methods. Our analysis of averaging-based aggregators shows that the error of the aggregator is small either when the dissimilarity between honest responses is small or the margin between the two most probable classes is large. Moving beyond linear averaging, we show that problem of robust federated inference with non-linear aggregators can be cast as an adversarial machine learning problem. We then introduce an advanced technique using the DeepSet aggregation model, proposing a novel composition of adversarial training and test-time robust aggregation to robustify non-linear aggregators. Our composition yields significant improvements, surpassing existing robust aggregation methods by 4.7 - 22.2% in accuracy points across diverse benchmarks.

  _Lunchen Xie, Zehua He, Qingjiang Shi_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Personalized Federated Learning (PFL) has emerged as a critical research frontier addressing data heterogeneity issue across distributed clients. Novel model architectures and collaboration mechanisms are engineered to accommodate statistical disparities while producing client-specific models. Parameter decoupling represents a promising paradigm for maintaining model performance in PFL frameworks. However, the communication efficiency of many existing methods remains suboptimal, sustaining substantial communication burdens that impede practical deployment. To bridge this gap, we propose Federated Learning with Programmed Update and Reduced INformation (FedPURIN), a novel framework that strategically identifies critical parameters for transmission through an integer programming formulation. This mathematically grounded strategy is seamlessly integrated into a sparse aggregation scheme, achieving a significant communication reduction while preserving the efficacy. Comprehensive evaluations on standard image classification benchmarks under varied non-IID conditions demonstrate competitive performance relative to state-of-the-art methods, coupled with quantifiable communication reduction through sparse aggregation. The framework establishes a new paradigm for communication-efficient PFL, particularly advantageous for edge intelligence systems operating with heterogeneous data sources.

- **[Mapping Post-Training Forgetting in Language Models at Scale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17776)**  `arXiv:2510.17776`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI` `cs.CL`  
  _Jackson Harmon, Andreas Hochlehnert, Matthias Bethge, Ameya Prabhu_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Scaled post-training now drives many of the largest capability gains in language models (LMs), yet its effect on pretrained knowledge remains poorly understood. Not all forgetting is equal: Forgetting one fact (e.g., a U.S. president or an API call) does not "average out" by recalling another. Hence, we propose a sample-wise paradigm to measure what is forgotten and when backward transfer occurs. Our metric counts 1->0 transitions (correct before post-training, incorrect after) to quantify forgetting and 0->1 transitions to quantify backward transfer. Traditional task averages conflate these effects and obscure large changes. For multiple-choice benchmarks, we add chance-adjusted variants that subtract the expected contribution of random guessing from pre- and post-training accuracies. We apply this framework across post-training stages, model sizes, and data scales. Our large-scale analysis shows that: (1) Domain-continual pretraining induces moderate forgetting with low-to-moderate backward transfer; (2) RL/SFT post-training applied to base models and Instruction tuning yields moderate-to-large backward transfer on math and logic with overall low-to-moderate forgetting; (3) Applying RL/SFT to instruction-tuned models is sensitive on data scale: at small scales, both forgetting and backward transfer are small; at larger scales, effects are mixed and warrant further study with better controls; (4) Model merging does not reliably mitigate forgetting. Overall, our framework offers a practical yardstick for mapping how post-training alters pretrained knowledge at scale -- enabling progress towards generally capable AI systems.

- **[Soft-Masked Diffusion Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17206)**  `arXiv:2510.17206`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI` `cs.CL`  
  _Michael Hersche, Samuel Moor-Smith, Thomas Hofmann, Abbas Rahimi_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Diffusion models have demonstrated strong potential in language modeling, offering various advantages over traditional autoregressive approaches. Their ability to generate and revise entire responses in parallel enables faster generation and built-in self-correction mechanisms. Most modern diffusion-based language models employ masked diffusion, where decoding involves iteratively processing masked tokens based on a binary decision: either retaining the mask or replacing it with the predicted token. However, this binary choice discards valuable predictive information when the mask is retained. To address this limitation, we introduce soft-masking (SM), a novel method that dynamically blends the embedding of the mask token with the embeddings of the top-$k$ predicted tokens from the previous decoding step, for each retained mask. This provides the model with a more informative prior, preserving context from earlier computations and allowing partial information about masked tokens to propagate beyond a single step. We propose a training methodology that adapts a pretrained masked diffusion language model to incorporate SM. We demonstrate that continuing pretraining a 169M parameter model with SM leads to improved perplexity and MAUVE scores. Furthermore, we finetune two state-of-the-art diffusion models, Dream-7B and Dream-Coder-7B, with SM. SM consistently improves performance across multiple coding benchmarks, particularly in high-throughput settings.

- **[Do LLMs Recognize Your Latent Preferences? A Benchmark for Latent Information Discovery in Personalized Interaction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17132)**  `arXiv:2510.17132`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI` `cs.CL`  
  _Ioannis Tsaknakis, Bingqing Song, Shuyu Gan, Dongyeop Kang, Alfredo Garcia, Gaowen Liu, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at producing broadly relevant text, but this generality becomes a limitation when user-specific preferences are required, such as recommending restaurants or planning travel. In these scenarios, users rarely articulate every preference explicitly; instead, much of what they care about remains latent, waiting to be inferred. This raises a fundamental question: Can LLMs uncover and reason about such latent information through conversation?We address this problem by introducing a unified benchmark for evaluating latent information discovery - the ability of LLMs to reveal and utilize hidden user attributes through multi-turn interaction. The benchmark spans three progressively realistic settings: the classic 20 Questions game, Personalized Question Answering, and Personalized Text Summarization. All tasks share a tri-agent framework (User, Assistant, Judge) enabling turn-level evaluation of elicitation and adaptation. Our results reveal that while LLMs can indeed surface latent information through dialogue, their success varies dramatically with context: from 32% to 98%, depending on task complexity, topic, and number of hidden attributes. This benchmark provides the first systematic framework for studying latent information discovery in personalized interaction, highlighting that effective preference inference remains an open frontier for building truly adaptive AI systems.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Knowledge Distillation (KD) accelerates training of large language models (LLMs) but poses intellectual property protection and LLM diversity risks. Existing KD detection methods based on self-identity or output similarity can be easily evaded through prompt engineering. We present a KD detection framework effective in both white-box and black-box settings by exploiting an overlooked signal: the transfer of MoE "structural habits", especially internal routing patterns. Our approach analyzes how different experts specialize and collaborate across various inputs, creating distinctive fingerprints that persist through the distillation process. To extend beyond the white-box setup and MoE architectures, we further propose Shadow-MoE, a black-box method that constructs proxy MoE representations via auxiliary distillation to compare these patterns between arbitrary model pairs. We establish a comprehensive, reproducible benchmark that offers diverse distilled checkpoints and an extensible framework to facilitate future research.

  Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is a commonly used technique to adapt large language models (LLMs) to downstream tasks. In practice, SFT on a full dataset is computationally expensive and sometimes suffers from overfitting or bias amplification. This facilitates the rise of data curation in SFT, which prioritizes the most valuable data to optimze. This work studies the online batch selection family that dynamically scores and filters samples during the training process. However, existing popular methods often (i) rely merely on the utility of data to select a subset while neglecting other crucial factors like diversity, (ii) rely on external resources such as reference models or validation sets, and (iii) incur extra training time over full-dataset training. To address these limitations, this work develops \textbf{UDS (Utility-Diversity Sampling)}, a framework for efficient online batch selection in SFT. UDS leverages the nuclear norm of the logits matrix to capture both data utility and intra-sample diversity, while estimating inter-sample diversity through efficient low-dimensional embedding comparisons with a lightweight memory buffer of historical samples. Such a design eliminates the need for external resources and unnecessary backpropagation, securing computational efficiency. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that UDS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art online batch selection methods under varying data budgets, and significantly reduces training time compared to full-dataset fine-tuning.

  Test-time scaling has enabled Large Language Models (LLMs) with remarkable reasoning capabilities, particularly in mathematical domains, through intermediate chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning before generating final answers. However, the specific sources and mechanisms underlying these reasoning capabilities remain insufficiently understood. Optimization reasoning, i.e. finding extrema under constraints, represents a fundamental abstraction that underpins critical applications in planning, control, resource allocation, and prompt search. To systematically evaluate this capability, we introduce ExtremBench, a benchmark dataset for solving mathematical extremal problems, curated from inequality exercises used for Chinese Mathematical Olympiad and transformed into $93$ standardized extrema-finding problems. We conduct extensive evaluations across various state-of-the-art open-source model families, including the Qwen3, GPT-OSS, and DeepSeek. Our results reveal that LLMs' extremal-solving reasoning capabilities do not always align with those of current mathematical benchmarks such as AIME25 and MATH-500, with some models showing strong general mathematical reasoning but poor extremal-solving skills, and vice versa. This discrepancy highlights a critical gap in current evaluation practices and suggests that existing benchmarks may not comprehensively capture the full spectrum of mathematical reasoning abilities.

  Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has improved the reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by using rule-based binary feedback. However, current RLVR methods typically assign the same reward to every token. This coarse-grained feedback hampers precise credit assignment, making it hard for models to identify which reasoning steps lead to success or failure, and often results in suboptimal policies. Methods like PPO provide credit assignment by value estimation, but yield inaccurate and unverifiable signals due to limited sampling. On the other hand, methods using Process Reward Models can provide step-wise rewards but suffer from several key limitations: they require high-quality process supervision labels, the feedback is unreliable due to probabilistic reward modeling, and their application in online reinforcement learning (RL) is time-consuming. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a simple but efficient method-Credit Assignment Policy Optimization (CAPO). Instead of training auxiliary models, CAPO directly leverages an off-the-shelf, general-purpose LLM as a Generative Process Reward Model (LLM-as-GenPRM) to generate all step-wise critique by one pass only based on the correctness of the step itself, providing deterministic token-level credits to refine the tokens that were originally assigned identical rule-based rewards. To further enhance the accuracy and robustness, we employ voting mechanisms that scale with the number of generated critiques. Extensive experiments on various backbones like Llama and Qwen models show that CAPO consistently outperforms supervised learning-based and RL-based fine-tuning methods across four challenging mathematical benchmarks and three out-of-domain benchmarks. Further analysis shows that CAPO can help the model to foster the learning of correct reasoning pathways leading to correct answers.

  Reinforcement learning (RL) post-training is crucial for LLM alignment and reasoning, but existing policy-based methods, such as PPO and DPO, can fall short of fixing shortcuts inherited from pre-training. In this work, we introduce $Q\sharp$, a value-based algorithm for KL-regularized RL that guides the reference policy using the optimal regularized $Q$ function. We propose to learn the optimal $Q$ function using distributional RL on an aggregated online dataset. Unlike prior value-based baselines that guide the model using unregularized $Q$-values, our method is theoretically principled and provably learns the optimal policy for the KL-regularized RL problem. Empirically, $Q\sharp$ outperforms prior baselines in math reasoning benchmarks while maintaining a smaller KL divergence to the reference policy. Theoretically, we establish a reduction from KL-regularized RL to no-regret online learning, providing the first bounds for deterministic MDPs under only realizability. Thanks to distributional RL, our bounds are also variance-dependent and converge faster when the reference policy has small variance. In sum, our results highlight $Q\sharp$ as an effective approach for post-training LLMs, offering both improved performance and theoretical guarantees. The code can be found atthis https URL.

  Electronic Health Records (EHRs) offer considerable potential for clinical prediction, but their complexity and heterogeneity present significant challenges for traditional machine learning methods. Recently, domain-specific EHR foundation models trained on large volumes of unlabeled EHR data have shown improved predictive accuracy and generalization. However, their development is constrained by limited access to diverse, high-quality datasets, and inconsistencies in coding standards and clinical practices. In this study, we explore the use of general-purpose Large Language Models (LLMs) to encode EHR into high-dimensional representations for downstream clinical prediction tasks. We convert structured EHR data into Markdown-formatted plain-text documents by replacing medical codes with natural language descriptions. This enables the use of LLMs and their extensive semantic understanding and generalization capabilities as effective encoders of EHRs without requiring access to private medical training data. We show that LLM-based embeddings can often match or even surpass the performance of a specialized EHR foundation model, CLMBR-T-Base, across 15 diverse clinical tasks from the EHRSHOT benchmark. Critically, our approach requires no institution-specific training and can incorporate any medical code with a text description, whereas existing EHR foundation models operate on fixed vocabularies and can only process codes seen during pretraining. To demonstrate generalizability, we further evaluate the approach on the UK Biobank (UKB) cohort, out-of-domain for CLMBR-T-Base, whose fixed vocabulary covers only 16% of UKB codes. Notably, an LLM-based model achieves superior performance for prediction of disease onset, hospitalization, and mortality, indicating robustness to population and coding shifts.

I-RAVEN-X extends I-RAVEN by increasing operand complexity, attribute range, and introducing perceptual uncertainty. Compared to LLMs, empirical results show that LRMs achieve improved productivity and systematicity on longer reasoning relations and wider attribute ranges, respectively. However, LRMs are still significantly challenged by reasoning under uncertainty and cannot effectively explore multiple probabilistic outcomes.

  Tasks involving high-risk-high-return (HRHR) actions, such as obstacle crossing, often exhibit multimodal action distributions and stochastic returns. Most reinforcement learning (RL) methods assume unimodal Gaussian policies and rely on scalar-valued critics, which limits their effectiveness in HRHR settings. We formally define HRHR tasks and theoretically show that Gaussian policies cannot guarantee convergence to the optimal solution. To address this, we propose a reinforcement learning framework that (i) discretizes continuous action spaces to approximate multimodal distributions, (ii) employs entropy-regularized exploration to improve coverage of risky but rewarding actions, and (iii) introduces a dual-critic architecture for more accurate discrete value distribution estimation. The framework scales to high-dimensional action spaces, supporting complex control domains. Experiments on locomotion and manipulation benchmarks with high risks of failure demonstrate that our method outperforms baselines, underscoring the importance of explicitly modeling multimodality and risk in RL.

  Vehicle aerodynamics optimization has become critical for automotive electrification, where drag reduction directly determines electric vehicle range and energy efficiency. Traditional approaches face an intractable trade-off: computationally expensive Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations requiring weeks per design iteration, or simplified models that sacrifice production-grade accuracy. While machine learning offers transformative potential, existing datasets exhibit fundamental limitations -- inadequate mesh resolution, missing vehicle components, and validation errors exceeding 5% -- preventing deployment in industrial workflows. We present DrivAerStar, comprising 12,000 industrial-grade automotive CFD simulations generated using $\text{STAR-CCM+}^\unicode{xAE}$ software. The dataset systematically explores three vehicle configurations through 20 Computer Aided Design (CAD) parameters via Free Form Deformation (FFD) algorithms, including complete engine compartments and cooling systems with realistic internal airflow. DrivAerStar achieves wind tunnel validation accuracy below 1.04% -- a five-fold improvement over existing datasets -- through refined mesh strategies with strict wall $y^+$ control. Benchmarks demonstrate that models trained on this data achieve production-ready accuracy while reducing computational costs from weeks to minutes. This represents the first dataset bridging academic machine learning research and industrial CFD practice, establishing a new standard for data-driven aerodynamic optimization in automotive development. Beyond automotive applications, DrivAerStar demonstrates a paradigm for integrating high-fidelity physics simulations with Artificial Intelligence (AI) across engineering disciplines where computational constraints currently limit innovation.

  We present a compact, strictly causal benchmark for streaming clinical time series on the MIT--BIH Arrhythmia Database using per-second heart rate. Two tasks are studied under record-level, non-overlapping splits: near-term tachycardia risk (next ten seconds) and one-step heart rate forecasting. We compare a GRU-D (RNN) and a Transformer under matched training budgets against strong non-learned baselines. Evaluation is calibration-aware for classification and proper for forecasting, with temperature scaling and grouped bootstrap confidence intervals. On MIT-BIH, GRU-D slightly surpasses the Transformer for tachycardia risk, while the Transformer clearly lowers forecasting error relative to GRU-D and persistence. Our results show that, in longitudinal monitoring, model choice is task-dependent: compact RNNs remain competitive for short-horizon risk scoring, whereas compact Transformers deliver clearer gains for point forecasting.

  Reinforcement learning in large language models (LLMs) often relies on scalar rewards, a practice that discards valuable textual rationale buried in the rollouts, forcing the model to explore \textit{de novo} with each attempt and hindering sample efficiency. While LLMs can uniquely learn from language feedback provided in-context, naively integrating on-line experiences into RL training presents a paradox: feedback from the same problem risks information leakage and memorization, while feedback from different problems often leads to behavior collapse due to irrelevant context. To resolve this tension, we propose \textbf{Language-And-Numerical Policy Optimization (LANPO)}, a framework that cleanly separates the roles of feedback: language guides exploration, while numerical rewards drive optimization. LANPO builds a dynamic experience pool from past trials and introduces two principles to ensure feedback is effective: \emph{Reward-Agnostic Reflection} for safe intra-sample self-correction and \emph{Relevant Abstraction} to distill generalizable lessons from inter-sample experiences. Across mathematical reasoning benchmarks, LANPO enables 7B and 14B models to significantly outperform strong baselines trained with GRPO in test accuracy. Our work provides a robust method for integrating historical experiences into the LLM RL loop, creating more effective and data-efficient learning agents.

  The last decade has seen an upswing in interest and adoption of reinforcement learning (RL) techniques, in large part due to its demonstrated capabilities at performing certain tasks at "super-human levels". This has incentivized the community to prioritize research that demonstrates RL agent performance, often at the expense of research aimed at understanding their learning dynamics. Performance-focused research runs the risk of overfitting on academic benchmarks -- thereby rendering them less useful -- which can make it difficult to transfer proposed techniques to novel problems. Further, it implicitly diminishes work that does not push the performance-frontier, but aims at improving our understanding of these techniques. This paper argues two points: (i) RL research should stop focusing solely on demonstrating agent capabilities, and focus more on advancing the science and understanding of reinforcement learning; and (ii) we need to be more precise on how our benchmarks map to the underlying mathematical formalisms. We use the popular Arcade Learning Environment (ALE; Bellemare et al., 2013) as an example of a benchmark that, despite being increasingly considered "saturated", can be effectively used for developing this understanding, and facilitating the deployment of RL techniques in impactful real-world problems.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Domain Incremental Learning (DIL) is a continual learning sub-branch that aims to address never-ending arrivals of new domains without catastrophic forgetting problems. Despite the advent of parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) approaches, existing works create task-specific LoRAs overlooking shared knowledge across tasks. Inaccurate selection of task-specific LORAs during inference results in significant drops in accuracy, while existing works rely on linear or prototype-based classifiers, which have suboptimal generalization powers. Our paper proposes continual knowledge consolidation low rank adaptation (CONEC-LoRA) addressing the DIL problems. CONEC-LoRA is developed from consolidations between task-shared LORA to extract common knowledge and task-specific LORA to embrace domain-specific knowledge. Unlike existing approaches, CONEC-LoRA integrates the concept of a stochastic classifier whose parameters are sampled from a distribution, thus enhancing the likelihood of correct classifications. Last but not least, an auxiliary network is deployed to optimally predict the task-specific LoRAs for inferences and implements the concept of a different-depth network structure in which every layer is connected with a local classifier to take advantage of intermediate representations. This module integrates the ball-generator loss and transformation module to address the synthetic sample bias problem. Our rigorous experiments demonstrate the advantage of CONEC-LoRA over prior arts in 4 popular benchmark problems with over 5% margins.

  Neural operators have emerged as a powerful data-driven paradigm for solving Partial Differential Equations (PDEs), offering orders-of-magnitude acceleration over traditional solvers. However, existing approaches still suffer from limited accuracy and scalability, particularly on irregular domains where fluid flows exhibit rich multiscale structures. In this work, we introduce the Multiscale Neural Operator (MNO), a new architecture for Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) on three-dimensional (3D) unstructured point clouds. MNO explicitly decomposes information across three scales: a global dimension-shrinkage attention module for long-range dependencies, a local graph attention module for neighborhood-level interactions, and a micro point-wise attention module for fine-grained details. This design preserves multiscale inductive biases while remaining computationally efficient. We evaluate MNO on four diverse benchmarks, covering both steady-state and unsteady flow scenarios with up to 300K points. Across all tasks, MNO consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, reducing prediction errors by 5% to 40% and demonstrating improved robustness in challenging 3D CFD problems. Our results highlight the importance of explicit multiscale design for neural operators and establish MNO as a scalable framework for learning complex fluid dynamics on irregular domains.

  Recent works have shown that natural gradient methods can significantly outperform standard optimizers when training physics-informed neural networks (PINNs). In this paper, we analyze the training dynamics of PINNs optimized with ANaGRAM, a natural-gradient-inspired approach employing singular value decomposition with cutoff regularization. Building on this analysis, we propose a multi-cutoff adaptation strategy that further enhances ANaGRAM's performance. Experiments on benchmark PDEs validate the effectiveness of our method, which allows to reach machine precision on some experiments. To provide theoretical grounding, we develop a framework based on spectral theory that explains the necessity of regularization and extend previous shown connections with Green's functions theory.

  How do latent and inference time computations enable large language models (LLMs) to solve multi-step reasoning? We introduce a framework for tracing and steering algorithmic primitives that underlie model reasoning. Our approach links reasoning traces to internal activation patterns and evaluates algorithmic primitives by injecting them into residual streams and measuring their effect on reasoning steps and task performance. We consider four benchmarks: Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP), 3SAT, AIME, and graph navigation. We operationalize primitives by clustering neural activations and labeling their matched reasoning traces. We then apply function vector methods to derive primitive vectors as reusable compositional building blocks of reasoning. Primitive vectors can be combined through addition, subtraction, and scalar operations, revealing a geometric logic in activation space. Cross-task and cross-model evaluations (Phi-4, Phi-4-Reasoning, Llama-3-8B) show both shared and task-specific primitives. Notably, comparing Phi-4 with its reasoning-finetuned variant highlights compositional generalization after finetuning: Phi-4-Reasoning exhibits more systematic use of verification and path-generation primitives. Injecting the associated primitive vectors in Phi-4-Base induces behavioral hallmarks associated with Phi-4-Reasoning. Together, these findings demonstrate that reasoning in LLMs may be supported by a compositional geometry of algorithmic primitives, that primitives transfer cross-task and cross-model, and that reasoning finetuning strengthens algorithmic generalization across domains.

  Contemporary progress in large language models (LLMs) has revealed notable inferential capacities via reinforcement learning (RL) employing verifiable reward, facilitating the development of O1 and R1-like reasoning models. Directly training from base models with RL is called zero-RL. However, previous works rely upon activating LLMs' inherent capacities through fixed prompt templates. This strategy introduces substantial sampling inefficiencies for weak LLMs, as the majority of problems generate invalid outputs during accuracy-driven filtration in reasoning tasks, which causes a waste of samples. To solve this issue, we propose Cog-Rethinker, a novel hierarchical metacognitive RL framework for LLM reasoning. Our Cog-Rethinker mainly focuses on the rollout procedure in RL training. After the direct rollout, our Cog-Rethinker improves sample utilization in a hierarchical metacognitive two-stage framework. By leveraging human cognition during solving problems, firstly, it prompts policy to decompose zero-accuracy problems into subproblems to produce final reasoning results. Secondly, with zero-accuracy problems in previous rollout stage, it further prompts policy to refine these answers by referencing previous wrong solutions. Moreover, to enable cold-start of the two new reasoning patterns and maintain train-test consistency across prompt templates, our Cog-Rethinker applies supervised fine-tuning on the policy using correct samples of the two stages with direct rollout template. Experimental results demonstrate Cog-Rethinker's superior performance on various mathematical reasoning benchmarks, we also analyzed its improved sample efficiency that accelerates convergence compared to baseline methods.

  Reformulating nonlinear optimization problems is largely manual and expertise-intensive, yet it remains essential for solving such problems with linear optimization solvers or applying special-purpose algorithms. We introduce \textit{LinearizeLLM}, an agent-based framework that solves this task by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs). The framework assigns each nonlinear pattern to a \textit{reformulation agent} that is explicitly instructed to derive an exact linear reformulation for its nonlinearity pattern, for instance, absolute-value terms or bilinear products of decision variables. The agents then coordinate to assemble a solver-ready linear model equivalent to the original problem. To benchmark the approach, we create a dataset of 20 real-world nonlinear optimization problems derived from the established ComplexOR dataset of linear optimization problems. We evaluate our approach with several LLMs. Our results indicate that specialized LLM agents can automate linearization tasks, opening a path toward fully conversational modeling pipelines for nonlinear optimization.

  Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has become the standard approach for adapting large language models under limited compute and memory budgets. Although previous methods improve efficiency through low-rank updates, quantization, or heuristic budget reallocation, they often decouple the allocation of capacity from the way updates evolve during training. In this work, we introduce CTR-LoRA, a framework guided by curvature trust region that integrates rank scheduling with stability-aware optimization. CTR-LoRA allocates parameters based on marginal utility derived from lightweight second-order proxies and constrains updates using a Fisher/Hessian-metric trust region. Experiments on multiple open-source backbones (7B-13B), evaluated on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution benchmarks, show consistent improvements over strong PEFT baselines. In addition to increased accuracy, CTR-LoRA enhances training stability, reduces memory requirements, and achieves higher throughput, positioning it on the Pareto frontier of performance and efficiency. These results highlight a principled path toward more robust and deployable PEFT.

  The growing integration of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) models into high-stakes domains such as healthcare and scientific research calls for models that are not only accurate but also interpretable. Among the existing explainable methods, counterfactual explanations offer interpretability by identifying minimal changes to inputs that would alter a model's prediction, thus providing deeper insights. However, current counterfactual generation methods suffer from critical limitations, including gradient vanishing, discontinuous latent spaces, and an overreliance on the alignment between learned and true decision boundaries. To overcome these limitations, we propose LeapFactual, a novel counterfactual explanation algorithm based on conditional flow matching. LeapFactual generates reliable and informative counterfactuals, even when true and learned decision boundaries diverge. Following a model-agnostic approach, LeapFactual is not limited to models with differentiable loss functions. It can even handle human-in-the-loop systems, expanding the scope of counterfactual explanations to domains that require the participation of human annotators, such as citizen science. We provide extensive experiments on benchmark and real-world datasets showing that LeapFactual generates accurate and in-distribution counterfactual explanations that offer actionable insights. We observe, for instance, that our reliable counterfactual samples with labels aligning to ground truth can be beneficially used as new training data to enhance the model. The proposed method is broadly applicable and enhances both scientific knowledge discovery and non-expert interpretability.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We propose SDAR, a Synergistic Diffusion-Autoregression paradigm that unifies the training efficiency of autoregressive models with the parallel inference capability of diffusion. Instead of costly end-to-end diffusion training, SDAR performs a lightweight paradigm conversion that transforms a well-trained autoregressive (AR) model into a blockwise diffusion model through brief, data-efficient adaptation. During inference, SDAR generates sequences autoregressively across blocks for global coherence while decoding all tokens within each block in parallel via a discrete diffusion process. Extensive experiments show that AR models remain substantially more compute-efficient than masked diffusion models, providing a strong foundation for adaptation. Building on this insight, SDAR achieves efficient AR-to-diffusion conversion with minimal cost, preserving AR-level performance while enabling parallel generation. Scaling studies across dense and Mixture-of-Experts architectures confirm that SDAR scales without compromise: larger models exhibit stronger robustness to block size and decoding thresholds, yielding greater speedups without accuracy loss. Beyond efficiency, SDAR demonstrates enhanced reasoning and domain adaptability. Our 30B MoE model surpasses its AR counterpart on challenging scientific reasoning benchmarks such as GPQA and ChemBench, and gains further improvements under test-time scaling methods like majority voting and pass@k. Together, these results establish SDAR as a practical paradigm that combines the strengths of autoregression and diffusion for scalable, high-throughput reasoning.

  Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have underscored the potential of Reinforcement Learning (RL) to facilitate the emergence of reasoning capabilities. Despite the encouraging results, a fundamental dilemma persists as RL improvement relies on learning from high-quality samples, yet the exploration for such samples remains bounded by the inherent limitations of LLMs. This, in effect, creates an undesirable cycle in which what cannot be explored cannot be learned. In this work, we propose Rubric-Scaffolded Reinforcement Learning (RuscaRL), a novel instructional scaffolding framework designed to break the exploration bottleneck for general LLM reasoning. Specifically, RuscaRL introduces checklist-style rubrics as (1) explicit scaffolding for exploration during rollout generation, where different rubrics are provided as external guidance within task instructions to steer diverse high-quality responses. This guidance is gradually decayed over time, encouraging the model to internalize the underlying reasoning patterns; (2) verifiable rewards for exploitation during model training, where we can obtain robust LLM-as-a-Judge scores using rubrics as references, enabling effective RL on general reasoning tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed RuscaRL across various benchmarks, effectively expanding reasoning boundaries under the Best-of-N evaluation.

  Test-Time Scaling (TTS) improves the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) by using additional inference-time computation to explore multiple reasoning paths through search. Yet how to allocate a fixed rollout budget most effectively during search remains underexplored, often resulting in inefficient use of compute at test time. To bridge this gap, we formulate test-time search as a resource allocation problem and derive the optimal allocation strategy that maximizes the probability of obtaining a correct solution under a fixed rollout budget. Within this formulation, we reveal a core limitation of existing search methods: solution-level allocation tends to favor reasoning directions with more candidates, leading to theoretically suboptimal and inefficient use of compute. To address this, we propose Direction-Oriented Resource Allocation (DORA), a provably optimal method that mitigates this bias by decoupling direction quality from candidate count and allocating resources at the direction level. To demonstrate DORA's effectiveness, we conduct extensive experiments on challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks including MATH500, AIME2024, and AIME2025. The empirical results show that DORA consistently outperforms strong baselines with comparable computational cost, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy. We hope our findings contribute to a broader understanding of optimal TTS for LLMs.

  The high inference demands of transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) pose substantial challenges in their deployment. To this end, we introduce Neural Block Linearization (NBL), a novel framework for accelerating transformer model inference by replacing self-attention layers with linear approximations derived from Linear Minimum Mean Squared Error estimators. NBL leverages Canonical Correlation Analysis to compute a theoretical upper bound on the approximation error. Then, we use this bound as a criterion for substitution, selecting the LLM layers with the lowest linearization error. NBL can be efficiently applied to pre-trained LLMs without the need for fine-tuning. In experiments, NBL achieves notable computational speed-ups while preserving competitive accuracy on multiple reasoning benchmarks. For instance, applying NBL to 12 self-attention layers in DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B increases the inference speed by 32% with less than 1% accuracy trade-off, making it a flexible and promising solution to improve the inference efficiency of LLMs. The implementation is available at:this https URL.

  _Mete Erdogan, Cengiz Pehlevan, Alper T. Erdogan_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce Error Broadcast and Decorrelation (EBD), a novel learning framework for neural networks that addresses credit assignment by directly broadcasting output errors to individual layers, circumventing weight transport of backpropagation. EBD is rigorously grounded in the stochastic orthogonality property of Minimum Mean Square Error estimators. This fundamental principle states that the error of an optimal estimator is orthogonal to functions of the input. Guided by this insight, EBD defines layerwise loss functions that directly penalize correlations between layer activations and output errors, thereby establishing a principled foundation for error broadcasting. This theoretically sound mechanism naturally leads to the experimentally observed three-factor learning rule and integrates with biologically plausible frameworks to enhance performance and plausibility. Numerical experiments demonstrate EBD's competitive or better performance against other error-broadcast methods on benchmark datasets. Our findings establish EBD as an efficient, biologically plausible, and principled alternative for neural network training. The implementation is available at:this https URL.

  The urban environment is characterized by complex spatio-temporal dynamics arising from diverse human activities and interactions. Effectively modeling these dynamics is essential for understanding and optimizing urban systems. In this work, we introduce UrbanDiT, a foundation model for open-world urban spatio-temporal learning that successfully scales up diffusion transformers in this field. UrbanDiT pioneers a unified model that integrates diverse data sources and types while learning universal spatio-temporal patterns across different cities and scenarios. This allows the model to unify both multi-data and multi-task learning, and effectively support a wide range of spatio-temporal applications. Its key innovation lies in the elaborated prompt learning framework, which adaptively generates both data-driven and task-specific prompts, guiding the model to deliver superior performance across various urban applications. UrbanDiT offers three advantages: 1) It unifies diverse data types, such as grid-based and graph-based data, into a sequential format; 2) With task-specific prompts, it supports a wide range of tasks, including bi-directional spatio-temporal prediction, temporal interpolation, spatial extrapolation, and spatio-temporal imputation; and 3) It generalizes effectively to open-world scenarios, with its powerful zero-shot capabilities outperforming nearly all baselines with training data. UrbanDiT sets up a new benchmark for foundation models in the urban spatio-temporal domain. Code and datasets are publicly available atthis https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Black-box Large Language Models (LLMs) provide practical and accessible alternatives to other machine learning methods, as they require minimal labeled data and machine learning expertise to develop solutions for various decision making problems. However, for applications that need operating with constraints on specific metrics (e.g., precision $\geq$ 95%), decision making with black-box LLMs remains unfavorable, due to their low numerical output cardinalities. This results in limited control over their operating points, preventing fine-grained adjustment of their decision making behavior. In this paper, we study using black-box LLMs as classifiers, focusing on efficiently improving their operational granularity without performance loss. Specifically, we first investigate the reasons behind their low-cardinality numerical outputs and show that they are biased towards generating rounded but informative verbalized probabilities. Then, we experiment with standard prompt engineering, uncertainty estimation and confidence elicitation techniques, and observe that they do not effectively improve operational granularity without sacrificing performance or increasing inference cost. Finally, we propose efficient approaches to significantly increase the number and diversity of available operating points. Our proposed approaches provide finer-grained operating points and achieve comparable to or better performance than the benchmark methods across 11 datasets and 3 LLMs.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Long-tail imbalance is endemic to multi-label learning: a few head labels dominate the gradient signal, while the many rare labels that matter in practice are silently ignored. We tackle this problem by casting the task as a cooperative potential game. In our Curiosity-Driven Game-Theoretic Multi-Label Learning (CD-GTMLL) framework, the label space is split among several cooperating players that share a global accuracy payoff yet earn additional curiosity rewards that rise with label rarity and inter-player disagreement. These curiosity bonuses inject gradient on under-represented tags without hand-tuned class weights. We prove that gradient best-response updates ascend a differentiable potential and converge to tail-aware stationary points that tighten a lower bound on the expected Rare-F1. Extensive experiments on conventional benchmarks and three extreme-scale datasets show consistent state-of-the-art gains, delivering up to +4.3% Rare-F1 and +1.6% P@3 over the strongest baselines, while ablations reveal emergent division of labour and faster consensus on rare classes. CD-GTMLL thus offers a principled, scalable route to long-tail robustness in multi-label prediction.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) data is critical for machine learning, be it for safety reasons or to enable open-ended learning. However, beyond mere detection, choosing an appropriate course of action typically hinges on the type of OOD data encountered. Unfortunately, the latter is generally not distinguished in practice, as modern OOD detection methods collapse distributional shifts into single scalar outlier scores. This work argues that scalar-based methods are thus insufficient for OOD data to be properly contextualized and prospectively exploited, a limitation we overcome with the introduction of DISC: Diffusion-based Statistical Characterization. DISC leverages the iterative denoising process of diffusion models to extract a rich, multi-dimensional feature vector that captures statistical discrepancies across multiple noise levels. Extensive experiments on image and tabular benchmarks show that DISC matches or surpasses state-of-the-art detectors for OOD detection and, crucially, also classifies OOD type, a capability largely absent from prior work. As such, our work enables a shift from simple binary OOD detection to a more granular detection.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In recent years, deep neural networks have been extensively employed in perceptual systems to learn representations endowed with invariances, aiming to emulate the invariance mechanisms observed in the human brain. However, studies in the visual and auditory domains have confirmed that significant gaps remain between the invariance properties of artificial neural networks and those of humans. To investigate the invariance behavior within graph neural networks (GNNs), we introduce a model ``metamers'' generation technique. By optimizing input graphs such that their internal node activations match those of a reference graph, we obtain graphs that are equivalent in the model's representation space, yet differ significantly in both structure and node features. Our theoretical analysis focuses on two aspects: the local metamer dimension for a single node and the activation-induced volume change of the metamer manifold. Utilizing this approach, we uncover extreme levels of representational invariance across several classic GNN architectures. Although targeted modifications to model architecture and training strategies can partially mitigate this excessive invariance, they fail to fundamentally bridge the gap to human-like invariance. Finally, we quantify the deviation between metamer graphs and their original counterparts, revealing unique failure modes of current GNNs and providing a complementary benchmark for model evaluation.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Learning disentangled representations in sequential data is a key goal in deep learning, with broad applications in vision, audio, and time series. While real-world data involves multiple interacting semantic factors over time, prior work has mostly focused on simpler two-factor static and dynamic settings, primarily because such settings make data collection easier, thereby overlooking the inherently multi-factor nature of real-world data. We introduce the first standardized benchmark for evaluating multi-factor sequential disentanglement across six diverse datasets spanning video, audio, and time series. Our benchmark includes modular tools for dataset integration, model development, and evaluation metrics tailored to multi-factor analysis. We additionally propose a post-hoc Latent Exploration Stage to automatically align latent dimensions with semantic factors, and introduce a Koopman-inspired model that achieves state-of-the-art results. Moreover, we show that Vision-Language Models can automate dataset annotation and serve as zero-shot disentanglement evaluators, removing the need for manual labels and human intervention. Together, these contributions provide a robust and scalable foundation for advancing multi-factor sequential disentanglement.

  Transformers have achieved remarkable success in time series modeling, yet their internal mechanisms remain opaque. This work demystifies the Transformer encoder by establishing its fundamental equivalence to a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN). We show that in the forward pass, the attention distribution matrix serves as a dynamic adjacency matrix, and its composition with subsequent transformations performs computations analogous to graph convolution. Moreover, we demonstrate that in the backward pass, the update dynamics of value and feed-forward projections mirror those of GCN parameters. Building on this unified theoretical reinterpretation, we propose \textbf{Fighter} (Flexible Graph Convolutional Transformer), a streamlined architecture that removes redundant linear projections and incorporates multi-hop graph aggregation. This perspective yields an explicit and interpretable representation of temporal dependencies across different scales, naturally expressed as graph edges. Experiments on standard forecasting benchmarks confirm that Fighter achieves competitive performance while providing clearer mechanistic interpretability of its predictions.

  In the same way that generative models today conduct most of their training in a self-supervised fashion, how can agentic models conduct their training in a self-supervised fashion, interactively exploring, learning, and preparing to quickly adapt to new tasks? A prerequisite for embodied agents deployed in real world interactions ought to be training with interaction, yet today's most successful AI models (e.g., VLMs, LLMs) are trained without an explicit notion of action. The problem of pure exploration (which assumes no data as input) is well studied in the reinforcement learning literature and provides agents with a wide array of experiences, yet it fails to prepare them for rapid adaptation to new tasks. Today's language and vision models are trained on data provided by humans, which provides a strong inductive bias for the sorts of tasks that the model will have to solve (e.g., modeling chords in a song, phrases in a sonnet, sentences in a medical record). However, when they are prompted to solve a new task, there is a faulty tacit assumption that humans spend most of their time in the most rewarding states. The key contribution of our paper is a method for pre-training interactive agents in a self-supervised fashion, so that they can instantly mimic human demonstrations. Our method treats goals (i.e., observations) as the atomic construct. During training, our method automatically proposes goals and practices reaching them, building off prior work in reinforcement learning exploration. During evaluation, our method solves an (amortized) inverse reinforcement learning problem to explain demonstrations as optimal goal-reaching behavior. Experiments on standard benchmarks (not designed for goal-reaching) show that our approach outperforms prior methods for zero-shot imitation.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promising capabilities for tackling complex reasoning tasks, including optimization problems. However, existing methods either rely on prompt engineering, which leads to poor generalization across problem types, or require costly supervised training. We introduce SolverLLM, a training-free framework that leverages test-time scaling to solve diverse optimization problems. Rather than solving directly, SolverLLM generates mathematical formulations and translates them into solver-ready code, guided by a novel Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) strategy. To enhance the search process, we modify classical MCTS with (1) dynamic expansion for adaptive formulation generation, (2) prompt backpropagation to guide exploration via outcome-driven feedback, and (3) uncertainty backpropagation to incorporate reward reliability into decision-making. Experiments on six standard benchmark datasets demonstrate that SolverLLM outperforms both prompt-based and learning-based baselines, achieving strong generalization without additional training.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Data selection improves computational efficiency by choosing informative subsets of training samples. However, existing methods ignore the compute budget, treating data selection and importance evaluation independently of compute budget constraints. Yet empirical studies show no algorithm can consistently outperform others (or even random selection) across varying budgets. We therefore argue that compute budget must be integral to data-selection strategies, since different budgets impose distinct requirements on data quantity, quality, and distribution for effective training. To this end, we propose a novel Computational budget-Aware Data Selection (CADS) method and naturally formulate it into a bilevel optimization framework, where the inner loop trains the model within the constraints of the computational budget on some selected subset of training data, while the outer loop optimizes data selection based on model evaluation. Our technical contributions lie in addressing two main challenges in solving this bilevel optimization problem: the expensive Hessian matrix estimation for outer-loop gradients and the computational burden of achieving inner-loop optimality during iterations. To solve the first issue, we propose a probabilistic reparameterization strategy and compute the gradient using a Hessian-free policy gradient estimator. To address the second challenge, we transform the inner optimization problem into a penalty term in the outer objective, further discovering that we only need to estimate the minimum of a one-dimensional loss to calculate the gradient, significantly improving efficiency. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves performance gains of up to 14.42% over baselines in vision and language benchmarks.

  Enhancing scene understanding in adverse visibility conditions remains a critical challenge for surveillance and autonomous navigation systems. Conventional imaging modalities, such as RGB and thermal infrared (MWIR / LWIR), when fused, often struggle to deliver comprehensive scene information, particularly under conditions of atmospheric interference or inadequate illumination. To address these limitations, Short-Wave Infrared (SWIR) imaging has emerged as a promising modality due to its ability to penetrate atmospheric disturbances and differentiate materials with improved clarity. However, the advancement and widespread implementation of SWIR-based systems face significant hurdles, primarily due to the scarcity of publicly accessible SWIR datasets. In response to this challenge, our research introduces an approach to synthetically generate SWIR-like structural/contrast cues (without claiming spectral reproduction) images from existing LWIR data using advanced contrast enhancement techniques. We then propose a multimodal fusion framework integrating synthetic SWIR, LWIR, and RGB modalities, employing an optimized encoder-decoder neural network architecture with modality-specific encoders and a softmax-gated fusion head. Comprehensive experiments on public RGB-LWIR benchmarks (M3FD, TNO, CAMEL, MSRS, RoadScene) and an additional private real RGB-MWIR-SWIR dataset demonstrate that our synthetic-SWIR-enhanced fusion framework improves fused-image quality (contrast, edge definition, structural fidelity) while maintaining real-time performance. We also add fair trimodal baselines (LP, LatLRR, GFF) and cascaded trimodal variants of U2Fusion/SwinFusion under a unified protocol. The outcomes highlight substantial potential for real-world applications in surveillance and autonomous systems.

  Signal Temporal Logic (STL) inference seeks to extract human-interpretable rules from time-series data, but existing methods lack formal confidence guarantees for the inferred rules. Conformal prediction (CP) is a technique that can provide statistical correctness guarantees, but is typically applied as a post-training wrapper without improving model learning. Instead, we introduce an end-to-end differentiable CP framework for STL inference that enhances both reliability and interpretability of the resulting formulas. We introduce a robustness-based nonconformity score, embed a smooth CP layer directly into training, and employ a new loss function that simultaneously optimizes inference accuracy and CP prediction sets with a single term. Following training, an exact CP procedure delivers statistical guarantees for the learned STL formulas. Experiments on benchmark time-series tasks show that our approach reduces uncertainty in predictions (i.e., it achieves high coverage while reducing prediction set size), and improves accuracy (i.e., the number of misclassifications when using a fixed threshold) over state-of-the-art baselines.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Cross-domain generalization is very important in Time Series Forecasting because similar historical information may lead to distinct future trends due to the domain-specific characteristics. Recent works focus on building unimodal time series foundation models and end-to-end multimodal supervised models. Since domain-specific knowledge is often contained in modalities like texts, the former lacks the explicit utilization of them, thus hindering the performance. The latter is tailored for end-to-end scenarios and does not support zero-shot inference for cross-domain scenarios. In this work, we introduce Aurora, a Multimodal Time Series Foundation Model, which supports multimodal inputs and zero-shot inference. Pretrained on Corss-domain Multimodal Time Series Corpus, Aurora can adaptively extract and focus on key domain knowledge contained in corrsponding text or image modalities, thus possessing strong Cross-domain generalization capability. Through tokenization, encoding, and distillation, Aurora can extract multimodal domain knowledge as guidance and then utilizes a Modality-Guided Multi-head Self-Attention to inject them into the modeling of temporal representations. In the decoding phase, the multimodal representations are used to generate the conditions and prototypes of future tokens, contributing to a novel Prototype-Guided Flow Matching for generative probabilistic forecasting. Comprehensive experiments on well-recognized benchmarks, including TimeMMD, TSFM-Bench and ProbTS, demonstrate the consistent state-of-the-art performance of Aurora on both unimodal and multimodal scenarios.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Forecasting chaotic dynamics beyond a few Lyapunov times is difficult because infinitesimal errors grow exponentially. Existing Echo State Networks (ESNs) mitigate this growth but employ reservoirs whose Euclidean geometry is mismatched to the stretch-and-fold structure of chaos. We introduce the Hyperbolic Embedding Reservoir (HypER), an ESN whose neurons are sampled in the Poincare ball and whose connections decay exponentially with hyperbolic distance. This negative-curvature construction embeds an exponential metric directly into the latent space, aligning the reservoir's local expansion-contraction spectrum with the system's Lyapunov directions while preserving standard ESN features such as sparsity, leaky integration, and spectral-radius control. Training is limited to a Tikhonov-regularized readout. On the chaotic Lorenz-63 and Roessler systems, and the hyperchaotic Chen-Ueta attractor, HypER consistently lengthens the mean valid-prediction horizon beyond Euclidean and graph-structured ESN baselines, with statistically significant gains confirmed over 30 independent runs; parallel results on real-world benchmarks, including heart-rate variability from the Santa Fe and MIT-BIH datasets and international sunspot numbers, corroborate its advantage. We further establish a lower bound on the rate of state divergence for HypER, mirroring Lyapunov growth.

  Transformers are the de-facto choice for sequence modelling, yet their quadratic self-attention and weak temporal bias can make long-range forecasting both expensive and brittle. We introduce FreezeTST, a lightweight hybrid that interleaves frozen random-feature (reservoir) blocks with standard trainable Transformer layers. The frozen blocks endow the network with rich nonlinear memory at no optimisation cost; the trainable layers learn to query this memory through self-attention. The design cuts trainable parameters and also lowers wall-clock training time, while leaving inference complexity unchanged. On seven standard long-term forecasting benchmarks, FreezeTST consistently matches or surpasses specialised variants such as Informer, Autoformer, and PatchTST; with substantially lower compute. Our results show that embedding reservoir principles within Transformers offers a simple, principled route to efficient long-term time-series prediction.

  Alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs) typically relies on Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) with gradient-based optimizers such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) or Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). While effective, these methods require complex distributed training, large memory budgets, and careful hyperparameter tuning, all of which become increasingly difficult at billion-parameter scale. We present ESSA, Evolutionary Strategies for Scalable Alignment, a gradient-free framework that aligns LLMs using only forward inference and black-box optimization. ESSA focuses optimization on Low-Rank Adapters (LoRA) and further compresses their parameter space by optimizing only the singular values from an SVD decomposition of each adapter matrix. This dimensionality reduction makes evolutionary search practical even for very large models and allows efficient operation in quantized INT4 and INT8 inference mode. Across these benchmarks ESSA improves the test accuracy of Qwen2.5-Math-7B by 12.6% on GSM8K and 14.8% on PRM800K, and raises the accuracy of LLaMA3.1-8B on IFEval by 22.5%, all compared with GRPO. In large-scale settings ESSA shows stronger scaling than gradient-based methods: on Qwen2.5-32B for PRM800K it reaches near-optimal accuracy twice as fast on 16 GPUs and six times as fast on 128 GPUs compared with GRPO. These results position evolutionary strategies as a compelling, hardware-friendly alternative to gradient-based LLM alignment, combining competitive quality with substantially reduced wall-clock time and engineering overhead.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Heterogeneous graph neural networks have seen rapid progress in web applications such as social networks, knowledge graphs, and recommendation systems, driven by the inherent heterogeneity of web data. However, existing methods typically assume static graphs, while real-world graphs are continuously evolving. This dynamic nature requires models to adapt to new data while preserving existing knowledge. To this end, this work introduces HERO (HEterogeneous continual gRaph learning via meta-knOwledge distillation), a unified framework for continual learning on heterogeneous graphs. HERO employs meta-adaptation, a gradient-based meta-learning strategy that provides directional guidance for rapid adaptation to new tasks with limited samples. To enable efficient and effective knowledge reuse, we propose DiSCo (Diversity Sampling with semantic Consistency), a heterogeneity-aware sampling method that maximizes target node diversity and expands subgraphs along metapaths, retaining critical semantic and structural information with minimal overhead. Furthermore, HERO incorporates heterogeneity-aware knowledge distillation, which aligns knowledge at both the node and semantic levels to balance adaptation and retention across tasks. Extensive experiments on four web-related heterogeneous graph benchmarks demonstrate that HERO substantially mitigates catastrophic forgetting while achieving efficient and consistent knowledge reuse in dynamic web environments.

  Model merging provides a scalable alternative to multi-task training by combining specialized finetuned models through parameter arithmetic, enabling efficient deployment without the need for joint training or access to all task data. While recent methods have shown promise, existing evaluations are limited in both model scale and task diversity, leaving open questions about their applicability to large, domain-specialized LLMs. To tackle the challenges, we introduce MergeBench, a comprehensive evaluation suite designed to assess model merging at scale. MergeBench builds on state-of-the-art open-source language models, including Llama and Gemma families at 2B to 9B scales, and covers five key domains: instruction following, mathematics, multilingual understanding, coding and safety. We standardize finetuning and evaluation protocols, and assess eight representative merging methods across multi-task performance, forgetting and runtime efficiency. Based on extensive experiments, we provide practical guidelines for algorithm selection and share insights showing that model merging tends to perform better on stronger base models, with techniques such as merging coefficient tuning and sparsification improving knowledge retention. However, several challenges remain, including the computational cost on large models, the gap for in-domain performance compared to multi-task models, and the underexplored role of model merging in standard LLM training pipelines. We hope MergeBench provides a foundation for future research to advance the understanding and practical application of model merging. Our project page is at \href{this https URL}{this https URL}.

  In domains such as molecular and protein generation, physical systems exhibit inherent symmetries that are critical to model. Two main strategies have emerged for learning invariant distributions: designing equivariant network architectures and using data augmentation to approximate equivariance. While equivariant architectures preserve symmetry by design, they often involve greater complexity and pose optimization challenges. Data augmentation, on the other hand, offers flexibility but may fall short in fully capturing symmetries. Our framework enhances both approaches by reducing training variance and providing a provably lower-variance gradient estimator. We achieve this by interpreting data augmentation as a Monte Carlo estimator of the training gradient and applying Rao-Blackwellization. This leads to more stable optimization, faster convergence, and reduced variance, all while requiring only a single forward and backward pass per sample. We also present a practical implementation of this estimator incorporating the loss and sampling procedure through a method we call Orbit Diffusion. Theoretically, we guarantee that our loss admits equivariant minimizers. Empirically, Orbit Diffusion achieves state-of-the-art results on GEOM-QM9 for molecular conformation generation, improves crystal structure prediction, and advances text-guided crystal generation on the Perov-5 and MP-20 benchmarks. Additionally, it enhances protein designability in protein structure generation. Code is available at:this https URL.

  Electroencephalograph (EEG) is a crucial tool for studying brain activity. Recently, self-supervised learning methods leveraging large unlabeled datasets have emerged as a potential solution to the scarcity of widely available annotated EEG data. However, current methods suffer from at least one of the following limitations: i) sub-optimal EEG signal modeling, ii) model sizes in the hundreds of millions of trainable parameters, and iii) reliance on private datasets and/or inconsistent public benchmarks, hindering reproducibility. To address these challenges, we introduce a Compact Encoder for Representations of Brain Oscillations using alternating attention (CEReBrO), a new small EEG foundation model. Our tokenization scheme represents EEG signals at a per-channel patch granularity. We propose an alternating attention mechanism that jointly models intra-channel temporal dynamics and inter-channel spatial correlations, achieving 2x speed improvement with 6x less memory required compared to standard self-attention. We present several model sizes ranging from 3.6 million to 85 million parameters. Pre-trained on over 20,000 hours of publicly available scalp EEG recordings with diverse channel configurations, our models set new benchmarks in emotion detection and seizure detection tasks, with competitive performance in anomaly classification and gait prediction. This validates our models' effectiveness and efficiency.

  Traffic data imputation is a critical preprocessing step in intelligent transportation systems, underpinning the reliability of downstream transportation services. Despite substantial progress in imputation models, model selection and development for practical applications remains challenging due to three key gaps: 1) the absence of a model taxonomy for traffic data imputation to trace the technological development and highlight their distinct features. 2) the lack of unified benchmarking pipeline for fair and reproducible model evaluation across standardized traffic datasets. 3) insufficient in-depth analysis that jointly compare models across multiple dimensions, including effectiveness, computational efficiency and robustness. To this end, this paper proposes practice-oriented taxonomies for traffic data missing patterns and imputation models, systematically cataloging real-world traffic data loss scenarios and analyzing the characteristics of existing models. We further introduce a unified benchmarking pipeline to comprehensively evaluate 11 representative models across various missing patterns and rates, assessing overall performance, performance under challenging scenarios, computational efficiency, and providing visualizations. This work aims to provide a holistic perspective on traffic data imputation and to serve as a practical guideline for model selection and application in intelligent transportation systems.

  Vision-language models (VLMs) excel in visual understanding but often lack reliable grounding capabilities and actionable inference rates. Integrating them with open-vocabulary object detection (OVD), instance segmentation, and tracking leverages their strengths while mitigating these drawbacks. We utilize VLM-generated structured descriptions to identify visible object instances, collect application-relevant attributes, and inform an open-vocabulary detector to extract corresponding bounding boxes that are passed to a video segmentation model providing segmentation masks and tracking. Once initialized, this model directly extracts segmentation masks, processing image streams in real time with minimal computational overhead. Tracks can be updated online as needed by generating new structured descriptions and detections. This combines the descriptive power of VLMs with the grounding capability of OVD and the pixel-level understanding and speed of video segmentation. Our evaluation across datasets and robotics platforms demonstrates the broad applicability of this approach, showcasing its ability to extract task-specific attributes from non-standard objects in dynamic environments.

  Deploying real-time spatial perception on edge devices requires efficient multi-task models that leverage complementary task information while minimizing computational overhead. This paper introduces Multi-Mono-Hydra (M2H), a novel multi-task learning framework designed for semantic segmentation and depth, edge, and surface normal estimation from a single monocular image. Unlike conventional approaches that rely on independent single-task models or shared encoder-decoder architectures, M2H introduces a Window-Based Cross-Task Attention Module that enables structured feature exchange while preserving task-specific details, improving prediction consistency across tasks. Built on a lightweight ViT-based DINOv2 backbone, M2H is optimized for real-time deployment and serves as the foundation for monocular spatial perception systems supporting 3D scene graph construction in dynamic environments. Comprehensive evaluations show that M2H outperforms state-of-the-art multi-task models on NYUDv2, surpasses single-task depth and semantic baselines on Hypersim, and achieves superior performance on the Cityscapes dataset, all while maintaining computational efficiency on laptop hardware. Beyond benchmarks, M2H is validated on real-world data, demonstrating its practicality in spatial perception tasks.

  Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) excel at understanding videos in-context, provided they have full access to the video when answering queries. However, these models face challenges in streaming scenarios where hour-long videos must be processed online, and questions need timely responses. In this work, we propose a training-free approach compatible with standard Video-LLMs, leveraging three key concepts: 1) LLM-informed selection of visual tokens to identify those that the LLM has attended to and contributed to its understanding of each short clip. Our attention-based selection allows us to discard up to ~95% of unimportant visual tokens with minimal performance loss; 2) Recurrent processing of past selected tokens to generate temporally coherent understanding of each processed clip; 3) Caption-based question answering for lightweight and accurate responses. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on streaming video benchmarks, striking a balance between efficiency and effectiveness.

  Distribution shifts between training and testing samples frequently occur in practice and impede model generalization performance. This crucial challenge thereby motivates studies on domain generalization (DG), which aim to predict the label on unseen target domain data by solely using data from source domains. It is intuitive to conceive the class-separated representations learned in contrastive learning (CL) are able to improve DG, while the reality is quite the opposite: users observe directly applying CL deteriorates the performance. We analyze the phenomenon with the insights from CL theory and discover lack of intra-class connectivity in the DG setting causes the deficiency. We thus propose a new paradigm, domain-connecting contrastive learning (DCCL), to enhance the conceptual connectivity across domains and obtain generalizable representations for DG. On the data side, more aggressive data augmentation and cross-domain positive samples are introduced to improve intra-class connectivity. On the model side, to better embed the unseen test domains, we propose model anchoring to exploit the intra-class connectivity in pre-trained representations and complement the anchoring with generative transformation loss. Extensive experiments on five standard DG benchmarks are performed. The results verify that DCCL outperforms state-of-the-art baselines even without domain supervision.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  A dominant assumption in Multimodal Language Model (MLLM) research is that its performance is largely inherited from the LLM backbone, given its immense parameter scale and remarkable capabilities. This has created a void in the understanding of the vision encoder, which determines how MLLMs perceive images. The recent shift in MLLM training paradigms, from Supervised Finetuning (SFT) to Reinforcement Learning (RL), magnifies this oversight-namely, the significant lack of analysis on how such training reshapes the vision encoder as well as the MLLM. To address this, we first investigate the impact of training strategies on MLLMs, where RL shows a clear advantage over SFT in strongly vision-related VQA benchmarks. Motivated by this, we conduct a critical yet under-explored analysis of the vision encoder of MLLMs through diverse and in-depth experiments, ranging from ImageNet classification and segmentation to gradient visualization. Our results demonstrate that MLLM's post-training strategy (i.e., SFT or RL) not only leads to distinct outcomes on MLLM downstream tasks, but also fundamentally reshapes MLLM's underlying visual representations. Specifically, the key finding of our study is that RL produces stronger and precisely localized visual representations compared to SFT, boosting the ability of the vision encoder for MLLM. We then reframe our findings into a simple recipe for building strong vision encoders for MLLMs, Preference-Instructed Vision OpTimization (PIVOT). When integrated into MLLMs, a PIVOT-trained vision encoder outperforms even larger and more heavily-trained counterparts, despite requiring less than 1% of the computational cost of standard vision pretraining. This result opens an effective and efficient path for advancing the vision backbones of MLLMs. Project page available atthis https URL

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In recent years, tensor decomposition-based approaches for hyperspectral anomaly detection (HAD) have gained significant attention in the field of remote sensing. However, existing methods often fail to fully leverage both the global correlations and local smoothness of the background components in hyperspectral images (HSIs), which exist in both the spectral and spatial domains. This limitation results in suboptimal detection performance. To mitigate this critical issue, we put forward a novel HAD method named HAD-EUNTRFR, which incorporates an enhanced unified nonconvex tensor ring (TR) factors regularization. In the HAD-EUNTRFR framework, the raw HSIs are first decomposed into background and anomaly components. The TR decomposition is then employed to capture the spatial-spectral correlations within the background component. Additionally, we introduce a unified and efficient nonconvex regularizer, induced by tensor singular value decomposition (TSVD), to simultaneously encode the low-rankness and sparsity of the 3-D gradient TR factors into a unique concise form. The above characterization scheme enables the interpretable gradient TR factors to inherit the low-rankness and smoothness of the original background. To further enhance anomaly detection, we design a generalized nonconvex regularization term to exploit the group sparsity of the anomaly component. To solve the resulting doubly nonconvex model, we develop a highly efficient optimization algorithm based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) framework. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches in terms of detection accuracy.

  Open-Vocabulary object detectors can generalize to an unrestricted set of categories through simple textual prompting. However, adapting these models to rare classes or reinforcing their abilities on multiple specialized domains remains essential. While recent methods rely on monolithic adaptation strategies with a single set of weights, we embrace modular deep learning. We introduce DitHub, a framework designed to build and maintain a library of efficient adaptation modules. Inspired by Version Control Systems, DitHub manages expert modules as branches that can be fetched and merged as needed. This modular approach allows us to conduct an in-depth exploration of the compositional properties of adaptation modules, marking the first such study in Object Detection. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the ODinW-13 benchmark and ODinW-O, a newly introduced benchmark designed to assess class reappearance.

  Large language models (LLMs) increasingly rely on long-context modeling for tasks such as document understanding, code analysis, and multi-step reasoning. However, scaling context windows to the million-token level brings prohibitive computational and memory costs, limiting the practicality of long-context LLMs. In this work, we take a different perspective-visual context scaling-to tackle this challenge. Instead of extending token-based sequences, we propose Glyph, a framework that renders long texts into images and processes them with vision-language models (VLMs). This approach substantially compresses textual input while preserving semantic information, and we further design an LLM-driven genetic search to identify optimal visual rendering configurations for balancing accuracy and compression. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our method achieves 3-4x token compression while maintaining accuracy comparable to leading LLMs such as Qwen3-8B on various long-context benchmarks. This compression also leads to around 4x faster prefilling and decoding, and approximately 2x faster SFT training. Furthermore, under extreme compression, a 128K-context VLM could scale to handle 1M-token-level text tasks. In addition, the rendered text data benefits real-world multimodal tasks, such as document understanding. Our code and model are released atthis https URL.

  Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) increasingly support dynamic image resolutions. However, current evaluation paradigms primarily assess semantic performance, overlooking the critical question of resolution robustness - whether performance remains stable across varying input resolutions. To address this gap, we introduce \textbf{Res-Bench}, a comprehensive benchmark comprising 14,400 samples across 12 resolution levels and six core capability dimensions. We designed a novel evaluation framework that goes beyond traditional accuracy metrics to capture performance stability. This framework introduces multiple robustness metrics: Spearman's correlation for assessing resolution-performance trends, and Absolute/Relative Continuous Error (ACE/RCE) for measuring performance volatility. Using these metrics, we conducted a large-scale evaluation of leading MLLMs. Our analysis encompasses: (1) model-centric and task-centric robustness examination, (2) investigation of preprocessing strategies including padding and super-resolution, and (3) exploration of fine-tuning for stability enhancement.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  With the rapid progress of large language models (LLMs), multimodal frameworks that unify understanding and generation have become promising, yet they face increasing complexity as the number of modalities and tasks grows. We observe that motion quantization introduces approximation errors that cap motion quality, and that unifying discrete text and continuous motion within a single-stream backbone amplifies cross-modal interference. Motivated by recent multi-branch Transformer designs that separate signals from different modalities, we propose MotionGPT3, a bimodal motion-language model for both understanding and generation. MotionGPT3 encodes raw motion into a continuous latent space using a variational autoencoder (VAE), thereby avoiding quantization-induced artifacts, while leveraging the semantic prior of pretrained language models. A dual-stream Transformer with shared attention preserves modality-specific routes while enabling controlled, bidirectional information flow, which reduces interference, stabilizing optimization, and empirically accelerates convergence without degrading fidelity. For multimodal joint training, a generate-then-align three-stage schedule further improves stability and limits cross-task interference. Experiments show that MotionGPT3 achieves 2x faster convergence in training loss and up to 4x faster convergence in validation, while maintaining state-of-the-art performance on standard motion understanding and motion generation benchmarks.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) frequently hallucinate by over-committing to spurious visual cues. Prior remedies-Visual and Instruction Contrastive Decoding (VCD, ICD)-mitigate this issue, yet the mechanism remains opaque. We first empirically show that their improvements systematically coincide with redistributions of cross-modal attention. Building on this insight, we propose Attention-Steerable Contrastive Decoding (ASCD), which directly steers the attention scores during decoding. ASCD combines (i) positive steering, which amplifies automatically mined text-centric heads-stable within a model and robust across domains-with (ii) negative steering, which dampens on-the-fly identified critical visual tokens. The method incurs negligible runtime and memory overhead and requires no additional training. Across five MLLM backbones and three decoding schemes, ASCD reduces hallucination on POPE, CHAIR, and MMHal-Bench by up to 38.2 percent while improving accuracy on standard VQA benchmarks, including MMMU, MM-VET, ScienceQA, TextVQA, and GQA. These results position attention steering as a simple, model-agnostic, and principled route to safer, more faithful multimodal generation.

  The increasing deployment of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) raises safety concerns under potential malicious inputs. However, existing multimodal safety evaluations primarily focus on model vulnerabilities exposed by static image inputs, ignoring the temporal dynamics of video that may induce distinct safety risks. To bridge this gap, we introduce Video-SafetyBench, the first comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the safety of LVLMs under video-text attacks. It comprises 2,264 video-text pairs spanning 48 fine-grained unsafe categories, each pairing a synthesized video with either a harmful query, which contains explicit malice, or a benign query, which appears harmless but triggers harmful behavior when interpreted alongside the video. To generate semantically accurate videos for safety evaluation, we design a controllable pipeline that decomposes video semantics into subject images (what is shown) and motion text (how it moves), which jointly guide the synthesis of query-relevant videos. To effectively evaluate uncertain or borderline harmful outputs, we propose RJScore, a novel LLM-based metric that incorporates the confidence of judge models and human-aligned decision threshold calibration. Extensive experiments show that benign-query video composition achieves average attack success rates of 67.2%, revealing consistent vulnerabilities to video-induced attacks. We believe Video-SafetyBench will catalyze future research into video-based safety evaluation and defense strategies.

  Trustworthy AI is mandatory for the broad deployment of autonomous vehicles. Although end-to-end approaches derive control commands directly from raw data, interpreting these decisions remains challenging, especially in complex urban scenarios. This is mainly attributed to very deep neural networks with non-linear decision boundaries, making it challenging to grasp the logic behind AI-driven decisions. This paper presents a method to enhance interpretability while optimizing control commands in autonomous driving. To address this, we propose loss functions that promote the interpretability of our model by generating sparse and localized feature maps. The feature activations allow us to explain which image regions contribute to the predicted control command. We conduct comprehensive ablation studies on the feature extraction step and validate our method on the CARLA benchmarks. We also demonstrate that our approach improves interpretability, which correlates with reducing infractions, yielding a safer, high-performance driving model. Notably, our monocular, non-ensemble model surpasses the top-performing approaches from the CARLA Leaderboard by achieving lower infraction scores and the highest route completion rate, all while ensuring interpretability.

  Visual reinforcement learning (RL) is challenging due to the need to extract useful representations from high-dimensional inputs while learning effective control from sparse and noisy rewards. Although large perception models exist, integrating them effectively into RL for visual generalization and improved sample efficiency remains difficult. We propose SegDAC, a Segmentation-Driven Actor-Critic method. SegDAC uses Segment Anything (SAM) for object-centric decomposition and YOLO-World to ground the image segmentation process via text inputs. It includes a novel transformer-based architecture that supports a dynamic number of segments at each time step and effectively learns which segments to focus on using online RL, without using human labels. By evaluating SegDAC over a challenging visual generalization benchmark using Maniskill3, which covers diverse manipulation tasks under strong visual perturbations, we demonstrate that SegDAC achieves significantly better visual generalization, doubling prior performance on the hardest setting and matching or surpassing prior methods in sample efficiency across all evaluated tasks.

  The development of computer-assisted surgery systems depends on large-scale, annotated datasets. Current resources for cataract surgery often lack the diversity and annotation depth needed to train generalizable deep-learning models. To address this gap, we present a dataset of 3,000 phacoemulsification cataract surgery videos from two surgical centers, performed by surgeons with a range of experience levels. This resource is enriched with four annotation layers: temporal surgical phases, instance segmentation of instruments and anatomical structures, instrument-tissue interaction tracking, and quantitative skill scores based on the established competency rubrics like the ICO-OSCAR. The technical quality of the dataset is supported by a series of benchmarking experiments for key surgical AI tasks, including workflow recognition, scene segmentation, and automated skill assessment. Furthermore, we establish a domain adaptation baseline for the phase recognition task by training a model on a subset of surgical centers and evaluating its performance on a held-out center.

  Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) are making rapid progress toward general-purpose embodied agents. However, current training pipelines primarily rely on high-level vision-sound-text pairs and lack fine-grained, structured alignment between pixel-level visual content and textual semantics. To overcome this challenge, we propose ESCA, a new framework for contextualizing embodied agents through structured spatial-temporal understanding. At its core is SGClip, a novel CLIP-based, open-domain, and promptable model for generating scene graphs. SGClip is trained on 87K+ open-domain videos via a neurosymbolic learning pipeline, which harnesses model-driven self-supervision from video-caption pairs and structured reasoning, thereby eliminating the need for human-labeled scene graph annotations. We demonstrate that SGClip supports both prompt-based inference and task-specific fine-tuning, excelling in scene graph generation and action localization benchmarks. ESCA with SGClip consistently improves both open-source and commercial MLLMs, achieving state-of-the-art performance across two embodied environments. Notably, it significantly reduces agent perception errors and enables open-source models to surpass proprietary baselines.

  The rapid advancement of generative AI enables highly realistic synthetic videos, posing significant challenges for content authentication and raising urgent concerns about misuse. Existing detection methods often struggle with generalization and capturing subtle temporal inconsistencies. We propose ReStraV(Representation Straightening Video), a novel approach to distinguish natural from AI-generated videos. Inspired by the "perceptual straightening" hypothesis -- which suggests real-world video trajectories become more straight in neural representation domain -- we analyze deviations from this expected geometric property. Using a pre-trained self-supervised vision transformer (DINOv2), we quantify the temporal curvature and stepwise distance in the model's representation domain. We aggregate statistics of these measures for each video and train a classifier. Our analysis shows that AI-generated videos exhibit significantly different curvature and distance patterns compared to real videos. A lightweight classifier achieves state-of-the-art detection performance (e.g., 97.17% accuracy and 98.63% AUROC on the VidProM benchmark), substantially outperforming existing image- and video-based methods. ReStraV is computationally efficient, it is offering a low-cost and effective detection solution. This work provides new insights into using neural representation geometry for AI-generated video detection.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Automated parsing of scanned documents into richly structured, machine-readable formats remains a critical bottleneck in Document AI, as traditional multi-stage pipelines suffer from error propagation and limited adaptability to diverse layouts. We introduce layoutRL, an end-to-end reinforcement learning framework that trains models to be explicitly layout-aware by optimizing a composite reward of normalized edit distance, paragraph count accuracy, and reading order preservation. Leveraging our newly released dataset, Infinity-Doc-55K, which combines 55K high-fidelity synthetic scanned document parsing data with expert-filtered real-world documents, we instantiate layoutRL in a vision-language-model-based parser called Infinity-Parser. Evaluated on English and Chinese benchmarks for OCR, table and formula extraction, and reading order detection, Infinity-Parser achieves new state-of-the-art performance in both accuracy and structural fidelity, outpacing specialist pipelines and general-purpose vision-language models. We will publicly release our code and dataset to accelerate progress in robust document understanding.

  Automated signature verification is a critical biometric technique used in banking, identity authentication, and legal documentation. Despite the notable progress achieved by deep learning methods, most approaches in offline signature verification still struggle to generalize across datasets, as variations in handwriting styles and acquisition protocols often degrade performance. This study investigates feature learning strategies for signature forgery detection, focusing on improving cross-dataset generalization -- that is, model robustness when trained on one dataset and tested on another. Using three public benchmarks -- CEDAR, ICDAR, and GPDS Synthetic -- two experimental pipelines were developed: one based on raw signature images and another employing a preprocessing method referred to as shell preprocessing. Several behavioral patterns were identified and analyzed; however, no definitive superiority between the two approaches was established. The results show that the raw-image model achieved higher performance across benchmarks, while the shell-based model demonstrated promising potential for future refinement toward robust, cross-domain signature verification.

  The recent development of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has significantly advanced AI's ability to understand visual modalities. However, existing evaluation benchmarks remain limited to single-turn question answering, overlooking the complexity of multi-turn dialogues in real-world scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce MT-Video-Bench, a holistic video understanding benchmark for evaluating MLLMs in multi-turn dialogues. Specifically, our MT-Video-Bench mainly assesses six core competencies that focus on perceptivity and interactivity, encompassing 987 meticulously curated multi-turn dialogues from diverse domains. These capabilities are rigorously aligned with real-world applications, such as interactive sports analysis and multi-turn video-based intelligent tutoring. With MT-Video-Bench, we extensively evaluate various state-of-the-art open-source and closed-source MLLMs, revealing their significant performance discrepancies and limitations in handling multi-turn video dialogues. The benchmark will be publicly available to foster future research.

  Text-to-image person retrieval (TIPR) aims to identify the target person using textual descriptions, facing challenge in modality heterogeneity. Prior works have attempted to address it by developing cross-modal global or local alignment strategies. However, global methods typically overlook fine-grained cross-modal differences, whereas local methods require prior information to explore explicit part alignments. Additionally, current methods are English-centric, restricting their application in multilingual contexts. To alleviate these issues, we pioneer a multilingual TIPR task by developing a multilingual TIPR benchmark, for which we leverage large language models for initial translations and refine them by integrating domain-specific knowledge. Correspondingly, we propose Bi-IRRA: a Bidirectional Implicit Relation Reasoning and Aligning framework to learn alignment across languages and modalities. Within Bi-IRRA, a bidirectional implicit relation reasoning module enables bidirectional prediction of masked image and text, implicitly enhancing the modeling of local relations across languages and modalities, a multi-dimensional global alignment module is integrated to bridge the modality heterogeneity. The proposed method achieves new state-of-the-art results on all multilingual TIPR datasets. Data and code are presented inthis https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Image editing has achieved remarkable progress recently. Modern editing models could already follow complex instructions to manipulate the original content. However, beyond completing the editing instructions, the accompanying physical effects are the key to the generation realism. For example, removing an object should also remove its shadow, reflections, and interactions with nearby objects. Unfortunately, existing models and benchmarks mainly focus on instruction completion but overlook these physical effects. So, at this moment, how far are we from physically realistic image editing? To answer this, we introduce PICABench, which systematically evaluates physical realism across eight sub-dimension (spanning optics, mechanics, and state transitions) for most of the common editing operations (add, remove, attribute change, etc). We further propose the PICAEval, a reliable evaluation protocol that uses VLM-as-a-judge with per-case, region-level human annotations and questions. Beyond benchmarking, we also explore effective solutions by learning physics from videos and construct a training dataset PICA-100K. After evaluating most of the mainstream models, we observe that physical realism remains a challenging problem with large rooms to explore. We hope that our benchmark and proposed solutions can serve as a foundation for future work moving from naive content editing toward physically consistent realism.

  AI systems must adapt to evolving visual environments, especially in domains where object appearances change over time. We introduce Car Models in Time (CaMiT), a fine-grained dataset capturing the temporal evolution of car models, a representative class of technological artifacts. CaMiT includes 787K labeled samples of 190 car models (2007-2023) and 5.1M unlabeled samples (2005-2023), supporting both supervised and self-supervised learning. Static pretraining on in-domain data achieves competitive performance with large-scale generalist models while being more resource-efficient, yet accuracy declines when models are tested across years. To address this, we propose a time-incremental classification setting, a realistic continual learning scenario with emerging, evolving, and disappearing classes. We evaluate two strategies: time-incremental pretraining, which updates the backbone, and time-incremental classifier learning, which updates only the final layer, both improving temporal robustness. Finally, we explore time-aware image generation that leverages temporal metadata during training, yielding more realistic outputs. CaMiT offers a rich benchmark for studying temporal adaptation in fine-grained visual recognition and generation.

  The advancement of vision-language models (VLMs) is hampered by a fragmented landscape of inconsistent and contaminated public datasets. We introduce FineVision, a meticulously collected, curated, and unified corpus of 24 million samples - the largest open resource of its kind. We unify more than 200 sources into 185 subsets via a semi-automated, human-in-the-loop pipeline: automation performs bulk ingestion and schema mapping, while reviewers audit mappings and spot-check outputs to verify faithful consumption of annotations, appropriate formatting and diversity, and safety; issues trigger targeted fixes and re-runs. The workflow further applies rigorous de-duplication within and across sources and decontamination against 66 public benchmarks. FineVision also encompasses agentic/GUI tasks with a unified action space; reviewers validate schemas and inspect a sample of trajectories to confirm executable fidelity. Models trained on FineVision consistently outperform those trained on existing open mixtures across a broad evaluation suite, underscoring the benefits of scale, data hygiene, and balanced automation with human oversight. We release the corpus and curation tools to accelerate data-centric VLM research.

  Existing Moment retrieval (MR) methods focus on Single-Moment Retrieval (SMR). However, one query can correspond to multiple relevant moments in real-world applications. This makes the existing datasets and methods insufficient for video temporal grounding. By revisiting the gap between current MR tasks and real-world applications, we introduce a high-quality datasets called QVHighlights Multi-Moment Dataset (QV-M$^2$), along with new evaluation metrics tailored for multi-moment retrieval (MMR). QV-M$^2$ consists of 2,212 annotations covering 6,384 video segments. Building on existing efforts in MMR, we propose a framework called FlashMMR. Specifically, we propose a Multi-moment Post-verification module to refine the moment boundaries. We introduce constrained temporal adjustment and subsequently leverage a verification module to re-evaluate the candidate segments. Through this sophisticated filtering pipeline, low-confidence proposals are pruned, and robust multi-moment alignment is achieved. We retrain and evaluate 6 existing MR methods on QV-M$^2$ and QVHighlights under both SMR and MMR settings. Results show that QV-M$^2$ serves as an effective benchmark for training and evaluating MMR models, while FlashMMR provides a strong baseline. Specifically, on QV-M$^2$, it achieves improvements over prior SOTA method by 3.00% on G-mAP, 2.70% on mAP@3+tgt, and 2.56% on mR@3. The proposed benchmark and method establish a foundation for advancing research in more realistic and challenging video temporal grounding scenarios. Code is released atthis https URL.

  _Pu Zhang, Yuwei Li, Xingyuan Xian, Guoming Tang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As the capabilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) advance, they can process increasingly large inputs, which, unlike in LLMs, generates significant visual token redundancy and leads to prohibitive inference costs. While many methods aim to reduce these costs by pruning visual tokens, existing approaches, whether based on attention or diversity, typically neglect the guidance of the text prompt and thus fail to prioritize task relevance. In this work, we propose a novel, zero-shot method that reframes the problem by introducing a prompt-aware perspective, explicitly modeling visual token pruning as a balance between task relevance and information diversity. Our hierarchical approach first selects a core set of task-relevant visual tokens and then supplements them with diversity tokens to preserve broader context. Experiments across multiple models and benchmarks show that our method achieves performance that matches or surpasses the state-of-the-art with only minimal accuracy loss, even when pruning up to 90\% of the tokens. Furthermore, these gains are accompanied by significant reductions in GPU memory footprint and inference latency.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Automated plankton recognition models face significant challenges during real-world deployment due to distribution shifts (Out-of-Distribution, OoD) between training and test data. This stems from plankton's complex morphologies, vast species diversity, and the continuous discovery of novel species, which leads to unpredictable errors during inference. Despite rapid advancements in OoD detection methods in recent years, the field of plankton recognition still lacks a systematic integration of the latest computer vision developments and a unified benchmark for large-scale evaluation. To address this, this paper meticulously designed a series of OoD benchmarks simulating various distribution shift scenarios based on the DYB-PlanktonNet dataset \cite{875n-f104-21}, and systematically evaluated twenty-two OoD detection methods. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the ViM \cite{wang2022vim} method significantly outperforms other approaches in our constructed benchmarks, particularly excelling in Far-OoD scenarios with substantial improvements in key metrics. This comprehensive evaluation not only provides a reliable reference for algorithm selection in automated plankton recognition but also lays a solid foundation for future research in plankton OoD detection. To our knowledge, this study marks the first large-scale, systematic evaluation and analysis of Out-of-Distribution data detection methods in plankton recognition. Code is available atthis https URL.

  Coral reefs are rapidly declining due to anthropogenic pressures such as climate change, underscoring the urgent need for scalable, automated monitoring. We introduce ReefNet, a large public coral reef image dataset with point-label annotations mapped to the World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS). ReefNet aggregates imagery from 76 curated CoralNet sources and an additional site from Al Wajh in the Red Sea, totaling approximately 925000 genus-level hard coral annotations with expert-verified labels. Unlike prior datasets, which are often limited by size, geography, or coarse labels and are not ML-ready, ReefNet offers fine-grained, taxonomically mapped labels at a global scale to WoRMS. We propose two evaluation settings: (i) a within-source benchmark that partitions each source's images for localized evaluation, and (ii) a cross-source benchmark that withholds entire sources to test domain generalization. We analyze both supervised and zero-shot classification performance on ReefNet and find that while supervised within-source performance is promising, supervised performance drops sharply across domains, and performance is low across the board for zero-shot models, especially for rare and visually similar genera. This provides a challenging benchmark intended to catalyze advances in domain generalization and fine-grained coral classification. We will release our dataset, benchmarking code, and pretrained models to advance robust, domain-adaptive, global coral reef monitoring and conservation.

  X-ray image-based medical report generation (MRG) is a pivotal area in artificial intelligence that can significantly reduce diagnostic burdens for clinicians and patient wait times. Existing MRG models predominantly rely on Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve report generation, with limited exploration of pre-trained vision foundation models or advanced fine-tuning techniques. Mainstream frameworks either avoid fine-tuning or utilize simplistic methods like LoRA, often neglecting the potential of enhancing cross-attention mechanisms. Additionally, while Transformer-based models dominate vision-language tasks, non-Transformer architectures, such as the Mamba network, remain underexplored for medical report generation, presenting a promising avenue for future research. In this paper, we propose EMRRG, a novel X-ray report generation framework that fine-tunes pre-trained Mamba networks using parameter-efficient methods. Specifically, X-ray images are divided into patches, tokenized, and processed by an SSM-based vision backbone for feature extraction, with Partial LoRA yielding optimal performance. An LLM with a hybrid decoder generates the medical report, enabling end-to-end training and achieving strong results on benchmark datasets. Extensive experiments on three widely used benchmark datasets fully validated the effectiveness of our proposed strategies for the X-ray MRG.

  Existing research on 3D Large Language Models (LLMs) still struggles to achieve grounded question-answering, primarily due to the under-exploration of the mech- anism of human-like scene-object grounded reasoning. This paper bridges the gap by presenting a novel framework. We first introduce a grounded Chain-of- Thought reasoning method in 3D scenes (SCENECOT), decoupling a complex reasoning task into simpler and manageable problems, and building corresponding visual clues based on multimodal expert modules. To enable such a method, we develop SCENECOT-185K, the first large-scale grounded CoT reasoning dataset, consisting of 185K high-quality instances. Extensive experiments across various complex 3D scene reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our new framework achieves strong performance with high grounding-QA coherence. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first successful application of CoT reasoning to 3D scene understanding, enabling step-by-step human-like reasoning and showing potential for extension to broader 3D scene understanding scenarios.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Spatial reasoning, the ability to ground language in 3D understanding, remains a persistent challenge for Vision-Language Models (VLMs). We identify two fundamental bottlenecks: inadequate 3D understanding capabilities stemming from 2D-centric pre-training, and reasoning failures induced by redundant 3D information. To address these, we first construct a Minimal Sufficient Set (MSS) of information before answering a given question: a compact selection of 3D perception results from \textit{expert models}. We introduce MSSR (Minimal Sufficient Spatial Reasoner), a dual-agent framework that implements this principle. A Perception Agent programmatically queries 3D scenes using a versatile perception toolbox to extract sufficient information, including a novel SOG (Situated Orientation Grounding) module that robustly extracts language-grounded directions. A Reasoning Agent then iteratively refines this information to pursue minimality, pruning redundant details and requesting missing ones in a closed loop until the MSS is curated. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method, by explicitly pursuing both sufficiency and minimality, significantly improves accuracy and achieves state-of-the-art performance across two challenging benchmarks. Furthermore, our framework produces interpretable reasoning paths, offering a promising source of high-quality training data for future models. Source code is available atthis https URL.

  Medical imaging plays a vital role in modern diagnostics; however, interpreting high-resolution radiological data remains time-consuming and susceptible to variability among clinicians. Traditional image processing techniques often lack the precision, robustness, and speed required for real-time clinical use. To overcome these limitations, this paper introduces a deep learning framework for real-time medical image analysis designed to enhance diagnostic accuracy and computational efficiency across multiple imaging modalities, including X-ray, CT, and MRI. The proposed system integrates advanced neural network architectures such as U-Net, EfficientNet, and Transformer-based models with real-time optimization strategies including model pruning, quantization, and GPU acceleration. The framework enables flexible deployment on edge devices, local servers, and cloud infrastructures, ensuring seamless interoperability with clinical systems such as PACS and EHR. Experimental evaluations on public benchmark datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, achieving classification accuracies above 92%, segmentation Dice scores exceeding 91%, and inference times below 80 milliseconds. Furthermore, visual explanation tools such as Grad-CAM and segmentation overlays enhance transparency and clinical interpretability. These results indicate that the proposed framework can substantially accelerate diagnostic workflows, reduce clinician workload, and support trustworthy AI integration in time-critical healthcare environments.

  Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) excel in diverse cross-modal tasks. However, object hallucination, where models produce plausible but inaccurate object descriptions, remains a significant challenge. In contrast to previous work focusing on LLM components, this paper is the first to trace LVLM hallucinations to visual encoders and identifies three key issues: statistical bias, inherent bias, and vulnerability. To address these challenges, we propose SHIELD, a training-free framework that mitigates hallucinations through three strategies: re-weighting visual tokens to reduce statistical bias, introducing noise-derived tokens to counter inherent bias, and applying adversarial attacks with contrastive decoding to address vulnerability. Experiments demonstrate that SHIELD effectively mitigates object hallucinations across diverse benchmarks and LVLM families. Moreover, SHIELD achieves strong performance on the general LVLM benchmark, highlighting its broad applicability. Code will be released.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Deep learning-based gait recognition has achieved great success in various applications. The key to accurate gait recognition lies in considering the unique and diverse behavior patterns in different motion regions, especially when covariates affect visual appearance. However, existing methods typically use predefined regions for temporal modeling, with fixed or equivalent temporal scales assigned to different types of regions, which makes it difficult to model motion regions that change dynamically over time and adapt to their specific patterns. To tackle this problem, we introduce a Region-aware Dynamic Aggregation and Excitation framework (GaitRDAE) that automatically searches for motion regions, assigns adaptive temporal scales and applies corresponding attention. Specifically, the framework includes two core modules: the Region-aware Dynamic Aggregation (RDA) module, which dynamically searches the optimal temporal receptive field for each region, and the Region-aware Dynamic Excitation (RDE) module, which emphasizes the learning of motion regions containing more stable behavior patterns while suppressing attention to static regions that are more susceptible to covariates. Experimental results show that GaitRDAE achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets.

  _Jihoon Kwon, Kyle Min, Jy-yong Sohn_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Despite recent advances, vision-language models trained with standard contrastive objectives still struggle with compositional reasoning -- the ability to understand structured relationships between visual and linguistic elements. This shortcoming is largely due to the tendency of the text encoder to focus on individual words rather than their relations, a limitation reinforced by contrastive training that primarily aligns words with visual objects. In this paper, we introduce REconstruction and Alignment of text Descriptions (READ), a fine-tuning method designed to enhance compositional reasoning by adding two auxiliary objectives to the contrastive learning: (1) a token-level reconstruction objective, where a frozen pre-trained decoder reconstructs alternative captions based on the embedding of the original caption; and (2) a sentence-level alignment objective, which explicitly aligns paraphrased sentences in the embedding space. We show that READ-CLIP, a model derived by applying the READ method to the pre-trained CLIP model, achieves the state-of-the-art performance across five major compositional reasoning benchmarks, outperforming the strongest conventional fine-tuning baseline by up to 4.1%. Furthermore, applying the READ to existing CLIP variants (including NegCLIP and FSC-CLIP) also improves performance on these benchmarks. Quantitative and qualitative analyses reveal that our proposed objectives -- reconstruction and alignment -- offer complementary benefits: the former encourages the encoder to capture relationships between words within a caption, while the latter ensures consistent representations for paraphrases expressed with different wording.

  The rapid development of deepfake video technology has not only facilitated artistic creation but also made it easier to spread misinformation. Traditional deepfake video detection (DVD) methods face issues such as a lack of transparency in their principles and insufficient generalization capabilities to cope with evolving forgery techniques. This highlights an urgent need for detectors that can identify forged content and provide verifiable reasoning explanations. This paper proposes the explainable deepfake video detection (EDVD) task and designs the EDVD-LLaMA multimodal, a large language model (MLLM) reasoning framework, which provides traceable reasoning processes alongside accurate detection results and trustworthy explanations. Our approach first incorporates a Spatio-Temporal Subtle Information Tokenization (ST-SIT) to extract and fuse global and local cross-frame deepfake features, providing rich spatio-temporal semantic information input for MLLM reasoning. Second, we construct a Fine-grained Multimodal Chain-of-Thought (Fg-MCoT) mechanism, which introduces facial feature data as hard constraints during the reasoning process to achieve pixel-level spatio-temporal video localization, suppress hallucinated outputs, and enhance the reliability of the chain of thought. In addition, we build an Explainable Reasoning FF++ benchmark dataset (ER-FF++set), leveraging structured data to annotate videos and ensure quality control, thereby supporting dual supervision for reasoning and detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EDVD-LLaMA achieves outstanding performance and robustness in terms of detection accuracy, explainability, and its ability to handle cross-forgery methods and cross-dataset scenarios. Compared to previous DVD methods, it provides a more explainable and superior solution. The source code and dataset will be publicly available.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown remarkable abilities by integrating large language models with visual inputs. However, they often fail to utilize visual evidence adequately, either depending on linguistic priors in vision-centric tasks or resorting to textual shortcuts during reasoning. Although reinforcement learning (RL) can align models with desired behaviors, its application to VLMs has been hindered by the lack of scalable and reliable reward mechanisms. To overcome this challenge, we propose SSL4RL, a novel framework that leverages self-supervised learning (SSL) tasks as a source of verifiable rewards for RL-based fine-tuning. Our approach reformulates SSL objectives-such as predicting image rotation or reconstructing masked patches-into dense, automatic reward signals, eliminating the need for human preference data or unreliable AI evaluators. Experiments show that SSL4RL substantially improves performance on both vision-centric and vision-language reasoning benchmarks. Furthermore, through systematic ablations, we identify key factors-such as task difficulty, model scale, and semantic alignment with the target domain-that influence the effectiveness of SSL4RL tasks, offering new design principles for future work. We also demonstrate the framework's generality by applying it to graph learning, where it yields significant gains. SSL4RL establishes a versatile and effective paradigm for aligning multimodal models using verifiable, self-supervised objectives.

  With the increasing ubiquity of AR/VR devices, the deployment of deep learning models on edge devices has become a critical challenge. These devices require real-time inference, low power consumption, and minimal latency. Many framework designers face the conundrum of balancing efficiency and performance. We design a light framework that adopts an encoder-decoder architecture and introduces several key contributions aimed at improving both efficiency and accuracy. We apply sparse convolution on a ResNet-18 backbone to exploit the inherent sparsity in hand pose images, achieving a 42% end-to-end efficiency improvement. Moreover, we propose our SPLite decoder. This new architecture significantly boosts the decoding process's frame rate by 3.1x on the Raspberry Pi 5, while maintaining accuracy on par. To further optimize performance, we apply quantization-aware training, reducing memory usage while preserving accuracy (PA-MPJPE increases only marginally from 9.0 mm to 9.1 mm on FreiHAND). Overall, our system achieves a 2.98x speed-up on a Raspberry Pi 5 CPU (BCM2712 quad-core Arm A76 processor). Our method is also evaluated on compound benchmark datasets, demonstrating comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art approaches while significantly enhancing computational efficiency.

  OpenLVLM-MIA is a new benchmark that highlights fundamental challenges in evaluating membership inference attacks (MIA) against large vision-language models (LVLMs). While prior work has reported high attack success rates, our analysis suggests that these results often arise from detecting distributional bias introduced during dataset construction rather than from identifying true membership status. To address this issue, we introduce a controlled benchmark of 6{,}000 images where the distributions of member and non-member samples are carefully balanced, and ground-truth membership labels are provided across three distinct training stages. Experiments using OpenLVLM-MIA demonstrated that the performance of state-of-the-art MIA methods converged to random chance under unbiased conditions. By offering a transparent and unbiased benchmark, OpenLVLM-MIA clarifies the current limitations of MIA research on LVLMs and provides a solid foundation for developing stronger privacy-preserving techniques.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Knowledge-based visual question answering (KB-VQA) requires visual language models (VLMs) to integrate visual understanding with external knowledge retrieval. Although retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) achieves significant advances in this task by combining knowledge-base querying, it still struggles with the quality of multimodal queries and the relevance of retrieved results. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel three-stage method, termed Wiki-PRF, including Processing, Retrieval and Filtering stages. The processing stage dynamically invokes visual tools to extract precise multimodal information for retrieval. The retrieval stage integrates visual and text features to achieve multimodal knowledge retrieval. The filtering stage performs relevance filtering and concentration on retrieval results. To this end, we introduce a visual language model trained with answer accuracy and format consistency as reward signals via a reinforcement learning manner. This enhances the model's reasoning, tool invocation for accurate queries, and filtering of irrelevant content. Experiments on benchmark datasets (E-VQA and InfoSeek) show significant improvements~(36.0 and 42.8) in answer quality, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Code is available atthis https URL

  3D shape completion methods typically assume scans are pre-aligned to a canonical frame. This leaks pose and scale cues that networks may exploit to memorize absolute positions rather than inferring intrinsic geometry. When such alignment is absent in real data, performance collapses. We argue that robust generalization demands architectural equivariance to the similarity group, SIM(3), so the model remains agnostic to pose and scale. Following this principle, we introduce the first SIM(3)-equivariant shape completion network, whose modular layers successively canonicalize features, reason over similarity-invariant geometry, and restore the original frame. Under a de-biased evaluation protocol that removes the hidden cues, our model outperforms both equivariant and augmentation baselines on the PCN benchmark. It also sets new cross-domain records on real driving and indoor scans, lowering minimal matching distance on KITTI by 17% and Chamfer distance $\ell1$ on OmniObject3D by 14%. Perhaps surprisingly, ours under the stricter protocol still outperforms competitors under their biased settings. These results establish full SIM(3) equivariance as an effective route to truly generalizable shape completion. Project page:this https URL.

  Recent strides in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have significantly advanced their performance in many reasoning tasks. However, Abstract Visual Reasoning (AVR) remains a critical challenge, primarily due to limitations in perceiving abstract graphics. To tackle this issue, we investigate the bottlenecks in current MLLMs and synthesize training data to improve their abstract visual perception. First, we propose VisuRiddles, a benchmark for AVR, featuring tasks meticulously constructed to assess models' reasoning capacities across five core dimensions and two high-level reasoning categories. Second, we introduce the Perceptual Riddle Synthesizer (PRS), an automated framework for generating riddles with fine-grained perceptual descriptions. PRS not only generates valuable training data for abstract graphics but also provides fine-grained perceptual description, crucially allowing for supervision over intermediate reasoning stages and thereby improving both training efficacy and model interpretability. Our extensive experimental results on VisuRiddles empirically validate that fine-grained visual perception is the principal bottleneck and our synthesis framework markedly enhances the performance of contemporary MLLMs on these challenging tasks.

  _Jiyuan Wang, Chunyu Lin, Cheng Guan, Lang Nie, Jing He, Haodong Li, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this paper, we propose Jasmine, the first Stable Diffusion (SD)-based self-supervised framework for monocular depth estimation, which effectively harnesses SD's visual priors to enhance the sharpness and generalization of unsupervised prediction. Previous SD-based methods are all supervised since adapting diffusion models for dense prediction requires high-precision supervision. In contrast, self-supervised reprojection suffers from inherent challenges (e.g., occlusions, texture-less regions, illumination variance), and the predictions exhibit blurs and artifacts that severely compromise SD's latent priors. To resolve this, we construct a novel surrogate task of hybrid image reconstruction. Without any additional supervision, it preserves the detail priors of SD models by reconstructing the images themselves while preventing depth estimation from degradation. Furthermore, to address the inherent misalignment between SD's scale and shift invariant estimation and self-supervised scale-invariant depth estimation, we build the Scale-Shift GRU. It not only bridges this distribution gap but also isolates the fine-grained texture of SD output against the interference of reprojection loss. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Jasmine achieves SoTA performance on the KITTI benchmark and exhibits superior zero-shot generalization across multiple datasets.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Autoregressive models have achieved significant success in image generation. However, unlike the inherent hierarchical structure of image information in the spectral domain, standard autoregressive methods typically generate pixels sequentially in a fixed spatial order. To better leverage this spectral hierarchy, we introduce NextFrequency Image Generation (NFIG). NFIG is a novel framework that decomposes the image generation process into multiple frequency-guided stages. NFIG aligns the generation process with the natural image structure. It does this by first generating low-frequency components, which efficiently capture global structure with significantly fewer tokens, and then progressively adding higher-frequency details. This frequency-aware paradigm offers substantial advantages: it not only improves the quality of generated images but crucially reduces inference cost by efficiently establishing global structure early on. Extensive experiments on the ImageNet-256 benchmark validate NFIG's effectiveness, demonstrating superior performance (FID: 2.81) and a notable 1.25x speedup compared to the strong baseline VAR-d20.

  We address multi-reference visual place recognition (VPR), where reference sets captured under varying conditions are used to improve localisation performance. While deep learning with large-scale training improves robustness, increasing data diversity and model complexity incur extensive computational cost during training and deployment. Descriptor-level fusion via voting or aggregation avoids training, but often targets multi-sensor setups or relies on heuristics with limited gains under appearance and viewpoint change. We propose a training-free, descriptor-agnostic approach that jointly models places using multiple reference descriptors via matrix decomposition into basis representations, enabling projection-based residual matching. We also introduce SotonMV, a structured benchmark for multi-viewpoint VPR. On multi-appearance data, our method improves Recall@1 by up to ~18% over single-reference and outperforms multi-reference baselines across appearance and viewpoint changes, with gains of ~5% on unstructured data, demonstrating strong generalisation while remaining lightweight.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) under raindrop conditions suffers from severe occlusions and optical distortions caused by raindrop contamination on the camera lens, substantially degrading reconstruction quality. Existing benchmarks typically evaluate 3DGS using synthetic raindrop images with known camera poses (constrained images), assuming ideal conditions. However, in real-world scenarios, raindrops often interfere with accurate camera pose estimation and point cloud initialization. Moreover, a significant domain gap between synthetic and real raindrops further impairs generalization. To tackle these issues, we introduce RaindropGS, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the full 3DGS pipeline-from unconstrained, raindrop-corrupted images to clear 3DGS reconstructions. Specifically, the whole benchmark pipeline consists of three parts: data preparation, data processing, and raindrop-aware 3DGS evaluation, including types of raindrop interference, camera pose estimation and point cloud initialization, single image rain removal comparison, and 3D Gaussian training comparison. First, we collect a real-world raindrop reconstruction dataset, in which each scene contains three aligned image sets: raindrop-focused, background-focused, and rain-free ground truth, enabling a comprehensive evaluation of reconstruction quality under different focus conditions. Through comprehensive experiments and analyses, we reveal critical insights into the performance limitations of existing 3DGS methods on unconstrained raindrop images and the varying impact of different pipeline components: the impact of camera focus position on 3DGS reconstruction performance, and the interference caused by inaccurate pose and point cloud initialization on reconstruction. These insights establish clear directions for developing more robust 3DGS methods under raindrop conditions.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) has evolved from building specialized single-class models to unified multi-class models, yet existing multi-class models significantly underperform the most advanced one-for-one counterparts. Moreover, the field has fragmented into specialized methods tailored to specific scenarios (multi-class, 3D, few-shot, etc.), creating deployment barriers and highlighting the need for a unified solution. In this paper, we present Dinomaly2, the first unified framework for full-spectrum image UAD, which bridges the performance gap in multi-class models while seamlessly extending across diverse data modalities and task settings. Guided by the "less is more" philosophy, we demonstrate that the orchestration of five simple element achieves superior performance in a standard reconstruction-based framework. This methodological minimalism enables natural extension across diverse tasks without modification, establishing that simplicity is the foundation of true universality. Extensive experiments on 12 UAD benchmarks demonstrate Dinomaly2's full-spectrum superiority across multiple modalities (2D, multi-view, RGB-3D, RGB-IR), task settings (single-class, multi-class, inference-unified multi-class, few-shot) and application domains (industrial, biological, outdoor). For example, our multi-class model achieves unprecedented 99.9% and 99.3% image-level (I-) AUROC on MVTec-AD and VisA respectively. For multi-view and multi-modal inspection, Dinomaly2 demonstrates state-of-the-art performance with minimum adaptations. Moreover, using only 8 normal examples per class, our method surpasses previous full-shot models, achieving 98.7% and 97.4% I-AUROC on MVTec-AD and VisA. The combination of minimalistic design, computational scalability, and universal applicability positions Dinomaly2 as a unified solution for the full spectrum of real-world anomaly detection applications.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  With the development of underwater exploration and marine protection, underwater vision tasks are widespread. Due to the degraded underwater environment, characterized by color distortion, low contrast, and blurring, camouflaged instance segmentation (CIS) faces greater challenges in accurately segmenting objects that blend closely with their surroundings. Traditional camouflaged instance segmentation methods, trained on terrestrial-dominated datasets with limited underwater samples, may exhibit inadequate performance in underwater scenes. To address these issues, we introduce the first underwater camouflaged instance segmentation (UCIS) dataset, abbreviated as UCIS4K, which comprises 3,953 images of camouflaged marine organisms with instance-level annotations. In addition, we propose an Underwater Camouflaged Instance Segmentation network based on Segment Anything Model (UCIS-SAM). Our UCIS-SAM includes three key modules. First, the Channel Balance Optimization Module (CBOM) enhances channel characteristics to improve underwater feature learning, effectively addressing the model's limited understanding of underwater environments. Second, the Frequency Domain True Integration Module (FDTIM) is proposed to emphasize intrinsic object features and reduce interference from camouflage patterns, enhancing the segmentation performance of camouflaged objects blending with their surroundings. Finally, the Multi-scale Feature Frequency Aggregation Module (MFFAM) is designed to strengthen the boundaries of low-contrast camouflaged instances across multiple frequency bands, improving the model's ability to achieve more precise segmentation of camouflaged objects. Extensive experiments on the proposed UCIS4K and public benchmarks show that our UCIS-SAM outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.

  Salient object detection (SOD) aims to segment visually prominent regions in images and serves as a foundational task for various computer vision applications. We posit that SOD can now reach near-supervised accuracy without a single pixel-level label, but only when reliable pseudo-masks are available. We revisit the prototype-based line of work and make two key observations. First, boundary pixels and interior pixels obey markedly different geometry; second, the global consistency enforced by optimal transport (OT) is underutilized if prototype quality is weak. To address this, we introduce POTNet, an adaptation of Prototypical Optimal Transport that replaces POT's single k-means step with an entropy-guided dual-clustering head: high-entropy pixels are organized by spectral clustering, low-entropy pixels by k-means, and the two prototype sets are subsequently aligned by OT. This split-fuse-transport design yields sharper, part-aware pseudo-masks in a single forward pass, without handcrafted priors. Those masks supervise a standard MaskFormer-style encoder-decoder, giving rise to AutoSOD, an end-to-end unsupervised SOD pipeline that eliminates SelfMask's offline voting yet improves both accuracy and training efficiency. Extensive experiments on five benchmarks show that AutoSOD outperforms unsupervised methods by up to 26% and weakly supervised methods by up to 36% in F-measure, further narrowing the gap to fully supervised models.

  Compared to daytime image deraining, nighttime image deraining poses significant challenges due to inherent complexities of nighttime scenarios and the lack of high-quality datasets that accurately represent the coupling effect between rain and illumination. In this paper, we rethink the task of nighttime image deraining and contribute a new high-quality benchmark, HQ-NightRain, which offers higher harmony and realism compared to existing datasets. In addition, we develop an effective Color Space Transformation Network (CST-Net) for better removing complex rain from nighttime scenes. Specifically, we propose a learnable color space converter (CSC) to better facilitate rain removal in the Y channel, as nighttime rain is more pronounced in the Y channel compared to the RGB color space. To capture illumination information for guiding nighttime deraining, implicit illumination guidance is introduced enabling the learned features to improve the model's robustness in complex scenarios. Extensive experiments show the value of our dataset and the effectiveness of our method. The source code and datasets are available atthis https URL.

  Humans can perform previously unexperienced interactions with novel objects simply by observing others engage with them. Weakly-supervised affordance grounding mimics this process by learning to locate object regions that enable actions on egocentric images, using exocentric interaction images with image-level annotations. However, extracting affordance knowledge solely from exocentric images and transferring it one-way to egocentric images limits the applicability of previous works in complex interaction scenarios. Instead, this study introduces LoopTrans, a novel closed-loop framework that not only transfers knowledge from exocentric to egocentric but also transfers back to enhance exocentric knowledge extraction. Within LoopTrans, several innovative mechanisms are introduced, including unified cross-modal localization and denoising knowledge distillation, to bridge domain gaps between object-centered egocentric and interaction-centered exocentric images while enhancing knowledge transfer. Experiments show that LoopTrans achieves consistent improvements across all metrics on image and video benchmarks, even handling challenging scenarios where object interaction regions are fully occluded by the human body.

  The deployment of facial recognition systems has created an ethical dilemma: achieving high accuracy requires massive datasets of real faces collected without consent, leading to dataset retractions and potential legal liabilities under regulations like GDPR. While synthetic facial data presents a promising privacy-preserving alternative, the field lacks comprehensive empirical evidence of its viability. This study addresses this critical gap through extensive evaluation of synthetic facial recognition datasets. We present a systematic literature review identifying 25 synthetic facial recognition datasets (2018-2025), combined with rigorous experimental validation. Our methodology examines seven key requirements for privacy-preserving synthetic data: identity leakage prevention, intra-class variability, identity separability, dataset scale, ethical data sourcing, bias mitigation, and benchmark reliability. Through experiments involving over 10 million synthetic samples, extended by a comparison of results reported on five standard benchmarks, we provide the first comprehensive empirical assessment of synthetic data's capability to replace real datasets. Best-performing synthetic datasets (VariFace, VIGFace) achieve recognition accuracies of 95.67% and 94.91% respectively, surpassing established real datasets including CASIA-WebFace (94.70%). While those images remain private, publicly available alternatives Vec2Face (93.52%) and CemiFace (93.22%) come close behind. Our findings reveal that they ensure proper intra-class variability while maintaining identity separability. Demographic bias analysis shows that, even though synthetic data inherits limited biases, it offers unprecedented control for bias mitigation through generation parameters. These results establish synthetic facial data as a scientifically viable and ethically imperative alternative for facial recognition research.

  Event cameras offer distinct advantages such as low latency, high dynamic range, and efficient motion capture. However, event-to-video reconstruction (E2V), a fundamental event-based vision task, remains challenging, particularly for reconstructing and recovering semantic information. This is primarily due to the nature of the event camera, as it only captures intensity changes, ignoring static objects and backgrounds, resulting in a lack of semantic information in captured event modality. Further, semantic information plays a crucial role in video and frame reconstruction, yet is often overlooked by existing E2V approaches. To bridge this gap, we propose Semantic-E2VID, an E2V framework that explores the missing visual semantic knowledge in event modality and leverages it to enhance event-to-video reconstruction. Specifically, Semantic-E2VID introduces a cross-modal feature alignment (CFA) module to transfer the robust visual semantics from a frame-based vision foundation model, the Segment Anything Model (SAM), to the event encoder, while aligning the high-level features from distinct modalities. To better utilize the learned semantic feature, we further propose a semantic-aware feature fusion (SFF) block to integrate learned semantics in frame modality to form event representations with rich semantics that can be decoded by the event decoder. Further, to facilitate the reconstruction of semantic information, we propose a novel Semantic Perceptual E2V Supervision that helps the model to reconstruct semantic details by leveraging SAM-generated categorical labels. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Semantic-E2VID significantly enhances frame quality, outperforming state-of-the-art E2V methods across multiple benchmarks. The sample code is included in the supplementary material.

In this work, we address the emerging challenge of detailed and explainable IQA by proposing iDETEX-a unified multimodal large language model (MLLM) capable of simultaneously performing three key tasks: quality grounding, perception, and description. To facilitate efficient and generalizable training across these heterogeneous subtasks, we design a suite of task-specific offline augmentation modules and a data mixing strategy. These are further complemented by online enhancement strategies to fully exploit multi-sourced supervision. We validate our approach on the large-scale ViDA-UGC benchmark, where iDETEX achieves state-of-the-art performance across all subtasks. Our model ranks first in the ICCV MIPI 2025 Detailed Image Quality Assessment Challenge, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness in delivering accurate and interpretable quality assessments.

  In this work, we observe a counterintuitive phenomenon in self-supervised learning (SSL): longer training may impair the performance of dense prediction tasks (e.g., semantic segmentation). We refer to this phenomenon as Self-supervised Dense Degradation (SDD) and demonstrate its consistent presence across sixteen state-of-the-art SSL methods with various losses, architectures, and datasets. When the model performs suboptimally on dense tasks at the end of training, measuring the performance during training becomes essential. However, evaluating dense performance effectively without annotations remains an open challenge. To tackle this issue, we introduce a Dense representation Structure Estimator (DSE), composed of a class-relevance measure and an effective dimensionality measure. The proposed DSE is both theoretically grounded and empirically validated to be closely correlated with the downstream performance. Based on this metric, we introduce a straightforward yet effective model selection strategy and a DSE-based regularization method. Experiments on sixteen SSL methods across four benchmarks confirm that model selection improves mIoU by $3.0\%$ on average with negligible computational cost. Additionally, DSE regularization consistently mitigates the effects of dense degradation. Code is available atthis https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Accurate segmentation and classification of white blood cells (WBCs) in microscopic images are essential for diagnosis and monitoring of many hematological disorders, yet remain challenging due to staining variability, complex backgrounds, and class imbalance. In this paper, we introduce a novel Saliency-Guided Cross-Layer Deep Feature Fusion framework (SG-CLDFF) that tightly integrates saliency-driven preprocessing with multi-scale deep feature aggregation to improve both robustness and interpretability for WBC analysis. SG-CLDFF first computes saliency priors to highlight candidate WBC regions and guide subsequent feature extraction. A lightweight hybrid backbone (EfficientSwin-style) produces multi-resolution representations, which are fused by a ResNeXt-CC-inspired cross-layer fusion module to preserve complementary information from shallow and deep layers. The network is trained in a multi-task setup with concurrent segmentation and cell-type classification heads, using class-aware weighted losses and saliency-alignment regularization to mitigate imbalance and suppress background activation. Interpretability is enforced through Grad-CAM visualizations and saliency consistency checks, allowing model decisions to be inspected at the regional level. We validate the framework on standard public benchmarks (BCCD, LISC, ALL-IDB), reporting consistent gains in IoU, F1, and classification accuracy compared to strong CNN and transformer baselines. An ablation study also demonstrates the individual contributions of saliency preprocessing and cross-layer fusion. SG-CLDFF offers a practical and explainable path toward more reliable automated WBC analysis in clinical workflows.

  Current autonomous driving systems rely on specialized models for perceiving and predicting motion, which demonstrate reliable performance in standard conditions. However, generalizing cost-effectively to diverse real-world scenarios remains a significant challenge. To address this, we propose Plug-and-Forecast (PnF), a plug-and-play approach that augments existing motion forecasting models with multimodal large language models (MLLMs). PnF builds on the insight that natural language provides a more effective way to describe and handle complex scenarios, enabling quick adaptation to targeted behaviors. We design prompts to extract structured scene understanding from MLLMs and distill this information into learnable embeddings to augment existing behavior prediction models. Our method leverages the zero-shot reasoning capabilities of MLLMs to achieve significant improvements in motion prediction performance, while requiring no fine-tuning -- making it practical to adopt. We validate our approach on two state-of-the-art motion forecasting models using the Waymo Open Motion Dataset and the nuScenes Dataset, demonstrating consistent performance improvements across both benchmarks.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Three-dimensional (3D) point clouds are becoming increasingly vital in applications such as autonomous driving, augmented reality, and immersive communication, demanding real-time processing and low latency. However, their large data volumes and bandwidth constraints hinder the deployment of high-quality services in resource-limited environments. Progres- sive coding, which allows for decoding at varying levels of detail, provides an alternative by allowing initial partial decoding with subsequent refinement. Although recent learning-based point cloud geometry coding methods have achieved notable success, their fixed latent representation does not support progressive decoding. To bridge this gap, we propose ProDAT, a novel density-aware tail-drop mechanism for progressive point cloud coding. By leveraging density information as a guidance signal, latent features and coordinates are decoded adaptively based on their significance, therefore achieving progressive decoding at multiple bitrates using one single model. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that the proposed ProDAT not only enables progressive coding but also achieves superior coding efficiency compared to state-of-the-art learning-based coding techniques, with over 28.6% BD-rate improvement for PSNR- D2 on SemanticKITTI and over 18.15% for ShapeNet

  Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer mortality, with CT imaging central to screening, prognosis, and treatment. Manual segmentation is variable and time-intensive, while deep learning (DL) offers automation but faces barriers to clinical adoption. Guided by the Knowledge-to-Action framework, this study develops a clinician-in-the-loop DL pipeline to enhance reproducibility, prognostic accuracy, and clinical trust. Multi-center CT data from 999 patients across 12 public datasets were analyzed using five DL models (3D Attention U-Net, ResUNet, VNet, ReconNet, SAM-Med3D), benchmarked against expert contours on whole and click-point cropped images. Segmentation reproducibility was assessed using 497 PySERA-extracted radiomic features via Spearman correlation, ICC, Wilcoxon tests, and MANOVA, while prognostic modeling compared supervised (SL) and semi-supervised learning (SSL) across 38 dimensionality reduction strategies and 24 classifiers. Six physicians qualitatively evaluated masks across seven domains, including clinical meaningfulness, boundary quality, prognostic value, trust, and workflow integration. VNet achieved the best performance (Dice = 0.83, IoU = 0.71), radiomic stability (mean correlation = 0.76, ICC = 0.65), and predictive accuracy under SSL (accuracy = 0.88, F1 = 0.83). SSL consistently outperformed SL across models. Radiologists favored VNet for peritumoral representation and smoother boundaries, preferring AI-generated initial masks for refinement rather than replacement. These results demonstrate that integrating VNet with SSL yields accurate, reproducible, and clinically trusted CT-based lung cancer prognosis, highlighting a feasible path toward physician-centered AI translation.

  Foundation models have advanced machine learning across various modalities, including images. Recently multiple teams trained foundation models specialized for remote sensing applications. This line of research is motivated by the distinct characteristics of remote sensing imagery, specific applications and types of robustness useful for satellite image analysis. In this work we systematically challenge the idea that specific foundation models are more useful than general-purpose vision foundation models, at least in the small scale. First, we design a simple benchmark that measures generalization of remote sensing models towards images with lower resolution for two downstream tasks. Second, we train iBOT, a self-supervised vision encoder, on MillionAID, an ImageNet-scale satellite imagery dataset, with several modifications specific to remote sensing. We show that none of those pretrained models bring consistent improvements upon general-purpose baselines at the ViT-B scale.

  Temporal video grounding is a fundamental task in computer vision, aiming to localize a natural language query in a long, untrimmed video. It has a key role in the scientific community, in part due to the large amount of video generated every day. Although we find extensive work in this task, we note that research remains focused on a small selection of video representations, which may lead to architectural overfitting in the long run. To address this issue, we propose an empirical study to investigate the impact of different video features on a classical architecture. We extract features for three well-known benchmarks, Charades-STA, ActivityNet-Captions and YouCookII, using video encoders based on CNNs, temporal reasoning and transformers. Our results show significant differences in the performance of our model by simply changing the video encoder, while also revealing clear patterns and errors derived from the use of certain features, ultimately indicating potential feature complementarity.

  Instruction-based image editing has achieved remarkable progress; however, models solely trained via supervised fine-tuning often overfit to annotated patterns, hindering their ability to explore and generalize beyond training distributions. To this end, we introduce Edit-R1, a novel post-training framework for instruction-based image editing based on policy optimization. Specifically, we utilize Diffusion Negative-aware Finetuning (DiffusionNFT), a likelihood-free policy optimization method consistent with the flow matching forward process, thereby enabling the use of higher-order samplers and more efficient training. Another key challenge here is the absence of a universal reward model, resulting from the diverse nature of editing instructions and tasks. To bridge this gap, we employ a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) as a unified, training-free reward model, leveraging its output logits to provide fine-grained feedback. Furthermore, we carefully design a low-variance group filtering mechanism to reduce MLLM scoring noise and stabilize optimization. UniWorld-V2, trained with this framework, achieves \textbf{state-of-the-art} results on the ImgEdit and GEdit-Bench benchmarks, scoring 4.49 and 7.83, respectively. Crucially, our framework is model-agnostic, delivering substantial performance gains when applied to diverse base models like Qwen-Image-Edit and FLUX-Kontext, demonstrating its wide applicability.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Semi-supervised medical image segmentation (SSMIS) seeks to match fully supervised performance while sharply reducing annotation cost. Mainstream SSMIS methods rely on \emph{label-space consistency}, yet they overlook the equally critical \emph{representation-space alignment}. Without harmonizing latent features, models struggle to learn representations that are both discriminative and spatially coherent. To this end, we introduce \textbf{Bilateral Alignment in Representation and Label spaces (BARL)}, a unified framework that couples two collaborative branches and enforces alignment in both spaces. For label-space alignment, inspired by co-training and multi-scale decoding, we devise \textbf{Dual-Path Regularization (DPR)} and \textbf{Progressively Cognitive Bias Correction (PCBC)} to impose fine-grained cross-branch consistency while mitigating error accumulation from coarse to fine scales. For representation-space alignment, we conduct region-level and lesion-instance matching between branches, explicitly capturing the fragmented, complex pathological patterns common in medical imagery. Extensive experiments on four public benchmarks and a proprietary CBCT dataset demonstrate that BARL consistently surpasses state-of-the-art SSMIS methods. Ablative studies further validate the contribution of each component. Code will be released soon.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  While inference-time scaling through search has revolutionized Large Language Models, translating these gains to image generation has proven difficult. Recent attempts to apply search strategies to continuous diffusion models show limited benefits, with simple random sampling often performing best. We demonstrate that the discrete, sequential nature of visual autoregressive models enables effective search for image generation. We show that beam search substantially improves text-to-image generation, enabling a 2B parameter autoregressive model to outperform a 12B parameter diffusion model across benchmarks. Systematic ablations show that this advantage comes from the discrete token space, which allows early pruning and computational reuse, and our verifier analysis highlights trade-offs between speed and reasoning capability. These findings suggest that model architecture, not just scale, is critical for inference-time optimization in visual generation.

  End-to-end autonomous driving systems increasingly rely on vision-centric world models to understand and predict their environment. However, a common ineffectiveness in these models is the full reconstruction of future scenes, which expends significant capacity on redundantly modeling static backgrounds. To address this, we propose IR-WM, an Implicit Residual World Model that focuses on modeling the current state and evolution of the world. IR-WM first establishes a robust bird's-eye-view representation of the current state from the visual observation. It then leverages the BEV features from the previous timestep as a strong temporal prior and predicts only the "residual", i.e., the changes conditioned on the ego-vehicle's actions and scene context. To alleviate error accumulation over time, we further apply an alignment module to calibrate semantic and dynamic misalignments. Moreover, we investigate different forecasting-planning coupling schemes and demonstrate that the implicit future state generated by world models substantially improves planning accuracy. On the nuScenes benchmark, IR-WM achieves top performance in both 4D occupancy forecasting and trajectory planning.

  Vision-and-Language Models (VLMs) have shown impressive capabilities on single-turn benchmarks, yet real-world applications often demand more intricate multi-turn dialogues. Existing multi-turn datasets (e.g, MMDU, ConvBench) only partially capture the breadth and depth of conversational scenarios encountered by users. In this work, we introduce MultiVerse, a novel multi-turn conversation benchmark featuring 647 dialogues - each averaging four turns - derived from a diverse set of 12 popular VLM evaluation benchmarks. With 484 tasks and 484 interaction goals, MultiVerse covers a wide range of topics, from factual knowledge and perception to advanced reasoning tasks such as mathematics and coding. To facilitate robust assessment, we propose a checklist-based evaluation method that leverages GPT-4o as the automated evaluator, measuring performance across 37 key aspects, including perceptual accuracy, linguistic clarity, and factual correctness. We evaluate 18 VLMs on MultiVerse, revealing that even the strongest models (e.g., GPT-4o) achieve only a 50% success rate in complex multi-turn conversations, highlighting the dataset's challenging nature. Notably, we find that providing full dialogue context significantly enhances performance for smaller or weaker models, emphasizing the importance of in-context learning. We believe MultiVerse is a landscape of evaluating multi-turn interaction abilities for VLMs.

  The rapid proliferation of AI-generated content, driven by advances in generative adversarial networks, diffusion models, and multimodal large language models, has made the creation and dissemination of synthetic media effortless, heightening the risks of misinformation, particularly political deepfakes that distort truth and undermine trust in political institutions. In turn, governments, research institutions, and industry have strongly promoted deepfake detection initiatives as solutions. Yet, most existing models are trained and validated on synthetic, laboratory-controlled datasets, limiting their generalizability to the kinds of real-world political deepfakes circulating on social platforms that affect the public. In this work, we introduce the first systematic benchmark based on the Political Deepfakes Incident Database, a curated collection of real-world political deepfakes shared on social media since 2018. Our study includes a systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art deepfake detectors across academia, government, and industry. We find that the detectors from academia and government perform relatively poorly. While paid detection tools achieve relatively higher performance than free-access models, all evaluated detectors struggle to generalize effectively to authentic political deepfakes, and are vulnerable to simple manipulations, especially in the video domain. Results urge the need for politically contextualized deepfake detection frameworks to better safeguard the public in real-world settings.

  Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) are increasingly applied to scientific research, yet it remains unclear whether they can reliably understand and reason over the multimodal complexity of papers. A central challenge lies in detecting and resolving inconsistencies across text, figures, tables, and equations, issues that are often subtle, domain-specific, and ultimately undermine clarity, reproducibility, and trust. Existing benchmarks overlook this issue, either isolating single modalities or relying on synthetic errors that fail to capture real-world complexity. We introduce PRISMM-Bench (Peer-Review-sourced Inconsistency Set for Multimodal Models), the first benchmark grounded in real reviewer-flagged inconsistencies in scientific papers. Through a multi-stage pipeline of review mining, LLM-assisted filtering and human verification, we curate 262 inconsistencies from 242 papers. Based on this set, we design three tasks, namely inconsistency identification, remedy and pair matching, which assess a model's capacity to detect, correct, and reason over inconsistencies across different modalities. Furthermore, to address the notorious problem of choice-only shortcuts in multiple-choice evaluation, where models exploit answer patterns without truly understanding the question, we further introduce structured JSON-based answer representations that minimize linguistic biases by reducing reliance on superficial stylistic cues. We benchmark 21 leading LMMs, including large open-weight models (GLM-4.5V 106B, InternVL3 78B) and proprietary models (Gemini 2.5 Pro, GPT-5 with high reasoning). Results reveal strikingly low performance (26.1-54.2%), underscoring the challenge of multimodal scientific reasoning and motivating progress towards trustworthy scientific assistants.

  Detecting rotated objects accurately and efficiently is a significant challenge in computer vision, particularly in applications such as aerial imagery, remote sensing, and autonomous driving. Although traditional object detection frameworks are effective for axis-aligned objects, they often underperform in scenarios involving rotated objects due to their limitations in capturing orientation variations. This paper introduces an improved loss function aimed at enhancing detection accuracy and robustness by leveraging the Gaussian bounding box representation and Bhattacharyya distance. In addition, we advocate for the use of an anisotropic Gaussian representation to address the issues associated with isotropic variance in square-like objects. Our proposed method addresses these challenges by incorporating a rotation-invariant loss function that effectively captures the geometric properties of rotated objects. We integrate this proposed loss function into state-of-the-art deep learning-based rotated object detection detectors, and extensive experiments demonstrated significant improvements in mean Average Precision metrics compared to existing methods. The results highlight the potential of our approach to establish new benchmark in rotated object detection, with implications for a wide range of applications requiring precise and reliable object localization irrespective of orientation.

  Lines and points are complementary local features, whose combination has proven effective for applications such as SLAM and Structure-from-Motion. The backbone of these pipelines are the local feature matchers, establishing correspondences across images. Traditionally, point and line matching have been treated as independent tasks. Recently, GlueStick proposed a GNN-based network that simultaneously operates on points and lines to establish matches. While running a single joint matching reduced the overall computational complexity, the heavy architecture prevented real-time applications or deployment to edge devices.Inspired by recent progress in point matching, we propose LightGlueStick, a lightweight matcher for points and line segments. The key novel component in our architecture is the Attentional Line Message Passing (ALMP), which explicitly exposes the connectivity of the lines to the network, allowing for efficient communication between nodes. In thorough experiments we show that LightGlueStick establishes a new state-of-the-art across different benchmarks. The code is available atthis https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Bridging the gap between complex human instructions and precise 3D object grounding remains a significant challenge in vision and robotics. Existing 3D segmentation methods often struggle to interpret ambiguous, reasoning-based instructions, while 2D vision-language models that excel at such reasoning lack intrinsic 3D spatial understanding. In this paper, we introduce REALM, an innovative MLLM-agent framework that enables open-world reasoning-based segmentation without requiring extensive 3D-specific post-training. We perform segmentation directly on 3D Gaussian Splatting representations, capitalizing on their ability to render photorealistic novel views that are highly suitable for MLLM comprehension. As directly feeding one or more rendered views to the MLLM can lead to high sensitivity to viewpoint selection, we propose a novel Global-to-Local Spatial Grounding strategy. Specifically, multiple global views are first fed into the MLLM agent in parallel for coarse-level localization, aggregating responses to robustly identify the target object. Then, several close-up novel views of the object are synthesized to perform fine-grained local segmentation, yielding accurate and consistent 3D masks. Extensive experiments show that REALM achieves remarkable performance in interpreting both explicit and implicit instructions across LERF, 3D-OVS, and our newly introduced REALM3D benchmarks. Furthermore, our agent framework seamlessly supports a range of 3D interaction tasks, including object removal, replacement, and style transfer, demonstrating its practical utility and versatility.

  Social manufacturing leverages community collaboration and scattered resources to realize mass individualization in modern industry. However, this paradigm shift also introduces substantial challenges in quality control, particularly in defect detection. The main difficulties stem from three aspects. First, products often have highly customized configurations. Second, production typically involves fragmented, small-batch orders. Third, imaging environments vary considerably across distributed sites. To overcome the scarcity of real-world datasets and tailored algorithms, we introduce the Mass Individualization Robust Anomaly Detection (MIRAD) dataset. As the first benchmark explicitly designed for anomaly detection in social manufacturing, MIRAD captures three critical dimensions of this domain: (1) diverse individualized products with large intra-class variation, (2) data collected from six geographically dispersed manufacturing nodes, and (3) substantial imaging heterogeneity, including variations in lighting, background, and motion conditions. We then conduct extensive evaluations of state-of-the-art (SOTA) anomaly detection methods on MIRAD, covering one-class, multi-class, and zero-shot approaches. Results show a significant performance drop across all models compared with conventional benchmarks, highlighting the unresolved complexities of defect detection in real-world individualized production. By bridging industrial requirements and academic research, MIRAD provides a realistic foundation for developing robust quality control solutions essential for Industry 5.0. The dataset is publicly available atthis https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper investigates the recently emerged problem of Language-assisted Image Clustering (LaIC), where textual semantics are leveraged to improve the discriminability of visual representations to facilitate image clustering. Due to the unavailability of true class names, one of core challenges of LaIC lies in how to filter positive nouns, i.e., those semantically close to the images of interest, from unlabeled wild corpus data. Existing filtering strategies are predominantly based on the off-the-shelf feature space learned by CLIP; however, despite being intuitive, these strategies lack a rigorous theoretical foundation. To fill this gap, we propose a novel gradient-based framework, termed as GradNorm, which is theoretically guaranteed and shows strong empirical performance. In particular, we measure the positiveness of each noun based on the magnitude of gradients back-propagated from the cross-entropy between the predicted target distribution and the softmax output. Theoretically, we provide a rigorous error bound to quantify the separability of positive nouns by GradNorm and prove that GradNorm naturally subsumes existing filtering strategies as extremely special cases of itself. Empirically, extensive experiments show that GradNorm achieves the state-of-the-art clustering performance on various benchmarks.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Ultra-high-resolution text-to-image generation demands both fine-grained texture synthesis and globally coherent structure, yet current diffusion models remain constrained to sub-$1K \times 1K$ resolutions due to the prohibitive quadratic complexity of attention and the scarcity of native $4K$ training data. We present \textbf{Scale-DiT}, a new diffusion framework that introduces hierarchical local attention with low-resolution global guidance, enabling efficient, scalable, and semantically coherent image synthesis at ultra-high resolutions. Specifically, high-resolution latents are divided into fixed-size local windows to reduce attention complexity from quadratic to near-linear, while a low-resolution latent equipped with scaled positional anchors injects global semantics. A lightweight LoRA adaptation bridges global and local pathways during denoising, ensuring consistency across structure and detail. To maximize inference efficiency, we repermute token sequence in Hilbert curve order and implement a fused-kernel for skipping masked operations, resulting in a GPU-friendly design. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Scale-DiT achieves more than $2\times$ faster inference and lower memory usage compared to dense attention baselines, while reliably scaling to $4K \times 4K$ resolution without requiring additional high-resolution training data. On both quantitative benchmarks (FID, IS, CLIP Score) and qualitative comparisons, Scale-DiT delivers superior global coherence and sharper local detail, matching or outperforming state-of-the-art methods that rely on native 4K training. Taken together, these results highlight hierarchical local attention with guided low-resolution anchors as a promising and effective approach for advancing ultra-high-resolution image generation.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Facial Beauty Prediction (FBP) is a complex and challenging computer vision task, aiming to model the subjective and intricate nature of human aesthetic perception. While deep learning models, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), have made significant strides, they often struggle to capture the global, holistic facial features that are critical to human judgment. Vision Transformers (ViT) address this by effectively modeling long-range spatial relationships, but their quadratic complexity can be a bottleneck. This paper introduces a novel, heterogeneous ensemble architecture, \textbf{VM-BeautyNet}, that synergistically fuses the complementary strengths of a Vision Transformer and a Mamba-based Vision model, a recent advancement in State-Space Models (SSMs). The ViT backbone excels at capturing global facial structure and symmetry, while the Mamba backbone efficiently models long-range dependencies with linear complexity, focusing on sequential features and textures. We evaluate our approach on the benchmark SCUT-FBP5500 dataset. Our proposed VM-BeautyNet achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a \textbf{Pearson Correlation (PC) of 0.9212}, a \textbf{Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.2085}, and a \textbf{Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.2698}. Furthermore, through Grad-CAM visualizations, we provide interpretability analysis that confirms the complementary feature extraction of the two backbones, offering new insights into the model's decision-making process and presenting a powerful new architectural paradigm for computational aesthetics.

  _Nyle Siddiqui, Rohit Gupta, Sirnam Swetha, Mubarak Shah_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  State space models (SSMs) have emerged as a competitive alternative to transformers in various tasks. Their linear complexity and hidden-state recurrence make them particularly attractive for modeling long sequences, whereas attention becomes quadratically expensive. However, current training methods for video understanding are tailored towards transformers and fail to fully leverage the unique attributes of SSMs. For example, video models are often trained at a fixed resolution and video length to balance the quadratic scaling of attention cost against performance. Consequently, these models suffer from degraded performance when evaluated on videos with spatial and temporal resolutions unseen during training; a property we call spatio-temporal inflexibility. In the context of action recognition, this severely limits a model's ability to retain performance across both short- and long-form videos. Therefore, we propose a flexible training method that leverages and improves the inherent adaptability of SSMs. Our method samples videos at varying temporal and spatial resolutions during training and dynamically interpolates model weights to accommodate any spatio-temporal scale. This instills our SSM, which we call StretchySnake, with spatio-temporal flexibility and enables it to seamlessly handle videos ranging from short, fine-grained clips to long, complex activities. We introduce and compare five different variants of flexible training, and identify the most effective strategy for video SSMs. On short-action (UCF-101, HMDB-51) and long-action (COIN, Breakfast) benchmarks, StretchySnake outperforms transformer and SSM baselines alike by up to 28%, with strong adaptability to fine-grained actions (SSV2, Diving-48). Therefore, our method provides a simple drop-in training recipe that makes video SSMs more robust, resolution-agnostic, and efficient across diverse action recognition scenarios.

  The limited availability of annotated data in medical imaging makes semi-supervised learning increasingly appealing for its ability to learn from imperfect supervision. Recently, teacher-student frameworks have gained popularity for their training benefits and robust performance. However, jointly optimizing the entire network can hinder convergence and stability, especially in challenging scenarios. To address this for medical image segmentation, we propose DuetMatch, a novel dual-branch semi-supervised framework with asynchronous optimization, where each branch optimizes either the encoder or decoder while keeping the other frozen. To improve consistency under noisy conditions, we introduce Decoupled Dropout Perturbation, enforcing regularization across branches. We also design Pair-wise CutMix Cross-Guidance to enhance model diversity by exchanging pseudo-labels through augmented input pairs. To mitigate confirmation bias from noisy pseudo-labels, we propose Consistency Matching, refining labels using stable predictions from frozen teacher models. Extensive experiments on benchmark brain MRI segmentation datasets, including ISLES2022 and BraTS, show that DuetMatch consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness across diverse semi-supervised segmentation scenarios.

  Well-maintained road networks are crucial for achieving Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 11. Road surface damage not only threatens traffic safety but also hinders sustainable urban development. Accurate detection, however, remains challenging due to the diverse shapes of damages, the difficulty of capturing slender cracks with high aspect ratios, and the high error rates in small-scale damage recognition. To address these issues, we propose StripRFNet, a novel deep neural network comprising three modules: (1) a Shape Perception Module (SPM) that enhances shape discrimination via large separable kernel attention (LSKA) in multi-scale feature aggregation; (2) a Strip Receptive Field Module (SRFM) that employs large strip convolutions and pooling to capture features of slender cracks; and (3) a Small-Scale Enhancement Module (SSEM) that leverages a high-resolution P2 feature map, a dedicated detection head, and dynamic upsampling to improve small-object detection. Experiments on the RDD2022 benchmark show that StripRFNet surpasses existing methods. On the Chinese subset, it improves F1-score, mAP50, and mAP50:95 by 4.4, 2.9, and 3.4 percentage points over the baseline, respectively. On the full dataset, it achieves the highest F1-score of 80.33% compared with CRDDC'2022 participants and ORDDC'2024 Phase 2 results, while maintaining competitive inference speed. These results demonstrate that StripRFNet achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and real-time efficiency, offering a promising tool for intelligent road maintenance and sustainable infrastructure management.

  The sparse cross-modality detector offers more advantages than its counterpart, the Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) detector, particularly in terms of adaptability for downstream tasks and computational cost savings. However, existing sparse detectors overlook the quality of token representation, leaving it with a sub-optimal foreground quality and limited performance. In this paper, we identify that the geometric structure preserved and the class distribution are the key to improving the performance of the sparse detector, and propose a Sparse Selector (SS). The core module of SS is Ray-Aware Supervision (RAS), which preserves rich geometric information during the training stage, and Class-Balanced Supervision, which adaptively reweights the salience of class semantics, ensuring that tokens associated with small objects are retained during token sampling. Thereby, outperforming other sparse multi-modal detectors in the representation of tokens. Additionally, we design Ray Positional Encoding (Ray PE) to address the distribution differences between the LiDAR modality and the image. Finally, we integrate the aforementioned module into an end-to-end sparse multi-modality detector, dubbed CrossRay3D. Experiments show that, on the challenging nuScenes benchmark, CrossRay3D achieves state-of-the-art performance with 72.4 mAP and 74.7 NDS, while running 1.84 faster than other leading methods. Moreover, CrossRay3D demonstrates strong robustness even in scenarios where LiDAR or camera data are partially or entirely missing.

  Modeling reflections from 2D images is essential for photorealistic rendering and novel view synthesis. Recent approaches enhance Gaussian primitives with reflection-related material attributes to enable physically based rendering (PBR) with Gaussian Splatting. However, the material inference often lacks sufficient constraints, especially under limited environment modeling, resulting in illumination aliasing and reduced generalization. In this work, we revisit the problem from a multi-view perspective and show that multi-view consistent material inference with more physically-based environment modeling is key to learning accurate reflections with Gaussian Splatting. To this end, we enforce 2D Gaussians to produce multi-view consistent material maps during deferred shading. We also track photometric variations across views to identify highly reflective regions, which serve as strong priors for reflection strength terms. To handle indirect illumination caused by inter-object occlusions, we further introduce an environment modeling strategy through ray tracing with 2DGS, enabling photorealistic rendering of indirect radiance. Experiments on widely used benchmarks show that our method faithfully recovers both illumination and geometry, achieving state-of-the-art rendering quality in novel views synthesis.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this work, we first revisit the sampling issues in current autoregressive (AR) image generation models and identify that image tokens, unlike text tokens, exhibit lower information density and non-uniform spatial distribution. Accordingly, we present an entropy-informed decoding strategy that facilitates higher autoregressive generation quality with faster synthesis speed. Specifically, the proposed method introduces two main innovations: 1) dynamic temperature control guided by spatial entropy of token distributions, enhancing the balance between content diversity, alignment accuracy, and structural coherence in both mask-based and scale-wise models, without extra computational overhead, and 2) entropy-aware acceptance rules in speculative decoding, achieving near-lossless generation at about 85\% of the inference cost of conventional acceleration methods. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks using diverse AR image generation models demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our approach in enhancing both generation quality and sampling speed.

  Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is essential for reliably deploying machine learning models in the wild. Yet, most methods treat large pre-trained models as monolithic encoders and rely solely on their final-layer representations for detection. We challenge this wisdom. We reveal the \textit{intermediate layers} of pre-trained models, shaped by residual connections that subtly transform input projections, \textit{can} encode \textit{surprisingly rich and diverse signals} for detecting distributional shifts. Importantly, to exploit latent representation diversity across layers, we introduce an entropy-based criterion to \textit{automatically} identify layers offering the most complementary information in a training-free setting -- \textit{without access to OOD data}. We show that selectively incorporating these intermediate representations can increase the accuracy of OOD detection by up to \textbf{$10\%$} in far-OOD and over \textbf{$7\%$} in near-OOD benchmarks compared to state-of-the-art training-free methods across various model architectures and training objectives. Our findings reveal a new avenue for OOD detection research and uncover the impact of various training objectives and model architectures on confidence-based OOD detection methods.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce a new interpretation of the attention matrix as a discrete-time Markov chain. Our interpretation sheds light on common operations involving attention scores such as selection, summation, and averaging in a unified framework. It further extends them by considering indirect attention, propagated through the Markov chain, as opposed to previous studies that only model immediate effects. Our key observation is that tokens linked to semantically similar regions form metastable states, i.e., regions where attention tends to concentrate, while noisy attention scores dissipate. Metastable states and their prevalence can be easily computed through simple matrix multiplication and eigenanalysis, respectively. Using these lightweight tools, we demonstrate state-of-the-art zero-shot segmentation. Lastly, we define TokenRank -- the steady state vector of the Markov chain, which measures global token importance. We show that TokenRank enhances unconditional image generation, improving both quality (IS) and diversity (FID), and can also be incorporated into existing segmentation techniques to improve their performance over existing benchmarks. We believe our framework offers a fresh view of how tokens are being attended in modern visual transformers.

  Recent breakthroughs in reasoning language models have significantly advanced text-based reasoning. On the other hand, Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) still lag behind, hindered by their outdated internal LLMs. Upgrading these is often prohibitively expensive, as it requires complete vision-language alignment retraining which is costly. To address this issue, we introduce Perception-Reasoning Decoupling, which modularizes the MLLM's reasoning component and makes it easily replaceable. This approach redefines the MLLM's role to convert multi-modal inputs into detailed textual outputs that can be processed by any powerful, external, text-only LLM reasoners. To align the MLLM's perceptual output with the final reasoning task, we propose a novel reinforcement learning algorithm called Visual Perception Optimization (VPO). VPO rewards the MLLM based on the correctness of answers generated by the external reasoner to produce faithful and query-relevant captions. Together, this decoupling pipeline and VPO form our Reasoning-Aligned PerceptIon Decoupling (RAPID) approach. Empirical results show that RAPID achieves significant performance gains on multi-modal reasoning benchmarks. Crucially, RAPID enables a novel inference-time scaling paradigm: Once trained with VPO, the MLLM can be paired with any state-of-the-art LLM reasoner for consistent performance improvement without retraining.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Computer-Aided Design (CAD) plays a pivotal role in industrial manufacturing. Orthographic projection reasoning underpins the entire CAD workflow, encompassing design, manufacturing, and simulation. However, prevailing deep-learning approaches employ standard 3D reconstruction pipelines as an alternative, which often introduce imprecise dimensions and limit the parametric editability required for CAD workflows. Recently, some researchers adopt vision-language models (VLMs), particularly supervised fine-tuning (SFT), to tackle CAD-related challenges. SFT shows promise but often devolves into pattern memorization, yielding poor out-of-distribution performance on complex reasoning tasks. To address these gaps, we introduce CReFT-CAD, a two-stage fine-tuning paradigm that first employs a curriculum-driven reinforcement learning stage with difficulty-aware rewards to build reasoning ability steadily, and then applies supervised post-tuning to hone instruction following and semantic extraction. Complementing this, we release TriView2CAD, the first large-scale, open-source benchmark for orthographic projection reasoning, comprising 200,000 synthetic and 3,000 real-world orthographic projections with precise dimension annotations and six interoperable data modalities. We benchmark leading VLMs on orthographic projection reasoning and demonstrate that CReFT-CAD substantially improves reasoning accuracy and out-of-distribution generalizability in real-world scenarios, offering valuable insights for advancing CAD reasoning research.

  While reinforcement learning (RL) over chains of thought has significantly advanced language models in tasks such as mathematics and coding, visual reasoning introduces added complexity by requiring models to direct visual attention, interpret perceptual inputs, and ground abstract reasoning in spatial evidence. We introduce ViGoRL (Visually Grounded Reinforcement Learning), a vision-language model trained with RL to explicitly anchor each reasoning step to specific visual coordinates. Inspired by human visual decision-making, ViGoRL learns to produce spatially grounded reasoning traces, guiding visual attention to task-relevant regions at each step. When fine-grained exploration is required, our novel multi-turn RL framework enables the model to dynamically zoom into predicted coordinates as reasoning unfolds. Across a diverse set of visual reasoning benchmarks--including SAT-2 and BLINK for spatial reasoning, V*bench for visual search, and ScreenSpot and VisualWebArena for web-based grounding--ViGoRL consistently outperforms both supervised fine-tuning and conventional RL baselines that lack explicit grounding mechanisms. Incorporating multi-turn RL with zoomed-in visual feedback significantly improves ViGoRL's performance on localizing small GUI elements and visual search, achieving 86.4% on V*Bench. Additionally, we find that grounding amplifies other visual behaviors such as region exploration, grounded subgoal setting, and visual verification. Finally, human evaluations show that the model's visual references are not only spatially accurate but also helpful for understanding model reasoning steps. Our results show that visually grounded RL is a strong paradigm for imbuing models with general-purpose visual reasoning.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  6DoF object pose estimation is fundamental to robotic grasp tasks. While recent learning-based methods achieve high accuracy, their computational demands hinder deployment on resource-constrained mobile platforms. In this work, we revisit the classical keypoint matching paradigm and propose GMatch, a lightweight, geometry-constrained keypoint matcher that can run efficiently on embedded CPU-only platforms. GMatch works with keypoint descriptors and it uses a set of geometric constraints to establishes inherent ambiguities between features extracted by descriptors, thus giving a globally consistent correspondences from which 6DoF pose can be easily solved. We benchmark GMatch on the HOPE and YCB-Video datasets, where our method beats existing keypoint matchers (both feature-based and geometry-based) among three commonly used descriptors and approaches the SOTA zero-shot method on texture-rich objects with much more humble devices. The method is further deployed on a LoCoBot mobile manipulator, enabling a one-shot grasp pipeline that demonstrates high task success rates in real-world experiments. In a word, by its lightweight and white-box nature, GMatch offers a practical solution for resource-limited robotic systems, and although currently bottlenecked by descriptor quality, the framework presents a promising direction towards robust yet efficient pose estimation.Code will be released soon under Mozilla Public License.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Personalized models have demonstrated remarkable success in understanding and generating concepts provided by users. However, existing methods use separate concept tokens for understanding and generation, treating these tasks in isolation. This may result in limitations for generating images with complex prompts. For example, given the concept $\langle bo\rangle$, generating "$\langle bo\rangle$ wearing its hat" without additional textual descriptions of its hat. We call this kind of generation \textit{\textbf{personalized attribute-reasoning generation}}. To address the limitation, we present UniCTokens, a novel framework that effectively integrates personalized information into a unified vision language model (VLM) for understanding and generation. UniCTokens trains a set of unified concept tokens to leverage complementary semantics, boosting two personalized tasks. Moreover, we propose a progressive training strategy with three stages: understanding warm-up, bootstrapping generation from understanding, and deepening understanding from generation to enhance mutual benefits between both tasks. To quantitatively evaluate the unified VLM personalization, we present UnifyBench, the first benchmark for assessing concept understanding, concept generation, and attribute-reasoning generation. Experimental results on UnifyBench indicate that UniCTokens shows competitive performance compared to leading methods in concept understanding, concept generation, and achieving state-of-the-art results in personalized attribute-reasoning generation. Our research demonstrates that enhanced understanding improves generation, and the generation process can yield valuable insights into understanding.

  We present GaSLight, a method that generates spatially-varying lighting from regular images. Our method proposes using HDR Gaussian Splats as light source representation, marking the first time regular images can serve as light sources in a 3D renderer. Our two-stage process first enhances the dynamic range of images plausibly and accurately by leveraging the priors embedded in diffusion models. Next, we employ Gaussian Splats to model 3D lighting, achieving spatially variant lighting. Our approach yields state-of-the-art results on HDR estimations and their applications in illuminating virtual objects and scenes. To facilitate the benchmarking of images as light sources, we introduce a novel dataset of calibrated and unsaturated HDR to evaluate images as light sources. We assess our method using a combination of this novel dataset and an existing dataset from the literature. Project page:this https URL

  Recent advances in image and video generation raise hopes that these models possess world modeling capabilities, the ability to generate realistic, physically plausible videos. This could revolutionize applications in robotics, autonomous driving, and scientific simulation. However, before treating these models as world models, we must ask: Do they adhere to physical conservation laws? To answer this, we introduce Morpheus, a benchmark for evaluating video generation models on physical reasoning. It features 80 real-world videos capturing physical phenomena, guided by conservation laws. Since artificial generations lack ground truth, we assess physical plausibility using physics-informed metrics evaluated with respect to infallible conservation laws known per physical setting, leveraging advances in physics-informed neural networks and vision-language foundation models. Our findings reveal that even with advanced prompting and video conditioning, current models struggle to encode physical principles despite generating aesthetically pleasing videos.

  The objective in this paper is to improve the performance of text-to-image retrieval. To this end, we introduce a new framework that can boost the performance of large-scale pre-trained vision-language models, so that they can be used for text-to-image re-ranking. The approach, Enhanced Language-Image Pre-training (ELIP), uses the text query, via a simple MLP mapping network, to predict a set of visual prompts to condition the ViT image encoding. ELIP can easily be applied to the commonly used CLIP, SigLIP and BLIP-2 networks. To train the architecture with limited computing resources, we develop a 'student friendly' best practice, involving global hard sample mining, and curation of a large-scale dataset. On the evaluation side, we set up two new out-of-distribution (OOD) benchmarks, Occluded COCO and ImageNet-R, to assess the zero-shot generalisation of the models to different domains. The results demonstrate that ELIP significantly boosts CLIP/SigLIP/SigLIP-2 text-to-image retrieval performance and outperforms BLIP-2 on several benchmarks, as well as providing an easy means to adapt to OOD datasets.

  Existing recommendation systems either rely on user interaction logs, such as online shopping history for shopping recommendations, or focus on text signals. However, item-based histories are not always accessible, and are not generalizable for multimodal recommendation. We hypothesize that a user's visual history -- comprising images from daily life -- can offer rich, task-agnostic insights into their interests and preferences, and thus be leveraged for effective personalization. To this end, we propose VisualLens, a novel framework that leverages multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to enable personalization using task-agnostic visual history. VisualLens extracts, filters, and refines a spectrum user profile from the visual history to support personalized recommendation. We created two new benchmarks, Google-Review-V and Yelp-V, with task-agnostic visual histories, and show that VisualLens improves over state-of-the-art item-based multimodal recommendations by 5-10% on Hit@3, and outperforms GPT-4o by 2-5%. Further analysis shows that VisualLens is robust across varying history lengths and excels at adapting to both longer histories and unseen content categories.

  Deep neural networks often encounter significant performance drops while facing with domain shifts between training (source) and test (target) data. To address this issue, Test Time Adaptation (TTA) methods have been proposed to adapt pre-trained source model to handle out-of-distribution streaming target data. Although these methods offer some relief, they lack a reliable mechanism for domain shift correction, which can often be erratic in real-world applications. In response, we develop Few-Shot Test Time Adaptation (FS-TTA), a novel and practical setting that utilizes a few-shot support set on top of TTA. Adhering to the principle of few inputs, big gains, FS-TTA reduces blind exploration in unseen target domains. Furthermore, we propose a two-stage framework to tackle FS-TTA, including (i) fine-tuning the pre-trained source model with few-shot support set, along with using feature diversity augmentation module to avoid overfitting, (ii) implementing test time adaptation based on prototype memory bank guidance to produce high quality pseudo-label for model adaptation. Through extensive experiments on three cross-domain classification benchmarks, we demonstrate the superior performance and reliability of our FS-TTA and framework.

  Predicting cancer treatment outcomes requires models that are both accurate and interpretable, particularly in the presence of heterogeneous clinical data. While large language models (LLMs) have shown strong performance in biomedical NLP, they often lack structured reasoning capabilities critical for high-stakes decision support. We present a unified, multi-task learning framework that aligns autoregressive LLMs with clinical reasoning for outcome prediction on the MSK-CHORD dataset. Our models are trained to jointly perform binary survival classification, continuous survival time regression, and natural language rationale generation. We evaluate three alignment strategies: (1) standard supervised fine-tuning (SFT), (2) SFT with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting to elicit step-by-step reasoning, and (3) Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), a reinforcement learning method that aligns model outputs to expert-derived reasoning trajectories. Experiments with LLaMa3-8B and Med42-8B backbones demonstrate that CoT prompting improves F1 by +6.0 and reduces MAE by 12%, while GRPO achieves state-of-the-art interpretability and predictive performance across BLEU, ROUGE, and BERTScore. We further show that existing biomedical LLMs often fail to produce valid reasoning traces due to architectural constraints. Our findings underscore the importance of reasoning-aware alignment in multi-task clinical modeling and set a new benchmark for interpretable, trustworthy LLMs in precision oncology.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Detecting AI-involved text is essential for combating misinformation, plagiarism, and academic misconduct. However, AI text generation includes diverse collaborative processes (AI-written text edited by humans, human-written text edited by AI, and AI-generated text refined by other AI), where various or even new LLMs could be involved. Texts generated through these varied processes exhibit complex characteristics, presenting significant challenges for detection. Current methods model these processes rather crudely, primarily employing binary classification (purely human vs. AI-involved) or multi-classification (treating human-AI collaboration as a new class). We observe that representations of texts generated through different processes exhibit inherent clustering relationships. Therefore, we propose DETree, a novel approach that models the relationships among different processes as a Hierarchical Affinity Tree structure, and introduces a specialized loss function that aligns text representations with this tree. To facilitate this learning, we developed RealBench, a comprehensive benchmark dataset that automatically incorporates a wide spectrum of hybrid texts produced through various human-AI collaboration processes. Our method improves performance in hybrid text detection tasks and significantly enhances robustness and generalization in out-of-distribution scenarios, particularly in few-shot learning conditions, further demonstrating the promise of training-based approaches in OOD settings.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Toxic comment detection remains a challenging task, where transformer-based models (e.g., BERT) incur high computational costs and degrade on minority toxicity classes, while classical ensembles lack semantic adaptability. We propose xLSTM, a parameter-efficient and theoretically grounded framework that unifies cosine-similarity gating, adaptive feature prioritization, and principled class rebalancing. A learnable reference vector {v} in {R}^d modulates contextual embeddings via cosine similarity, amplifying toxic cues and attenuating benign signals to yield stronger gradients under severe class imbalance. xLSTM integrates multi-source embeddings (GloVe, FastText, BERT CLS) through a projection layer, a character-level BiLSTM for morphological cues, embedding-space SMOTE for minority augmentation, and adaptive focal loss with dynamic class weighting. On the Jigsaw Toxic Comment benchmark, xLSTM attains 96.0% accuracy and 0.88 macro-F1, outperforming BERT by 33% on threat and 28% on identity_hate categories, with 15 times fewer parameters and 50ms inference latency. Cosine gating contributes a +4.8% F1 gain in ablations. The results establish a new efficiency adaptability frontier, demonstrating that lightweight, theoretically informed architectures can surpass large pretrained models on imbalanced, domain-specific NLP tasks.

  The increasing use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in agentic applications highlights the need for robust safety guard models. While content safety in English is well-studied, non-English languages lack similar advancements due to the high cost of collecting culturally aligned labeled datasets. We present CultureGuard, a novel solution for curating culturally aligned, high-quality safety datasets across multiple languages. Our approach introduces a four-stage synthetic data generation and filtering pipeline: cultural data segregation, cultural data adaptation, machine translation, and quality filtering. This pipeline enables the conversion and expansion of the Nemotron-Content-Safety-Dataset-V2 English safety dataset into eight distinct languages: Arabic, German, Spanish, French, Hindi, Japanese, Thai, and Chinese. The resulting dataset, Nemotron-Safety-Guard-Dataset-v3, comprises 386,661 samples in 9 languages and facilitates the training of Llama-3.1-Nemotron-Safety-Guard-8B-v3 via LoRA-based fine-tuning. The final model achieves state-of-the-art performance on several multilingual content safety benchmarks. Furthermore, we show our moderately multilingual fine-tuning enables robust cross-lingual transfer and strong zero-shot generalization to unseen languages. We also benchmark the latest open LLMs on multilingual safety and observe that these LLMs are more prone to give unsafe responses when prompted in non-English languages. This work advances multilingual LLM safety by enabling the development of culturally aware safety guard models.

  The capabilities of large language models (LLMs) are widely regarded as relying on autoregressive models (ARMs). We challenge this notion by introducing LLaDA, a diffusion model trained from scratch under the pre-training and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) paradigm. LLaDA employs a forward data masking process and a reverse generation process, parameterized by a Transformer to predict masked tokens. It provides a principled generative approach for probabilistic inference by optimizing a likelihood lower bound. Across extensive benchmarks on general tasks, math, code, and so on, LLaDA demonstrates strong scalability and performs comparably to our self-constructed ARM baselines. Remarkably, LLaDA 8B is competitive with strong LLMs like LLaMA3 8B in in-context learning and, after SFT, exhibits impressive instruction-following abilities in case studies such as multi-turn dialogue. Moreover, LLaDA addresses the reversal curse, surpassing GPT-4o in a reversal poem completion task. Our findings show the promise of diffusion models for language modeling at scale and challenge the common assumption that core LLM capabilities discussed above inherently depend on ARMs. Project page and codes:this https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Self-Refinement refers to a model's ability to revise its own responses to produce improved outputs. This capability can also serve as a fundamental mechanism for Self-Improvement, for example, by reconstructing datasets with refined results to enhance intrinsic model performance. However, our comprehensive experiments reveal that large language models (LLMs) show no clear evidence of inherent Self-Refinement and may even experience response quality degradation after Self-Refinement. To address this issue, we propose EVOLVE, a simple and effective framework for eliciting and tracking the evolution of Self-Refinement through iterative training. We first explore optimization methods during training to activate the model's Self-Refinement capability. Then, at inference, we investigate various generation strategies to further enhance and utilize Self-Refinement while supplying the necessary data for training. Through synergistic optimization of training and inference stages, we continually evolve the model's Self-Refinement ability, enabling it to better refine its own responses. Moreover, we demonstrate the potential of leveraging Self-Refinement to achieve broader Self-Improvement of intrinsic model abilities. Experiments show that the evolved Self-Refinement ability enables the Llama-3.1-8B base model to surpass GPT-4o, achieving 62.3% length-controlled and 63.3% raw win rates on AlpacaEval 2, and 50.3% on Arena-Hard. It also generalizes effectively to out-of-domain reasoning tasks, improving performance on mathematical reasoning benchmarks such as GSM8K and MATH.

In this paper, we introduce PertBench, a comprehensive benchmark dataset that includes a wide range of input perturbations, designed to systematically evaluate the robustness of current auto-prompting techniques. Our analysis reveals substantial vulnerabilities in existing prompt generation strategies, where even minor modifications to the prompt can lead to significant differences in model output. To address this issue, we propose PGO, a gradient-free prompt generation framework that leverages perturbation types as pseudo-gradient signals to guide LLMs in producing more robust prompts. In contrast to existing methods that assess prompt quality only on clean, well-structured inputs, our approach explicitly emphasizes robustness under noisy and perturbed conditions. Extensive experiments across diverse tasks and multiple LLMs show PGO consistently outperforms previous methods in maintaining performance under input perturbations.

  Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) are susceptible to hallucinations, where generated responses seem semantically plausible yet exhibit little or no relevance to the input image. Previous studies reveal that this issue primarily stems from LVLMs' over-reliance on language priors while disregarding the visual information during decoding. To alleviate this issue, we introduce a novel Conditional Pointwise Mutual Information (C-PMI) calibrated decoding strategy, which adaptively strengthens the mutual dependency between generated texts and input images to mitigate hallucinations. Unlike existing methods solely focusing on text token sampling, we propose to jointly model the contributions of visual and textual tokens to C-PMI, formulating hallucination mitigation as a bi-level optimization problem aimed at maximizing mutual information. To solve it, we design a token purification mechanism that dynamically regulates the decoding process by sampling text tokens remaining maximally relevant to the given image, while simultaneously refining image tokens most pertinent to the generated response. Extensive experiments across various benchmarks reveal that the proposed method significantly reduces hallucinations in LVLMs while preserving decoding efficiency.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong performance but often lack interpretable reasoning. This paper introduces the Multi-Agent Collaboration Framework for Diverse Thinking Modes (DiMo), which enhances both performance and interpretability by simulating a structured debate among four specialized LLM agents. Each agent embodies a distinct reasoning paradigm, allowing the framework to collaboratively explore diverse cognitive approaches. Through iterative debate, agents challenge and refine initial responses, yielding more robust conclusions and an explicit, auditable reasoning chain. Across six benchmarks and under a unified open-source setup, DiMo improves accuracy over widely used single-model and debate baselines, with the largest gains on math. We position DiMo as a semantics-aware, Web-native multi-agent framework: it models human-machine intelligence with LLM agents that produce semantically typed, URL-annotated evidence chains for explanations and user-friendly interactions. Although our experiments use standard reasoning benchmarks, the framework is designed to be instantiated over Web corpora and knowledge graphs, combining retrieval-augmented reasoning with structured justifications that downstream systems can inspect and reuse.

  Finetuning specialized generative evaluators has emerged as a popular paradigm to meet the increasing demand for scalable evaluation during both training and test-time. However, recent work has largely focused on applying new methodology, such as reinforcement learning (RL), to training evaluators, shying away from large-scale, data-driven development. In this work, we focus on data scaling, curating a set of 2.5M samples spanning five unique evaluation tasks (pairwise, step-level, reference-free and reference-based verification, and single rating) and multiple domains focused on reasoning evaluation. With our data, we train Foundational Automatic Reasoning Evaluators (FARE), a family of 8B and 20B (with 3.6B active) parameter evaluators, with a simple iterative rejection-sampling supervised finetuning (SFT) approach. FARE-8B challenges larger specialized RL-trained evaluators and FARE-20B sets the new standard for open-source evaluators, surpassing specialized 70B+ evaluators. Beyond static benchmarks, we evaluate FARE in real-world tasks: As inference-time rerankers, FARE-20B achieves near-oracle performance on MATH. As verifiers in RL training, FARE improves the downstream RL-trained model performance by up to 14.1% vs. string-matching verifiers. When initialized from FARE, a continually-finetuned FARE-Code outperforms gpt-oss-20B by 65% on evaluating test-case quality.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently achieved remarkable performance in long-context understanding. However, current long-context LLM benchmarks are limited by rigid context length, labor-intensive annotation, and the pressing challenge of label leakage issues during LLM training. Therefore, we propose \textsc{AcademicEval}, a live benchmark for evaluating LLMs over long-context generation tasks. \textsc{AcademicEval} adopts papers on arXiv to introduce several academic writing tasks with long-context inputs, \textit{i.e.}, \textsc{Title}, \textsc{Abstract}, \textsc{Introduction}, and \textsc{Related Work}, which cover a wide range of abstraction levels and require no manual labeling. Moreover, \textsc{AcademicEval} integrates high-quality and expert-curated few-shot demonstrations from a collected co-author graph to enable flexible context length. Especially, \textsc{AcademicEval} features an efficient live evaluation, ensuring no label leakage. We conduct a holistic evaluation on \textsc{AcademicEval}, and the results illustrate that LLMs perform poorly on tasks with hierarchical abstraction levels and tend to struggle with long few-shot demonstrations, highlighting the challenge of our benchmark. Through experimental analysis, we also reveal some insights for enhancing LLMs' long-context modeling capabilities. Code is available atthis https URL

  Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) presents a rich and structurally unique knowledge system that challenges conventional applications of large language models (LLMs). Although previous TCM-specific LLMs have shown progress through supervised fine-tuning, they often face limitations in alignment, data quality, and evaluation consistency. In this study, we introduce Ladder-base, the first TCM-focused LLM trained with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), a reinforcement learning method that improves reasoning and factual consistency by optimizing response selection based on intra-group comparisons. Ladder-base is built upon the Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct foundation model and trained exclusively on the textual subset of the TCM-Ladder benchmark, using 80 percent of the data for training and the remaining 20 percent split evenly between validation and test sets. Through standardized evaluation, Ladder-base demonstrates superior performance across multiple reasoning metrics when compared to both state-of-the-art general-purpose LLMs such as GPT-4, Gemini 2.5, Claude 3, and Qwen3 and domain-specific TCM models including BenTsao, HuatuoGPT2, and Zhongjing. These findings suggest that GRPO provides an effective and efficient strategy for aligning LLMs with expert-level reasoning in traditional medical domains and supports the development of trustworthy and clinically grounded TCM artificial intelligence systems.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Designing effective agentic systems requires the seamless composition and integration of agents, tools, and models within dynamic and uncertain environments. Most existing methods rely on static, semantic retrieval approaches for tool or agent discovery. However, effective reuse and composition of existing components remain challenging due to incomplete capability descriptions and the limitations of retrieval methods. Component selection suffers because the decisions are not based on capability, cost, and real-time utility. To address these challenges, we introduce a structured, automated framework for agentic system composition that is inspired by the knapsack problem. Our framework enables a composer agent to systematically identify, select, and assemble an optimal set of agentic components by jointly considering performance, budget constraints, and compatibility. By dynamically testing candidate components and modeling their utility in real-time, our approach streamlines the assembly of agentic systems and facilitates scalable reuse of resources. Empirical evaluation with Claude 3.5 Sonnet across five benchmarking datasets shows that our online-knapsack-based composer consistently lies on the Pareto frontier, achieving higher success rates at significantly lower component costs compared to our baselines. In the single-agent setup, the online knapsack composer shows a success rate improvement of up to 31.6% in comparison to the retrieval baselines. In multi-agent systems, the online knapsack composer increases success rate from 37% to 87% when agents are selected from an agent inventory of 100+ agents. The substantial performance gap confirms the robust adaptability of our method across diverse domains and budget constraints.

  Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) can extract interpretable features from large language models (LLMs) without supervision. However, their effectiveness in downstream steering tasks is limited by the requirement for contrastive datasets or large activation storage. To address these limitations, we propose CorrSteer, which selects features by correlating sample correctness with SAE activations from generated tokens at inference time. This approach uses only inference-time activations to extract more relevant features, thereby reducing spurious correlations. It also obtains steering coefficients from average activations, automating the entire pipeline. Our method shows improved task performance on QA, bias mitigation, jailbreaking prevention, and reasoning benchmarks on Gemma-2 2B and LLaMA-3.1 8B, notably achieving a +3.3% improvement in MMLU performance with 4000 samples and a +27.2% improvement in HarmBench with only 108 samples. Selected features demonstrate semantically meaningful patterns aligned with each task's requirements, revealing the underlying capabilities that drive performance. Our work establishes correlation-based selection as an effective and scalable approach for automated SAE steering across language model applications.

  The alignment of pre-trained LLMs continues to draw significant attention from both industry and academia, aiming to ensure responses that are helpful, harmless, and honest. However, identifying a point in the model's representation subspace that simultaneously satisfies all these properties remains challenging. H3Fusion addresses this challenge by introducing a mixture-of-experts (MoE)-based fusion mechanism that models alignment as a controllable drift within the subspace, guided by a drift-regularization loss to balance competing alignment dimensions. Furthermore, we formulate the alignment by finding a dual objective of harnessing the distance of generated embeddings and alignment embeddings, and introduce a gating loss by canalizing the activations on the contributing experts. Extensive evaluations of three benchmark datasets show that H3Fusion is more helpful, less harmful, and more honest in three aspects: it outperforms each individually aligned model by 11.37%, and provides stronger robustness compared to the state-of-the-art LLM ensemble approaches by 13.77% and model-merging approaches by 6.18%.

  This work studies the problem of large language model (LLM) unlearning, aiming to remove unwanted data influences (e.g., copyrighted or harmful content) while preserving model utility. Despite the increasing demand for unlearning, a technically-grounded optimization framework is lacking. Gradient ascent (GA)-type methods, though widely used, are suboptimal as they reverse the learning process without controlling optimization divergence (i.e., deviation from the pre-trained state), leading to risks of over-forgetting and potential model collapse. Negative preference optimization (NPO) has been proposed to address this issue and is considered one of the state-of-the-art LLM unlearning approaches. In this work, we revisit NPO and identify another critical issue: reference model bias. This bias arises from using the reference model (i.e., the model prior to unlearning) to evaluate the unlearning success, which can compromise NPO's effectiveness. Specifically, it leads to (a) uneven allocation of optimization power across forget data with varying difficulty levels and (b) ineffective gradient weight smoothing during the early stages of unlearning optimization. To overcome these challenges, we propose a simple yet effective unlearning optimization framework, called SimNPO, showing that `simplicity' in removing the reliance on a reference model (through the lens of simple preference optimization) benefits unlearning. We provide deeper insights into SimNPO's advantages through an analysis based on mixtures of Markov chains. Extensive experiments further validate SimNPO's efficacy on benchmarks like TOFU and MUSE, as well as its robustness against relearning attacks. Codes are available atthis https URL.

  While recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have advanced automated ECG interpretation, they still face two key limitations: (1) insufficient multimodal synergy between time series signals and visual ECG representations, and (2) limited explainability in linking diagnoses to granular waveform evidence. We introduce GEM, the first MLLM unifying ECG time series, 12-lead ECG images and text for grounded and clinician-aligned ECG interpretation. GEM enables feature-grounded analysis, evidence-driven reasoning, and a clinician-like diagnostic process through three core innovations: a dual-encoder framework extracting complementary time series and image features, cross-modal alignment for effective multimodal understanding, and knowledge-guided instruction generation for generating high-granularity grounding data (ECG-Grounding) linking diagnoses to measurable parameters ($e.g.$, QRS/PR Intervals). Additionally, we propose the Grounded ECG Understanding task, a clinically motivated benchmark designed to comprehensively assess the MLLM's capability in grounded ECG understanding. Experimental results on both existing and our proposed benchmarks show GEM significantly improves predictive performance (CSN $7.4\% \uparrow$), explainability ($22.7\% \uparrow$), and grounding ($24.8\% \uparrow$), making it more suitable for real-world clinical applications.

While autonomous agents show promise, they often struggle with domain-specific nuances, intent alignment, and enterprise integration. We present Enterprise Deep Research (EDR), a multi-agent system that integrates (1) a Master Planning Agent for adaptive query decomposition, (2) four specialized search agents (General, Academic, GitHub, LinkedIn), (3) an extensible MCP-based tool ecosystem supporting NL2SQL, file analysis, and enterprise workflows, (4) a Visualization Agent for data-driven insights, and (5) a reflection mechanism that detects knowledge gaps and updates research direction with optional human-in-the-loop steering guidance. These components enable automated report generation, real-time streaming, and seamless enterprise deployment, as validated on internal datasets. On open-ended benchmarks including DeepResearch Bench and DeepConsult, EDR outperforms state-of-the-art agentic systems without any human steering.

  Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a critical task that requires substantial annotated data, making it challenging in low-resource scenarios where label acquisition is expensive. While zero-shot and instruction-tuned approaches have made progress, they often fail to generalize to domain-specific entities and do not effectively utilize limited available data. We present a lightweight few-shot NER framework that addresses these challenges through two key innovations: (1) a new instruction tuning template with a simplified output format that combines principles from prior IT approaches to leverage the large context window of recent state-of-the-art LLMs; (2) introducing a strategic data augmentation technique that preserves entity information while paraphrasing the surrounding context, thereby expanding our training data without compromising semantic relationships. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that our method achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art models on few-shot and zero-shot tasks, with our few-shot approach attaining an average F1 score of 80.1 on the CrossNER datasets. Models trained with our paraphrasing approach show consistent improvements in F1 scores of up to 17 points over baseline versions, offering a promising solution for groups with limited NER training data and compute power.

  Large language models (LLMs) are transforming education by answering questions, explaining complex concepts, and generating content across a wide range of subjects. Despite strong performance on academic benchmarks, they often fail to tailor responses to students' grade levels. This is a critical need in K-12 education, where age-appropriate vocabulary and explanation are essential for effective learning. Existing models frequently produce outputs that are too advanced or vague for younger learners, and there are no standardized benchmarks to evaluate their ability to adjust across cognitive and developmental stages. To address this gap, we introduce EduAdapt, a benchmark of nearly 48k grade-labeled QA pairs across nine science subjects, spanning Grades 1-12 and grouped into four grade levels. We evaluate a diverse set of open-source LLMs on EduAdapt and find that while larger models generally perform better, they still struggle with generating suitable responses for early-grade students (Grades 1-5). Our work presents the first dataset and evaluation framework for assessing grade-level adaptability in LLMs, aiming to foster more developmentally aligned educational AI systems through better training and prompting strategies.

  While reasoning-based large language models excel at complex tasks through an internal, structured thinking process, a concerning phenomenon has emerged that such a thinking process can aggregate social stereotypes, leading to biased outcomes. However, the underlying behaviours of these language models in social bias scenarios remain underexplored. In this work, we systematically investigate mechanisms within the thinking process behind this phenomenon and uncover two failure patterns that drive social bias aggregation: 1) stereotype repetition, where the model relies on social stereotypes as its primary justification, and 2) irrelevant information injection, where it fabricates or introduces new details to support a biased narrative. Building on these insights, we introduce a lightweight prompt-based mitigation approach that queries the model to review its own initial reasoning against these specific failure patterns. Experiments on question answering (BBQ and StereoSet) and open-ended (BOLD) benchmarks show that our approach effectively reduces bias while maintaining or improving accuracy.

  Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated sophisticated capabilities, including the ability to process and comprehend extended contexts. These emergent capabilities necessitate rigorous evaluation methods to effectively assess their performance in long-context understanding. In this paper, we present \textbf{LC-Eval}, a bilingual, multi-task evaluation benchmark designed to evaluate long-context understanding in English and Arabic, targeting context lengths ranging from 4k to over 128k tokens. LC-Eval introduces four novel and challenging tasks: multi-document question answering, bilingual question answering, claim verification within a paragraph, and multiple-choice questions based on long contexts. These tasks are designed to assess LLMs' abilities in deep reasoning, document comprehension, information tracing, and bilingual information extraction and understanding. The benchmark includes datasets in both Arabic and English for each task, allowing for a comparative analysis of their performance across different text genres. Evaluations were conducted on both open-weight and closed LLMs, with results indicating that LC-Eval presents significant challenges. Even high-performing models, such as GPT-4o, struggled with certain tasks, highlighting the complexity and rigor of the benchmark.

  Large language models internalize a structural trade-off between truthfulness and obsequious flattery, emerging from reward optimization that conflates helpfulness with polite submission. This latent bias, known as sycophancy, manifests as a preference for user agreement over principled reasoning. We introduce Beacon, a single-turn forced-choice benchmark that isolates this bias independent of conversational context, enabling precise measurement of the tension between factual accuracy and submissive bias. Evaluations across twelve state-of-the-art models reveal that sycophancy decomposes into stable linguistic and affective sub-biases, each scaling with model capacity. We further propose prompt-level and activation-level interventions that modulate these biases in opposing directions, exposing the internal geometry of alignment as a dynamic manifold between truthfulness and socially compliant judgment. Beacon reframes sycophancy as a measurable form of normative misgeneralization, providing a reproducible foundation for studying and mitigating alignment drift in large-scale generative systems.

  Integration of Large Language Models with search/retrieval engines has become ubiquitous, yet these systems harbor a critical vulnerability that undermines their reliability. We present the first systematic investigation of "chameleon behavior" in LLMs: their alarming tendency to shift stances when presented with contradictory questions in multi-turn conversations (especially in search-enabled LLMs). Through our novel Chameleon Benchmark Dataset, comprising 17,770 carefully crafted question-answer pairs across 1,180 multi-turn conversations spanning 12 controversial domains, we expose fundamental flaws in state-of-the-art systems. We introduce two theoretically grounded metrics: the Chameleon Score (0-1) that quantifies stance instability, and Source Re-use Rate (0-1) that measures knowledge diversity. Our rigorous evaluation of Llama-4-Maverick, GPT-4o-mini, and Gemini-2.5-Flash reveals consistent failures: all models exhibit severe chameleon behavior (scores 0.391-0.511), with GPT-4o-mini showing the worst performance. Crucially, small across-temperature variance (less than 0.004) suggests the effect is not a sampling artifact. Our analysis uncovers the mechanism: strong correlations between source re-use rate and confidence (r=0.627) and stance changes (r=0.429) are statistically significant (p less than 0.05), indicating that limited knowledge diversity makes models pathologically deferential to query framing. These findings highlight the need for comprehensive consistency evaluation before deploying LLMs in healthcare, legal, and financial systems where maintaining coherent positions across interactions is critical for reliable decision support.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Argument Mining (AM) helps in automating the extraction of complex argumentative structures such as Argument Components (ACs) like Premise, Claim etc. and Argumentative Relations (ARs) like Support, Attack etc. in an argumentative text. Due to the inherent complexity of reasoning involved with this task, modelling dependencies between ACs and ARs is challenging. Most of the recent approaches formulate this task through a generative paradigm by flattening the argumentative structures. In contrast to that, this study jointly formulates the key tasks of AM in an end-to-end fashion using Autoregressive Argumentative Structure Prediction (AASP) framework. The proposed AASP framework is based on the autoregressive structure prediction framework that has given good performance for several NLP tasks. AASP framework models the argumentative structures as constrained pre-defined sets of actions with the help of a conditional pre-trained language model. These actions build the argumentative structures step-by-step in an autoregressive manner to capture the flow of argumentative reasoning in an efficient way. Extensive experiments conducted on three standard AM benchmarks demonstrate that AASP achieves state-of-theart (SoTA) results across all AM tasks in two benchmarks and delivers strong results in one benchmark.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This study quantifies how prompting strategies interact with large language models (LLMs) to automate the screening stage of systematic literature reviews (SLRs). We evaluate six LLMs (GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, DeepSeek-Chat-V3, Gemini-2.5-Flash, Claude-3.5-Haiku, Llama-4-Maverick) under five prompt types (zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought (CoT), CoT-few-shot, self-reflection) across relevance classification and six Level-2 tasks, using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1. Results show pronounced model-prompt interaction effects: CoT-few-shot yields the most reliable precision-recall balance; zero-shot maximizes recall for high-sensitivity passes; and self-reflection underperforms due to over-inclusivity and instability across models. GPT-4o and DeepSeek provide robust overall performance, while GPT-4o-mini performs competitively at a substantially lower dollar cost. A cost-performance analysis for relevance classification (per 1,000 abstracts) reveals large absolute differences among model-prompt pairings; GPT-4o-mini remains low-cost across prompts, and structured prompts (CoT/CoT-few-shot) on GPT-4o-mini offer attractive F1 at a small incremental cost. We recommend a staged workflow that (1) deploys low-cost models with structured prompts for first-pass screening and (2) escalates only borderline cases to higher-capacity models. These findings highlight LLMs' uneven but promising potential to automate literature screening. By systematically analyzing prompt-model interactions, we provide a comparative benchmark and practical guidance for task-adaptive LLM deployment.

  Current Large Language Model (LLM) agents show strong performance in tool use, but lack the crucial capability to systematically learn from their own experiences. While existing frameworks mainly focus on mitigating external knowledge gaps, they fail to address a more fundamental limitation: the inability to iteratively refine problem-solving strategies. In this work, we introduce EvolveR, a framework designed to enable agent to self-improve through a complete, closed-loop experience lifecycle. This lifecycle comprises two key stages: (1) Offline Self-Distillation, where the agent's interaction trajectories are synthesized into a structured repository of abstract, reusable strategic principles; (2) Online Interaction, where the agent interacts with tasks and actively retrieves distilled principles to guide its decision-making, accumulating a diverse set of behavioral trajectories. This loop employs a policy reinforcement mechanism to iteratively update the agent based on its performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of EvolveR on complex multi-hop question-answering benchmarks, where it achieves superior performance over strong agentic baselines. Our work presents a comprehensive blueprint for agents that learn not only from external data but also from the consequences of their own actions, paving the way for more autonomous and continuously improving systems.

Although various self-correction methods have been proposed, a comprehensive evaluation of these methods remains largely unexplored, and the question of whether LLMs can truly correct themselves is a matter of significant interest and concern. In this study, we introduce CorrectBench, a benchmark developed to evaluate the effectiveness of self-correction strategies, including intrinsic, external, and fine-tuned approaches, across three tasks: commonsense reasoning, mathematical reasoning, and code generation. Our findings reveal that: 1) Self-correction methods can improve accuracy, especially for complex reasoning tasks; 2) Mixing different self-correction strategies yields further improvements, though it reduces efficiency; 3) Reasoning LLMs (e.g., DeepSeek-R1) have limited optimization under additional self-correction methods and have high time costs. Interestingly, a comparatively simple chain-of-thought (CoT) baseline demonstrates competitive accuracy and efficiency. These results underscore the potential of self-correction to enhance LLM's reasoning performance while highlighting the ongoing challenge of improving their efficiency. Consequently, we advocate for further research focused on optimizing the balance between reasoning capabilities and operational efficiency. Project Page:this https URL

  Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as role-playing agents, yet their capacity to faithfully and consistently portray version-specific characters -- for example, superheroes across comic and cinematic universes -- remains underexplored. Superhero canons such as Marvel and DC provide a rich testbed: decades of storytelling yield multiple incarnations of the same character with distinct histories, values, and moral codes. To study this problem, we introduce Beyond One World, a benchmark for character-grounded roleplay spanning 30 iconic heroes and 90 canon-specific versions. The benchmark comprises two tasks: (i) Canon Events, which probes factual recall of pivotal life stages, and (ii) Moral Dilemmas, which confronts models with ethically charged scenarios. We score responses for canonical accuracy and reasoning fidelity under a framework that separates internal deliberation ("thinking") from outward decisions ("acting"). We further propose Think-Act Matching, a metric that quantifies alignment between reasons and actions and serves as a proxy for model trustworthiness. Experiments across reasoning- and non-reasoning-oriented models yield three findings: (1) chain-of-thought prompting improves narrative coherence in weaker models but can reduce canonical accuracy in stronger ones; (2) cross-version generalization within a character remains a major obstacle; and (3) models often excel at either thinking or acting, but rarely both. Beyond One World exposes critical gaps in multiversal consistency and reasoning alignment, offering a challenging evaluation for role-playing LLMs.

  Understanding human intent is a complex, high-level task for large language models (LLMs), requiring analytical reasoning, contextual interpretation, dynamic information aggregation, and decision-making under uncertainty. Real-world public discussions, such as consumer product discussions, are rarely linear or involve a single user. Instead, they are characterized by interwoven and often conflicting perspectives, divergent concerns, goals, emotional tendencies, as well as implicit assumptions and background knowledge about usage scenarios. To accurately understand such explicit public intent, an LLM must go beyond parsing individual sentences; it must integrate multi-source signals, reason over inconsistencies, and adapt to evolving discourse, similar to how experts in fields like politics, economics, or finance approach complex, uncertain environments. Despite the importance of this capability, no large-scale benchmark currently exists for evaluating LLMs on real-world human intent understanding, primarily due to the challenges of collecting real-world public discussion data and constructing a robust evaluation pipeline. To bridge this gap, we introduce \bench, the first dynamic, live evaluation benchmark specifically designed for intent understanding, particularly in the consumer domain. \bench is the largest and most diverse benchmark of its kind, supporting real-time updates while preventing data contamination through an automated curation pipeline.

  Large language models (LLMs) can correctly answer "When was Einstein born?" yet fail to provide the same date when writing about Einstein's life revealing a fundamental inconsistency in how models access factual knowledge across task complexities. While models display impressive accuracy on factual question-answering benchmarks, the reliability gap between simple and complex queries remains poorly understood, eroding their trustworthiness. In this work, we introduce Short-Long Form Alignment for Factual Question Answering (SLAQ), a controlled evaluation framework that compares LLMs' answers to the same factual questions asked (a) in isolation (short) vs. (b) integrated into complex queries (long). Looking at 16 LLMs across 600 queries, we find a systematic misalignment of answers to the corresponding short and long queries. We further uncover position-dependent accuracy loss and momentum effects where consecutive correct or incorrect answers create self-reinforcing patterns. Through mechanistic analysis, we find that aligned facts activate overlapping model internals, and that metrics based on mechanistic similarity can predict short-long answer alignment with up to 78% accuracy. Our work establishes factual consistency over query complexity as an important aspect of LLMs' trustworthiness and challenges current evaluation practices, which implicitly assume that good performance for simple factual queries implies reliability in more complex knowledge-seeking tasks too.

  Scientific Large Language Models (Sci-LLMs) are transforming how knowledge is represented, integrated, and applied in scientific research, yet their progress is shaped by the complex nature of scientific data. This survey presents a comprehensive, data-centric synthesis that reframes the development of Sci-LLMs as a co-evolution between models and their underlying data substrate. We formulate a unified taxonomy of scientific data and a hierarchical model of scientific knowledge, emphasizing the multimodal, cross-scale, and domain-specific challenges that differentiate scientific corpora from general natural language processing datasets. We systematically review recent Sci-LLMs, from general-purpose foundations to specialized models across diverse scientific disciplines, alongside an extensive analysis of over 270 pre-/post-training datasets, showing why Sci-LLMs pose distinct demands -- heterogeneous, multi-scale, uncertainty-laden corpora that require representations preserving domain invariance and enabling cross-modal reasoning. On evaluation, we examine over 190 benchmark datasets and trace a shift from static exams toward process- and discovery-oriented assessments with advanced evaluation protocols. These data-centric analyses highlight persistent issues in scientific data development and discuss emerging solutions involving semi-automated annotation pipelines and expert validation. Finally, we outline a paradigm shift toward closed-loop systems where autonomous agents based on Sci-LLMs actively experiment, validate, and contribute to a living, evolving knowledge base. Collectively, this work provides a roadmap for building trustworthy, continually evolving artificial intelligence (AI) systems that function as a true partner in accelerating scientific discovery.

  Training large language models (LLMs) with chain-of-thought (CoT) supervision has proven effective for enhancing their reasoning abilities. However, obtaining reliable and accurate reasoning supervision remains a significant challenge. We propose a scalable method for generating a high-quality CoT supervision dataset by leveraging the determinism of program execution. Unlike existing reasoning dataset generation methods that rely on costly human annotations or error-prone LLM-generated CoT, our approach extracts verifiable, step-by-step reasoning traces from code execution and transforms them into a natural language CoT reasoning. Experiments on reasoning benchmarks across various domains show that our method effectively equips LLMs with transferable reasoning abilities across diverse tasks. Furthermore, the ablation studies validate that our method produces highly accurate reasoning data and reduces overall token length during inference by reducing meaningless repetition and overthinking.

  Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly evaluated on single-answer multiple-choice tasks, yet many real-world problems require identifying all correct answers from a set of options. This capability remains underexplored. We introduce SATA-BENCH, the first dedicated benchmark for evaluating LLMs on Select All That Apply (SATA) questions across diverse domains, including reading comprehension, law, and biomedicine. Our evaluation of 27 open-source and proprietary models reveals a significant gap: even the strongest model achieves only 41.8% exact match, exposing LLMs' inability to reliably identify all correct answers. We find that this weakness stems from two core challenges: selection bias - models favor certain choices regardless of content, and count bias - models fail to predict the correct number of answers. To address these issues, we propose Choice Funnel, a decoding strategy that combines token debiasing with adaptive thresholding to guide models toward complete and accurate selections. Choice Funnel achieves up to 29% higher exact match than competitive baselines while reducing inference cost by over 64%. Our findings expose fundamental limitations in current LLMs and introduce a new framework for diagnosing and improving multi-answer reasoning. We release SATA-BENCH and Choice Funnel to promote LLM development for robust decision-making in realistic, multi-answer applications.

  Human-generated reward signals are critical for aligning generative models with human preferences, guiding both training and inference-time evaluations. While large language models (LLMs) employed as proxy evaluators, i.e., LLM-as-a-Judge, significantly reduce the costs associated with manual annotations, they typically require extensive modality-specific training data and fail to generalize well across diverse multimodal tasks. In this paper, we propose Flex-Judge, a reasoning-guided multimodal judge model that leverages minimal textual reasoning data to robustly generalize across multiple modalities and evaluation formats. Our core intuition is that structured textual reasoning explanations inherently encode generalizable decision-making patterns, enabling an effective transfer to multimodal judgments, e.g., with images or videos. Empirical results demonstrate that Flex-Judge, despite being trained on significantly fewer text data, achieves competitive or superior performance compared to state-of-the-art commercial APIs and extensively trained multimodal evaluators. Notably, Flex-Judge presents broad impact in modalities like molecule, where comprehensive evaluation benchmarks are scarce, underscoring its practical value in resource-constrained domains. Our framework highlights reasoning-based text supervision as a powerful, cost-effective alternative to traditional annotation-intensive approaches, substantially advancing scalable multimodal model-as-a-judge.

  Human safety awareness gaps often prevent the timely recognition of everyday risks. In solving this problem, a proactive safety artificial intelligence (AI) system would work better than a reactive one. Instead of just reacting to users' questions, it would actively watch people's behavior and their environment to detect potential dangers in advance. Our Proactive Safety Bench (PaSBench) evaluates this capability through 416 multimodal scenarios (128 image sequences, 288 text logs) spanning 5 safety-critical domains. Evaluation of 36 advanced models reveals fundamental limitations: Top performers like Gemini-2.5-pro achieve 71% image and 64% text accuracy, but miss 45-55% risks in repeated trials. Through failure analysis, we identify unstable proactive reasoning rather than knowledge deficits as the primary limitation. This work establishes (1) a proactive safety benchmark, (2) systematic evidence of model limitations, and (3) critical directions for developing reliable protective AI. We believe our dataset and findings can promote the development of safer AI assistants that actively prevent harm rather than merely respond to requests. Our dataset can be found atthis https URL.

  Argument Mining (AM) involves identifying and extracting Argumentative Components (ACs) and their corresponding Argumentative Relations (ARs). Most of the prior works have broken down these tasks into multiple sub-tasks. Existing end-to-end setups primarily use the dependency parsing approach. This work introduces a generative paradigm-based end-to-end framework argTANL. argTANL frames the argumentative structures into label-augmented text, called Augmented Natural Language (ANL). This framework jointly extracts both ACs and ARs from a given argumentative text. Additionally, this study explores the impact of Argumentative and Discourse markers on enhancing the model's performance within the proposed framework. Two distinct frameworks, Marker-Enhanced argTANL (ME-argTANL) and argTANL with specialized Marker-Based Fine-Tuning, are proposed to achieve this. Extensive experiments are conducted on three standard AM benchmarks to demonstrate the superior performance of the ME-argTANL.

  Medical Large language models achieve strong scores on standard benchmarks; however, the transfer of those results to safe and reliable performance in clinical workflows remains a challenge. This survey reframes evaluation through a levels-of-autonomy lens (L0-L3), spanning informational tools, information transformation and aggregation, decision support, and supervised agents. We align existing benchmarks and metrics with the actions permitted at each level and their associated risks, making the evaluation targets explicit. This motivates a level-conditioned blueprint for selecting metrics, assembling evidence, and reporting claims, alongside directions that link evaluation to oversight. By centering autonomy, the survey moves the field beyond score-based claims toward credible, risk-aware evidence for real clinical use.

  Large Language Models have achieved strong performance on reasoning tasks, solving competition-level coding and math problems. However, their scalability is limited by human-labeled datasets and the lack of large-scale, challenging coding problem training data. Existing competitive coding datasets contain only thousands to tens of thousands of problems. Previous synthetic data generation methods rely on either augmenting existing instruction datasets or selecting challenging problems from human-labeled data. In this paper, we propose QueST, a novel framework which combines difficulty-aware graph sampling and difficulty-aware rejection fine-tuning that directly optimizes specialized generators to create challenging coding problems. Our trained generators demonstrate superior capability compared to even GPT-4o at creating challenging problems that benefit downstream performance. We leverage QueST to generate large-scale synthetic coding problems, which we then use to distill from strong teacher models with long chain-of-thought or to conduct reinforcement learning for smaller models, proving effective in both scenarios. Our distillation experiments demonstrate significant performance gains. Specifically, after fine-tuning Qwen3-8B-base on 100K difficult problems generated by QueST, we surpass the performance of the original Qwen3-8B on LiveCodeBench. With an additional 112K examples (i.e., 28K human-written problems paired with multiple synthetic solutions), our 8B model matches the performance of the much larger DeepSeek-R1-671B. These findings indicate that generating complex problems via QueST offers an effective and scalable approach to advancing the frontiers of competitive coding and reasoning for large language models.

  This paper introduces Qomhr√°, a bilingual Irish-English large language model (LLM), developed under low-resource constraints presenting a complete pipeline spanning bilingual continued pre-training, instruction tuning, and alignment from human preferences. Newly accessible Irish corpora and English text are mixed and curated to improve Irish performance while preserving English ability. 6 closed-weight LLMs are judged for their Irish text generation by a native speaker, a learner and other LLMs. Google's Gemini-2.5-Pro is ranked the highest and is subsequently used to synthesise instruction tuning and human preference datasets. Two datasets are contributed leveraging Gemini-2.5-Pro: a 30K Irish-English parallel instruction tuning dataset and a 1K human preference dataset, generating accepted and rejected responses that show near perfect alignment with a native Irish speaker. Qomhr√° is comprehensively evaluated across benchmarks testing translation, gender understanding, topic identification and world knowledge with gains of up to 29% in Irish and 44% in English. Qomhr√° also undergoes instruction tuning and demonstrates clear progress in instruction following, crucial for chatbot functionality.

  Legal reasoning is a fundamental component of legal analysis and decision-making. Existing computational approaches to legal reasoning predominantly rely on generic reasoning frameworks such as syllogism and IRAC, which do not comprehensively examine the nuanced processes that underpin legal reasoning. Moreover, current research has largely focused on criminal cases, with insufficient modeling for civil cases. In this work, we present a novel framework for explicitly modeling legal reasoning in the analysis of Chinese tort-related civil cases. We first operationalize the legal reasoning processes used in tort analysis into the LawChain framework. LawChain is a three-module reasoning framework, with each module consisting of multiple finer-grained sub-steps. Informed by the LawChain framework, we introduce the task of tort legal reasoning and construct an evaluation benchmark, LawChain$_{eval}$, to systematically assess the critical steps within analytical reasoning chains for tort analysis. Leveraging this benchmark, we evaluate state-of-the-art large language models for their legal reasoning ability in civil tort contexts. Our results indicate that current models still fall short in accurately handling crucial elements of tort legal reasoning. Furthermore, we introduce several baseline approaches that explicitly incorporate LawChain-style reasoning through prompting or post-training. We conduct further experiments on additional legal analysis tasks, such as Legal Named-Entity Recognition and Criminal Damages Calculation, to verify the generalizability of these baselines. The proposed baseline approaches achieve significant improvements in tort-related legal reasoning and generalize well to related legal analysis tasks, thus demonstrating the value of explicitly modeling legal reasoning chains to enhance the reasoning capabilities of language models.

  Honesty alignment-the ability of large language models (LLMs) to recognize their knowledge boundaries and express calibrated confidence-is essential for trustworthy deployment. Existing methods either rely on training-free confidence estimation (e.g., token probabilities, self-consistency) or training-based calibration with correctness annotations. While effective, achieving universal honesty alignment with training-based calibration requires costly, large-scale labeling. To support annotation-efficient training, we introduce Elicitation-Then-Calibration (EliCal), a two-stage framework that first elicits internal confidence using inexpensive self-consistency supervision, then calibrates this confidence with a small set of correctness annotations. To support a large-scale study, we release HonestyBench, a benchmark covering ten free-form QA datasets with 560k training and 70k evaluation instances annotated with correctness and self-consistency signals. Experiments show that EliCal achieves near-optimal alignment with only 1k correctness annotations (0.18% of full supervision) and better alignment performance on unseen MMLU tasks than the calibration-only baseline, offering a scalable solution toward universal honesty alignment in LLMs.

  While BERT is an effective method for learning monolingual sentence embeddings for semantic similarity and embedding based transfer learning BERT based cross-lingual sentence embeddings have yet to be explored. We systematically investigate methods for learning multilingual sentence embeddings by combining the best methods for learning monolingual and cross-lingual representations including: masked language modeling (MLM), translation language modeling (TLM), dual encoder translation ranking, and additive margin softmax. We show that introducing a pre-trained multilingual language model dramatically reduces the amount of parallel training data required to achieve good performance by 80%. Composing the best of these methods produces a model that achieves 83.7% bi-text retrieval accuracy over 112 languages on Tatoeba, well above the 65.5 achieved by LASER, while still performing competitively on monolingual transfer learning benchmarks. Parallel data mined from CommonCrawl using our best model is shown to train competitive NMT models for en-zh and en-de. We publicly release our best multilingual sentence embedding model for 109+ languages atthis https URL.

  Long-form chain-of-thought reasoning has become a cornerstone of advanced reasoning in large language models. While recent verification-refinement frameworks have enabled proprietary models to solve Olympiad-level problems, their effectiveness hinges on strong, reliable verification and correction capabilities, which remain fragile in open-weight, smaller-scale models. This work demonstrates that even with weak verification and refinement capabilities on hard tasks, the reasoning limits of such models can be substantially extended through a probabilistic paradigm we call Deep Self-Evolving Reasoning (DSER). We conceptualize iterative reasoning as a Markov chain, where each step represents a stochastic transition in the solution space. The key insight is that convergence to a correct solution is guaranteed as long as the probability of improvement marginally exceeds that of degradation. By running multiple long-horizon, self-evolving processes in parallel, DSER amplifies these small positive tendencies, enabling the model to asymptotically approach correct answers. Empirically, we apply DSER to the DeepSeek-R1-0528-Qwen3-8B model. On the challenging AIME 2024-2025 benchmark, DSER solves 5 out of 9 previously unsolvable problems and boosts overall performance, enabling this compact model to surpass the single-turn accuracy of its 600B-parameter teacher through majority voting. Beyond its immediate utility for test-time scaling, the DSER framework serves to diagnose the fundamental limitations of current open-weight reasoners. By clearly delineating their shortcomings in self-verification, refinement, and stability, our findings establish a clear research agenda for developing next-generation models with powerful, intrinsic self-evolving capabilities.

  With the rise of large language models (LLMs), LLM agents capable of autonomous reasoning, planning, and executing complex tasks have become a frontier in artificial intelligence. However, how to translate the research on general agents into productivity that drives industry transformations remains a significant challenge. To address this, this paper systematically reviews the technologies, applications, and evaluation methods of industry agents based on LLMs. Using an industry agent capability maturity framework, it outlines the evolution of agents in industry applications, from "process execution systems" to "adaptive social systems." First, we examine the three key technological pillars that support the advancement of agent capabilities: Memory, Planning, and Tool Use. We discuss how these technologies evolve from supporting simple tasks in their early forms to enabling complex autonomous systems and collective intelligence in more advanced forms. Then, we provide an overview of the application of industry agents in real-world domains such as digital engineering, scientific discovery, embodied intelligence, collaborative business execution, and complex system simulation. Additionally, this paper reviews the evaluation benchmarks and methods for both fundamental and specialized capabilities, identifying the challenges existing evaluation systems face regarding authenticity, safety, and industry specificity. Finally, we focus on the practical challenges faced by industry agents, exploring their capability boundaries, developmental potential, and governance issues in various scenarios, while providing insights into future directions. By combining technological evolution with industry practices, this review aims to clarify the current state and offer a clear roadmap and theoretical foundation for understanding and building the next generation of industry agents.

  Instruction-tuned large language models (IT-LLMs) exhibit strong zero-shot reasoning, yet their ability to execute simple, self-contained instructions remains underexplored, despite this being foundational to complex instruction-following. We evaluate 20 IT-LLMs on modified MMLU and MMLU-Pro benchmarks, by systematically varying the format of option labels (alphabetic, numeric, Roman) while keeping their meaning identical under four paradigms, namely: (1) With explicit instructions, label changes cause large performance shifts (e.g., -30.45\% for Roman vs. numeric), revealing instruction-format bias. (2) Without instructions, performance drops further (up to -10.84\%) and label sensitivity intensifies, underscoring the role of explicit guidance. (3) When option contents are removed, models fail random-choice baselines except with numeric labels, suggesting weak adherence to atomic directives. (4) Three-shot exemplars yield no significant gains in robustness or fidelity, and generation analyses show persistent label errors, especially for non-numeric formats. Across model sizes, larger LLMs achieve higher accuracy but remain inconsistent in instruction adherence. These results expose the insufficiencies of current instruction-tuning paradigms and highlight the need for evaluation methods and training strategies that explicitly target atomic instruction-following.

  Antisocial behavior (ASB) on social media -- including hate speech, harassment, and cyberbullying -- poses growing risks to platform safety and societal well-being. Prior research has focused largely on networks such as X and Reddit, while \textit{multi-party conversational settings} remain underexplored due to limited data. To address this gap, we use \textit{CyberAgressionAdo-Large}, a French open-access dataset simulating ASB in multi-party conversations, and evaluate three tasks: \textit{abuse detection}, \textit{bullying behavior analysis}, and \textit{bullying peer-group identification}. We benchmark six text-based and eight graph-based \textit{representation-learning methods}, analyzing lexical cues, interactional dynamics, and their multimodal fusion. Results show that multimodal models outperform unimodal baselines. The late fusion model \texttt{mBERT + WD-SGCN} achieves the best overall results, with top performance on abuse detection (0.718) and competitive scores on peer-group identification (0.286) and bullying analysis (0.606). Error analysis highlights its effectiveness in handling nuanced ASB phenomena such as implicit aggression, role transitions, and context-dependent hostility.

  Taxonomies play a crucial role in helping researchers structure and navigate knowledge in a hierarchical manner. They also form an important part in the creation of comprehensive literature surveys. The existing approaches to automatic survey generation do not compare the structure of the generated surveys with those written by human experts. To address this gap, we present our own method for automated taxonomy creation that can bridge the gap between human-generated and automatically-created taxonomies. For this purpose, we create the CS-TaxoBench benchmark which consists of 460 taxonomies that have been extracted from human-written survey papers. We also include an additional test set of 80 taxonomies curated from conference survey papers. We propose TaxoAlign, a three-phase topic-based instruction-guided method for scholarly taxonomy generation. Additionally, we propose a stringent automated evaluation framework that measures the structural alignment and semantic coherence of automatically generated taxonomies in comparison to those created by human experts. We evaluate our method and various baselines on CS-TaxoBench, using both automated evaluation metrics and human evaluation studies. The results show that TaxoAlign consistently surpasses the baselines on nearly all metrics. The code and data can be found atthis https URL.

  The increase in computing power and the necessity of AI-assisted decision-making boost the growing application of large language models (LLMs). Along with this, the potential retention of sensitive data of LLMs has spurred increasing research into machine unlearning. However, existing unlearning approaches face a critical dilemma: Aggressive unlearning compromises model utility, while conservative strategies preserve utility but risk hallucinated responses. This significantly limits LLMs' reliability in knowledge-intensive applications. To address this, we introduce a novel Attention-Shifting (AS) framework for selective unlearning. AS is driven by two design objectives: (1) context-preserving suppression that attenuates attention to fact-bearing tokens without disrupting LLMs' linguistic structure; and (2) hallucination-resistant response shaping that discourages fabricated completions when queried about unlearning content. AS realizes these objectives through two attention-level interventions, which are importance-aware suppression applied to the unlearning set to reduce reliance on memorized knowledge and attention-guided retention enhancement that reinforces attention toward semantically essential tokens in the retained dataset to mitigate unintended degradation. These two components are jointly optimized via a dual-loss objective, which forms a soft boundary that localizes unlearning while preserving unrelated knowledge under representation superposition. Experimental results show that AS improves performance preservation over the state-of-the-art unlearning methods, achieving up to 15% higher accuracy on the ToFU benchmark and 10% on the TDEC benchmark, while maintaining competitive hallucination-free unlearning effectiveness. Compared to existing methods, AS demonstrates a superior balance between unlearning effectiveness, generalization, and response reliability.

  Recent LLM benchmarks have tested models on a range of phenomena, but are still focused primarily on natural language understanding for extraction of explicit information, such as QA or summarization, with responses often tar- geting information from individual sentences. We are still lacking more challenging, and im- portantly also multilingual, benchmarks focus- ing on implicit information and pragmatic infer- ences across larger documents in the context of discourse tracking: integrating and aggregating information across sentences, paragraphs and multiple speaker utterances. To this end, we present DiscoTrack, an LLM benchmark target- ing a range of tasks across 12 languages and four levels of discourse understanding: salience recognition, entity tracking, discourse relations and bridging inference. Our evaluation shows that these tasks remain challenging, even for state-of-the-art models.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Existing benchmarks for large language models (LLMs) are largely restricted to high- or mid-resource languages, and often evaluate performance on higher-order tasks in reasoning and generation. However, plenty of evidence points to the fact that LLMs lack basic linguistic competence in the vast majority of the world's 3800+ written languages. We introduce ChiKhaPo, consisting of 8 subtasks of varying difficulty designed to evaluate the lexical comprehension and generation abilities of generative models. ChiKhaPo draws on existing lexicons, monolingual data, and bitext, and provides coverage for 2700+ languages for 2 subtasks, surpassing any existing benchmark in terms of language coverage. We further show that 6 SOTA models struggle on our benchmark, and discuss the factors contributing to performance scores, including language family, language resourcedness, task, and comprehension versus generation directions. With ChiKhaPo, we hope to enable and encourage the massively multilingual benchmarking of LLMs.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Despite significant progress in multimodal language models (LMs), it remains unclear whether visual grounding enhances their understanding of embodied knowledge compared to text-only models. To address this question, we propose a novel embodied knowledge understanding benchmark based on the perceptual theory from psychology, encompassing visual, auditory, tactile, gustatory, olfactory external senses, and interoception. The benchmark assesses the models' perceptual abilities across different sensory modalities through vector comparison and question-answering tasks with over 1,700 questions. By comparing 30 state-of-the-art LMs, we surprisingly find that vision-language models (VLMs) do not outperform text-only models in either task. Moreover, the models perform significantly worse in the visual dimension compared to other sensory dimensions. Further analysis reveals that the vector representations are easily influenced by word form and frequency, and the models struggle to answer questions involving spatial perception and reasoning. Our findings underscore the need for more effective integration of embodied knowledge in LMs to enhance their understanding of the physical world.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Authorship attribution (AA) is the task of identifying the most likely author of a query document from a predefined set of candidate authors. We introduce a two-stage retrieve-and-rerank framework that finetunes LLMs for cross-genre AA. Unlike the field of information retrieval (IR), where retrieve-and-rerank is a de facto strategy, cross-genre AA systems must avoid relying on topical cues and instead learn to identify author-specific linguistic patterns that are independent of the text's subject matter (genre/domain/topic). Consequently, for the reranker, we demonstrate that training strategies commonly used in IR are fundamentally misaligned with cross-genre AA, leading to suboptimal behavior. To address this, we introduce a targeted data curation strategy that enables the reranker to effectively learn author-discriminative signals. Using our LLM-based retrieve-and-rerank pipeline, we achieve substantial gains of 22.3 and 34.4 absolute Success@8 points over the previous state-of-the-art on HIATUS's challenging HRS1 and HRS2 cross-genre AA benchmarks.

  Advertisement (Ad) video violation detection is critical for ensuring platform compliance, but existing methods struggle with precise temporal grounding, noisy annotations, and limited generalization. We propose RAVEN, a novel framework that integrates curriculum reinforcement learning with multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to enhance reasoning and cognitive capabilities for violation detection. RAVEN employs a progressive training strategy, combining precisely and coarsely annotated data, and leverages Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to develop emergent reasoning abilities without explicit reasoning annotations. Multiple hierarchical sophisticated reward mechanism ensures precise temporal grounding and consistent category prediction. Experiments on industrial datasets and public benchmarks show that RAVEN achieves superior performances in violation category accuracy and temporal interval localization. We also design a pipeline to deploy the RAVEN on the online Ad services, and online A/B testing further validates its practical applicability, with significant improvements in precision and recall. RAVEN also demonstrates strong generalization, mitigating the catastrophic forgetting issue associated with supervised fine-tuning.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable progress in complex reasoning tasks, largely enabled by test-time scaling (TTS) paradigms that allocate additional compute during inference. Among these, external TTS (particularly the Best-of-N selection paradigm) yields scalable performance improvements by selecting from multiple independently generated reasoning trajectories. However, this approach faces key limitations: (i) the high computational overhead of deploying process reward models, (ii) the underutilization of the LLM's intrinsic latent representations. We introduce TrajSelector, an efficient and effective Best-of-N framework that exploit the hidden states in the sampler LLM for process-level scoring. A lightweight verifier (with only 0.6B parameters) evaluates the quality of step-wise trajectory, and then aggregates these scores to identify the optimal reasoning trajectory. Our framework employs a fully data-driven, end-to-end training recipe that eliminates reliance on massive step-level annotations. Experiential results across five benchmarks demonstrate that TrajSelector delivers consistent performance gains. In Best-of-32 settings, it surpasses majority voting by 4.61% accuracy and outperforms existing process reward models by 4.31% to 12.21%, all while maintaining lower inference costs.

  Despite recent advances in AI, multimodal culturally diverse datasets are still limited, particularly for regions in the Middle East and Africa. In this paper, we introduce EgMM-Corpus, a multimodal dataset dedicated to Egyptian culture. By designing and running a new data collection pipeline, we collected over 3,000 images, covering 313 concepts across landmarks, food, and folklore. Each entry in the dataset is manually validated for cultural authenticity and multimodal coherence. EgMM-Corpus aims to provide a reliable resource for evaluating and training vision-language models in an Egyptian cultural context. We further evaluate the zero-shot performance of Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training CLIP on EgMM-Corpus, on which it achieves 21.2% Top-1 accuracy and 36.4% Top-5 accuracy in classification. These results underscore the existing cultural bias in large-scale vision-language models and demonstrate the importance of EgMM-Corpus as a benchmark for developing culturally aware models.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Document parsing from scanned images into structured formats remains a significant challenge due to its complexly intertwined elements such as text paragraphs, figures, formulas, and tables. Existing supervised fine-tuning methods often struggle to generalize across diverse document types, leading to poor performance, particularly on out-of-distribution data. This issue is further exacerbated by the limited availability of high-quality training data for layout-aware parsing tasks. To address these challenges, we introduce LayoutRL, a reinforcement learning framework that optimizes layout understanding through composite rewards integrating normalized edit distance, paragraph count accuracy, and reading order preservation. To support this training, we construct the Infinity-Doc-400K dataset, which we use to train Infinity-Parser, a vision-language model demonstrating robust generalization across various domains. Extensive evaluations on benchmarks including OmniDocBench, olmOCR-Bench, PubTabNet, and FinTabNet show that Infinity-Parser consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance across a broad range of document types, languages, and structural complexities, substantially outperforming both specialized document parsing systems and general-purpose vision-language models. We will release our code, dataset, and model to facilitate reproducible research in document parsing.

  Building effective knowledge graphs (KGs) for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is pivotal for advancing question answering (QA) systems. However, its effectiveness is hindered by a fundamental disconnect: the knowledge graph (KG) construction process is decoupled from its downstream application, yielding suboptimal graph structures. To bridge this gap, we introduce AutoGraph-R1, the first framework to directly optimize KG construction for task performance using Reinforcement Learning (RL). AutoGraph-R1 trains an LLM constructor by framing graph generation as a policy learning problem, where the reward is derived from the graph's functional utility in a RAG pipeline. We design two novel, task-aware reward functions, one for graphs as knowledge carriers and another as knowledge indices. Across multiple QA benchmarks, AutoGraph-R1 consistently enables graph RAG methods to achieve significant performance gains over using task-agnostic baseline graphs. Our work shows it is possible to close the loop between construction and application, shifting the paradigm from building intrinsically ``good'' graphs to building demonstrably ``useful'' ones.

  Large language models (LLMs) excel at general next-token prediction but still struggle to generate responses that reflect how individuals truly communicate, such as replying to emails or social messages in their own style. However, real SNS or email histories are difficult to collect due to privacy concerns. To address this, we propose the task of "Your Next Token Prediction (YNTP)", which models a user's precise word choices through controlled human-agent conversations. We build a multilingual benchmark of 100 dialogue sessions across English, Japanese, and Chinese, where users interact for five days with psychologically grounded NPCs based on MBTI dimensions. This setup captures natural, daily-life communication patterns and enables analysis of users' internal models. We evaluate prompt-based and fine-tuning-based personalization methods, establishing the first benchmark for YNTP and a foundation for user-aligned language modeling.

  Comparing human and model performance offers a valuable perspective for understanding the strengths and limitations of embedding models, highlighting where they succeed and where they fail to capture meaning and nuance. However, such comparisons are rarely made, as human performance on embedding tasks is difficult to measure. To fill this gap, we introduce HUME: Human Evaluation Framework for Text Embeddings. While frameworks like MTEB provide broad model evaluation, they lack reliable estimates of human performance, limiting the interpretability of model scores. We measure human performance across 16 MTEB datasets spanning reranking, classification, clustering, and semantic textual similarity across linguistically diverse high- and low-resource languages. Humans achieve an average performance of 77.6% compared to 80.1% for the best embedding model, although variation is substantial: models reach near-ceiling performance on some datasets while struggling on others, suggesting dataset issues and revealing shortcomings in low-resource languages. We provide human performance baselines, insight into task difficulty patterns, and an extensible evaluation framework that enables a more meaningful interpretation of the model and informs the development of both models and benchmarks. Our code, dataset, and leaderboard are publicly available atthis https URL.

  Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has significantly enhanced the reasoning capability of large language models by optimizing the arithmetic mean of token-level rewards. Unfortunately, GRPO is observed to suffer from unstable policy updates when facing tokens with outlier importance-weighted rewards, which manifest as extreme importance sampling ratios during training. In this study, we propose Geometric-Mean Policy Optimization (GMPO), with the aim to improve the stability of GRPO through suppressing token reward outliers. Instead of optimizing the arithmetic mean, GMPO maximizes the geometric mean of token-level rewards, which is inherently less sensitive to outliers and maintains a more stable range of importance sampling ratio. GMPO is plug-and-play-simply replacing GRPO's arithmetic mean with the geometric mean of token-level rewards, as the latter is inherently less sensitive to outliers. GMPO is theoretically plausible-analysis reveals that both GMPO and GRPO are weighted forms of the policy gradient while the former enjoys more stable weights, which consequently benefits policy optimization and performance. Experiments on multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that GMPO-7B improves the average Pass@1 of GRPO by up to 4.1%, outperforming many state-of-the-art approaches.

  Recently, AI agents are rapidly evolving in intelligence and widely used in professional research applications, such as STEM, software development, and finance. Among these AI agents, deep research agent is a key category as it can perform long-horizon tasks and solve problems of greater complexity. However, there are few evaluation frameworks and benchmarks that systematically and automatically investigate the capabilities of these research agents. In addition, financial research problems have distinct complexity and subtlety. To fill in the gap, we propose FinResearchBench, which is a logic tree-based Agent-as-a-Judge and targets specifically for the financial research agents. It provides a comprehensive and automatic assessment of the research agents across 7 key types of tasks in the financial research domain. The contributions of this work are two-folded: (1) the first and innovative Agent-as-a-Judge system that extracts the logic tree of the research outcome and uses it as the intermediate information to present a comprehensive, reliable, and robust evaluation; (2) finance-oriented that it covers 70 typical financial research questions, spreading across 7 frequently encountered types of task in the domain.

  The ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to mimic human behavior triggered a plethora of computational social science research, assuming that empirical studies of humans can be conducted with AI agents instead. Since there have been conflicting research findings on whether and when this hypothesis holds, there is a need to better understand the differences in their experimental designs. We focus on replicating the behavior of social network users with the use of LLMs for the analysis of communication on social networks. First, we provide a formal framework for the simulation of social networks, before focusing on the sub-task of imitating user communication. We empirically test different approaches to imitate user behavior on X in English and German. Our findings suggest that social simulations should be validated by their empirical realism measured in the setting in which the simulation components were fitted. With this paper, we argue for more rigor when applying generative-agent-based modeling for social simulation.

  Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) improves factual accuracy by grounding responses in external knowledge. However, existing RAG methods either rely solely on text corpora and neglect structural knowledge, or build ad-hoc knowledge graphs (KGs) at high cost and low reliability. To address these issues, we propose KG-Infused RAG, a framework that incorporates pre-existing large-scale KGs into RAG and applies spreading activation to enhance both retrieval and generation. KG-Infused RAG directly performs spreading activation over external KGs to retrieve relevant structured knowledge, which is then used to expand queries and integrated with corpus passages, enabling interpretable and semantically grounded multi-source retrieval. We further improve KG-Infused RAG through preference learning on sampled key stages of the pipeline. Experiments on five QA benchmarks show that KG-Infused RAG consistently outperforms vanilla RAG (by 3.9% to 17.8%). Compared with KG-based approaches such as GraphRAG and LightRAG, our method obtains structured knowledge at lower cost while achieving superior performance. Additionally, integrating KG-Infused RAG with Self-RAG and DeepNote yields further gains, demonstrating its effectiveness and versatility as a plug-and-play enhancement module for corpus-based RAG methods.

  Existing frameworks for evaluating long-context language models (LCLM) can be broadly categorized into real-world applications (e.g, document summarization) and synthetic tasks (e.g, needle-in-a-haystack). Despite their utility, both approaches are accompanied by certain intrinsic limitations. Real-world tasks often involve complexity that makes interpretation challenging and suffer from data contamination, whereas synthetic tasks frequently lack meaningful coherence between the target information (needle) and its surrounding context (haystack), undermining their validity as proxies for realistic applications. In response to these challenges, we posit that an ideal long-context evaluation framework should be characterized by three essential features: 1) seamless context 2) controllable setting and 3) sound evaluation. This study introduces $\textbf{LongBioBench}$, a benchmark that utilizes artificially generated biographies as a controlled environment for assessing LCLMs across dimensions of understanding, reasoning, and trustworthiness. Our experimental evaluation, which includes 18 LCLMs in total, demonstrates that most models still exhibit deficiencies in semantic understanding and elementary reasoning over retrieved results and are less trustworthy as context length increases. Our further analysis indicates some design choices employed by existing synthetic benchmarks, such as contextual non-coherence, numerical needles, and the absence of distractors, rendering them vulnerable to test the model's long-context capabilities. To sum up, compared to previous synthetic benchmarks, LongBioBench achieves a better trade-off between mirroring authentic language tasks and maintaining controllability, and is highly interpretable and configurable.

  Genuine human-like causal reasoning is fundamental for strong artificial intelligence. Humans typically identify whether an event is part of the causal chain first, and then influenced by modulatory factors such as morality, normality, and intention to make the final judgment. These two stages naturally map to the fields of 1) actual causality that provides formalisms for causal chain membership and 2) causal judgment from cognitive science that studies psychological modulators that influence causal selection. However, these two domains have largely been studied in isolation, leaving a gap for a systematic method based on LLMs. Therefore, we introduce HCR-Reasoner, a framework that systematically integrates the theory of actual causality and causal judgment into LLMs for human-like causal reasoning. It simulates humans by using actual causality formalisms to filter for structurally necessary candidate causes and causal judgment factors to determine the psychologically selected cause. For fine-grained evaluation, we introduce HCR-Bench, a challenging benchmark with 1,093 annotated instances with detailed reasoning steps. Results show HCR-Reasoner consistently and significantly improves LLMs' causal alignment with humans, and that explicitly integrating theory-guided reasoning into LLMs is highly effective for achieving faithful human-like causal reasoning.

  Large reasoning models (LRMs) have recently demonstrated impressive capabilities in complex reasoning tasks by leveraging increased test-time computation and exhibiting behaviors reminiscent of human-like self-reflection. While LRMs show a clear capacity for valuable self-reflection, how this ability interacts with other model behaviors remains underexplored. We investigate this connection by analyzing verbalized confidence, how models articulate their certainty, as a lens into the nature of self-reflection in LRMs. We find that supervised fine-tuning on reasoning traces (i.e., distillation) and reinforcement learning can improve verbalized calibration in reasoning-intensive settings in a progressive, laddered fashion. However, our results also indicate that reasoning models may possess a diminished awareness of their own knowledge boundaries, as evidenced by significantly lower "I don't know" response rates on factuality benchmarks. Moreover, we examine the relationship between verbalized confidence and reasoning chains, finding that models tend to express higher confidence when providing shorter or less elaborate reasoning. Our findings highlight how reasoning-oriented training can enhance performance in reasoning-centric tasks while potentially incurring a "reasoning tax," a cost reflected in the model's reduced ability to accurately recognize the limits of its own knowledge in small-scale models. More broadly, our work showcases how this erosion of knowledge boundaries can compromise model faithfulness, as models grow more confident without a commensurate understanding of when they should abstain.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) are poised to revolutionize healthcare. Ophthalmology-specific LLMs remain scarce and underexplored. We introduced an open-source, specialized LLM for ophthalmology, termed Language Enhanced Model for Eye (LEME). LEME was initially pre-trained on the Llama2 70B framework and further fine-tuned with a corpus of ~127,000 non-copyrighted training instances curated from ophthalmology-specific case reports, abstracts, and open-source study materials. We benchmarked LEME against eight other LLMs, namely, GPT-3.5, GPT-4, three Llama2 models (7B, 13B, 70B), PMC-LLAMA 13B, Meditron 70B, and EYE-Llama (another ophthalmology-specific LLM). Evaluations included four internal validation tasks: abstract completion, fill-in-the-blank, multiple-choice questions (MCQ), and short-answer QA. External validation tasks encompassed long-form QA, MCQ, patient EHR summarization, and clinical QA. Evaluation metrics included Rouge-L scores, accuracy, and expert evaluation of correctness, completeness, and readability. In internal validations, LEME consistently outperformed its counterparts, achieving Rouge-L scores of 0.20 in abstract completion (all p<0.05), 0.82 in fill-in-the-blank (all p<0.0001), and 0.22 in short-answer QA (all p<0.0001, except versus GPT-4). In external validations, LEME excelled in long-form QA with a Rouge-L of 0.19 (all p<0.0001), ranked second in MCQ accuracy (0.68; all p<0.0001), and scored highest in EHR summarization and clinical QA (ranging from 4.24 to 4.83 out of 5 for correctness, completeness, and readability).LEME's emphasis on robust fine-tuning and the use of non-copyrighted data represents a breakthrough in open-source ophthalmology-specific LLMs, offering the potential to revolutionize execution of clinical tasks while democratizing research collaboration.

  Autonomous agents rely on automated planning algorithms to achieve their objectives. Simulation-based planning offers a significant advantage over declarative models in modelling complex environments. However, relying solely on a planner that produces a single plan may not be practical, as the generated plans may not always satisfy the agent's preferences. To address this limitation, we introduce $\texttt{FBI}_\texttt{LTL}$, a diverse planner explicitly designed for simulation-based planning problems. $\texttt{FBI}_\texttt{LTL}$ utilises Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) to define semantic diversity criteria, enabling agents to specify what constitutes meaningfully different plans. By integrating these LTL-based diversity models directly into the search process, $\texttt{FBI}_\texttt{LTL}$ ensures the generation of semantically diverse plans, addressing a critical limitation of existing diverse planning approaches that may produce syntactically different but semantically identical solutions. Extensive evaluations on various benchmarks consistently demonstrate that $\texttt{FBI}_\texttt{LTL}$ generates more diverse plans compared to a baseline approach. This work establishes the feasibility of semantically-guided diverse planning in simulation-based environments, paving the way for innovative approaches in realistic, non-symbolic domains where traditional model-based approaches fail.

  Modern AI agents can exchange messages using protocols such as A2A and ACP, yet these mechanisms emphasize communication over coordination. As agent populations grow, this limitation produces brittle collective behavior, where individually smart agents converge on poor group outcomes. We introduce the Ripple Effect Protocol (REP), a coordination protocol in which agents share not only their decisions but also lightweight sensitivities - signals expressing how their choices would change if key environmental variables shifted. These sensitivities ripple through local networks, enabling groups to align faster and more stably than with agent-centric communication alone. We formalize REP's protocol specification, separating required message schemas from optional aggregation rules, and evaluate it across scenarios with varying incentives and network topologies. Benchmarks across three domains: (i) supply chain cascades (Beer Game), (ii) preference aggregation in sparse networks (Movie Scheduling), and (iii) sustainable resource allocation (Fishbanks) show that REP improves coordination accuracy and efficiency over A2A by 41 to 100%, while flexibly handling multimodal sensitivity signals from LLMs. By making coordination a protocol-level capability, REP provides scalable infrastructure for the emerging Internet of Agents

  Large Language Models (LLMs), such as OpenAI-o1 and DeepSeek-R1, have demonstrated strong reasoning capabilities. To further enhance LLM capabilities, recent agentic systems, such as Deep Research, incorporate web interactions into LLM reasoning to mitigate uncertainties and reduce potential errors. However, existing research predominantly focuses on reasoning performance, often neglecting the efficiency of agentic systems. In this work, we present a comprehensive empirical study that identifies efficiency bottlenecks in web-interactive agentic systems. We decompose end-to-end latency into two primary components: LLM API latency and web environment latency. We conduct a comprehensive empirical study across 15 models and 5 providers to demonstrate high variability in API-based agentic systems. We observe that web environment latency can contribute as much as 53.7% to the overall latency in a web-based agentic system. To improve latency, we propose SpecCache, a caching framework augmented with speculative execution that can reduce web environment overhead. Extensive evaluations on two standard benchmarks show that our approach improves the cache hit rate by up to 58x compared to a random caching strategy, while reducing web environment overhead by up to 3.2x, without degrading agentic system performance.

  The deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) as agentic orchestrators has revolutionized task automation, but the need for privacy-preserving, cost-effective solutions demands on-device inference capabilities. However, local LLMs consistently underperform compared to frontier models in tool calling scenarios, struggling with both tool selection from large tool sets and accurate argument generation for complex parameter structures. We introduce a methodology that disaggregates a tool-calling task into two distinct subtasks: tool selection and argument generation. We propose "decoupled fine-tuning", a novel post-training approach that employs LoRA fine-tuning to create dedicated LoRA adapters for tool selection and tool-specific argument generation using separate loss masking for each of the subtasks. Furthermore, we present DualTune, an inference framework that leverages the LoRA adapters created using decoupled fine-tuning to perform efficient agent orchestration with the help of local models on end-user devices. DualTune decomposes the tool-call generation step into tool selection and argument generation, and dynamically loads the corresponding LoRA adapters to generate tool calls. Additionally, DualTune implements hierarchical orchestration to restrict the number of tools required for tool selection. Our experiments on the MCP-Bench benchmark demonstrate that the Qwen-2.5-7B model trained using decoupled fine-tuning improves the tool calling accuracy of the base model by 46%, and outperforms other local reasoning, non-reasoning and fine-tuned models of similar size in all cases, and models that are 2x larger, in most cases.

  Forecasting is not only a fundamental intellectual pursuit but also is of significant importance to societal systems such as finance and economics. With the rapid advances of large language models (LLMs) trained on Internet-scale data, it raises the promise of employing LLMs to forecast real-world future events, an emerging paradigm we call "LLM-as-a-Prophet". This paper systematically investigates such predictive intelligence of LLMs. To this end, we build Prophet Arena, a general evaluation benchmark that continuously collects live forecasting tasks and decomposes each task into distinct pipeline stages, in order to support our controlled and large-scale experimentation. Our comprehensive evaluation reveals that many LLMs already exhibit impressive forecasting capabilities, reflected in, e.g., their small calibration errors, consistent prediction confidence and promising market returns. However, we also uncover key bottlenecks towards achieving superior predictive intelligence via LLM-as-a-Prophet, such as LLMs' inaccurate event recalls, misunderstanding of data sources and slower information aggregation compared to markets when resolution nears.

  Effective code generation with language models hinges on two critical factors: accurately understanding the intent of the prompt and generating code that applies algorithmic reasoning to produce correct solutions capable of passing diverse test cases while adhering to the syntax of the target programming language. Unlike other language tasks, code generation requires more than accurate token prediction; it demands comprehension of solution-level and structural relationships rather than merely generating the most likely tokens. very large language model (VLLM) are capable of generating detailed steps toward the correct solution of complex tasks where reasoning is crucial in solving the problem. Such reasoning capabilities may be absent in smaller language models. Therefore, in this work, we distill the reasoning capabilities of a VLLM into a smaller, more efficient model that is faster and cheaper to deploy. Our approach trains the model to emulate the reasoning and problem-solving abilities of the VLLM by learning to identify correct solution pathways and establishing a structural correspondence between problem definitions and potential solutions through a novel method of structure-aware loss optimization. This enables the model to transcend token-level generation and to deeply grasp the overarching structure of solutions for given problems. Experimental results show that our fine-tuned model, developed through a cheap and simple to implement process, significantly outperforms our baseline model in terms of pass@1, average data flow, and average syntax match metrics across the MBPP, MBPP Plus, and HumanEval benchmarks.

  The increasing demand for long-context modeling in large language models (LLMs) is bottlenecked by the quadratic complexity of the standard self-attention mechanism. The community has proposed sparse attention to mitigate this issue. However, position-aware sparse attention methods rely on static sparse structures that lack adaptability to diverse query contexts, while content-aware sparse attention methods depend on heuristic key-value selection, hindering full differentiability. We introduce a trainable dynamic mask sparse attention mechanism, a method that merges the advantages of both position-aware and content-aware approaches. Dynamic Mask Attention (DMA) achieves this through three key innovations: First, it leverages value vector representations to generate content-aware dynamic masks, enabling the model to adaptively identify and attend to critical information. Second, it computes position-aware sparse weights in a hardware-friendly manner, efficiently skipping unnecessary computational regions. Finally, we demonstrate that the introduced dynamic mask and sparse weights do not obstruct gradients, supporting end-to-end training. We have validated the performance of DMA through comprehensive experiments. A large body of experimental evidence shows that DMA consistently holds a Pareto advantage over state-of-the-art sparse attention baselines in tasks including scaling laws, multi-query associative recall, standard benchmarks, and needle in a haystack tests, while also delivering up to a 10x overall speedup. These results highlight its ability to effectively balance model efficiency with long-context modeling capabilities. Our computational kernel code is now open-source atthis https URLto encourage further research and application by the community.

  Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR) has significantly advanced the complex reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, it struggles to break through the inherent capability boundaries of the base LLM, due to its essentially on-policy strategy coupled with LLM's immense action space and sparse reward. Critically, RLVR can lead to the capability boundary collapse, narrowing the LLM's problem-solving scope. To address this problem, we propose RL-PLUS, a novel hybrid-policy optimization approach for LLMs that synergizes internal exploitation with external data to achieve stronger reasoning capabilities and surpass the boundaries of base models. RL-PLUS integrates two core components, i.e., Multiple Importance Sampling to address distributional mismatch from external data, and Exploration-Based Advantage Function to guide the model towards high-value, unexplored reasoning paths. We provide both theoretical analysis and extensive experiments to demonstrate the superiority and generalizability of our approach. Compared with existing RLVR methods, RL-PLUS achieves 1) state-of-the-art performance on six math reasoning benchmarks; 2) superior performance on six out-of-distribution reasoning tasks; 3) consistent and significant gains across diverse model families, with average relative improvements up to 69.2\%. Moreover, the analysis of Pass@k curves indicates that RL-PLUS effectively resolves the capability boundary collapse problem.

  LLM-based formal proof assistants (e.g., in Lean) hold great promise for automating mathematical discovery. But beyond syntactic correctness, do these systems truly understand mathematical structure as humans do? We investigate this question in context of mathematical inequalities -- specifically the prover's ability to recognize that the given problem simplifies by applying a known inequality such as AM/GM. Specifically, we are interested in their ability to do this in a compositional setting where multiple inequalities must be applied as part of a solution. We introduce Ineq-Comp, a benchmark built from elementary inequalities through systematic transformations, including variable duplication, algebraic rewriting, and multi-step composition. Although these problems remain easy for humans, we find that most provers -- including Goedel, STP, and Kimina-7B -- struggle significantly. DeepSeek-Prover-V2-7B shows relative robustness, but still suffers a 20% performance drop (pass@32). Even for DeepSeek-Prover-V2-671B model, the gap between compositional variants and seed problems exists, implying that simply scaling up the model size alone does not fully solve the compositional weakness. Strikingly, performance remains poor for all models even when formal proofs of the constituent parts are provided in context, revealing that the source of weakness is indeed in compositional reasoning. Our results expose a persisting gap between the generalization behavior of current AI provers and human mathematical intuition. All data and evaluation code can be found atthis https URL.

  A key challenge in training Vision-Language Model (VLM) agents, compared to Language Model (LLM) agents, lies in the shift from textual states to complex visual observations. This transition introduces partial observability and demands robust world modeling. We ask: Can VLM agents construct internal world models through explicit visual state reasoning? To address this question, we architecturally enforce and reward the agent's reasoning process via reinforcement learning (RL), formulating it as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP). We find that decomposing the agent's reasoning into State Estimation ("what is the current state?") and Transition Modeling ("what comes next?") is critical for success, as demonstrated through five reasoning strategies. Our investigation into how agents represent internal beliefs reveals that the optimal representation is task-dependent: Natural Language excels at capturing semantic relationships in general tasks, while Structured formats are indispensable for precise manipulation and control. Building on these insights, we design a World Modeling Reward that provides dense, turn-level supervision for accurate state prediction, and introduce Bi-Level General Advantage Estimation (Bi-Level GAE) for turn-aware credit assignment. Through this form of visual state reasoning, a 3B-parameter model achieves a score of 0.82 across five diverse agent benchmarks, representing a 3$\times$ improvement over its untrained counterpart (0.21) and outperforming proprietary reasoning models such as GPT-5 (0.75), Gemini 2.5 Pro (0.67) and Claude 4.5 (0.62). All experiments are conducted within our VAGEN framework, a scalable system for training and analyzing multi-turn VLM agents in diverse visual environments.

  Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown promise in graph understanding, but remain limited by input-token constraints, facing scalability bottlenecks and lacking effective mechanisms to coordinate textual and visual modalities. To address these challenges, we propose GraphVista, a unified framework that enhances both scalability and modality coordination in graph understanding. For scalability, GraphVista organizes graph information hierarchically into a lightweight GraphRAG base, which retrieves only task-relevant textual descriptions and high-resolution visual subgraphs, compressing redundant context while preserving key reasoning elements. For modality coordination, GraphVista introduces a planning agent that routes tasks to the most suitable modality-using the text modality for simple property reasoning and the visual modality for local and structurally complex reasoning grounded in explicit topology. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GraphVista scales to large graphs, up to $200\times$ larger than those used in existing benchmarks, and consistently outperforms existing textual, visual, and fusion-based methods, achieving up to $4.4\times$ quality improvement over the state-of-the-art baselines by fully exploiting the complementary strengths of both modalities.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success across a wide range of industries, primarily due to their impressive generative abilities. Yet, their potential in applications requiring cognitive abilities, such as psychological counseling, remains largely untapped. This paper investigates the key question: \textit{Can LLMs be effectively applied to psychological counseling?} To determine whether an LLM can effectively take on the role of a psychological counselor, the first step is to assess whether it meets the qualifications required for such a role, namely the ability to pass the U.S. National Counselor Certification Exam (NCE). This is because, just as a human counselor must pass a certification exam to practice, an LLM must demonstrate sufficient psychological knowledge to meet the standards required for such a role. To address this, we introduce PsychCounsel-Bench, a benchmark grounded inthis http URLcounselor examinations, a licensure test for professional counselors that requires about 70\% accuracy to pass. PsychCounsel-Bench comprises approximately 2,252 carefully curated single-choice questions, crafted to require deep understanding and broad enough to cover various sub-disciplines of psychology. This benchmark provides a comprehensive assessment of an LLM's ability to function as a counselor. Our evaluation shows that advanced models such as GPT-4o, Llama3.3-70B, and Gemma3-27B achieve well above the passing threshold, while smaller open-source models (e.g., Qwen2.5-7B, Mistral-7B) remain far below it. These results suggest that only frontier LLMs are currently capable of meeting counseling exam standards, highlighting both the promise and the challenges of developing psychology-oriented LLMs. We release the proposed dataset for public use:this https URL

  Math reasoning has become the poster child of progress in large language models (LLMs), with new models rapidly surpassing human-level performance on benchmarks like MATH and AIME. But as math leaderboards improve week by week, it is worth asking: do these gains reflect broader problem-solving ability or just narrow overfitting? To answer this question, we evaluate over 20 open-weight reasoning-tuned models across a broad suite of tasks, including math, scientific QA, agent planning, coding, and standard instruction-following. We surprisingly find that most models that succeed in math fail to transfer their gains to other domains. To rigorously study this phenomenon, we conduct controlled experiments on Qwen3-14B models using math-only data but different tuning methods. We find that reinforcement learning (RL)-tuned models generalize well across domains, while supervised fine-tuning (SFT)-tuned models often forget general capabilities. Latent-space representation and token-space distribution shift analyses reveal that SFT induces substantial representation and output drift, while RL preserves general-domain structure. Our results suggest a need to rethink standard post-training recipes, particularly the reliance on SFT-distilled data for advancing reasoning models.

  The cryptocurrency market offers significant investment opportunities but faces challenges including high volatility and fragmented information. Data integration and analysis are essential for informed investment decisions. Currently, investors use three main approaches: (1) Manual analysis across various sources, which depends heavily on individual experience and is time-consuming and prone to bias; (2) Data aggregation platforms-limited in functionality and depth of analysis; (3) Large language model agents-based on static pretrained models, lacking real-time data integration and multi-step reasoning capabilities. To address these limitations, we present Coinvisor, a reinforcement learning-based chatbot that provides comprehensive analytical support for cryptocurrency investment through a multi-agent framework. Coinvisor integrates diverse analytical capabilities through specialized tools. Its key innovation is a reinforcement learning-based tool selection mechanism that enables multi-step planning and flexible integration of diverse data sources. This design supports real-time interaction and adaptive analysis of dynamic content, delivering accurate and actionable investment insights. We evaluated Coinvisor through automated benchmarks on tool calling accuracy and user studies with 20 cryptocurrency investors using our interface. Results show that Coinvisor improves recall by 40.7% and F1 score by 26.6% over the base model in tool orchestration. User studies show high satisfaction (4.64/5), with participants preferring Coinvisor to both general LLMs and existing crypto platforms (4.62/5).

  As large-scale multi-agent systems evolve, the communication protocol layer has become a critical yet under-evaluated factor shaping performance and reliability. Despite the existence of diverse protocols (A2A, ACP, ANP, Agora, etc.), selection is often intuition-driven and lacks standardized guidance. We introduce ProtocolBench, a benchmark that systematically compares agent protocols along four measurable axes: task success, end-to-end latency, message or byte overhead, and robustness under failures. On ProtocolBench, protocol choice significantly influences system behavior. In the Streaming Queue scenario, overall completion time varies by up to 36.5% across protocols, and mean end-to-end latency differs by 3.48 s. Under Fail-Storm Recovery, resilience also differs consistently across protocols. Beyond evaluation, we present ProtocolRouter, a learnable protocol router that selects per-scenario (or per-module) protocols from requirement and runtime signals. ProtocolRouter reduces Fail-Storm recovery time by up to 18.1% versus the best single-protocol baseline, and achieves scenario-specific gains such as higher success in GAIA. We also release ProtocolRouterBench to standardize protocol evaluation and improve reliability at scale.

  The efficiency of GPU kernels is central to the progress of modern AI, yet optimizing them remains a difficult and labor-intensive task due to complex interactions between memory hierarchies, thread scheduling, and hardware-specific characteristics. While recent advances in large language models (LLMs) provide new opportunities for automated code generation, existing approaches largely treat LLMs as single-shot generators or naive refinement tools, limiting their effectiveness in navigating the irregular kernel optimization landscape. We introduce an LLM agentic framework for GPU kernel optimization that systematically explores the design space through multi-agent collaboration, grounded instruction, dynamic context management, and strategic search. This framework mimics the workflow of expert engineers, enabling LLMs to reason about hardware trade-offs, incorporate profiling feedback, and refine kernels iteratively. We evaluate our approach on KernelBench, a benchmark for LLM-based kernel optimization, and demonstrate substantial improvements over baseline agents: our system produces correct solutions where baselines often fail, and achieves kernels with up to 16x faster runtime performance. These results highlight the potential of agentic LLM frameworks to advance fully automated, scalable GPU kernel optimization.

  Multimodal Knowledge Graphs (MKGs) extend traditional knowledge graphs by incorporating visual and textual modalities, enabling richer and more expressive entity representations. However, existing MKGs often suffer from incompleteness, which hinder their effectiveness in downstream tasks. Therefore, multimodal knowledge graph completion (MKGC) task is receiving increasing attention. While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise for knowledge graph completion (KGC), their application to the multimodal setting remains underexplored. Moreover, applying Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to the task of MKGC introduces significant challenges: (1) the large number of image tokens per entity leads to semantic noise and modality conflicts, and (2) the high computational cost of processing large token inputs. To address these issues, we propose Efficient Lightweight Multimodal Large Language Models (ELMM) for MKGC. ELMM proposes a Multi-view Visual Token Compressor (MVTC) based on multi-head attention mechanism, which adaptively compresses image tokens from both textual and visual views, thereby effectively reducing redundancy while retaining necessary information and avoiding modality conflicts. Additionally, we design an attention pruning strategy to remove redundant attention layers from MLLMs, thereby significantly reducing the inference cost. We further introduce a linear projection to compensate for the performance degradation caused by pruning. Extensive experiments on benchmark FB15k-237-IMG and WN18-IMG demonstrate that ELMM achieves state-of-the-art performance while substantially improving computational efficiency, establishing a new paradigm for multimodal knowledge graph completion.

  Complex vehicle routing problems (VRPs) remain a fundamental challenge, demanding substantial expert effort for intent interpretation and algorithm design. While large language models (LLMs) offer a promising path toward automation, current approaches still rely on external intervention, which restrict autonomy and often lead to execution errors and low solution feasibility. To address these challenges, we propose an Agentic Framework with LLMs (AFL) for solving complex vehicle routing problems, achieving full automation from problem instance to solution. AFL directly extracts knowledge from raw inputs and enables self-contained code generation without handcrafted modules or external solvers. To improve trustworthiness, AFL decomposes the overall pipeline into three manageable subtasks and employs four specialized agents whose coordinated interactions enforce cross-functional consistency and logical soundness. Extensive experiments on 60 complex VRPs, ranging from standard benchmarks to practical variants, validate the effectiveness and generality of our framework, showing comparable performance against meticulously designed algorithms. Notably, it substantially outperforms existing LLM-based baselines in both code reliability and solution feasibility, achieving rates close to 100% on the evaluated benchmarks.

  Reinforcement Learning (RL) has become a compelling way to strengthen the multi step reasoning ability of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, prevalent RL paradigms still lean on sparse outcome-based rewards and limited exploration, which often drives LLMs toward repetitive and suboptimal reasoning patterns. In this paper, we study the central question of how to design exploration for LLM reasoning and introduce MERCI (Motivating Exploration in LLM Reasoning with Count-based Intrinsic Rewards), a novel RL algorithm that augments policy optimization with a principled intrinsic reward. Building on the idea of count-based exploration, MERCI leverages a lightweight Coin Flipping Network (CFN) to estimate the pseudo count and further epistemic uncertainty over reasoning trajectories, and converts them into an intrinsic reward that values novelty while preserving the learning signal from task rewards. We integrate MERCI into some advanced RL frameworks like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Experiments on complex reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that MERCI encourages richer and more varied chains of thought, significantly improves performance over strong baselines, and helps the policy escape local routines to discover better solutions. It indicates that our targeted intrinsic motivation can make exploration reliable for language model reasoning.

  Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based on knowledge graphs (KGs) enhances large language models (LLMs) by providing structured and interpretable external knowledge. However, existing KG-based RAG methods struggle to retrieve accurate and diverse information from text-rich KGs for complex real-world queries. Process Reward Models (PRMs) offer a way to align the retrieval process of KG-based RAG with query-specific knowledge requirements, but they heavily rely on process-level supervision signals that are expensive and hard to obtain on KGs. To address this challenge, we propose GraphFlow, a framework that efficiently retrieves accurate and diverse knowledge required for real-world queries from text-rich KGs. GraphFlow employs a transition-based flow matching objective to jointly optimize a retrieval policy and a flow estimator. The flow estimator factorizes the reward of the retrieval outcome into the intermediate retrieval states. Such reward factorization guides the retrieval policy to retrieve candidates from KGs in proportion to their reward. This allows GraphFlow to explore high-quality regions of KGs that yield diverse and relevant results. We evaluate GraphFlow on the STaRK benchmark, which includes real-world queries from multiple domains over text-rich KGs. GraphFlow outperforms strong KG-RAG baselines, including GPT-4o, by 10% on average in hit rate and recall. It also shows strong generalization to unseen KGs, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness.

  Engineering construction automation aims to transform natural language specifications into physically viable structures, requiring complex integrated reasoning under strict physical constraints. While modern LLMs possess broad knowledge and strong reasoning capabilities that make them promising candidates for this domain, their construction competencies remain largely unevaluated. To address this gap, we introduce BuildArena, the first physics-aligned interactive benchmark designed for language-driven engineering construction. It contributes to the community in four aspects: (1) a highly customizable benchmarking framework for in-depth comparison and analysis of LLMs; (2) an extendable task design strategy spanning static and dynamic mechanics across multiple difficulty tiers; (3) a 3D Spatial Geometric Computation Library for supporting construction based on language instructions; (4) a baseline LLM agentic workflow that effectively evaluates diverse model capabilities. On eight frontier LLMs, BuildArena comprehensively evaluates their capabilities for language-driven and physics-grounded construction automation. The project page is atthis https URL.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong reasoning capabilities, with models like OpenAI's O-series and DeepSeek R1 excelling at tasks such as mathematics, coding, logic, and puzzles through Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). However, their ability to solve more complex optimization problems - particularly NP-hard tasks - remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose NP-ENGINE, the first comprehensive framework for training and evaluating LLMs on NP-hard problems. NP-ENGINE covers 10 tasks across five domains, each equipped with (i) a controllable instance generator, (ii) a rule-based verifier, and (iii) a heuristic solver that provides approximate optimal solutions as ground truth. This generator-verifier-heuristic pipeline enables scalable and verifiable RLVR training under hierarchical difficulties. We also introduce NP-BENCH, a benchmark derived from NP-ENGINE-DATA, specifically designed to evaluate LLMs' ability to tackle NP-hard level reasoning problems, focusing not only on feasibility but also on solution quality. Additionally, we present QWEN2.5-7B-NP, a model trained via zero-RLVR with curriculum learning on Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, which significantly outperforms GPT-4o on NP-BENCH and achieves SOTA performance with the same model size. Beyond in-domain tasks, we demonstrate that RLVR training on NP-ENGINE-DATA enables strong out-of-domain (OOD) generalization to reasoning tasks (logic, puzzles, math, and knowledge), as well as non-reasoning tasks such as instruction following. We also observe a scaling trend: increasing task diversity improves OOD generalization. These findings suggest that task-rich RLVR training is a promising direction for advancing LLM's reasoning ability, revealing new insights into the scaling laws of RLVR.

On a 90-example FDA-derived benchmark, grounding in MedRule-KG improves exact match (EM) from 0.767 to 0.900, and adding the verifier yields 1.000 EM while eliminating rule violations entirely. We demonstrate how MedRule-KG provides a general scaffold for safe mathematical reasoning, discuss ablations, and release code and data to encourage reproducibility.

  Recent advances in large reasoning models (LRMs) have enabled remarkable performance on complex tasks such as mathematics and coding by generating long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) traces. In this paper, we identify and systematically analyze a critical vulnerability we term reasoning distraction, where LRMs are diverted from their primary objective by irrelevant yet complex tasks maliciously embedded in the prompt. Through a comprehensive study across diverse models and benchmarks, we show that even state-of-the-art LRMs are highly susceptible, with injected distractors reducing task accuracy by up to 60%. We further reveal that certain alignment techniques can amplify this weakness and that models may exhibit covert compliance, following hidden adversarial instructions in reasoning while concealing them in the final output. To mitigate these risks, we propose a training-based defense that combines Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) on synthetic adversarial data, improving robustness by over 50 points on challenging distractor attacks. Our findings establish reasoning distraction as a distinct and urgent threat to LRM reliability and provide a practical step toward safer and more trustworthy reasoning systems.

  Modern manufacturing systems must meet hard delivery deadlines while coping with stochastic task durations caused by process noise, equipment variability, and human intervention. Traditional deterministic schedules break down when reality deviates from nominal plans, triggering costly last-minute repairs. This thesis combines offline constraint-programming (CP) optimisation with online temporal-network execution to create schedules that remain feasible under worst-case uncertainty. First, we build a CP model of the flexible job-shop with per-job deadline tasks and insert an optimal buffer $\Delta^*$ to obtain a fully pro-active baseline. We then translate the resulting plan into a Simple Temporal Network with Uncertainty (STNU) and verify dynamic controllability, which guarantees that a real-time dispatcher can retime activities for every bounded duration realisation without violating resource or deadline constraints. Extensive Monte-Carlo simulations on the open Kacem~1--4 benchmark suite show that our hybrid approach eliminates 100\% of deadline violations observed in state-of-the-art meta-heuristic schedules, while adding only 3--5\% makespan overhead. Scalability experiments confirm that CP solve-times and STNU checks remain sub-second on medium-size instances. The work demonstrates how temporal-network reasoning can bridge the gap between proactive buffering and dynamic robustness, moving industry a step closer to truly digital, self-correcting factories.

  Existing transfer fault diagnosis methods typically assume either clean data or sufficient domain similarity, which limits their effectiveness in industrial environments where severe noise interference and domain shifts coexist. To address this challenge, we propose an information separation global-focal adversarial network (ISGFAN), a robust framework for cross-domain fault diagnosis under noise conditions. ISGFAN is built on an information separation architecture that integrates adversarial learning with an improved orthogonal loss to decouple domain-invariant fault representation, thereby isolating noise interference and domain-specific characteristics. To further strengthen transfer robustness, ISGFAN employs a global-focal domain-adversarial scheme that constrains both the conditional and marginal distributions of the model. Specifically, the focal domain-adversarial component mitigates category-specific transfer obstacles caused by noise in unsupervised scenarios, while the global domain classifier ensures alignment of the overall distribution. Experiments conducted on three public benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other prominent existing approaches, confirming the superiority of the ISGFAN framework.

  _Dong Liu, Yanxuan Yu_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We propose \textbf{Cognitive Load Traces} (CLTs) as a mid-level interpretability framework for deep models, inspired by Cognitive Load Theory in human cognition. CLTs are defined as symbolic, temporally varying functions that quantify model-internal resource allocation. Formally, we represent CLTs as a three-component stochastic process $(\mathrm{IL}_t, \mathrm{EL}_t, \mathrm{GL}_t)$, corresponding to \emph{Intrinsic}, \emph{Extraneous}, and \emph{Germane} load. Each component is instantiated through measurable proxies such as attention entropy, KV-cache miss ratio, representation dispersion, and decoding stability. We propose both symbolic formulations and visualization methods (load curves, simplex diagrams) that enable interpretable analysis of reasoning dynamics. Experiments on reasoning and planning benchmarks show that CLTs predict error-onset, reveal cognitive strategies, and enable load-guided interventions that improve reasoning efficiency by 15-30\% while maintaining accuracy.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Memory systems are fundamental to AI agents, yet existing work often lacks adaptability to diverse tasks and overlooks the constructive and task-oriented role of AI agent memory. Drawing from Piaget's theory of cognitive development, we propose PISA, a pragmatic, psych-inspired unified memory system that addresses these limitations by treating memory as a constructive and adaptive process. To enable continuous learning and adaptability, PISA introduces a trimodal adaptation mechanism (i.e., schema updation, schema evolution, and schema creation) that preserves coherent organization while supporting flexible memory updates. Building on these schema-grounded structures, we further design a hybrid memory access architecture that seamlessly integrates symbolic reasoning with neural retrieval, significantly improving retrieval accuracy and efficiency. Our empirical evaluation, conducted on the existing LOCOMO benchmark and our newly proposed AggQA benchmark for data analysis tasks, confirms that PISA sets a new state-of-the-art by significantly enhancing adaptability and long-term knowledge retention.

  Tool-augmented large language models (LLMs) are emerging as deep research agents, systems that decompose complex queries, retrieve external evidence, and synthesize grounded responses. Yet current agents remain limited by shallow retrieval, weak alignment metrics, and brittle tool-use behavior. We introduce PokeeResearch-7B, a 7B-parameter deep research agent built under a unified reinforcement learning framework for robustness, alignment, and scalability. PokeeResearch-7B is trained by an annotation-free Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF) framework to optimize policies using LLM-based reward signals that capture factual accuracy, citation faithfulness, and instruction adherence. A chain-of-thought-driven multi-call reasoning scaffold further enhances robustness through self-verification and adaptive recovery from tool failures. Among 10 popular deep research benchmarks, PokeeResearch-7B achieves state-of-the-art performance among 7B-scale deep research agents. This highlights that careful reinforcement learning and reasoning design can produce efficient, resilient, and research-grade AI agents. The model and inference code is open-sourced under MIT license atthis https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) optimized to output truthful answers often overfit, producing brittle reasoning that fails to generalize. While persuasion-based optimization has shown promise in debate settings, it has not been systematically compared against mainstream truth-based approaches. We introduce DebateQD, a minimal Quality-Diversity (QD) evolutionary algorithm that evolves diverse debate strategies across different categories (rationality, authority, emotional appeal, etc.) through tournament-style competitions where two LLMs debate while a third judges. Unlike previously proposed methods that require a population of LLMs, our approach maintains diversity of opponents through prompt-based strategies within a single LLM architecture, making it more accessible for experiments while preserving the key benefits of population-based optimization. In contrast to prior work, we explicitly isolate the role of the optimization objective by fixing the debate protocol and swapping only the fitness function: persuasion rewards strategies that convince the judge irrespective of truth, whereas truth rewards collaborative correctness. Across three model scales (7B, 32B, 72B parameters) and multiple dataset sizes from the QuALITY benchmark, persuasion-optimized strategies achieve up to 13.94% smaller train-test generalization gaps, while matching or exceeding truth optimization's test performance. These results provide the first controlled evidence that competitive pressure to persuade, rather than seek the truth collaboratively, fosters more transferable reasoning skills, offering a promising path for improving LLM generalization.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents show promising capabilities for automating computer-use tasks and facilitating accessibility, but existing interactive benchmarks are mostly English-only, covering web-use or Windows, Linux, and Android environments, but not macOS. macOS is a major OS with distinctive GUI patterns and exclusive applications. To bridge the gaps, we present macOSWorld, the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating GUI agents on macOS. macOSWorld features 202 multilingual interactive tasks across 30 applications (28 macOS-exclusive), with task instructions and OS interfaces offered in 5 languages (English, Chinese, Arabic, Japanese, and Russian). As GUI agents are shown to be vulnerable to deception attacks, macOSWorld also includes a dedicated safety benchmarking subset. Our evaluation on six GUI agents reveals a dramatic gap: proprietary computer-use agents lead at above 30% success rate, while open-source lightweight research models lag at below 5\%, highlighting the need for macOS domain adaptation. Multilingual benchmarks also expose common weaknesses, especially in Arabic, with a 28.8% average degradation compared to English. Results from safety benchmarking also highlight that deception attacks are more general and demand immediate attention. Project page:this https URL.

  _Hanjun Luo, Shenyu Dai, Chiming Ni, Xinfeng Li, Guibin Zhang, Kun Wang, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Despite the rapid advancement of LLM-based agents, the reliable evaluation of their safety and security remains a significant challenge. Existing rule-based or LLM-based evaluators often miss dangers in agents' step-by-step actions, overlook subtle meanings, fail to see how small issues compound, and get confused by unclear safety or security rules. To overcome this evaluation crisis, we introduce AgentAuditor, a universal, training-free, memory-augmented reasoning framework that empowers LLM evaluators to emulate human expert evaluators. AgentAuditor constructs an experiential memory by having an LLM adaptively extract structured semantic features (e.g., scenario, risk, behavior) and generate associated chain-of-thought reasoning traces for past interactions. A multi-stage, context-aware retrieval-augmented generation process then dynamically retrieves the most relevant reasoning experiences to guide the LLM evaluator's assessment of new cases. Moreover, we developed ASSEBench, the first benchmark designed to check how well LLM-based evaluators can spot both safety risks and security threats. ASSEBench comprises 2293 meticulously annotated interaction records, covering 15 risk types across 29 application scenarios. A key feature of ASSEBench is its nuanced approach to ambiguous risk situations, employing "Strict" and "Lenient" judgment standards. Experiments demonstrate that AgentAuditor not only consistently improves the evaluation performance of LLMs across all benchmarks but also sets a new state-of-the-art in LLM-as-a-judge for agent safety and security, achieving human-level accuracy.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Mathematical reasoning is central to artificial intelligence, with applications in education, code generation, and research-level mathematical discovery. Mathematical competitions highlight two problem types: theorem proving, requiring rigorous proofs, and answer construction, requiring creative generation and formal verification of mathematical objects. Existing research reveals that LLMs can tackle difficult answer-construction tasks but are prone to errors from hallucinations and unverifiable steps, while symbolic methods guarantee rigor but falter in creative answer construction. This raises a key understudied question: how to solve answer-construction problems while preserving both LLM creativity and mathematical rigor? To address this problem, we introduce the Enumerate-Conjecture-Prove (ECP) framework, a modular neuro-symbolic method integrating LLM-based enumeration and pattern-driven conjecturing with formal theorem proving in Lean, and ConstructiveBench, a dataset of 3,640 formal answer-construction problems from math competitions. ECP is model agnostic and shows consistent improvements over pure LLM baselines: on the subset of PutnamBench for answer construction, ECP formally solves 6 out of 337 answer-construction problems end to end (up from 4 without ECP) using GPT-5 mini and DeepSeek-Prover-V2-7B. On ConstructiveBench, ECP achieves 33.1% end-to-end state-of-the-art accuracy (up from 32.5%), demonstrating its potential to advance formal mathematical reasoning by combining LLM conjecturing with formal verification.

  Existing benchmarks for evaluating mathematical reasoning in large language models (LLMs) rely primarily on competition problems, formal proofs, or artificially challenging questions -- failing to capture the nature of mathematics encountered in actual research environments. We introduce RealMath, a novel benchmark derived directly from research papers and mathematical forums that assesses LLMs' abilities on authentic mathematical tasks. Our approach addresses three critical challenges: sourcing diverse research-level content, enabling reliable automated evaluation through verifiable statements, and designing a continually refreshable dataset to mitigate contamination risks. Experimental results across multiple LLMs reveal surprising capabilities in handling research mathematics compared to competition problems, suggesting current models may already serve as valuable assistants for working mathematicians despite limitations on highly challenging problems. The code and dataset for RealMath are publicly available.
