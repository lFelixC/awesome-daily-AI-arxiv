- **[HAMLET: Switch your Vision-Language-Action Model into a History-Aware Policy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00695)**  `arXiv:2510.00695`  `cs.RO` `cs.CV`

  Inherently, robotic manipulation tasks are history-dependent: leveraging past context could be beneficial. However, most existing Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) have been designed without considering this aspect, i.e., they rely solely on the current observation, ignoring preceding context. In this paper, we propose HAMLET, a scalable framework to adapt VLAs to attend to the historical context during action prediction. Specifically, we introduce moment tokens that compactly encode perceptual information at each timestep. Their representations are initialized with time-contrastive learning, allowing them to better capture temporally distinctive aspects. Next, we employ a lightweight memory module that integrates the moment tokens across past timesteps into memory features, which are then leveraged for action prediction. Through empirical evaluation, we show that HAMLET successfully transforms a state-of-the-art VLA into a history-aware policy, especially demonstrating significant improvements on long-horizon tasks that require historical context. In particular, on top of GR00T N1.5, HAMLET achieves an average success rate of 76.4% on history-dependent real-world tasks, surpassing the baseline performance by 47.2%. Furthermore, HAMLET pushes prior art performance from 64.1% to 66.4% on RoboCasa Kitchen (100-demo setup) and from 95.6% to 97.7% on LIBERO, highlighting its effectiveness even under generic robot-manipulation benchmarks.

  Maintaining good driving behavior in out-of-distribution scenarios remains a critical challenge in autonomous driving. A promising direction is to leverage the generalist knowledge and reasoning capabilities of large-language models by treating unusual driving scenarios as a logical reasoning task. In this work, we present Poutine, a method that uses an off-the-shelf 3B-parameter vision-language model (VLM) - without any additional components - to achieve robust end-to-end autonomous driving via a simple and scalable training recipe. To learn strong base driving capabilities, we first train Poutine-Base using self-supervised next-token prediction over vision, language, and trajectory (VLT) tokens, leveraging both nominal and long-tail driving data. In the second stage, we fine-tune Poutine-Base using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with a small set of human preference-labeled examples. We evaluated our approach on the Waymo end-to-end driving benchmark curated for long-tail scenarios. The final Poutine model achieves an RFS of 7.99 on the test set, placing 1st in the 2025 Waymo Vision-Based End-to-End Driving Challenge by a significant margin. Our results suggest that handcrafted tokenizers or custom architectural components added to base VLMs in prior work are not necessary to achieve strong driving performance. Instead, this work highlights the potential of scalable VLT pretraining combined with lightweight RL fine-tuning to enable robust and generalizable autonomous driving.

- **[Grasp Pre-shape Selection by Synthetic Training: Eye-in-hand Shared Control on the Hannes Prosthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.09812)**  `arXiv:2203.09812`  `cs.RO` `cs.CV`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We consider the task of object grasping with a prosthetic hand capable of multiple grasp types. In this setting, communicating the intended grasp type often requires a high user cognitive load which can be reduced adopting shared autonomy frameworks. Among these, so-called eye-in-hand systems automatically control the hand pre-shaping before the grasp, based on visual input coming from a camera on the wrist. In this paper, we present an eye-in-hand learning-based approach for hand pre-shape classification from RGB sequences. Differently from previous work, we design the system to support the possibility to grasp each considered object part with a different grasp type. In order to overcome the lack of data of this kind and reduce the need for tedious data collection sessions for training the system, we devise a pipeline for rendering synthetic visual sequences of hand trajectories. We develop a sensorized setup to acquire real human grasping sequences for benchmarking and show that, compared on practical use cases, models trained with our synthetic dataset achieve better generalization performance than models trained on real data. We finally integrate our model on the Hannes prosthetic hand and show its practical effectiveness. We make publicly available the code and dataset to reproduce the presented results.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown potential for robot navigation but encounter fundamental limitations: they lack persistent scene memory, offer limited spatial reasoning, and do not scale effectively with video duration for real-time application. We present VL-KnG, a Visual Scene Understanding system that tackles these challenges using spatiotemporal knowledge graph construction and computationally efficient query processing for navigation goal identification. Our approach processes video sequences in chunks utilizing modern VLMs, creates persistent knowledge graphs that maintain object identity over time, and enables explainable spatial reasoning through queryable graph structures. We also introduce WalkieKnowledge, a new benchmark with about 200 manually annotated questions across 8 diverse trajectories spanning approximately 100 minutes of video data, enabling fair comparison between structured approaches and general-purpose VLMs. Real-world deployment on a differential drive robot demonstrates practical applicability, with our method achieving 77.27% success rate and 76.92% answer accuracy, matching Gemini 2.5 Pro performance while providing explainable reasoning supported by the knowledge graph, computational efficiency for real-time deployment across different tasks, such as localization, navigation and planning. Code and dataset will be released after acceptance.

- **[EC3R-SLAM: Efficient and Consistent Monocular Dense SLAM with Feed-Forward 3D Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02080)**  `arXiv:2510.02080`  `cs.RO`  
  _Lingxiang Hu, Naima Ait Oufroukh, Fabien Bonardi, Raymond Ghandour_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The application of monocular dense Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) is often hindered by high latency, large GPU memory consumption, and reliance on camera calibration. To relax this constraint, we propose EC3R-SLAM, a novel calibration-free monocular dense SLAM framework that jointly achieves high localization and mapping accuracy, low latency, and low GPU memory consumption. This enables the framework to achieve efficiency through the coupling of a tracking module, which maintains a sparse map of feature points, and a mapping module based on a feed-forward 3D reconstruction model that simultaneously estimates camera intrinsics. In addition, both local and global loop closures are incorporated to ensure mid-term and long-term data association, enforcing multi-view consistency and thereby enhancing the overall accuracy and robustness of the system. Experiments across multiple benchmarks show that EC3R-SLAM achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, while being faster and more memory-efficient. Moreover, it runs effectively even on resource-constrained platforms such as laptops and Jetson Orin NX, highlighting its potential for real-world robotics applications.

- **[AniMaker: Multi-Agent Animated Storytelling with MCTS-Driven Clip Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10540)**  `arXiv:2506.10540`  `cs.MA` `cs.CV`  
  _Haoyuan Shi, Yunxin Li, Xinyu Chen, Longyue Wang, Baotian Hu, Min Zhang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Despite rapid advancements in video generation models, generating coherent storytelling videos that span multiple scenes and characters remains challenging. Current methods often rigidly convert pre-generated keyframes into fixed-length clips, resulting in disjointed narratives and pacing issues. Furthermore, the inherent instability of video generation models means that even a single low-quality clip can significantly degrade the entire output animation's logical coherence and visual continuity. To overcome these obstacles, we introduce AniMaker, a multi-agent framework enabling efficient multi-candidate clip generation and storytelling-aware clip selection, thus creating globally consistent and story-coherent animation solely from text input. The framework is structured around specialized agents, including the Director Agent for storyboard generation, the Photography Agent for video clip generation, the Reviewer Agent for evaluation, and the Post-Production Agent for editing and voiceover. Central to AniMaker's approach are two key technical components: MCTS-Gen in Photography Agent, an efficient Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)-inspired strategy that intelligently navigates the candidate space to generate high-potential clips while optimizing resource usage; and AniEval in Reviewer Agent, the first framework specifically designed for multi-shot animation evaluation, which assesses critical aspects such as story-level consistency, action completion, and animation-specific features by considering each clip in the context of its preceding and succeeding clips. Experiments demonstrate that AniMaker achieves superior quality as measured by popular metrics including VBench and our proposed AniEval framework, while significantly improving the efficiency of multi-candidate generation, pushing AI-generated storytelling animation closer to production standards.

- **[A Framework for Scalable Heterogeneous Multi-Agent Adversarial Reinforcement Learning in IsaacLab](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01264)**  `arXiv:2510.01264`  `cs.LG` `cs.RO`  
  _Isaac Peterson, Christopher Allred, Jacob Morrey, Mario Harper_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) is central to robotic systems cooperating in dynamic environments. While prior work has focused on these collaborative settings, adversarial interactions are equally critical for real-world applications such as pursuit-evasion, security, and competitive manipulation. In this work, we extend the IsaacLab framework to support scalable training of adversarial policies in high-fidelity physics simulations. We introduce a suite of adversarial MARL environments featuring heterogeneous agents with asymmetric goals and capabilities. Our platform integrates a competitive variant of Heterogeneous Agent Reinforcement Learning with Proximal Policy Optimization (HAPPO), enabling efficient training and evaluation under adversarial dynamics. Experiments across several benchmark scenarios demonstrate the framework's ability to model and train robust policies for morphologically diverse multi-agent competition while maintaining high throughput and simulation realism.

- **[LoFT: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning for Long-tailed Semi-Supervised Learning in Open-World Scenarios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09926)**  `arXiv:2509.09926`  `cs.LG` `cs.CV`  
  _Zhiyuan Huang, Jiahao Chen, Yurou Liu, Bing Su_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Long-tailed learning has garnered increasing attention due to its wide applicability in real-world scenarios. Among existing approaches, Long-Tailed Semi-Supervised Learning (LTSSL) has emerged as an effective solution by incorporating a large amount of unlabeled data into the imbalanced labeled dataset. However, most prior LTSSL methods are designed to train models from scratch, which often leads to issues such as overconfidence and low-quality pseudo-labels. To address these challenges, we extend LTSSL into the foundation model fine-tuning paradigm and propose a novel framework: LoFT (Long-tailed semi-supervised learning via parameter-efficient Fine-Tuning). We demonstrate that fine-tuned foundation models can generate more reliable pseudolabels, thereby benefiting imbalanced learning. Furthermore, we explore a more practical setting by investigating semi-supervised learning under open-world conditions, where the unlabeled data may include out-of-distribution (OOD) samples. To handle this problem, we propose LoFT-OW (LoFT under Open-World scenarios) to improve the discriminative ability. Experimental results on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance compared to previous approaches, even when utilizing only 1\% of the unlabeled data compared with previous works.

- **[StockBench: Can LLM Agents Trade Stocks Profitably In Real-world Markets?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02209)**  `arXiv:2510.02209`  `cs.LG` `cs.CL`  
  _Yanxu Chen, Zijun Yao, Yantao Liu, Jin Ye, Jianing Yu, Lei Hou, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated strong capabilities as autonomous agents, showing promise in reasoning, tool use, and sequential decision-making. While prior benchmarks have evaluated LLM agents in domains such as software engineering and scientific discovery, the finance domain remains underexplored, despite its direct relevance to economic value and high-stakes decision-making. Existing financial benchmarks primarily test static knowledge through question answering, but they fall short of capturing the dynamic and iterative nature of trading. To address this gap, we introduce StockBench, a contamination-free benchmark designed to evaluate LLM agents in realistic, multi-month stock trading environments. Agents receive daily market signals -- including prices, fundamentals, and news -- and must make sequential buy, sell, or hold decisions. Performance is assessed using financial metrics such as cumulative return, maximum drawdown, and the Sortino ratio. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art proprietary (e.g., GPT-5, Claude-4) and open-weight (e.g., Qwen3, Kimi-K2, GLM-4.5) models shows that while most LLM agents struggle to outperform the simple buy-and-hold baseline, several models demonstrate the potential to deliver higher returns and manage risk more effectively. These findings highlight both the challenges and opportunities in developing LLM-powered financial agents, showing that excelling at static financial knowledge tasks does not necessarily translate into successful trading strategies. We release StockBench as an open-source resource to support reproducibility and advance future research in this domain.

- **[Sparse Query Attention (SQA): A Computationally Efficient Attention Mechanism with Query Heads Reduction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01817)**  `arXiv:2510.01817`  `cs.LG` `cs.CL`  
  _Adam Filipek_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The Transformer architecture, underpinned by the Multi-Head Attention (MHA) mechanism, has become the de facto standard for state-of-the-art models in artificial intelligence. However, the quadratic computational complexity of MHA with respect to sequence length presents a significant barrier to scaling, particularly for applications involving long contexts. Prevailing solutions, such as Multi-Query Attention (MQA) and Grouped-Query Attention (GQA), have effectively addressed the memory bandwidth bottleneck that dominates autoregressive inference latency by sharing Key and Value projections. While highly successful, these methods do not reduce the fundamental number of floating-point operations (FLOPs) required for the attention score computation, which remains a critical bottleneck for training and full-sequence processing. This paper introduces Sparse Query Attention (SQA), a novel attention architecture that pursues an alternative and complementary optimization path. Instead of reducing Key/Value heads, SQA reduces the number of Query heads. This architectural modification directly decreases the computational complexity of the attention mechanism by a factor proportional to the reduction in query heads, thereby lowering the overall FLOPs. This work presents the theoretical foundation of SQA, its mathematical formulation, and a family of architectural variants. Empirical benchmarks on long sequences (32k-200k tokens) demonstrate that SQA can achieve significant throughput improvements of up to 3x in computation-bound scenarios such as model pre-training, fine-tuning, and encoder-based tasks, with only a minimal impact on model quality in preliminary smallscale experiments. SQA was discovered serendipitously during the development of the upcoming Reactive Transformer architecture, suggesting its potential as a powerful tool for building more efficient and scalable models

- **[Predictive Preference Learning from Human Interventions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01545)**  `arXiv:2510.01545`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI` `cs.RO`  
  _Haoyuan Cai, Zhenghao Peng, Bolei Zhou_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Learning from human involvement aims to incorporate the human subject to monitor and correct agent behavior errors. Although most interactive imitation learning methods focus on correcting the agent's action at the current state, they do not adjust its actions in future states, which may be potentially more hazardous. To address this, we introduce Predictive Preference Learning from Human Interventions (PPL), which leverages the implicit preference signals contained in human interventions to inform predictions of future rollouts. The key idea of PPL is to bootstrap each human intervention into L future time steps, called the preference horizon, with the assumption that the agent follows the same action and the human makes the same intervention in the preference horizon. By applying preference optimization on these future states, expert corrections are propagated into the safety-critical regions where the agent is expected to explore, significantly improving learning efficiency and reducing human demonstrations needed. We evaluate our approach with experiments on both autonomous driving and robotic manipulation benchmarks and demonstrate its efficiency and generality. Our theoretical analysis further shows that selecting an appropriate preference horizon L balances coverage of risky states with label correctness, thereby bounding the algorithmic optimality gap.

- **[ExGRPO: Learning to Reason from Experience](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02245)**  `arXiv:2510.02245`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI` `cs.CL`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards (RLVR) is an emerging paradigm for improving the reasoning ability of large language models. However, standard on-policy training discards rollout experiences after a single update, leading to computational inefficiency and instability. While prior work on RL has highlighted the benefits of reusing past experience, the role of experience characteristics in shaping learning dynamics of large reasoning models remains underexplored. In this paper, we are the first to investigate what makes a reasoning experience valuable and identify rollout correctness and entropy as effective indicators of experience value. Based on these insights, we propose ExGRPO (Experiential Group Relative Policy Optimization), a framework that organizes and prioritizes valuable experiences, and employs a mixed-policy objective to balance exploration with experience exploitation. Experiments on five backbone models (1.5B-8B parameters) show that ExGRPO consistently improves reasoning performance on mathematical/general benchmarks, with an average gain of +3.5/7.6 points over on-policy RLVR. Moreover, ExGRPO stabilizes training on both stronger and weaker models where on-policy methods fail. These results highlight principled experience management as a key ingredient for efficient and scalable RLVR.

  _Feiyang Kang, Michael Kuchnik, Karthik Padthe, Marin Vlastelica, Ruoxi Jia, Carole-Jean Wu, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In post-training for reasoning Large Language Models (LLMs), the current state of practice trains LLMs in two independent stages: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR, shortened as ``RL'' below). In this work, we challenge whether high SFT scores translate to improved performance after RL. We provide extensive counter-examples where this is not true. We find high SFT scores can be biased toward simpler or more homogeneous data and are not reliably predictive of subsequent RL gains or scaled-up post-training effectiveness. In some cases, RL training on models with improved SFT performance could lead to substantially worse outcome compared to RL on the base model without SFT. We study alternative metrics and identify generalization loss on held-out reasoning examples and Pass@large k performance to provide strong proxies for the RL outcome. We trained hundreds of models up to 12B-parameter with SFT and RLVR via GRPO and ran extensive evaluations on 7 math benchmarks with up to 256 repetitions, spending $>$1M GPU hours. Experiments include models from Llama3, Mistral-Nemo, Qwen3 and multiple state-of-the-art SFT/RL datasets. Compared to directly predicting from pre-RL performance, prediction based on generalization loss and Pass@large k achieves substantial higher precision, improving $R^2$ coefficient and Spearman's rank correlation coefficient by up to 0.5 (2x). This provides strong utility for broad use cases. For example, in most experiments, we find SFT training on unique examples for a one epoch underperforms training on half examples for two epochs, either after SFT or SFT-then-RL; With the same SFT budget, training only on short examples may lead to better SFT performance, though, it often leads to worse outcome after RL compared to training on examples with varying lengths. Evaluation tool will be open-sourced.

  Recent thinking models solve complex reasoning tasks by scaling test-time compute, but this scaling must be allocated in line with task difficulty. On one hand, short reasoning (underthinking) leads to errors on harder problems that require extended reasoning steps; but, excessively long reasoning (overthinking) can be token-inefficient, generating unnecessary steps even after reaching a correct intermediate solution. We refer to this as under-adaptivity, where the model fails to modulate its response length appropriately given problems of varying difficulty. To address under-adaptivity and strike a balance between under- and overthinking, we propose TRAAC (Think Right with Adaptive, Attentive Compression), an online post-training RL method that leverages the model's self-attention over a long reasoning trajectory to identify important steps and prune redundant ones. TRAAC also estimates difficulty and incorporates it into training rewards, thereby learning to allocate reasoning budget commensurate with example difficulty. Our approach improves accuracy, reduces reasoning steps, and enables adaptive thinking compared to base models and other RL baselines. Across a variety of tasks (AIME, AMC, GPQA-D, BBEH), TRAAC (Qwen3-4B) achieves an average absolute accuracy gain of 8.4% with a relative reduction in reasoning length of 36.8% compared to the base model, and a 7.9% accuracy gain paired with a 29.4% length drop compared to the best RL baseline. TRAAC also shows strong generalization: although our models are trained on math datasets, they show accuracy and efficiency gains on out-of-distribution non-math datasets like GPQA-D, BBEH, and OptimalThinkingBench. Our analysis further verifies that TRAAC provides fine-grained adjustments to thinking budget based on difficulty and that a combination of task-difficulty calibration and attention-based compression yields gains across diverse tasks.

- **[RLP: Reinforcement as a Pretraining Objective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01265)**  `arXiv:2510.01265`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI` `cs.CL`  
  _Ali Hatamizadeh, Syeda Nahida Akter, Shrimai Prabhumoye, Jan Kautz, Mostofa Patwary, Mohammad Shoeybi, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The dominant paradigm for training large reasoning models starts with pre-training using next-token prediction loss on vast amounts of data. Reinforcement learning, while powerful in scaling reasoning, is introduced only as the very last phase of post-training, preceded by supervised fine-tuning. While dominant, is this an optimal way of training? In this paper, we present RLP, an information-driven reinforcement pretraining objective, that brings the core spirit of reinforcement learning -- exploration -- to the last phase of pretraining. The key idea is to treat chain-of-thought as an exploratory action, with rewards computed based on the information gain it provides for predicting future tokens. This training objective essentially encourages the model to think for itself before predicting what comes next, thus teaching an independent thinking behavior earlier in the pretraining. More concretely, the reward signal measures the increase in log-likelihood of the next token when conditioning on both context and a sampled reasoning chain, compared to conditioning on context alone. This approach yields a verifier-free dense reward signal, allowing for efficient training for the full document stream during pretraining. Specifically, RLP reframes reinforcement learning for reasoning as a pretraining objective on ordinary text, bridging the gap between next-token prediction and the emergence of useful chain-of-thought reasoning. Pretraining with RLP on Qwen3-1.7B-Base lifts the overall average across an eight-benchmark math-and-science suite by 19%. With identical post-training, the gains compound, with the largest improvements on reasoning-heavy tasks such as AIME25 and MMLU-Pro. Applying RLP to the hybrid Nemotron-Nano-12B-v2 increases the overall average from 42.81% to 61.32% and raises the average on scientific reasoning by 23%, demonstrating scalability across architectures and model sizes.

- **[Addressing Pitfalls in the Evaluation of Uncertainty Estimation Methods for Natural Language Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02279)**  `arXiv:2510.02279`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Hallucinations are a common issue that undermine the reliability of large language models (LLMs). Recent studies have identified a specific subset of hallucinations, known as confabulations, which arise due to predictive uncertainty of LLMs. To detect confabulations, various methods for estimating predictive uncertainty in natural language generation (NLG) have been developed. These methods are typically evaluated by correlating uncertainty estimates with the correctness of generated text, with question-answering (QA) datasets serving as the standard benchmark. However, commonly used approximate correctness functions have substantial disagreement between each other and, consequently, in the ranking of the uncertainty estimation methods. This allows one to inflate the apparent performance of uncertainty estimation methods. We propose using several alternative risk indicators for risk correlation experiments that improve robustness of empirical assessment of UE algorithms for NLG. For QA tasks, we show that marginalizing over multiple LLM-as-a-judge variants leads to reducing the evaluation biases. Furthermore, we explore structured tasks as well as out of distribution and perturbation detection tasks which provide robust and controllable risk indicators. Finally, we propose to use an Elo rating of uncertainty estimation methods to give an objective summarization over extensive evaluation settings.

- **[DiFFPO: Training Diffusion LLMs to Reason Fast and Furious via Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02212)**  `arXiv:2510.02212`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Hanyang Zhao, Dawen Liang, Wenpin Tang, David Yao, Nathan Kallus_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We propose DiFFPO, Diffusion Fast and Furious Policy Optimization, a unified framework for training masked diffusion large language models (dLLMs) to reason not only better (furious), but also faster via reinforcement learning (RL). We first unify the existing baseline approach such as d1 by proposing to train surrogate policies via off-policy RL, whose likelihood is much more tractable as an approximation to the true dLLM policy. This naturally motivates a more accurate and informative two-stage likelihood approximation combined with importance sampling correction, which leads to generalized RL algorithms with better sample efficiency and superior task performance. Second, we propose a new direction of joint training efficient samplers/controllers of dLLMs policy. Via RL, we incentivize dLLMs' natural multi-token prediction capabilities by letting the model learn to adaptively allocate an inference threshold for each prompt. By jointly training the sampler, we yield better accuracies with lower number of function evaluations (NFEs) compared to training the model only, obtaining the best performance in improving the Pareto frontier of the inference-time compute of dLLMs. We showcase the effectiveness of our pipeline by training open source large diffusion language models over benchmark math and planning tasks.

- **[GRACE: A Language Model Framework for Explainable Inverse Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02180)**  `arXiv:2510.02180`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Inverse Reinforcement Learning aims to recover reward models from expert demonstrations, but traditional methods yield "black-box" models that are difficult to interpret and debug. In this work, we introduce GRACE (Generating Rewards As CodE), a method for using Large Language Models within an evolutionary search to reverse-engineer an interpretable, code-based reward function directly from expert trajectories. The resulting reward function is executable code that can be inspected and verified. We empirically validate GRACE on the BabyAI and AndroidWorld benchmarks, where it efficiently learns highly accurate rewards, even in complex, multi-task settings. Further, we demonstrate that the resulting reward leads to strong policies, compared to both competitive Imitation Learning and online RL approaches with ground-truth rewards. Finally, we show that GRACE is able to build complex reward APIs in multi-task setups.

  _Kuiye Ding, Fanda Fan, Zheya Wang, Hongxiao Li, Yifan Wang, Lei Wang, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In the World Wide Web, reliable time series forecasts provide the forward-looking signals that drive resource planning, cache placement, and anomaly response, enabling platforms to operate efficiently as user behavior and content distributions evolve. Compared with other domains, time series forecasting for Web applications requires much faster responsiveness to support real-time decision making. We present KAIROS, a non-autoregressive time series forecasting framework that directly models segment-level multi-peak distributions. Unlike autoregressive approaches, KAIROS avoids error accumulation and achieves just-in-time inference, while improving over existing non-autoregressive models that collapse to over-smoothed predictions. Trained on the large-scale corpus, KAIROS demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization on six widely used benchmarks, delivering forecasting performance comparable to state-of-the-art foundation models with similar scale, at a fraction of their inference cost. Beyond empirical results, KAIROS highlights the importance of non-autoregressive design as a scalable paradigm for foundation models in time series.

- **[Are LLMs Better GNN Helpers? Rethinking Robust Graph Learning under Deficiencies with Iterative Refinement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01910)**  `arXiv:2510.01910`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Zhaoyan Wang, Zheng Gao, Arogya Kharel, In-Young Ko_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are widely adopted in Web-related applications, serving as a core technique for learning from graph-structured data, such as text-attributed graphs. Yet in real-world scenarios, such graphs exhibit deficiencies that substantially undermine GNN performance. While prior GNN-based augmentation studies have explored robustness against individual imperfections, a systematic understanding of how graph-native and Large Language Models (LLMs) enhanced methods behave under compound deficiencies is still missing. Specifically, there has been no comprehensive investigation comparing conventional approaches and recent LLM-on-graph frameworks, leaving their merits unclear. To fill this gap, we conduct the first empirical study that benchmarks these two lines of methods across diverse graph deficiencies, revealing overlooked vulnerabilities and challenging the assumption that LLM augmentation is consistently superior. Building on empirical findings, we propose Robust Graph Learning via Retrieval-Augmented Contrastive Refinement (RoGRAD) framework. Unlike prior one-shot LLM-as-Enhancer designs, RoGRAD is the first iterative paradigm that leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to inject retrieval-grounded augmentations by supplying class-consistent, diverse augmentations and enforcing discriminative representations through iterative graph contrastive learning. It transforms LLM augmentation for graphs from static signal injection into dynamic refinement. Extensive experiments demonstrate RoGRAD's superiority over both conventional GNN- and LLM-enhanced baselines, achieving up to 82.43% average improvement.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The field of AutoML has made remarkable progress in post-hoc model selection, with libraries capable of automatically identifying the most performing models for a given dataset. Nevertheless, these methods often rely on exhaustive hyperparameter searches, where methods automatically train and test different types of models on the target dataset. Contrastingly, pre-hoc prediction emerges as a promising alternative, capable of bypassing exhaustive search through intelligent pre-selection of models. Despite its potential, pre-hoc prediction remains under-explored in the literature. This paper explores the intersection of AutoML and pre-hoc model selection by leveraging traditional models and Large Language Model (LLM) agents to reduce the search space of AutoML libraries. By relying on dataset descriptions and statistical information, we reduce the AutoML search space. Our methodology is applied to the AWS AutoGluon portfolio dataset, a state-of-the-art AutoML benchmark containing 175 tabular classification datasets available on OpenML. The proposed approach offers a shift in AutoML workflows, significantly reducing computational overhead, while still selecting the best model for the given dataset.

  Most recent RL for LLMs (RL4LLM) methods avoid explicit critics, replacing them with average advantage baselines. This shift is largely pragmatic: conventional value functions are computationally expensive to train at LLM scale and often fail under sparse rewards and long reasoning horizons. We revisit this bottleneck from an architectural perspective and introduce Asymmetric Proximal Policy Optimization (AsyPPO), a simple and scalable framework that restores the critics role while remaining efficient in large-model settings. AsyPPO employs a set of lightweight mini-critics, each trained on disjoint prompt shards. This design encourages diversity while preserving calibration, reducing value-estimation bias. Beyond robust estimation, AsyPPO leverages inter-critic uncertainty to refine the policy update: (i) masking advantages in states where critics agree and gradients add little learning signal, and (ii) filtering high-divergence states from entropy regularization, suppressing spurious exploration. After training on open-source data with only 5,000 samples, AsyPPO consistently improves learning stability and performance across multiple benchmarks over strong baselines, such as GRPO, achieving performance gains of more than six percent on Qwen3-4b-Base and about three percent on Qwen3-8b-Base and Qwen3-14b-Base over classic PPO, without additional tricks. These results highlight the importance of architectural innovations for scalable, efficient algorithms.

  Forest fire prediction involves estimating the likelihood of fire ignition or related risk levels in a specific area over a defined time period. With climate change intensifying fire behavior and frequency, accurate prediction has become one of the most pressing challenges in Artificial Intelligence (AI). Traditionally, fire ignition is approached as a binary classification task in the literature. However, this formulation oversimplifies the problem, especially from the perspective of end-users such as firefighters. In general, as is the case in France, firefighting units are organized by department, each with its terrain, climate conditions, and historical experience with fire events. Consequently, fire risk should be modeled in a way that is sensitive to local conditions and does not assume uniform risk across all regions. This paper proposes a new approach that tailors fire risk assessment to departmental contexts, offering more actionable and region-specific predictions for operational use. With this, we present the first national-scale AI benchmark for metropolitan France using state-of-the-art AI models on a relatively unexplored dataset. Finally, we offer a summary of important future works that should be taken into account. Supplementary materials are available on GitHub.

  Due to their expressive capacity, diffusion models have shown great promise in offline RL and imitation learning. Diffusion Actor-Critic with Entropy Regulator (DACER) extended this capability to online RL by using the reverse diffusion process as a policy approximator, achieving state-of-the-art performance. However, it still suffers from a core trade-off: more diffusion steps ensure high performance but reduce efficiency, while fewer steps degrade performance. This remains a major bottleneck for deploying diffusion policies in real-time online RL. To mitigate this, we propose DACERv2, which leverages a Q-gradient field objective with respect to action as an auxiliary optimization target to guide the denoising process at each diffusion step, thereby introducing intermediate supervisory signals that enhance the efficiency of single-step diffusion. Additionally, we observe that the independence of the Q-gradient field from the diffusion time step is inconsistent with the characteristics of the diffusion process. To address this issue, a temporal weighting mechanism is introduced, allowing the model to effectively eliminate large-scale noise during the early stages and refine its outputs in the later stages. Experimental results on OpenAI Gym benchmarks and multimodal tasks demonstrate that, compared with classical and diffusion-based online RL algorithms, DACERv2 achieves higher performance in most complex control environments with only five diffusion steps and shows greater multimodality.

  Compression methods, including quantization, distillation, and pruning, improve the computational efficiency of large reasoning models (LRMs). However, existing studies either fail to sufficiently compare all three compression methods on LRMs or lack in-depth interpretation analysis. In this paper, we investigate how the reasoning capabilities of LRMs are compromised during compression, through performance benchmarking and mechanistic interpretation. To uncover the effects of compression on reasoning performance, we benchmark quantized, distilled, and pruned DeepSeek-R1 models on four reasoning datasets (AIME 2024, FOLIO, Temporal Sequences, and MuSiQue). To precisely locate compression effects on model weights, we adapt difference of means and attribution patching techniques, focusing on the activation of every linear component in compressed LRMs, to interpret fine-grained causal relationships between weights and various reasoning capabilities. This fine-grained interpretation addresses a fundamental question of compression: which weights are the most important for reasoning? Overall, we find dynamically quantized 2.51-bit R1 reaches close-to-R1 performance. With empirical verification, we present three main findings that generalize across both Llama and Qwen: (1) Weight count has a greater impact on LRMs' knowledge memorization than reasoning, highlighting the risks of pruning and distillation; (2) The MLP up projection in the final layer of distilled LRMs is one of the most important components, offering a new perspective on locating critical weights - a fundamental problem in model compression; and (3) Current quantization methods overly compress the final-layer modules and MLP gate projections, so protecting just 2% of all weights that are excessively compressed can raise average accuracy by 6.57%, greatly surpassing the state-of-the-art.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this work, we introduce a novel paradigm for generalized In-Context Learning (ICL), termed Indirect In-Context Learning. In Indirect ICL, we explore demonstration selection strategies tailored for two distinct real-world scenarios: Mixture of Tasks and Noisy ICL. We systematically evaluate the effectiveness of Influence Functions (IFs) as a selection tool for these settings, highlighting the potential of IFs to better capture the informativeness of examples within the demonstration pool. For the Mixture of Tasks setting, demonstrations are drawn from 28 diverse tasks, including MMLU, BigBench, StrategyQA, and CommonsenseQA. We demonstrate that combining BertScore-Recall (BSR) with an IF surrogate model can further improve performance, leading to average absolute accuracy gains of 0.37\% and 1.45\% for 3-shot and 5-shot setups when compared to traditional ICL metrics. In the Noisy ICL setting, we examine scenarios where demonstrations might be mislabeled or have adversarial noise. Our experiments show that reweighting traditional ICL selectors (BSR and Cosine Similarity) with IF-based selectors boosts accuracy by an average of 2.90\% for Cosine Similarity and 2.94\% for BSR on noisy GLUE benchmarks. For the adversarial sub-setting, we show the utility of using IFs for task-agnostic demonstration selection for backdoor attack mitigation. Showing a 32.89\% reduction in Attack Success Rate compared to task-aware methods. In sum, we propose a robust framework for demonstration selection that generalizes beyond traditional ICL, offering valuable insights into the role of IFs for Indirect ICL.

  Traffic forecasting on road networks is a complex task of significant practical importance that has recently attracted considerable attention from the machine learning community, with spatiotemporal graph neural networks (GNNs) becoming the most popular approach. The proper evaluation of traffic forecasting methods requires realistic datasets, but current publicly available benchmarks have significant drawbacks, including the absence of information about road connectivity for road graph construction, limited information about road properties, and a relatively small number of road segments that falls short of real-world applications. Further, current datasets mostly contain information about intercity highways with sparsely located sensors, while city road networks arguably present a more challenging forecasting task due to much denser roads and more complex urban traffic patterns. In this work, we provide a more complete, realistic, and challenging benchmark for traffic forecasting by releasing datasets representing the road networks of two major cities, with the largest containing almost 100,000 road segments (more than a 10-fold increase relative to existing datasets). Our datasets contain rich road features and provide fine-grained data about both traffic volume and traffic speed, allowing for building more holistic traffic forecasting systems. We show that most current implementations of neural spatiotemporal models for traffic forecasting have problems scaling to datasets of our size. To overcome this issue, we propose an alternative approach to neural traffic forecasting that uses a GNN without a dedicated module for temporal sequence processing, thus achieving much better scalability, while also demonstrating stronger forecasting performance. We hope our datasets and modeling insights will serve as a valuable resource for research in traffic forecasting.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce Policy Gradient Guidance (PGG), a simple extension of classifier-free guidance from diffusion models to classical policy gradient methods. PGG augments the policy gradient with an unconditional branch and interpolates conditional and unconditional branches, yielding a test-time control knob that modulates behavior without retraining. We provide a theoretical derivation showing that the additional normalization term vanishes under advantage estimation, leading to a clean guided policy gradient update. Empirically, we evaluate PGG on discrete and continuous control benchmarks. We find that conditioning dropout-central to diffusion guidance-offers gains in simple discrete tasks and low sample regimes, but dropout destabilizes continuous control. Training with modestly larger guidance ($\gamma>1$) consistently improves stability, sample efficiency, and controllability. Our results show that guidance, previously confined to diffusion policies, can be adapted to standard on-policy methods, opening new directions for controllable online reinforcement learning.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce an order-invariant reinforcement learning framework for black-box combinatorial optimization. Classical estimation-of-distribution algorithms (EDAs) often rely on learning explicit variable dependency graphs, which can be costly and fail to capture complex interactions efficiently. In contrast, we parameterize a multivariate autoregressive generative model trained without a fixed variable ordering. By sampling random generation orders during training - a form of information-preserving dropout - the model is encouraged to be invariant to variable order, promoting search-space diversity and shaping the model to focus on the most relevant variable dependencies, improving sample efficiency. We adapt Generalized Reinforcement Policy Optimization (GRPO) to this setting, providing stable policy-gradient updates from scale-invariant advantages. Across a wide range of benchmark algorithms and problem instances of varying sizes, our method frequently achieves the best performance and consistently avoids catastrophic failures.

  Reinforcement learning (RL) research requires diverse, challenging environments that are both tractable and scalable. While modern video games may offer rich dynamics, they are computationally expensive and poorly suited for large-scale experimentation due to their CPU-bound execution. We introduce Octax, a high-performance suite of classic arcade game environments implemented in JAX, based on CHIP-8 emulation, a predecessor to Atari, which is widely adopted as a benchmark in RL research. Octax provides the JAX community with a long-awaited end-to-end GPU alternative to the Atari benchmark, offering image-based environments, spanning puzzle, action, and strategy genres, all executable at massive scale on modern GPUs. Our JAX-based implementation achieves orders-of-magnitude speedups over traditional CPU emulators while maintaining perfect fidelity to the original game mechanics. We demonstrate Octax's capabilities by training RL agents across multiple games, showing significant improvements in training speed and scalability compared to existing solutions. The environment's modular design enables researchers to easily extend the suite with new games or generate novel environments using large language models, making it an ideal platform for large-scale RL experimentation.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Transformers achieve strong performance across diverse domains but implicitly assume Euclidean geometry in their attention mechanisms, limiting their effectiveness on data with non-Euclidean structure. While recent extensions to hyperbolic and spherical spaces show promise for hierarchical and cyclical patterns, respectively, they require committing to a single geometry a priori, reducing flexibility when data exhibits mixed geometric properties. We introduce the Curvature-Adaptive Transformer (CAT), a novel architecture that dynamically learns per-token routing across three geometric attention branches through a lightweight, differentiable gating mechanism. Unlike fixed-geometry approaches, CAT enables adaptive geometric specialization, routing tokens to the appropriate curvature based on their local relational structure. The routing network provides interpretable curvature preferences while each branch employs geometry-specific operations optimized for its respective manifold. On knowledge graph completion benchmarks (FB15k-237, WN18RR), CAT achieves approximately 10% improvements in MRR and Hits@10 over fixed-geometry baselines with minimal overhead (5% parameter increase, comparable inference time). These results demonstrate that learned geometric adaptation outperforms any single fixed geometry for complex relational reasoning, establishing CAT as a scalable and interpretable foundation for mixture-of-geometry architectures across language, vision, and multimodal domains.

  Time series forecasting is central to decision-making in domains as diverse as energy, finance, climate, and public health. In practice, forecasters face thousands of short, noisy series that vary in frequency, quality, and horizon, where the dominant cost lies not in model fitting, but in the labor-intensive preprocessing, validation, and ensembling required to obtain reliable predictions. Prevailing statistical and deep learning models are tailored to specific datasets or domains and generalize poorly. A general, domain-agnostic framework that minimizes human intervention is urgently in demand. In this paper, we introduce TimeSeriesScientist (TSci), the first LLM-driven agentic framework for general time series forecasting. The framework comprises four specialized agents: Curator performs LLM-guided diagnostics augmented by external tools that reason over data statistics to choose targeted preprocessing; Planner narrows the hypothesis space of model choice by leveraging multi-modal diagnostics and self-planning over the input; Forecaster performs model fitting and validation and, based on the results, adaptively selects the best model configuration as well as ensemble strategy to make final predictions; and Reporter synthesizes the whole process into a comprehensive, transparent report. With transparent natural-language rationales and comprehensive reports, TSci transforms the forecasting workflow into a white-box system that is both interpretable and extensible across tasks. Empirical results on eight established benchmarks demonstrate that TSci consistently outperforms both statistical and LLM-based baselines, reducing forecast error by an average of 10.4% and 38.2%, respectively. Moreover, TSci produces a clear and rigorous report that makes the forecasting workflow more transparent and interpretable.

  Computational decarbonization aims to reduce carbon emissions in computing and societal systems such as data centers, transportation, and built environments. This requires accurate, fine-grained carbon intensity forecasts, yet existing tools have several key limitations: (i) they require grid-specific electricity mix data, restricting use where such information is unavailable; (ii) they depend on separate grid-specific models that make it challenging to provide global coverage; and (iii) they provide forecasts without uncertainty estimates, limiting reliability for downstream carbon-aware applications.In this paper, we present CarbonX, an open-source tool that leverages Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) for a range of decarbonization tasks. CarbonX utilizes the versatility of TSFMs to provide strong performance across multiple tasks, such as carbon intensity forecasting and imputation, and across diverse grids. Using only historical carbon intensity data and a single general model, our tool achieves a zero-shot forecasting Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 15.82% across 214 grids worldwide. Across 13 benchmark grids, CarbonX performance is comparable with the current state-of-the-art, with an average MAPE of 9.59% and tail forecasting MAPE of 16.54%, while also providing prediction intervals with 95% coverage. CarbonX can provide forecasts for up to 21 days with minimal accuracy degradation. Further, when fully fine-tuned, CarbonX outperforms the statistical baselines by 1.2--3.9X on the imputation task. Overall, these results demonstrate that CarbonX can be used easily on any grid with limited data and still deliver strong performance, making it a practical tool for global-scale decarbonization.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Hardware-Aware Neural Architecture Search (HW-NAS) requires joint optimization of accuracy and latency under device constraints. Traditional supernet-based methods require multiple GPU days per dataset. Large Language Model (LLM)-driven approaches avoid training a large supernet and can provide quick feedback, but we observe an exploration bias: the LLM repeatedly proposes neural network designs within limited search space and fails to discover architectures across different latency ranges in the entire search space. To address this issue, we propose PEL-NAS: a search space Partitioned, architecture prompt co-Evolutionary and LLM-driven Neural Architecture Search that can generate neural networks with high accuracy and low latency with reduced search cost. Our proposed PEL-NAS has three key components: 1) a complexity-driven partitioning engine that divides the search space by complexity to enforce diversity and mitigate exploration bias; 2) an LLM-powered architecture prompt co-evolution operator, in which the LLM first updates a knowledge base of design heuristics based on results from the previous round, then performs a guided evolution algorithm on architectures with prompts that incorporate this knowledge base. Prompts and designs improve together across rounds which avoids random guesswork and improve efficiency; 3) a zero-cost predictor to avoid training a large number of candidates from scratch. Experimental results show that on HW-NAS-Bench, PEL-NAS can achieve overall higher HV, lower IGD, and up to 54% lower latency than baselines at similar accuracy. Meanwhile, the search cost drops from days to minutes compared with traditional supernet baselines.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  A plethora of applications entail solving black-box optimization problems with high evaluation costs, including drug discovery, material design, as well as hyperparameter tuning. Toward finding the global optimum of such black-box optimization problems with sample efficiency, Bayesian optimization (BO) is a theoretically elegant framework that relies on a probabilistic surrogate model so as to iteratively select the query point with well-balanced exploration-exploitation tradeoffs. The Gaussian process (GP), as the de-facto choice for surrogate modeling, has achieved compelling performances for vanilla BO with low-dimensional continuous variables. However, GPs fall short in coping with high-dimensional counterparts with {\it irregular} variables (e.g., categorical, ordinal, etc.). To alleviate this, neural network-based surrogates have been explored. Inspired by the powerful capabilities of LLMs, we adopt the LLM as the surrogate to model the mapping from the high-dimensional input variables to the objective function. To adapt to the current problem, we leverage the low-rank adaptation (LoRA) to fine-tune the LLM parameters together with the posterior of a linear regression head via the variational Bayesian last layer (VBLL) framework. The resulting LoRA-VBLL is not only computationally light compared to existing alternatives, but also admits recursive updates. To automate the critical selection of the LoRA rank as well as other hyperparameters, a weighted ensemble (ENS) of LoRA-VBLL surrogates has been devised, which further accommodates continual update of the per-model weight and individual LoRA-VBLL parameters via recursive Bayes. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the compelling performance of the proposed (ENS-)LoRA-VBLL approaches on various high-dimensional benchmarks and the real-world molecular optimization tasks.

  _Brett Barkley, David Fridovich-Keil_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Synthetic data is a core component of data-efficient Dyna-style model-based reinforcement learning, yet it can also degrade performance. We study when it helps, where it fails, and why, and we show that addressing the resulting failure modes enables policy improvement that was previously unattainable. We focus on Model-Based Policy Optimization (MBPO), which performs actor and critic updates using synthetic action counterfactuals. Despite reports of strong and generalizable sample-efficiency gains in OpenAI Gym, recent work shows that MBPO often underperforms its model-free counterpart, Soft Actor-Critic (SAC), in the DeepMind Control Suite (DMC). Although both suites involve continuous control with proprioceptive robots, this shift leads to sharp performance losses across seven challenging DMC tasks, with MBPO failing in cases where claims of generalization from Gym would imply success. This reveals how environment-specific assumptions can become implicitly encoded into algorithm design when evaluation is limited. We identify two coupled issues behind these failures: scale mismatches between dynamics and reward models that induce critic underestimation and hinder policy improvement during model-policy coevolution, and a poor choice of target representation that inflates model variance and produces error-prone rollouts. Addressing these failure modes enables policy improvement where none was previously possible, allowing MBPO to outperform SAC in five of seven tasks while preserving the strong performance previously reported in OpenAI Gym. Rather than aiming only for incremental average gains, we hope our findings motivate the community to develop taxonomies that tie MDP task- and environment-level structure to algorithmic failure modes, pursue unified solutions where possible, and clarify how benchmark choices ultimately shape the conditions under which algorithms generalize.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is essential for reliable deployment of machine learning systems in vision, robotics, reinforcement learning, and beyond. We introduce Score-Curvature Out-of-distribution Proximity Evaluator for Diffusion (SCOPED), a fast and general-purpose OOD detection method for diffusion models that reduces the number of forward passes on the trained model by an order of magnitude compared to prior methods, outperforming most diffusion-based baselines and closely approaching the accuracy of the strongest ones. SCOPED is computed from a single diffusion model trained once on a diverse dataset, and combines the Jacobian trace and squared norm of the model's score function into a single test statistic. Rather than thresholding on a fixed value, we estimate the in-distribution density of SCOPED scores using kernel density estimation, enabling a flexible, unsupervised test that, in the simplest case, only requires a single forward pass and one Jacobian-vector product (JVP), made efficient by Hutchinson's trace estimator. On four vision benchmarks, SCOPED achieves competitive or state-of-the-art precision-recall scores despite its low computational cost. The same method generalizes to robotic control tasks with shared state and action spaces, identifying distribution shifts across reward functions and training regimes. These results position SCOPED as a practical foundation for fast and reliable OOD detection in real-world domains, including perceptual artifacts in vision, outlier detection in autoregressive models, exploration in reinforcement learning, and dataset curation for unsupervised training.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The long-output context generation of large reasoning models enables extended chain of thought (CoT) but also drives rapid growth of the key-value (KV) cache, quickly overwhelming GPU memory. To address this challenge, we propose ThinKV, a thought-adaptive KV cache compression framework. ThinKV is based on the observation that attention sparsity reveals distinct thought types with varying importance within the CoT. It applies a hybrid quantization-eviction strategy, assigning token precision by thought importance and progressively evicting tokens from less critical thoughts as reasoning trajectories evolve. Furthermore, to implement ThinKV, we design a kernel that extends PagedAttention to enable efficient reuse of evicted tokens' memory slots, eliminating compaction overheads. Extensive experiments on DeepSeek-R1-Distill, GPT-OSS, and NVIDIA AceReason across mathematics and coding benchmarks show that ThinKV achieves near-lossless accuracy with less than 5% of the original KV cache, while improving performance with up to 5.8x higher inference throughput over state-of-the-art baselines.

  Large language model (LLM) unlearning aims to surgically remove the influence of undesired data or knowledge from an existing model while preserving its utility on unrelated tasks. This paradigm has shown promise in addressing privacy and safety concerns. However, recent findings reveal that unlearning effects are often fragile: post-unlearning manipulations such as weight quantization or fine-tuning can quickly neutralize the intended forgetting. Prior efforts to improve robustness primarily reformulate unlearning objectives by explicitly assuming the role of vulnerability sources. In this work, we take a different perspective by investigating the role of the optimizer, independent of unlearning objectives and formulations, in shaping unlearning robustness. We show that the 'grade' of the optimizer, defined by the level of information it exploits, ranging from zeroth-order (gradient-free) to first-order (gradient-based) to second-order (Hessian-based), is tightly linked to the resilience of unlearning. Surprisingly, we find that downgrading the optimizer, such as using zeroth-order methods or compressed-gradient variants (e.g., gradient sign-based optimizers), often leads to stronger robustness. While these optimizers produce noisier and less precise updates, they encourage convergence to harder-to-disturb basins in the loss landscape, thereby resisting post-training perturbations. By connecting zeroth-order methods with randomized smoothing, we further highlight their natural advantage for robust unlearning. Motivated by these insights, we propose a hybrid optimizer that combines first-order and zeroth-order updates, preserving unlearning efficacy while enhancing robustness. Extensive experiments on the MUSE and WMDP benchmarks, across multiple LLM unlearning algorithms, validate that our approach achieves more resilient forgetting without sacrificing unlearning quality.

However, training and deploying these models is computationally challenging as the time and space complexity has a quadratic relation to the input sequence length. Several efforts exploring efficient computational paradigms and model architectures to address these limitations have been made. In this work, we explore spiking neural networks (SNNs) to design transformer models. A challenge in training large-scale SNNs, using existing surrogate learning methods is inefficient and time-consuming. On the other hand, techniques to convert existing transformer-based models to their SNN equivalent are not scalable, as achieving optimal performance comes at the cost of a large number of spike time-steps, i.e. increased latency. To address this, we propose NeurTransformer, a methodology for designing transformer-based SNN for inference using a supervised fine-tuning approach with existing conversion methods. The proposed methodology works by: (1) replacing the self-attention mechanism with a spike-based self-attention (SSA), (2) converting the feed-forward block of the trained transformer model to its equivalent SNN, and (3) fine-tuning the SSA block using SNN-based surrogate learning algorithms. We benchmark the proposed methodology and demonstrate its accuracy and scalability using three variants of the GPT-2 model of increasing model size. We observe that the converted GPT-2 small models demonstrate a 5-12% loss in cosine similarity and a 9.7% reduction in perplexity. Finally, we demonstrate the energy efficiency of the SSA block compared to the ASA block and show between 64.71% and 85.28% reductions in estimated energy consumption when implementing the self-attention mechanism on a digital hardware.

  Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a promising approach for interpreting neural network representations by learning sparse, human-interpretable features from dense activations. We investigate whether incorporating variational methods into SAE architectures can improve feature organization and interpretability. We introduce the Variational Sparse Autoencoder (vSAE), which replaces deterministic ReLU gating with stochastic sampling from learned Gaussian posteriors and incorporates KL divergence regularization toward a standard normal prior. Our hypothesis is that this probabilistic sampling creates dispersive pressure, causing features to organize more coherently in the latent space while avoiding overlap. We evaluate a TopK vSAE against a standard TopK SAE on Pythia-70M transformer residual stream activations using comprehensive benchmarks including SAE Bench, individual feature interpretability analysis, and global latent space visualization through t-SNE. The vSAE underperforms standard SAE across core evaluation metrics, though excels at feature independence and ablation metrics. The KL divergence term creates excessive regularization pressure that substantially reduces the fraction of living features, leading to observed performance degradation. While vSAE features demonstrate improved robustness, they exhibit many more dead features than baseline. Our findings suggest that naive application of variational methods to SAEs does not improve feature organization or interpretability.

  LLM-generated reasoning graphs, referred to as mission-specific graphs (MSGs), are increasingly used for video anomaly detection (VAD) and recognition (VAR). These MSGs are novel artifacts: they often exhibit skewed connectivity and lack large-scale datasets for pre-training, which makes existing graph structure refinement (GSR) methods ineffective. To address this challenge, we propose HDC-constrained Graph Structure Refinement (HDC-GSR), a paradigm that leverages hyperdimensional computing (HDC) to optimize decodable graph representations without relying on structural-distribution learning. Building on this paradigm, we introduce MissionHD, an HDC framework that encodes graphs with constrained graph-neural operations, aligns them directly with downstream task loss, and decodes refined structures. Experiments on VAD/VAR benchmarks demonstrate that MissionHD-refined graphs consistently improve performance, establishing HDC-GSR as an effective pre-processing step for structured reasoning in video anomaly tasks.

  With the rapid advancement of AI-generated videos, there is an urgent need for effective detection tools to mitigate societal risks such as misinformation and reputational harm. In addition to accurate classification, it is essential that detection models provide interpretable explanations to ensure transparency for regulators and end users. To address these challenges, we introduce VidGuard-R1, the first video authenticity detector that fine-tunes a multi-modal large language model (MLLM) using group relative policy optimization (GRPO). Our model delivers both highly accurate judgments and insightful reasoning. We curate a challenging dataset of 140k real and AI-generated videos produced by state-of-the-art generation models, carefully designing the generation process to maximize discrimination difficulty. We then fine-tune Qwen-VL using GRPO with two specialized reward models that target temporal artifacts and generation complexity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VidGuard-R1 achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on existing benchmarks, with additional training pushing accuracy above 95%. Case studies further show that VidGuard-R1 produces precise and interpretable rationales behind its predictions. The code is publicly available atthis https URL.

  Recent attempts to transfer features from 2D Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to 3D semantic segmentation expose a persistent trade-off. Directly projecting 2D features into 3D yields noisy and fragmented predictions, whereas enforcing geometric coherence necessitates costly training pipelines and large-scale annotated 3D data. We argue that this limitation stems from the dominant segmentation-and-matching paradigm, which fails to reconcile 2D semantics with 3D geometric structure. The geometric cues are not eliminated during the 2D-to-3D transfer but remain latent within the noisy and view-aggregated features. To exploit this property, we propose GeoPurify that applies a small Student Affinity Network to purify 2D VLM-generated 3D point features using geometric priors distilled from a 3D self-supervised teacher model. During inference, we devise a Geometry-Guided Pooling module to further denoise the point cloud and ensure the semantic and structural consistency. Benefiting from latent geometric information and the learned affinity network, GeoPurify effectively mitigates the trade-off and achieves superior data efficiency. Extensive experiments on major 3D benchmarks demonstrate that GeoPurify achieves or surpasses state-of-the-art performance while utilizing only about 1.5% of the training data.

Our dataset is built on 250,000 images from ImageNet21k dataset, providing structured thinking tokens and corresponding answers. Our synthetic dataset is generated by two state-of-the-art VLMs: GLM-4.1V-9B-Thinking and Kimi-VL-A3B-Thinking-2506. Each image is accompanied by two pairs of thinking-answer sequences, creating a resource for training and evaluating multimodal reasoning models.

  Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) extend the success of language models to visual understanding, and recent efforts have sought to build unified MLLMs that support both understanding and generation. However, constructing such models remains challenging: hybrid approaches combine continuous embeddings with diffusion or flow-based objectives, producing high-quality images but breaking the autoregressive paradigm, while pure autoregressive approaches unify text and image prediction over discrete visual tokens but often face trade-offs between semantic alignment and pixel-level fidelity. In this work, we present Bridge, a pure autoregressive unified MLLM that augments pre-trained visual understanding models with generative ability through a Mixture-of-Transformers architecture, enabling both image understanding and generation within a single next-token prediction framework. To further improve visual generation fidelity, we propose a semantic-to-pixel discrete representation that integrates compact semantic tokens with fine-grained pixel tokens, achieving strong language alignment and precise description of visual details with only a 7.9% increase in sequence length. Extensive experiments across diverse multimodal benchmarks demonstrate that Bridge achieves competitive or superior results in both understanding and generation benchmarks, while requiring less training data and reduced training time compared to prior unified MLLMs.

  Data-efficient learning aims to eliminate redundancy in large training datasets by training models on smaller subsets of the most informative examples. While data selection has been extensively explored for vision models and large language models (LLMs), it remains underexplored for Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). Notably, none of existing methods can outperform random selection at different subset sizes. In this work, we propose the first principled method for data-efficient instruction tuning of LVLMs. We prove that examples with similar cross-modal attention matrices during instruction tuning have similar gradients. Thus, they influence model parameters in a similar manner and convey the same information to the model during training. Building on this insight, we propose XMAS, which clusters examples based on the trajectories of the top singular values of their attention matrices obtained from fine-tuning a small proxy LVLM. By sampling a balanced subset from these clusters, XMAS effectively removes redundancy in large-scale LVLM training data. Extensive experiments show that XMAS can discard 50% of the LLaVA-665k dataset and 85% of the Vision-Flan dataset while fully preserving performance of LLaVA-1.5-7B on 10 downstream benchmarks and speeding up its training by 1.2x. This is 30% more data reduction compared to the best baseline for LLaVA-665k. The project's website can be found atthis https URL.

  Building accurate models for rare skin diseases remains challenging due to the lack of sufficient labeled data and the inherently long-tailed distribution of available samples. These issues are further complicated by inconsistencies in how datasets are collected and their varying objectives. To address these challenges, we compare three learning strategies: episodic learning, supervised transfer learning, and contrastive self-supervised pretraining, within a few-shot learning framework. We evaluate five training setups on three benchmark datasets: ISIC2018, Derm7pt, and SD-198. Our findings show that traditional transfer learning approaches, particularly those based on MobileNetV2 and Vision Transformer (ViT) architectures, consistently outperform episodic and self-supervised methods as the number of training examples increases. When combined with batch-level data augmentation techniques such as MixUp, CutMix, and ResizeMix, these models achieve state-of-the-art performance on the SD-198 and Derm7pt datasets, and deliver highly competitive results on ISIC2018. All the source codes related to this work will be made publicly available soon at the provided URL.

  We introduce the novel task of Language-Guided Object Placement in Real 3D Scenes. Our model is given a 3D scene's point cloud, a 3D asset, and a textual prompt broadly describing where the 3D asset should be placed. The task here is to find a valid placement for the 3D asset that respects the prompt. Compared with other language-guided localization tasks in 3D scenes such as grounding, this task has specific challenges: it is ambiguous because it has multiple valid solutions, and it requires reasoning about 3D geometric relationships and free space. We inaugurate this task by proposing a new benchmark and evaluation protocol. We also introduce a new dataset for training 3D LLMs on this task, as well as the first method to serve as a non-trivial baseline. We believe that this challenging task and our new benchmark could become part of the suite of benchmarks used to evaluate and compare generalist 3D LLM models.

  Video understanding in multimodal language models remains limited by context length: models often miss key transition frames and struggle to maintain coherence across long time scales. To address this, we adapt Native Sparse Attention (NSA) to video-language models. Our method, VideoNSA, adapts Qwen2.5-VL through end-to-end training on a 216K video instruction dataset. We employ a hardware-aware hybrid approach to attention, preserving dense attention for text, while employing NSA for video. Compared to token-compression and training-free sparse baselines, VideoNSA achieves improved performance on long-video understanding, temporal reasoning, and spatial benchmarks. Further ablation analysis reveals four key findings: (1) reliable scaling to 128K tokens; (2) an optimal global-local attention allocation at a fixed budget; (3) task-dependent branch usage patterns; and (4) the learnable combined sparse attention help induce dynamic attention sinks.

  Advances in machine learning and wearable sensors offer new opportunities for capturing and analyzing human movement outside specialized laboratories. Accurate assessment of human movement under real-world conditions is essential for telemedicine, sports science, and rehabilitation. This preclinical benchmark compares monocular video-based 3D human pose estimation models with inertial measurement units (IMUs), leveraging the VIDIMU dataset containing a total of 13 clinically relevant daily activities which were captured using both commodity video cameras and five IMUs. During this initial study only healthy subjects were recorded, so results cannot be generalized to pathological cohorts. Joint angles derived from state-of-the-art deep learning frameworks (MotionAGFormer, MotionBERT, MMPose 2D-to-3D pose lifting, and NVIDIA BodyTrack) were evaluated against joint angles computed from IMU data using OpenSim inverse kinematics following the Human3.6M dataset format with 17 keypoints. Among them, MotionAGFormer demonstrated superior performance, achieving the lowest overall RMSE ($9.27¬∞\pm 4.80¬∞$) and MAE ($7.86¬∞\pm 4.18¬∞$), as well as the highest Pearson correlation ($0.86 \pm 0.15$) and the highest coefficient of determination $R^{2}$ ($0.67 \pm 0.28$). The results reveal that both technologies are viable for out-of-the-lab kinematic assessment. However, they also highlight key trade-offs between video- and sensor-based approaches including costs, accessibility, and precision. This study clarifies where off-the-shelf video models already provide clinically promising kinematics in healthy adults and where they lag behind IMU-based estimates while establishing valuable guidelines for researchers and clinicians seeking to develop robust, cost-effective, and user-friendly solutions for telehealth and remote patient monitoring.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Drag-based image editing has long suffered from distortions in the target region, largely because the priors of earlier base models, Stable Diffusion, are insufficient to project optimized latents back onto the natural image manifold. With the shift from UNet-based DDPMs to more scalable DiT with flow matching (e.g., SD3.5, FLUX), generative priors have become significantly stronger, enabling advances across diverse editing tasks. However, drag-based editing has yet to benefit from these stronger priors. This work proposes the first framework to effectively harness FLUX's rich prior for drag-based editing, dubbed DragFlow, achieving substantial gains over baselines. We first show that directly applying point-based drag editing to DiTs performs poorly: unlike the highly compressed features of UNets, DiT features are insufficiently structured to provide reliable guidance for point-wise motion supervision. To overcome this limitation, DragFlow introduces a region-based editing paradigm, where affine transformations enable richer and more consistent feature supervision. Additionally, we integrate pretrained open-domain personalization adapters (e.g., IP-Adapter) to enhance subject consistency, while preserving background fidelity through gradient mask-based hard constraints. Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are further employed to resolve task ambiguities. For evaluation, we curate a novel Region-based Dragging benchmark (ReD Bench) featuring region-level dragging instructions. Extensive experiments on DragBench-DR and ReD Bench show that DragFlow surpasses both point-based and region-based baselines, setting a new state-of-the-art in drag-based image editing. Code and datasets will be publicly available upon publication.

  Even in controlled settings, understanding instance-wise geometries is a challenging task for a wide range of visual models. Although specialized systems exist, modern arts rely on expensive input formats (category labels, binary segmentation masks) and inference costs (a quadratic amount of forward passes). We mitigate these limitations by proposing InstaFormer, a network capable of holistic order prediction. That is, solely given an input RGB image, InstaFormer returns the full occlusion and depth orderings for all the instances in the scene in a single forward pass. At its core, InstaFormer relies on interactions between object queries and latent mask descriptors that semantically represent the same objects while carrying complementary information. We comprehensively benchmark and ablate our approach to highlight its effectiveness. Our code and models are open-source and available at this URL:this https URL.

  Spatial intelligence spans a rich suite of abilities, including visualising and transforming shapes, mentally rotating objects, judging relational positions and containment, and estimating numerosity. However, it still remains a critical unresolved challenge for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs).To fill this gap, we propose to treat Euclidean geometry problem-solving as a surrogate task. Specifically, we meticulously constructed a curated multimodal dataset, called Euclid30K, comprising approximately 30K plane and solid geometry problems. To enable the model to acquire and apply Euclidean principles from these geometry problems, we employed Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to finetune the Qwen2.5VL family and RoboBrain2.0 family, inspiring the models to identify shapes, count, and relate entities, and perform multi-step deductive reasoning using Euclidean principles. Our experiments demonstrate that the resulting models achieve substantial zero-shot gains across four spatial reasoning benchmarks (Super-CLEVR, Omni3DBench, VSI-Bench, and MindCube) without any task-specific adaptations. Notably, after training on the Euclid30K, the mean VSI-Bench accuracy of all evaluated models rose from 34.5% to 40.5%, improving by 5.5 percentage points. Among them, RoboBrain2.0-Euclid-7B achieves 49.6\% accuracy, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art model,this http URLour knowledge, this is the first systematic study showing that geometry-centric fine-tuning can confer vision-language models with broadly transferable spatial skills.

  Diffusion models have revolutionized image and video generation, achieving unprecedented visual quality. However, their reliance on transformer architectures incurs prohibitively high computational costs, particularly when extending generation to long videos. Recent work has explored autoregressive formulations for long video generation, typically by distilling from short-horizon bidirectional teachers. Nevertheless, given that teacher models cannot synthesize long videos, the extrapolation of student models beyond their training horizon often leads to pronounced quality degradation, arising from the compounding of errors within the continuous latent space. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective approach to mitigate quality degradation in long-horizon video generation without requiring supervision from long-video teachers or retraining on long video datasets. Our approach centers on exploiting the rich knowledge of teacher models to provide guidance for the student model through sampled segments drawn from self-generated long videos. Our method maintains temporal consistency while scaling video length by up to 20x beyond teacher's capability, avoiding common issues such as over-exposure and error-accumulation without recomputing overlapping frames like previous methods. When scaling up the computation, our method shows the capability of generating videos up to 4 minutes and 15 seconds, equivalent to 99.9% of the maximum span supported by our base model's position embedding and more than 50x longer than that of our baseline model. Experiments on standard benchmarks and our proposed improved benchmark demonstrate that our approach substantially outperforms baseline methods in both fidelity and consistency.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Unsupervised adaptation of CLIP-based vision-language models (VLMs) for fine-grained image classification requires sensitivity to microscopic local cues. While CLIP exhibits strong zero-shot transfer, its reliance on coarse global features restricts its performance on fine-grained classification tasks. Prior efforts inject fine-grained knowledge by aligning large language model (LLM) descriptions with the CLIP $\texttt{[CLS]}$ token; however, this approach overlooks spatial precision. We propose $\textbf{microCLIP}$, a self-training framework that jointly refines CLIP's visual and textual representations using fine-grained cues. At its core is Saliency-Oriented Attention Pooling (SOAP) within a lightweight TokenFusion module, which builds a saliency-guided $\texttt{[FG]}$ token from patch embeddings and fuses it with the global $\texttt{[CLS]}$ token for coarse-fine alignment. To stabilize adaptation, we introduce a two-headed LLM-derived classifier: a frozen classifier that, via multi-view alignment, provides a stable text-based prior for pseudo-labeling, and a learnable classifier initialized from LLM descriptions and fine-tuned with TokenFusion. We further develop Dynamic Knowledge Aggregation, which convexly combines fixed LLM/CLIP priors with TokenFusion's evolving logits to iteratively refine pseudo-labels. Together, these components uncover latent fine-grained signals in CLIP, yielding a consistent $2.90\%$ average accuracy gain across 13 fine-grained benchmarks while requiring only light adaptation.

  Fine-grained visual reasoning remains a core challenge for multimodal large language models (MLLMs). The recently introduced ReasonMap highlights this gap by showing that even advanced MLLMs struggle with spatial reasoning in structured and information-rich settings such as transit maps, a task of clear practical and scientific importance. However, standard reinforcement learning (RL) on such tasks is impeded by sparse rewards and unstable optimization. To address this, we first construct ReasonMap-Plus, an extended dataset that introduces dense reward signals through Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks, enabling effective cold-start training of fine-grained visual understanding skills. Next, we propose RewardMap, a multi-stage RL framework designed to improve both visual understanding and reasoning capabilities of MLLMs. RewardMap incorporates two key designs. First, we introduce a difficulty-aware reward design that incorporates detail rewards, directly tackling the sparse rewards while providing richer supervision. Second, we propose a multi-stage RL scheme that bootstraps training from simple perception to complex reasoning tasks, offering a more effective cold-start strategy than conventional Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). Experiments on ReasonMap and ReasonMap-Plus demonstrate that each component of RewardMap contributes to consistent performance gains, while their combination yields the best results. Moreover, models trained with RewardMap achieve an average improvement of 3.47% across 6 benchmarks spanning spatial reasoning, fine-grained visual reasoning, and general tasks beyond transit maps, underscoring enhanced visual understanding and reasoning capabilities.

  Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at many multimodal tasks, yet they frequently struggle with tasks requiring precise understanding and handling of fine-grained visual elements. This is mainly due to information loss during image encoding or insufficient attention to critical regions. Recent work has shown promise by incorporating pixel-level visual information into the reasoning process, enabling VLMs to access high-resolution visual details during their thought process. However, this pixel-level information is often overused, leading to inefficiency and distraction from irrelevant visual details. To address these challenges, we propose the first framework for adaptive pixel reasoning that dynamically determines necessary pixel-level operations based on the input query. Specifically, we first apply operation-aware supervised fine-tuning to establish baseline competence in textual reasoning and visual operations, then design a novel rollout-guided reinforcement learning framework relying on feedback of the model's own responses, which enables the VLM to determine when pixel operations should be invoked based on query difficulty. Experiments on extensive multimodal reasoning benchmarks show that our model achieves superior performance while significantly reducing unnecessary visual operations. Impressively, our model achieves 73.4\% accuracy on HR-Bench 4K while maintaining a tool usage ratio of only 20.1\%, improving accuracy and simultaneously reducing tool usage by 66.5\% compared to the previous methods.

  Worldwide visual geo-localization seeks to determine the geographic location of an image anywhere on Earth using only its visual content. Learned representations of geography for visual geo-localization remain an active research topic despite much progress. We formulate geo-localization as aligning the visual representation of the query image with a learned geographic representation. Our novel geographic representation explicitly models the world as a hierarchy of geographic embeddings. Additionally, we introduce an approach to efficiently fuse the appearance features of the query image with its semantic segmentation map, forming a robust visual representation. Our main experiments demonstrate improved all-time bests in 22 out of 25 metrics measured across five benchmark datasets compared to prior state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods and recent Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). Additional ablation studies support the claim that these gains are primarily driven by the combination of geographic and visual representations.

  Generalist Anomaly Detection (GAD) aims to train a unified model on an original domain that can detect anomalies in new target domains. Previous GAD methods primarily use only normal samples as references, overlooking the valuable information contained in anomalous samples that are often available in real-world scenarios. To address this limitation, we propose a more practical approach: normal-abnormal-guided generalist anomaly detection, which leverages both normal and anomalous samples as references to guide anomaly detection across diverse domains. We introduce the Normal-Abnormal Generalist Learning (NAGL) framework, consisting of two key components: Residual Mining (RM) and Anomaly Feature Learning (AFL). RM extracts abnormal patterns from normal-abnormal reference residuals to establish transferable anomaly representations, while AFL adaptively learns anomaly features in query images through residual mapping to identify instance-aware anomalies. Our approach effectively utilizes both normal and anomalous references for more accurate and efficient cross-domain anomaly detection. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing GAD approaches. This work represents the first to adopt a mixture of normal and abnormal samples as references in generalist anomaly detection. The code and datasets are available atthis https URL.

  The accurate interpretation of chest radiographs using automated methods is a critical task in medical imaging. This paper presents a comparative analysis between a supervised lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a state-of-the-art, zero-shot medical Vision-Language Model (VLM), BiomedCLIP, across two distinct diagnostic tasks: pneumonia detection on the PneumoniaMNIST benchmark and tuberculosis detection on the Shenzhen TB dataset. Our experiments show that supervised CNNs serve as highly competitive baselines in both cases. While the default zero-shot performance of the VLM is lower, we demonstrate that its potential can be unlocked via a simple yet crucial remedy: decision threshold calibration. By optimizing the classification threshold on a validation set, the performance of BiomedCLIP is significantly boosted across both datasets. For pneumonia detection, calibration enables the zero-shot VLM to achieve a superior F1-score of 0.8841, surpassing the supervised CNN's 0.8803. For tuberculosis detection, calibration dramatically improves the F1-score from 0.4812 to 0.7684, bringing it close to the supervised baseline's 0.7834. This work highlights a key insight: proper calibration is essential for leveraging the full diagnostic power of zero-shot VLMs, enabling them to match or even outperform efficient, task-specific supervised models.

  Reasoning has emerged as a pivotal capability in Large Language Models (LLMs). Through Reinforcement Learning (RL), typically Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), these models are able to solve complex tasks such as mathematics and code generation. Building on these advances, recent research has sought to extend reasoning to Vision-Language Models (VLMs), yielding promising results across diverse visual tasks. Despite this progress, our study uncovers the dual nature of multimodal reasoning: while it substantially enhances logical inference and facilitates performance on challenging problems, it may gradually impair perceptual grounding, leading to recognition failures on otherwise basic visual questions. Through further analysis, we attribute this phenomenon to visual forgetting, wherein prolonged reasoning causes the model to increasingly disregard visual input. To address this, we propose Vision-Anchored Policy Optimization (VAPO), a simple yet effective method that explicitly steers the reasoning process toward visually grounded trajectories. Our result model, VAPO-Thinker-7B, significantly strengthens the model's reliance on visual information and achieves new state-of-the-art results on a wide range of established benchmarks.

  3D scene representation methods like Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have significantly advanced novel view synthesis. As these methods become prevalent, addressing their vulnerabilities becomes critical. We analyze 3DGS robustness against image-level poisoning attacks and propose a novel density-guided poisoning method. Our method strategically injects Gaussian points into low-density regions identified via Kernel Density Estimation (KDE), embedding viewpoint-dependent illusory objects clearly visible from poisoned views while minimally affecting innocent views. Additionally, we introduce an adaptive noise strategy to disrupt multi-view consistency, further enhancing attack effectiveness. We propose a KDE-based evaluation protocol to assess attack difficulty systematically, enabling objective benchmarking for future research. Extensive experiments demonstrate our method's superior performance compared to state-of-the-art techniques. Project page:this https URL

  Video Large Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable results on a variety of vision language tasks, yet their practical use is limited by the "needle in a haystack" problem: the massive number of visual tokens produced from raw video frames exhausts the model's context window. Existing solutions alleviate this issue by selecting a sparse set of frames, thereby reducing token count, but such frame-wise selection discards essential temporal dynamics, leading to suboptimal reasoning about motion and event continuity. In this work we systematically explore the impact of temporal information and demonstrate that extending selection from isolated key frames to key clips, which are short, temporally coherent segments, improves video understanding. To maintain a fixed computational budget while accommodating the larger token footprint of clips, we propose an adaptive resolution strategy that dynamically balances spatial resolution and clip length, ensuring a constant token count per video. Experiments on three long-form video benchmarks demonstrate that our training-free approach, F2C, outperforms uniform sampling up to 8.1%, 5.6%, and 10.3% on Video-MME, LongVideoBench and MLVU benchmarks, respectively. These results highlight the importance of preserving temporal coherence in frame selection and provide a practical pathway for scaling Video LLMs to real world video understanding applications.

  Density map estimation can be used to estimate object counts in dense and occluded scenes where discrete counting-by-detection methods fail. We propose a multicategory counting framework that leverages a Twins pyramid vision-transformer backbone and a specialised multi-class counting head built on a state-of-the-art multiscale decoding approach. A two-task design adds a segmentation-based Category Focus Module, suppressing inter-category cross-talk at training time. Training and evaluation on the VisDrone and iSAID benchmarks demonstrates superior performance versus prior multicategory crowd-counting approaches (33%, 43% and 64% reduction to MAE), and the comparison with YOLOv11 underscores the necessity of crowd counting methods in dense scenes. The method's regional loss opens up multi-class crowd counting to new domains, demonstrated through the application to a biodiversity monitoring dataset, highlighting its capacity to inform conservation efforts and enable scalable ecological insights.

  Federeated Learning (FL) offers a privacy-preserving solution for Semantic Segmentation (SS) tasks to adapt to new domains, but faces significant challenges from these domain shifts, particularly when client data is unlabeled. However, most existing FL methods unrealistically assume access to labeled data on remote clients or fail to leverage the power of modern Vision Foundation Models (VFMs). Here, we propose a novel and challenging task, FFREEDG, in which a model is pretrained on a server's labeled source dataset and subsequently trained across clients using only their unlabeled data, without ever re-accessing the source. To solve FFREEDG, we propose FRIEREN, a framework that leverages the knowledge of a VFM by integrating vision and language modalities. Our approach employs a Vision-Language decoder guided by CLIP-based text embeddings to improve semantic disambiguation and uses a weak-to-strong consistency learning strategy for robust local training on pseudo-labels. Our experiments on synthetic-to-real and clear-to-adverse-weather benchmarks demonstrate that our framework effectively tackles this new task, achieving competitive performance against established domain generalization and adaptation methods and setting a strong baseline for future research.

  We introduce GaussianMorphing, a novel framework for semantic-aware 3D shape and texture morphing from multi-view images. Previous approaches usually rely on point clouds or require pre-defined homeomorphic mappings for untextured data. Our method overcomes these limitations by leveraging mesh-guided 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for high-fidelity geometry and appearance modeling. The core of our framework is a unified deformation strategy that anchors 3DGaussians to reconstructed mesh patches, ensuring geometrically consistent transformations while preserving texture fidelity through topology-aware constraints. In parallel, our framework establishes unsupervised semantic correspondence by using the mesh topology as a geometric prior and maintains structural integrity via physically plausible point trajectories. This integrated approach preserves both local detail and global semantic coherence throughout the morphing process with out requiring labeled data. On our proposed TexMorph benchmark, GaussianMorphing substantially outperforms prior 2D/3D methods, reducing color consistency error ($\Delta E$) by 22.2% and EI by 26.2%. Project page:this https URL

  Medical Image Quality Assessment (IQA) serves as the first-mile safety gate for clinical AI, yet existing approaches remain constrained by scalar, score-based metrics and fail to reflect the descriptive, human-like reasoning process central to expert evaluation. To address this gap, we introduce MedQ-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark that establishes a perception-reasoning paradigm for language-based evaluation of medical image quality with Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs). MedQ-Bench defines two complementary tasks: (1) MedQ-Perception, which probes low-level perceptual capability via human-curated questions on fundamental visual attributes; and (2) MedQ-Reasoning, encompassing both no-reference and comparison reasoning tasks, aligning model evaluation with human-like reasoning on image quality. The benchmark spans five imaging modalities and over forty quality attributes, totaling 2,600 perceptual queries and 708 reasoning assessments, covering diverse image sources including authentic clinical acquisitions, images with simulated degradations via physics-based reconstructions, and AI-generated images. To evaluate reasoning ability, we propose a multi-dimensional judging protocol that assesses model outputs along four complementary axes. We further conduct rigorous human-AI alignment validation by comparing LLM-based judgement with radiologists. Our evaluation of 14 state-of-the-art MLLMs demonstrates that models exhibit preliminary but unstable perceptual and reasoning skills, with insufficient accuracy for reliable clinical use. These findings highlight the need for targeted optimization of MLLMs in medical IQA. We hope that MedQ-Bench will catalyze further exploration and unlock the untapped potential of MLLMs for medical image quality evaluation.

  Source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) aims to address the challenge of adapting to a target domain without accessing the source domain directly. However, due to the inaccessibility of source domain data, deterministic invariable features cannot be obtained. Current mainstream methods primarily focus on evaluating invariant features in the target domain that closely resemble those in the source domain, subsequently aligning the target domain with the source domain. However, these methods are susceptible to hard samples and influenced by domain bias. In this paper, we propose a Consistent Assistant Domains Transformer for SFDA, abbreviated as CADTrans, which solves the issue by constructing invariable feature representations of domain consistency. Concretely, we develop an assistant domain module for CADTrans to obtain diversified representations from the intermediate aggregated global attentions, which addresses the limitation of existing methods in adequately representing diversity. Based on assistant and target domains, invariable feature representations are obtained by multiple consistent strategies, which can be used to distinguish easy and hard samples. Finally, to align the hard samples to the corresponding easy samples, we construct a conditional multi-kernel max mean discrepancy (CMK-MMD) strategy to distinguish between samples of the same category and those of different categories. Extensive experiments are conducted on various benchmarks such as Office-31, Office-Home, VISDA-C, and DomainNet-126, proving the significant performance improvements achieved by our proposed approaches.

  State-of-the-art text-to-image models excel at realism but collapse on multi-human prompts - duplicating faces, merging identities, and miscounting individuals. We introduce DisCo (Reinforcement with Diversity Constraints), the first RL-based framework to directly optimize identity diversity in multi-human generation. DisCo fine-tunes flow-matching models via Group-Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with a compositional reward that (i) penalizes intra-image facial similarity, (ii) discourages cross-sample identity repetition, (iii) enforces accurate person counts, and (iv) preserves visual fidelity through human preference scores. A single-stage curriculum stabilizes training as complexity scales, requiring no extra annotations. On the DiverseHumans Testset, DisCo achieves 98.6 Unique Face Accuracy and near-perfect Global Identity Spread - surpassing both open-source and proprietary methods (e.g., Gemini, GPT-Image) while maintaining competitive perceptual quality. Our results establish DisCo as a scalable, annotation-free solution that resolves the long-standing identity crisis in generative models and sets a new benchmark for compositional multi-human generation.

  MLLMs (Multimodal Large Language Models) have showcased remarkable capabilities, but their performance in high-stakes, domain-specific scenarios like surgical settings, remains largely under-explored. To address this gap, we develop \textbf{EyePCR}, a large-scale benchmark for ophthalmic surgery analysis, grounded in structured clinical knowledge to evaluate cognition across \textit{Perception}, \textit{Comprehension} and \textit{Reasoning}. EyePCR offers a richly annotated corpus with more than 210k VQAs, which cover 1048 fine-grained attributes for multi-view perception, medical knowledge graph of more than 25k triplets for comprehension, and four clinically grounded reasoning tasks. The rich annotations facilitate in-depth cognitive analysis, simulating how surgeons perceive visual cues and combine them with domain knowledge to make decisions, thus greatly improving models' cognitive ability. In particular, \textbf{EyePCR-MLLM}, a domain-adapted variant of Qwen2.5-VL-7B, achieves the highest accuracy on MCQs for \textit{Perception} among compared models and outperforms open-source models in \textit{Comprehension} and \textit{Reasoning}, rivalling commercial models like GPT-4.1. EyePCR reveals the limitations of existing MLLMs in surgical cognition and lays the foundation for benchmarking and enhancing clinical reliability of surgical video understanding models.

  Exams are a fundamental test of expert-level intelligence and require integrated understanding, reasoning, and generation. Existing exam-style benchmarks mainly focus on understanding and reasoning tasks, and current generation benchmarks emphasize the illustration of world knowledge and visual concepts, neglecting the evaluation of rigorous drawing exams. We introduce GenExam, the first benchmark for multidisciplinary text-to-image exams, featuring 1,000 samples across 10 subjects with exam-style prompts organized under a four-level taxonomy. Each problem is equipped with ground-truth images and fine-grained scoring points to enable a precise evaluation of semantic correctness and visual plausibility. Experiments show that even state-of-the-art models such as GPT-Image-1 and Gemini-2.5-Flash-Image achieve less than 15% strict scores, and most models yield almost 0%, suggesting the great challenge of our benchmark. By framing image generation as an exam, GenExam offers a rigorous assessment of models' ability to integrate understanding, reasoning, and generation, providing insights on the path to general AGI.

  In the Fourier domain, luminance information is primarily encoded in the amplitude spectrum, while spatial structures are captured in the phase components. The traditional Fourier Frequency information fitting employs pixel-wise loss functions, which tend to focus excessively on local information and may lead to global information loss. In this paper, we present LLFDisc, a U-shaped deep enhancement network that integrates cross-attention and gating mechanisms tailored for frequency-aware enhancement. We propose a novel distribution-aware loss that directly fits the Fourier-domain information and minimizes their divergence using a closed-form KL-Divergence objective. This enables the model to align Fourier-domain information more robustly than with conventional MSE-based losses. Furthermore, we enhance the perceptual loss based on VGG by embedding KL-Divergence on extracted deep features, enabling better structural fidelity. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that LLFDisc achieves state-of-the-art performance in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations.

  Dense self-supervised learning (SSL) methods showed its effectiveness in enhancing the fine-grained semantic understandings of vision models. However, existing approaches often rely on parametric assumptions or complex post-processing (e.g., clustering, sorting), limiting their flexibility and stability. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Patch-level Kernel Alignment (PaKA), a non-parametric, kernel-based approach that improves the dense representations of pretrained vision encoders with a post-(pre)training. Our method propose a robust and effective alignment objective that captures statistical dependencies which matches the intrinsic structure of high-dimensional dense feature distributions. In addition, we revisit the augmentation strategies inherited from image-level SSL and propose a refined augmentation strategy for dense SSL. Our framework improves dense representations by conducting a lightweight post-training stage on top of a pretrained model. With only 14 hours of additional training on a single GPU, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across a range of dense vision benchmarks, demonstrating both efficiency and effectiveness.

  Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection represents a critical challenge in remote sensing applications, where reliable identification of novel or anomalous patterns is essential for autonomous monitoring, disaster response, and environmental assessment. Despite remarkable progress in OOD detection for natural images, existing methods and benchmarks remain poorly suited to remote sensing imagery due to data scarcity, complex multi-scale scene structures, and pronounced distribution shifts. To this end, we propose RS-OOD, a novel framework that leverages remote sensing-specific vision-language modeling to enable robust few-shot OOD detection. Our approach introduces three key innovations: spatial feature enhancement that improved scene discrimination, a dual-prompt alignment mechanism that cross-verifies scene context against fine-grained semantics for spatial-semantic consistency, and a confidence-guided self-training loop that dynamically mines pseudo-labels to expand training data without manual annotation. RS-OOD consistently outperforms existing methods across multiple remote sensing benchmarks and enables efficient adaptation with minimal labeled data, demonstrating the critical value of spatial-semantic integration.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Prompt tuning has shown promising results, but its robustness and generalization to unseen categories remain limited. Through our experiments, we demonstrate that the complete removal of semantic noise is a key factor restricting robustness. Existing methods typically suppress or filter out semantic noise in the prompt space, inadvertently hindering the model's robustness and its ability to generalize to unseen categories. To address this, we propose ANPrompt, a robust prompt tuning framework that actively incorporates weak semantic noise. By clustering weakly perturbed features into noise prompts and integrating them with learnable tokens in both the text and vision encoders, ANPrompt ensures controlled exposure to semantic variations. To enhance the visual pathway, we introduce the Noise-Resistant Visual Prompt Prototype (NRVPP), which stabilizes visual semantics under weak perturbations. Additionally, we propose a Weak Alignment Loss (WALoss) at the logits level to enforce consistency between clean and perturbed predictions, providing stable supervision. By combining weak semantic noise exposure with logits-based consistency, ANPrompt prevents overfitting to specific phrasings while preserving semantic integrity. Extensive experiments across 11 benchmarks, including base-to-new splits, show that ANPrompt consistently outperforms existing prompt tuning methods, offering superior robustness to semantic noise and improved generalization across tasks.

  Recent text-to-image (T2I) generation models have achieved remarkable sucess by training on billion-scale datasets, following a `bigger is better' paradigm that prioritizes data quantity over availability (closed vs open source) and reproducibility (data decay vs established collections). We challenge this established paradigm by demonstrating that one can achieve capabilities of models trained on massive web-scraped collections, using only ImageNet enhanced with well-designed text and image augmentations. With this much simpler setup, we achieve a +6% overall score over SD-XL on GenEval and +5% on DPGBench while using just 1/10th the parameters and 1/1000th the training images. We also show that ImageNet pretrained models can be finetuned on task specific datasets (like for high resolution aesthetic applications) with good results, indicating that ImageNet is sufficient for acquiring general capabilities. This opens the way for more reproducible research as ImageNet is widely available and the proposed standardized training setup only requires 500 hours of H100 to train a text-to-image model.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Continual learning requires machine learning models to continuously acquire new knowledge in dynamic environments while avoiding the forgetting of previous knowledge. Prompt-based continual learning methods effectively address the issue of catastrophic forgetting through prompt expansion and selection. However, existing approaches often suffer from low accuracy in prompt selection, which can result in the model receiving biased knowledge and making biased predictions. To address this issue, we propose the Multiple Queries with Multiple Keys (MQMK) prompt matching paradigm for precise prompt selection. The goal of MQMK is to select the prompts whose training data distribution most closely matches that of the test sample. Specifically, Multiple Queries enable precise breadth search by introducing task-specific knowledge, while Multiple Keys perform deep search by representing the feature distribution of training samples at a fine-grained level. Each query is designed to perform local matching with a designated task to reduce interference across queries. Experiments show that MQMK enhances the prompt matching rate by over 30\% in challenging scenarios and achieves state-of-the-art performance on three widely adopted continual learning benchmarks.

  The automatic evaluation of Language Model (LM) responses is a critical piece in the development of benchmarks and metrics, both for model training and quality assessment of production model endpoints. The current approaches to response classification relies on methods that are too expensive (i.e. LLM-as-a-Judge) or that are far from real-world conditions (string-matching, logprob). In this paper, a structure-free evaluation method is presented. The method makes use of semantic embedding distances to match target candidates with arbitrary LM-generated text, resulting in a robust classification of the response at a relatively low compute cost (embedding models of less than $10B$ parameters). The results show a regression score of ~0.97 and an accuracy of ~96% against human annotators, tested over 3 data sets and 3 different LM architectures.

  Machine unlearning techniques aim to mitigate unintended memorization in large language models (LLMs). However, existing approaches predominantly focus on the explicit removal of isolated facts, often overlooking latent inferential dependencies and the non-deterministic nature of knowledge within LLMs. Consequently, facts presumed forgotten may persist implicitly through correlated information. To address these challenges, we propose a knowledge unlearning evaluation framework that more accurately captures the implicit structure of real-world knowledge by representing relevant factual contexts as knowledge graphs with associated confidence scores. We further develop an inference-based evaluation protocol leveraging powerful LLMs as judges; these judges reason over the extracted knowledge subgraph to determine unlearning success. Our LLM judges utilize carefully designed prompts and are calibrated against human evaluations to ensure their trustworthiness and stability. Extensive experiments on our newly constructed benchmark demonstrate that our framework provides a more realistic and rigorous assessment of unlearning performance. Moreover, our findings reveal that current evaluation strategies tend to overestimate unlearning effectiveness. Our code is publicly available atthis https URL.

  A critical component in the trustworthiness of LLMs is reliable uncertainty communication, yet LLMs often use assertive language when conveying false claims, leading to over-reliance and eroded trust. We present the first systematic study of $\textit{faithful confidence calibration}$ of LLMs, benchmarking models' ability to use linguistic expressions of uncertainty that $\textit{faithfully reflect}$ their intrinsic uncertainty, across a comprehensive array of models, datasets, and prompting strategies. Our results demonstrate that LLMs largely fail at this task, and that existing interventions are insufficient: standard prompt approaches provide only marginal gains, and existing, factuality-based calibration techniques can even harm faithful calibration. To address this critical gap, we introduce MetaFaith, a novel prompt-based calibration approach inspired by human metacognition. We show that MetaFaith robustly improves faithful calibration across diverse models and task domains, enabling up to 61% improvement in faithfulness and achieving an 83% win rate over original generations as judged by humans.

We develop language-only and multimodal models in low-resource settings using developmentally plausible datasets, with our multimodal models outperforming previous BabyLM baselines. One finding in the multimodal language model literature is that these models tend to underperform in \textit{language-only} tasks. Therefore, we focus on maintaining language-only abilities in multimodal models. To this end, we experiment with \textit{model merging}, where we fuse the parameters of multimodal models with those of language-only models using weighted linear interpolation. Our results corroborate the findings that multimodal models underperform in language-only benchmarks that focus on grammar, and model merging with text-only models can help alleviate this problem to some extent, while maintaining multimodal performance.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning abilities on complex problems using long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. However, they often suffer from overthinking, meaning generating unnecessarily lengthy reasoning steps for simpler problems. This issue may degrade the efficiency of the models and make them difficult to adapt the reasoning depth to the complexity of problems. To address this, we introduce a novel metric Token Entropy Cumulative Average (TECA), which measures the extent of exploration throughout the reasoning process. We further propose a novel reasoning paradigm -- Explore Briefly, Then Decide -- with an associated Cumulative Entropy Regulation (CER) mechanism. This paradigm leverages TECA to help the model dynamically determine the optimal point to conclude its thought process and provide a final answer, thus achieving efficient reasoning. Experimental results across diverse mathematical benchmarks show that our approach substantially mitigates overthinking without sacrificing problem-solving ability. With our thinking paradigm, the average response length decreases by up to 71% on simpler datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method in creating a more efficient and adaptive reasoning process.

  Large language models (LLMs) often generate hallucinations -- unsupported content that undermines reliability. While most prior works frame hallucination detection as a binary task, many real-world applications require identifying hallucinated spans, which is a multi-step decision making process. This naturally raises the question of whether explicit reasoning can help the complex task of detecting hallucination spans. To answer this question, we first evaluate pretrained models with and without Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, and show that CoT reasoning has the potential to generate at least one correct answer when sampled multiple times. Motivated by this, we propose RL4HS, a reinforcement learning framework that incentivizes reasoning with a span-level reward function. RL4HS builds on Group Relative Policy Optimization and introduces Class-Aware Policy Optimization to mitigate reward imbalance issue. Experiments on the RAGTruth benchmark (summarization, question answering, data-to-text) show that RL4HS surpasses pretrained reasoning models and supervised fine-tuning, demonstrating the necessity of reinforcement learning with span-level rewards for detecting hallucination spans.

  Speculative decoding accelerates LLM inference by using a smaller draft model to speculate tokens that a larger target model verifies. Verification is often the bottleneck (e.g. verification is $4\times$ slower than token generation when a 3B model speculates for a 70B target model), but most prior works focus only on accelerating drafting. $\textit{``Intermediate"}$ verification reduces verification time by discarding inaccurate draft tokens early, but existing methods incur substantial training overheads in incorporating the intermediate verifier, increase the memory footprint to orchestrate the intermediate verification step, and compromise accuracy by relying on approximate heuristics.We propose $\underline{\textit{Hi}}\textit{erarchical }\underline{\textit{Spec}}\textit{ulative Decoding (HiSpec)}$, a framework for high-throughput speculative decoding that exploits $\textit{early-exit (EE) models}$ for low-overhead intermediate verification. EE models allow tokens to exit early by skipping layer traversal and are explicitly trained so that hidden states at selected layers can be interpreted, making them uniquely suited for intermediate verification without drastically increasing compute and memory overheads. To improve resource-efficiency even further, we design a methodology that enables HiSpec to re-use key-value caches and hidden states between the draft, intermediate verifier, and target models. To maintain accuracy, HiSpec periodically validates the draft tokens accepted by the intermediate verifier against the target model. Our evaluations using various representative benchmarks and models show that HiSpec improves throughput by 1.28$\times$ on average and by up to 2.01$\times$ compared to the baseline single-layer speculation without compromising accuracy.

  Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) systems rely on high-quality benchmarks to evaluate complex multi-hop reasoning. However, despite their widespread use, popular datasets such as WebQSP and CWQ suffer from critical quality issues, including inaccurate or incomplete ground-truth annotations, poorly constructed questions that are ambiguous, trivial, or unanswerable, and outdated or inconsistent knowledge. Through a manual audit of 16 popular KGQA datasets, including WebQSP and CWQ, we find that the average factual correctness rate is only 57 %. To address these issues, we introduce KGQAGen, an LLM-in-the-loop framework that systematically resolves these pitfalls. KGQAGen combines structured knowledge grounding, LLM-guided generation, and symbolic verification to produce challenging and verifiable QA instances. Using KGQAGen, we construct KGQAGen-10k, a ten-thousand scale benchmark grounded in Wikidata, and evaluate a diverse set of KG-RAG models. Experimental results demonstrate that even state-of-the-art systems struggle on this benchmark, highlighting its ability to expose limitations of existing models. Our findings advocate for more rigorous benchmark construction and position KGQAGen as a scalable framework for advancing KGQA evaluation.

  Large Language Models have demonstrated strong performance across a wide range of tasks, but adapting them efficiently to new domains remains a key challenge. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods address this by introducing lightweight, trainable modules while keeping most pre-trained weights fixed. The prevailing approach, LoRA, models updates using a low-rank decomposition, but its expressivity is inherently constrained by the rank. Recent methods like HiRA aim to increase expressivity by incorporating a Hadamard product with the frozen weights, but still rely on the structure of the pre-trained model. We introduce ABBA, a new PEFT architecture that reparameterizes the update as a Hadamard product of two independently learnable low-rank matrices. In contrast to prior work, ABBA fully decouples the update from the pre-trained weights, enabling both components to be optimized freely. This leads to significantly higher expressivity under the same parameter budget, a property we validate through matrix reconstruction experiments. Empirically, ABBA achieves state-of-the-art results on arithmetic and commonsense reasoning benchmarks, consistently outperforming existing PEFT methods by a significant margin across multiple models.

  Long-form legal reasoning remains a key challenge for large language models (LLMs) in spite of recent advances in test-time scaling. To address this, we introduce \textsc{LEXam}, a novel benchmark derived from 340 law exams spanning 116 law school courses across a range of subjects and degree levels. The dataset comprises 4,886 law exam questions in English and German, including 2,841 long-form, open-ended questions and 2,045 multiple-choice questions. Besides reference answers, the open questions are also accompanied by explicit guidance outlining the expected legal reasoning approach such as issue spotting, rule recall, or rule application. Our evaluation on both open-ended and multiple-choice questions present significant challenges for current LLMs; in particular, they notably struggle with open questions that require structured, multi-step legal reasoning. Moreover, our results underscore the effectiveness of the dataset in differentiating between models with varying capabilities. Deploying an ensemble LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm with rigorous human expert validation, we demonstrate how model-generated reasoning steps can be evaluated consistently and accurately, closely aligning with human expert assessments. Our evaluation setup provides a scalable method to assess legal reasoning quality beyond simple accuracy metrics.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advancements in Reinforcement Post-Training (RPT) have significantly enhanced the capabilities of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), sparking increased interest in the generalization of RL-based reasoning. While existing work has primarily focused on investigating its generalization across tasks or modalities, this study proposes a novel cross-linguistic perspective to investigate reasoning generalization. This raises a crucial question: $\textit{Does the reasoning capability achieved from English RPT effectively transfer to other languages?}$ We address this by systematically evaluating English-centric LRMs on multilingual reasoning benchmarks and introducing a metric to quantify cross-lingual transferability. Our findings reveal that cross-lingual transferability varies significantly across initial model, target language, and training paradigm. Through interventional studies, we find that models with stronger initial English capabilities tend to over-rely on English-specific patterns, leading to diminished cross-lingual generalization. To address this, we conduct a thorough parallel training study. Experimental results yield three key findings: $\textbf{First-Parallel Leap}$, a substantial leap in performance when transitioning from monolingual to just a single parallel language, and a predictable $\textbf{Parallel Scaling Law}$, revealing that cross-lingual reasoning transfer follows a power-law with the number of training parallel languages. Moreover, we identify the discrepancy between actual monolingual performance and the power-law prediction as $\textbf{Monolingual Generalization Gap}$, indicating that English-centric LRMs fail to fully generalize across languages. Our study challenges the assumption that LRM reasoning mirrors human cognition, providing critical insights for the development of more language-agnostic LRMs.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Information seeking is a fundamental requirement for humans. However, existing LLM agents rely heavily on open-web search, which exposes two fundamental weaknesses: online content is noisy and unreliable, and many real-world tasks require precise, domain-specific knowledge unavailable from the web. The emergence of the Model Context Protocol (MCP) now allows agents to interface with thousands of specialized tools, seemingly resolving this limitation. Yet it remains unclear whether agents can effectively leverage such tools -- and more importantly, whether they can integrate them with general-purpose search to solve complex tasks. Therefore, we introduce InfoMosaic-Bench, the first benchmark dedicated to multi-source information seeking in tool-augmented agents. Covering six representative domains (medicine, finance, maps, video, web, and multi-domain integration), InfoMosaic-Bench requires agents to combine general-purpose search with domain-specific tools. Tasks are synthesized with InfoMosaic-Flow, a scalable pipeline that grounds task conditions in verified tool outputs, enforces cross-source dependencies, and filters out shortcut cases solvable by trivial lookup. This design guarantees both reliability and non-triviality. Experiments with 14 state-of-the-art LLM agents reveal three findings: (i) web information alone is insufficient, with GPT-5 achieving only 38.2% accuracy and 67.5% pass rate; (ii) domain tools provide selective but inconsistent benefits, improving some domains while degrading others; and (iii) 22.4% of failures arise from incorrect tool usage or selection, highlighting that current LLMs still struggle with even basic tool handling.

  Multimodal Dialogue Summarization (MDS) is a critical task with wide-ranging applications. To support the development of effective MDS models, robust automatic evaluation methods are essential for reducing both cost and human effort. However, such methods require a strong meta-evaluation benchmark grounded in human annotations. In this work, we introduce MDSEval, the first meta-evaluation benchmark for MDS, consisting image-sharing dialogues, corresponding summaries, and human judgments across eight well-defined quality aspects. To ensure data quality and richfulness, we propose a novel filtering framework leveraging Mutually Exclusive Key Information (MEKI) across modalities. Our work is the first to identify and formalize key evaluation dimensions specific to MDS. We benchmark state-of-the-art modal evaluation methods, revealing their limitations in distinguishing summaries from advanced MLLMs and their susceptibility to various bias.

  Cybersecurity is a relentless arms race, with AI driven offensive systems evolving faster than traditional defenses can adapt. Research and tooling remain fragmented across isolated defensive functions, creating blind spots that adversaries exploit. Autonomous agents capable of integrating, exploit confirmation, remediation, and validation into a single closed loop offer promise, but the field lacks three essentials: a framework defining the agentic capabilities of security systems across security life cycle, a principled method for evaluating closed loop agents, and a benchmark for measuring their performance in practice. We introduce CLASP: the Closed-Loop Autonomous Security Performance framework which aligns the security lifecycle (reconnaissance, exploitation, root cause analysis, patch synthesis, validation) with core agentic capabilities (planning, tool use, memory, reasoning, reflection & perception) providing a common vocabulary and rubric for assessing agentic capabilities in security tasks. By applying CLASP to 21 representative works, we map where systems demonstrate strengths, and where capability gaps persist. We then define the Closed-Loop Capability (CLC) Score, a composite metric quantifying both degree of loop closure and operational effectiveness, and outline the requirements for a closed loop benchmark. Together, CLASP and the CLC Score, provide the vocabulary, diagnostics, and measurements needed to advance both function level performance and measure closed loop security agents.

  While integrating tools like Code Interpreter and Search has significantly enhanced Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning in models like ChatGPT Agent and Gemini-Pro, practical guidance on optimal tool use is lacking. The core challenge is effectively combining textual reasoning, coding, and search for diverse questions. In this paper, we propose Tool-Use Mixture (TUMIX), an ensemble framework that runs multiple agents in parallel, each employing distinct tool-use strategies and answer paths. Agents in TUMIX iteratively share and refine responses based on the question and previous answers. In experiments, TUMIX achieves significant gains over state-of-the-art tool-augmented and test-time scaling methods, delivering an average accuracy improvement of up to 3.55% over the best baseline on Gemini-2.5-Pro and Gemini-2.5-Flash across key reasoning benchmarks, with near-equal inference costs. We find that agent diversity and quality are crucial and can be enhanced by using LLMs to auto-optimize agent designs. Furthermore, TUMIX can halt refinement upon reaching sufficient confidence, preserving performance at only 49% of the inference cost. Further scaling can achieve higher performance, albeit at a greater cost.

  Language Models (LMs) are primarily evaluated on globally popular sports, often overlooking regional and indigenous sporting traditions. To address this gap, we introduce \textbf{\textit{CultSportQA}}, a benchmark designed to assess LMs' understanding of traditional sports across 60 countries and 6 continents, encompassing four distinct cultural categories. The dataset features 33,000 multiple-choice questions (MCQs) across text and image modalities, each of which is categorized into three key types: history-based, rule-based, and scenario-based. To evaluate model performance, we employ zero-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting across a diverse set of Large Language Models (LLMs), Small Language Models (SLMs), and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLMs). By providing a comprehensive multilingual and multicultural sports benchmark, \textbf{\textit{CultSportQA}} establishes a new standard for assessing AI's ability to understand and reason about traditional sports.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models suffer from hallucination, generating plausible yet factually incorrect content. Current mitigation strategies focus on post-generation correction, which is computationally expensive and fails to prevent unreliable content generation. We propose a confidence-aware routing system that proactively assesses model uncertainty before generation and redirects queries based on estimated reliability. Our approach combines three complementary signals: semantic alignment between internal representations and reference embeddings, internal convergence analysis across model layers, and learned confidence estimation. The unified confidence score determines routing to four pathways: local generation for high confidence, retrieval-augmented generation for medium confidence, larger models for low confidence, and human review for very low confidence. Evaluation on knowledge-intensive QA benchmarks demonstrates significant improvements in hallucination detection (0.74 vs. 0.42 baseline) while reducing computational costs by 40% compared to post-hoc methods. The F1 score improves from 0.61 to 0.82 with low false positive rates (0.09). This paradigm shift from reactive correction to proactive assessment offers a computationally efficient approach to LLM reliability enhancement.

  Large Language Models are commonly judged by their scores on standard benchmarks, yet such scores often overstate real capability since they mask the mix of skills a task actually demands. For example, ARC is assumed to test reasoning, while HellaSwag is designed to evaluate commonsense. However, we lack a systematic way to verify if these benchmarks actually measure these labels. We introduce Benchmark Profiling, a diagnostic framework that decomposes benchmark performance into ten cognitively grounded abilities. The method combines gradient-based importance scoring with targeted parameter ablation to compute an Ability Impact Score (AIS) that quantifies how much each ability contributes to a model's success on a given benchmark. Profiling three instruction-tuned models across ten widely used benchmarks yields four key findings: (i) most benchmarks draw on several abilities rather than one, (ii) datasets with similar labels rely on distinct ability mixtures, (iii) code-generation benchmarks reward broad, multi-skill improvement and thus show only modest gains from narrow domain-specific fine-tuning, and (iv) abilities irrelevant to the task could negatively affect performance. Benchmark Profiling therefore explains why performance gains do not always translate into user-perceived competence and offers a transparent tool for benchmark audit and model interpretability.

Inspired by the way students prepare for competitions by reviewing past problems, we investigate the potential of RAG to enhance physics reasoning in foundation models. We introduce PhoPile, a high-quality multimodal dataset specifically designed for Olympiad-level physics, enabling systematic study of retrieval-based reasoning. PhoPile includes diagrams, graphs, and equations, capturing the inherently multimodal nature of physics problem solving. Using PhoPile, we benchmark RAG-augmented foundation models, covering both large language models (LLMs) and large multimodal models (LMMs) with multiple retrievers. Our results demonstrate that integrating retrieval with physics corpora can improve model performance, while also highlighting challenges that motivate further research in retrieval-augmented physics reasoning.

  The rapid expansion of large language models (LLMs) has heightened concerns about their computational and environmental costs. This study investigates the trade-offs between translation quality and efficiency by comparing full-scale, distilled, and quantized models using machine translation as a case study. We evaluated performance on the Flores+ benchmark and through human judgments of conversational translations in French, Hindi, and Kannada. Our analysis revealed that the full 3.3B FP32 model, while achieving the highest BLEU scores, incurred the largest environmental footprint (~ 0.007-0.008 kg CO2 per run). The distilled 600M FP32 model reduced inference time by 71-78% and carbon emissions by 63-65% compared with the full model, with only minimal reductions in BLEU scores. Human evaluations further showed that even aggressive quantization (INT4) preserved high levels of accuracy and fluency, with differences between models generally minor. These findings demonstrate that model compression strategies can substantially reduce computational demands and environmental impact while maintaining competitive translation quality, though trade-offs are more pronounced in low-resource settings. We argue for evaluation frameworks that integrate efficiency and sustainability alongside accuracy as central dimensions of progress in NLP.

  Counterfactual reasoning typically involves considering alternatives to actual events. While often applied to understand past events, a distinct form-forward counterfactual reasoning-focuses on anticipating plausible future developments. This type of reasoning is invaluable in dynamic financial markets, where anticipating market developments can powerfully unveil potential risks and opportunities for stakeholders, guiding their decision-making. However, performing this at scale is challenging due to the cognitive demands involved, underscoring the need for automated solutions. LLMs offer promise, but remain unexplored for this application. To address this gap, we introduce a novel benchmark, FIN-FORCE-FINancial FORward Counterfactual Evaluation. By curating financial news headlines and providing structured evaluation, FIN-FORCE supports LLM based forward counterfactual generation. This paves the way for scalable and automated solutions for exploring and anticipating future market developments, thereby providing structured insights for decision-making. Through experiments on FIN-FORCE, we evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs and counterfactual generation methods, analyzing their limitations and proposing insights for future research.

  With recent advancements in large language models, web agents have been greatly improved. However, dealing with complex and dynamic web environments requires more advanced planning and search abilities. Previous studies usually adopt a greedy one-way search strategy, which may struggle to recover from erroneous states. In this work, we enhance web agents with an explicit rollback mechanism, enabling the agent to revert back to a previous state in its navigation trajectory. This mechanism gives the model the flexibility to directly control the search process, leading to an effective and efficient web navigation method. We conduct experiments on two live web navigation benchmarks with zero-shot and fine-tuning settings. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach.

  Reinforcement learning with human-annotated data has boosted chain-of-thought reasoning in large reasoning models, but these gains come at high costs in labeled data while faltering on harder tasks. A natural next step is experience-driven learning, where models improve without curated labels by adapting to unlabeled data. We introduce RESTRAIN (REinforcement learning with Self-restraint), a self-penalizing RL framework that converts the absence of gold labels into a useful learning signal. Instead of overcommitting to spurious majority votes, RESTRAIN exploits signals from the model's entire answer distribution: penalizing overconfident rollouts and low-consistency examples while preserving promising reasoning chains. The self-penalization mechanism integrates seamlessly into policy optimization methods such as GRPO, enabling continual self-improvement without supervision. On challenging reasoning benchmarks, RESTRAIN delivers large gains using only unlabeled data. With Qwen3-4B-Base and OctoThinker Hybrid-8B-Base, it improves Pass@1 by up to +140.7 percent on AIME25, +36.2 percent on MMLU_STEM, and +19.6 percent on GPQA-Diamond, nearly matching gold-label training while using no gold labels. These results demonstrate that RESTRAIN establishes a scalable path toward stronger reasoning without gold labels.

  Online social media platforms are central to everyday communication and information seeking. While these platforms serve positive purposes, they also provide fertile ground for the spread of hate speech, offensive language, and bullying content targeting individuals, organizations, and communities. Such content undermines safety, participation, and equity online. Reliable detection systems are therefore needed, especially for low-resource languages where moderation tools are limited. In Bangla, prior work has contributed resources and models, but most are single-task (e.g., binary hate/offense) with limited coverage of multi-facet signals (type, severity, target). We address these gaps by introducing the first multi-task Bangla hate-speech dataset, BanglaMultiHate, one of the largest manually annotated corpus to date. Building on this resource, we conduct a comprehensive, controlled comparison spanning classical baselines, monolingual pretrained models, and LLMs under zero-shot prompting and LoRA fine-tuning. Our experiments assess LLM adaptability in a low-resource setting and reveal a consistent trend: although LoRA-tuned LLMs are competitive with BanglaBERT, culturally and linguistically grounded pretraining remains critical for robust performance. Together, our dataset and findings establish a stronger benchmark for developing culturally aligned moderation tools in low-resource contexts. For reproducibility, we will release the dataset and all related scripts.

We introduce MathLens, a benchmark designed to disentangle the subskills of multimodal reasoning while preserving the complexity of textbook-style geometry problems. The benchmark separates performance into three components: Perception: extracting information from raw inputs, Reasoning: operating on available information, and Integration: selecting relevant perceptual evidence and applying it within reasoning. To support each test, we provide annotations: visual diagrams, textual descriptions to evaluate reasoning in isolation, controlled questions that require both modalities, and probes for fine-grained perceptual skills, all derived from symbolic specifications of the problems to ensure consistency and robustness. Our analysis reveals that different training approaches have uneven effects: First, reinforcement learning chiefly strengthens perception, especially when supported by textual supervision, while textual SFT indirectly improves perception through reflective reasoning. Second, reasoning improves only in tandem with perception. Third, integration remains the weakest capacity, with residual errors concentrated there once other skills advance. Finally, robustness diverges: RL improves consistency under diagram variation, whereas multimodal SFT reduces it through overfitting. We will release all data and experimental logs.

  Although large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing capabilities, their practical implementation as autonomous multi-agent systems (MAS) for industrial problem-solving encounters persistent barriers. Conventional MAS architectures are fundamentally restricted by inflexible, hand-crafted graph topologies that lack contextual responsiveness, resulting in diminished efficacy across varied academic and commercial workloads. To surmount these constraints, we introduce AMAS, a paradigm-shifting framework that redefines LLM-based MAS through a novel dynamic graph designer. This component autonomously identifies task-specific optimal graph configurations via lightweight LLM adaptation, eliminating the reliance on monolithic, universally applied structural templates. Instead, AMAS exploits the intrinsic properties of individual inputs to intelligently direct query trajectories through task-optimized agent pathways. Rigorous validation across question answering, mathematical deduction, and code generation benchmarks confirms that AMAS systematically exceeds state-of-the-art single-agent and multi-agent approaches across diverse LLM architectures. Our investigation establishes that context-sensitive structural adaptability constitutes a foundational requirement for high-performance LLM MAS deployments.

  Small Language Models (SLMs) enable cost-effective, on-device and latency-sensitive AI applications, yet their deployment in Traditional Chinese (TC) remains hindered by token-level instability - models unpredictably emit non-TC characters or code-switch into other languages. We address this practical reliability gap by creating PureTC-1B, a three-stage stabilization pipeline for Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct (an open-weight, instruction-tuned model released by Meta) using parameter-efficient LoRA adapters. Our method combines Continual Pre-Training (CPT) on TC-centric corpora, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with instruction data, and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) using TC-adherence preferences to improve monolingual robustness without full-model retraining. On a benchmark designed to simulate real-world usage, PureTC-1B achieves a 51.3% relative reduction (micro-average) in non-TC output tokens versus the base model. On a Named Entity Translation (NET) task, PureTC-1B further reduces incorrect-language tokens by 77.2% relative to Llama-3B and 57.2% relative to Qwen-1.5B, indicating that robust TC adherence is attainable even at the 1B scale. The pipeline is reproducible, adapter-only, and hardware-friendly, offering practitioners a practical recipe to enhance language stability for TC and potentially other non-English languages.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) excel at general language tasks but often struggle with event-based questions-especially those requiring causal or temporal reasoning. We introduce TAG-EQA (Text-And-Graph for Event Question Answering), a prompting framework that injects causal event graphs into LLM inputs by converting structured relations into natural-language statements. TAG-EQA spans nine prompting configurations, combining three strategies (zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought) with three input modalities (text-only, graph-only, text+graph), enabling a systematic analysis of when and how structured knowledge aids inference. On the TORQUESTRA benchmark, TAG-EQA improves accuracy by 5% on average over text-only baselines, with gains up to 12% in zero-shot settings and 18% when graph-augmented CoT prompting is effective. While performance varies by model and configuration, our findings show that causal graphs can enhance event reasoning in LLMs without fine-tuning, offering a flexible way to encode structure in prompt-based QA.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have recently emerged as a powerful tool for language model steering. Prior work has explored top-k SAE latents for steering, but we observe that many dimensions among the top-k latents capture non-semantic features such as punctuation rather than semantic attributes like instructions. To address this, we propose focusing on a single, most relevant SAE latent (top-1), eliminating redundant features. We further identify a limitation in constant SAE steering, which often produces degenerate outputs such as repetitive single words. To mitigate this, we introduce a token-wise decaying steering strategy, enabling more faithful comparisons with mean activation difference baselines. Empirically, we show that steering an SAE latent associated with reasoning reliably elicits step-by-step mathematical reasoning and enhances inference quality, functionally resembling the effect of appending a guiding token. Our results demonstrate that SAEs outperform mean activation difference methods on mathematical reasoning benchmarks and match their performance on IF-Eval.

  Large language models (LLMs) now perform strongly on many public math suites, yet frontier separation within mathematics increasingly suffers from ceiling effects. We present two complementary benchmarks: SKYLENAGE-ReasoningMATH, a 100-item, structure-aware diagnostic set with per-item metadata on length, numeric density, and symbolic complexity; and SKYLENAGE-MATH, a 150-item contest-style suite spanning four stages from high school to doctoral under a seven-subject taxonomy. We evaluate fifteen contemporary LLM variants under a single setup and analyze subject x model and grade x model performance. On the contest suite, the strongest model reaches 44% while the runner-up reaches 37%; accuracy declines from high school to doctoral, and top systems exhibit a doctoral-to-high-school retention near 79%. On the reasoning set, the best model attains 81% overall, and hardest-slice results reveal clear robustness gaps between leaders and the mid-tier. In summary, we release SKYLENAGE-ReasoningMATH and report aggregate results for SKYLENAGE-MATH; together, SKYLENAGE provides a hard, reasoning-centered and broadly covering math benchmark with calibrated difficulty and rich metadata, serving as a reference benchmark for future evaluations of mathematical reasoning.

  The rapid growth of large language models (LLMs) with diverse capabilities, latency and computational costs presents a critical deployment challenge: selecting the most suitable model for each prompt to optimize the trade-off between performance and efficiency. We introduce LLMRank, a prompt-aware routing framework that leverages rich, human-readable features extracted from prompts, including task type, reasoning patterns, complexity indicators, syntactic cues, and signals from a lightweight proxy solver. Unlike prior one-shot routers that rely solely on latent embeddings, LLMRank predicts per-model utility using a neural ranking model trained on RouterBench, comprising 36,497 prompts spanning 11 benchmarks and 11 state-of-the-art LLMs, from small efficient models to large frontier systems. Our approach achieves up to 89.2% of oracle utility, while providing interpretable feature attributions that explain routing decisions. Extensive studies demonstrate the importance of multifaceted feature extraction and the hybrid ranking objective, highlighting the potential of feature-driven routing for efficient and transparent LLM deployment.

  Although numerous strategies have recently been proposed to enhance the autonomous interaction capabilities of multimodal agents in graphical user interface (GUI), their reliability remains limited when faced with complex or out-of-domain tasks. This raises a fundamental question: Are existing multimodal agents reasoning spuriously? In this paper, we propose \textbf{Agent-ScanKit}, a systematic probing framework to unravel the memory and reasoning capabilities of multimodal agents under controlled perturbations. Specifically, we introduce three orthogonal probing paradigms: visual-guided, text-guided, and structure-guided, each designed to quantify the contributions of memorization and reasoning without requiring access to model internals. In five publicly available GUI benchmarks involving 18 multimodal agents, the results demonstrate that mechanical memorization often outweighs systematic reasoning. Most of the models function predominantly as retrievers of training-aligned knowledge, exhibiting limited generalization. Our findings underscore the necessity of robust reasoning modeling for multimodal agents in real-world scenarios, offering valuable insights toward the development of reliable multimodal agents.

  Machine translation benchmarks sourced from the real world are quickly obsoleted, due to most examples being easy for state-of-the-art translation models. This limits the benchmark's ability to distinguish which model is better or to reveal models' weaknesses. Current methods for creating difficult test cases, such as subsampling or from-scratch synthesis, either fall short of identifying difficult examples or suffer from a lack of diversity and naturalness. Inspired by the iterative process of human experts probing for model failures, we propose MT-breaker, a method where a large language model iteratively refines a source text to increase its translation difficulty. The LLM iteratively queries a target machine translation model to guide its generation of difficult examples. Our approach generates examples that are more challenging for the target MT model while preserving the diversity of natural texts. While the examples are tailored to a particular machine translation model during the generation, the difficulty also transfers to other models and languages.

  Natural Language Processing (NLP) is undergoing constant transformation, as Large Language Models (LLMs) are driving daily breakthroughs in research and practice. In this regard, tracking the progress of NLP research and automatically analyzing the contributions of research papers provides key insights into the nature of the field and the researchers. This study explores the progress of African NLP (AfricaNLP) by asking (and answering) basic research questions such as: i) How has the nature of NLP evolved over the last two decades?, ii) What are the contributions of AfricaNLP papers?, and iii) Which individuals and organizations (authors, affiliated institutions, and funding bodies) have been involved in the development of AfricaNLP? We quantitatively examine the contributions of AfricaNLP research using 1.9K NLP paper abstracts, 4.9K author contributors, and 7.8K human-annotated contribution sentences (AfricaNLPContributions) along with benchmark results. Our dataset and continuously existing NLP progress tracking website provide a powerful lens for tracing AfricaNLP research trends and hold potential for generating data-driven literature surveys.

  News recommendation systems play a critical role in alleviating information overload by delivering personalized content. A key challenge lies in jointly modeling multi-view representations of news articles and capturing the dynamic, dual-scale nature of user interests-encompassing both short- and long-term preferences. Prior methods often rely on single-view features or insufficiently model user behavior across time. In this work, we introduce Co-NAML-LSTUR, a hybrid news recommendation framework that integrates NAML for attentive multi-view news encoding and LSTUR for hierarchical user modeling, designed for training on limited data resources. Our approach leverages BERT-based embeddings to enhance semantic representation. We evaluate Co-NAML-LSTUR on two widely used benchmarks, MIND-small and MIND-large. Results show that our model significantly outperforms strong baselines, achieving improvements over NRMS by 1.55% in AUC and 1.15% in MRR, and over NAML by 2.45% in AUC and 1.71% in MRR. These findings highlight the effectiveness of our efficiency-focused hybrid model, which combines multi-view news modeling with dual-scale user representations for practical, resource-limited resources rather than a claim to absolute state-of-the-art (SOTA).

  When evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) in question answering domains, it is common to ask the model to choose among a fixed set of choices (so-called multiple-choice question-answering, or MCQA). Although downstream tasks of interest typically do not provide systems with explicit options among which to choose, this approach is nevertheless widely used because it makes automatic grading straightforward and has tended to produce challenging benchmarks that correlate sufficiently well with downstream performance. This paper investigates the extent to which this trend continues to hold for state-of-the-art reasoning models, describing a systematic evaluation of 15 different question-answering benchmarks (e.g., MMLU, GSM8K) and 27 different LLMs (including small models such as Qwen-2.5 7B, mid-sized models such as Llama-3.3 70B, and large state-of-the-art models such as OpenAI's o3). For each model--benchmark pair, we considered 5 ways of presenting the model with questions, including variations on whether multiple choices were offered to the model at all; whether "none of the above" sometimes replaced the right answer; and whether the model was permitted to perform chain-of-thought reasoning before and/or after the choices were presented. MCQA remained a good proxy for the downstream performance of models as long as they were allowed to perform chain-of-thought reasoning only \emph{before} being presented with the options among which they had to select. On the other hand, large models that were able to perform reasoning \emph{after} being given a set of options tended to significantly outperform their free-text performance due to exploiting the information in the options. We identify and quantify the signals models are using when answering MCQA questions, and offer practical guidelines when analyzing results from MCQA that better reflect LLMs' genuine reasoning capabilities.

  While slow-thinking large language models (LLMs) exhibit reflection-like reasoning, commonly referred to as the "aha moment:, their ability to generate informative critiques and refine prior solutions remains limited. In this paper, we introduce Double-Checker, a principled framework designed to enhance the reasoning capabilities of slow-thinking LLMs by fostering explicit self-critique and iterative refinement of their previous solutions. By fine-tuning on our curated 1,730 self-critical instances, Double-Checker empowers long-CoT LLMs to iteratively critique and refine their outputs during inference until they evaluate their solutions as correct under self-generated critiques. We validate the efficacy of Double-Checker across a comprehensive suite of reasoning benchmarks, demonstrating that iterative self-critique significantly enhances the reasoning capabilities of long-CoT LLMs. Notably, our Double-Checker increases the pass@1 performance on challenging AIME benchmarks from 4.4% to 18.2% compared to the original long-CoT LLMs. These results highlight a promising direction for developing more trustworthy and effective LLMs capable of structured self-critique.

  Recent Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) with thinking traces have shown strong performance on English reasoning tasks. However, their ability to think in other languages is less studied. This capability is as important as answer accuracy for real world applications because users may find the reasoning trace useful for oversight only when it is expressed in their own language. We comprehensively evaluate two leading families of LRMs on our XReasoning benchmark and find that even the most advanced models often revert to English or produce fragmented reasoning in other languages, revealing a substantial gap in multilingual reasoning. Prompt based interventions that force models to reason in the users language improve readability and oversight but reduce answer accuracy, exposing an important trade off. We further show that targeted post training on just 100 examples mitigates this mismatch, though some accuracy loss remains. Our results highlight the limited multilingual reasoning capabilities of current LRMs and outline directions for future work. Code and data are available atthis https URL.

  Large language models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across a wide range of tasks, yet their ability to process structured symbolic knowledge remains underexplored. To address this gap, we propose a taxonomy of ontological capabilities and introduce OntoURL, the first comprehensive benchmark designed to systematically evaluate LLMs' capabilities in handling ontologies -- formal and symbolic representations of domain knowledge. Based on the proposed taxonomy, OntoURL systematically assesses three dimensions: understanding, reasoning, and learning through 15 distinct tasks comprising 57,303 questions derived from 40 ontologies across 8 domains. Experiments with 20 open-source LLMs reveal significant performance differences across models, tasks, and domains, with current LLMs showing capabilities in understanding ontological knowledge but weaknesses in reasoning and learning tasks. Further experiments with few-shot and chain-of-thought prompting illustrate how different prompting strategies affect model performance. Additionally, a human evaluation reveals that LLMs outperform humans in understanding and reasoning tasks but fall short in most learning tasks. These findings highlight both the potential and limitations of LLMs in processing symbolic knowledge and establish OntoURL as a critical benchmark for advancing the integration of LLMs with formal knowledge representations.

Despite Tibetan being spoken by over seven million people, it has largely been neglected in the development and assessment of large language models. To address this gap, we present a \textbf{T}ibetan \textbf{L}anguage \textbf{U}nderstanding \textbf{E}valuation Benchmark, \textbf{TLUE}, the first large-scale benchmark for measuring the proficiency of LLMs in the Tibetan language. \textbf{TLUE} comprises two major components: a comprehensive multi-task understanding benchmark spanning 5 domains and 67 subdomains, and a safety benchmark encompassing 7 subdomains. Then, we evaluate a diverse set of state-of-the-art large language models. Experimental results demonstrate that most large language models perform below the random baseline, highlighting the considerable challenges they face in Tibetan language processing. \textbf{TLUE} provides a crucial foundation for advancing future research in Tibetan language understanding and highlights the importance of promoting greater inclusivity in the development of large language models.

  As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to model and augment collective decision-making, it is critical to examine their alignment with human social reasoning. We present an empirical framework for assessing collective alignment, in contrast to prior work on the individual level. Using the Lost at Sea social psychology task, we conduct a large-scale online experiment (N=748), randomly assigning groups to leader elections with either visible demographic attributes (e.g. name, gender) or pseudonymous aliases. We then simulate matched LLM groups conditioned on the human data, benchmarking Gemini 2.5, GPT 4.1, Claude Haiku 3.5, and Gemma 3. LLM behaviors diverge: some mirror human biases; others mask these biases and attempt to compensate for them. We empirically demonstrate that human-AI alignment in collective reasoning depends on context, cues, and model-specific inductive biases. Understanding how LLMs align with collective human behavior is critical to advancing socially-aligned AI, and demands dynamic benchmarks that capture the complexities of collective reasoning.

  As Large Language Models (LLMs) transition from static tools to autonomous agents, traditional evaluation benchmarks that measure performance on downstream tasks are becoming insufficient. These methods fail to capture the emergent social and cognitive dynamics that arise when agents communicate, persuade, and collaborate in interactive environments. To address this gap, we introduce a novel evaluation framework that uses multi-agent debate as a controlled "social laboratory" to discover and quantify these behaviors. In our framework, LLM-based agents, instantiated with distinct personas and incentives, deliberate on a wide range of challenging topics under the supervision of an LLM moderator. Our analysis, enabled by a new suite of psychometric and semantic metrics, reveals several key findings. Across hundreds of debates, we uncover a powerful and robust emergent tendency for agents to seek consensus, consistently reaching high semantic agreement ({\mu} > 0.88) even without explicit instruction and across sensitive topics. We show that assigned personas induce stable, measurable psychometric profiles, particularly in cognitive effort, and that the moderators persona can significantly alter debate outcomes by structuring the environment, a key finding for external AI alignment. This work provides a blueprint for a new class of dynamic, psychometrically grounded evaluation protocols designed for the agentic setting, offering a crucial methodology for understanding and shaping the social behaviors of the next generation of AI agents. We have released the code and results atthis https URL.

  In tabular anomaly detection (AD), textual semantics often carry critical signals, as the definition of an anomaly is closely tied to domain-specific context. However, existing benchmarks provide only raw data points without semantic context, overlooking rich textual metadata such as feature descriptions and domain knowledge that experts rely on in practice. This limitation restricts research flexibility and prevents models from fully leveraging domain knowledge for detection. ReTabAD addresses this gap by restoring textual semantics to enable context-aware tabular AD research. We provide (1) 20 carefully curated tabular datasets enriched with structured textual metadata, together with implementations of state-of-the-art AD algorithms including classical, deep learning, and LLM-based approaches, and (2) a zero-shot LLM framework that leverages semantic context without task-specific training, establishing a strong baseline for future research. Furthermore, this work provides insights into the role and utility of textual metadata in AD through experiments and analysis. Results show that semantic context improves detection performance and enhances interpretability by supporting domain-aware reasoning. These findings establish ReTabAD as a benchmark for systematic exploration of context-aware AD.

We introduce OR-Toolformer, which fine-tunes Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct with a semi-automatic data synthesis pipeline that generates diverse OR problem-answer pairs and augments the model with external solvers to produce API calls. On three of four standard benchmarks, OR-Toolformer achieves up to 80.1% execution accuracy, exceeding size-matched baselines by over 4.3%. In zero-shot evaluation on two unseen OR problem types, it attains 54% average accuracy, a 21 percentage-point improvement over the strongest baseline. These findings validate the efficacy of tool-augmented fine-tuning LLMs for accurate and generalizable OR problem modeling and solving.

  As LLMs are increasingly deployed as agents, agentic reasoning - the ability to combine tool use, especially search, and reasoning - becomes a critical skill. However, it is hard to disentangle agentic reasoning when evaluated in complex environments and tasks. Current agent benchmarks often mix agentic reasoning with challenging math reasoning, expert-level knowledge, and other advanced capabilities. To fill this gap, we build a novel benchmark, GSM-Agent, where an LLM agent is required to solve grade-school-level reasoning problems, but is only presented with the question in the prompt without the premises that contain the necessary information to solve the task, and needs to proactively collect that information using tools. Although the original tasks are grade-school math problems, we observe that even frontier models like GPT-5 only achieve 67% accuracy. To understand and analyze the agentic reasoning patterns, we propose the concept of agentic reasoning graph: cluster the environment's document embeddings into nodes, and map each tool call to its nearest node to build a reasoning path. Surprisingly, we identify that the ability to revisit a previously visited node, widely taken as a crucial pattern in static reasoning, is often missing for agentic reasoning for many models. Based on the insight, we propose a tool-augmented test-time scaling method to improve LLM's agentic reasoning performance by adding tools to encourage models to revisit. We expect our benchmark and the agentic reasoning framework to aid future studies of understanding and pushing the boundaries of agentic reasoning.

  As AI foundation models grow in capability, a deeper question emerges: What shapes their internal cognitive identity -- beyond fluency and output? Benchmarks measure behavior, but the soul of a model resides in its latent geometry. In this work, we propose Neural DNA (nDNA) as a semantic-genotypic representation that captures this latent identity through the intrinsic geometry of belief. At its core, nDNA is synthesized from three principled and indispensable dimensions of latent geometry: spectral curvature, which reveals the curvature of conceptual flow across layers; thermodynamic length, which quantifies the semantic effort required to traverse representational transitions through layers; and belief vector field, which delineates the semantic torsion fields that guide a model's belief directional orientations. Like biological DNA, it encodes ancestry, mutation, and semantic inheritance, found in finetuning and alignment scars, cultural imprints, and architectural drift. In naming it, we open a new field: Neural Genomics, where models are not just tools, but digital semantic organisms with traceable inner cognition.Modeling statement. We read AI foundation models as semantic fluid dynamics: meaning is transported through layers like fluid in a shaped conduit; nDNA is the physics-grade readout of that flow -- a geometry-first measure of how meaning is bent, paid for, and pushed -- yielding a stable, coordinate-free neural DNA fingerprint tied to on-input behavior; with this fingerprint we cross into biology: tracing lineages across pretraining, fine-tuning, alignment, pruning, distillation, and merges; measuring inheritance between checkpoints; detecting drift as traits shift under new data or objectives; and, ultimately, studying the evolution of artificial cognition to compare models, diagnose risks, and govern change over time.

  Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have led to substantial improvements in the mathematical reasoning abilities of LLMs, as measured by standard benchmarks. Yet these gains often persist even when models are trained with flawed signals, such as random or inverted rewards. This raises a fundamental question: do such improvements reflect genuine reasoning, or are they merely artifacts of overfitting to benchmark-specific patterns? To answer this question, we adopt an evaluation-centric perspective and highlight two critical shortcomings in existing protocols. First, benchmark contamination arises because test problems are publicly available, thereby increasing the risk of data leakage. Second, evaluation fragility results from reliance on single-instance assessments, which are sensitive to stochastic outputs and fail to capture reasoning consistency. These limitations suggest the need for a new evaluation paradigm that can probe reasoning ability beyond memorization and one-off success. As response, we propose VAR-MATH, a symbolic evaluation framework that converts fixed numerical problems into parameterized templates and requires models to solve multiple instantiations of each. This design enforces consistency across structurally equivalent variants, mitigates contamination, and enhances robustness through bootstrapped metrics. We apply VAR-MATH to transform three popular benchmarks, AMC23, AIME24, and AIME25, into their symbolic counterparts, VAR-AMC23, VAR-AIME24, and VAR-AIME25. Experimental results show substantial performance drops for RL-trained models on these variabilized benchmarks, especially for smaller models, with average declines of 47.9\% on AMC23, 58.8\% on AIME24, and 72.9\% on AIME25. These findings indicate that some existing RL methods rely on superficial heuristics and fail to generalize beyond specific numerical forms.

  Preference finetuning methods like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) with AI-generated feedback have shown promise in aligning Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) with human preferences. However, existing techniques overlook the prevalence of noise in synthetic preference annotations in the form of stylistic and length biases. To this end, we introduce a hard-negative response generation framework based on LLM-guided response editing, that produces rejected responses with targeted errors, maintaining stylistic and length similarity to the accepted ones. Using this framework, we develop the VaPR dataset, comprising 30K high-quality samples, to finetune three LVLM families: LLaVA-V1.5, Qwen2VL & Qwen2.5VL (2B-13B sizes). Our VaPR models deliver significant performance improvements across ten benchmarks, achieving average gains of 6.5% (LLaVA), 4.0% (Qwen2VL), and 1.5% (Qwen2.5VL), with notable improvements on reasoning tasks. A scaling analysis shows that performance consistently improves with data size, with LLaVA models benefiting even at smaller scales. Moreover, VaPR reduces the tendency to answer "Yes" in binary questions - addressing a common failure mode in LVLMs like LLaVA. Lastly, we show that the framework generalizes to open-source LLMs as editors, with models trained on VaPR-OS achieving ~99% of the performance of models trained on \name, which is synthesized using GPT-4o.

  Explicit information seeking is essential to human problem-solving in practical environments characterized by incomplete information and noisy dynamics. When the true environmental state is not directly observable, humans seek information to update their internal dynamics and inform future decision-making. Although existing Large Language Model (LLM) planning agents have addressed observational uncertainty, they often overlook discrepancies between their internal dynamics and the actual environment. We introduce Information Seeking Decision Planner (InfoSeeker), an LLM decision-making framework that integrates task-oriented planning with information seeking to align internal dynamics and make optimal decisions under uncertainty in both agent observations and environmental dynamics. InfoSeeker prompts an LLM to actively gather information by planning actions to validate its understanding, detect environmental changes, or test hypotheses before generating or revising task-oriented plans. To evaluate InfoSeeker, we introduce a novel benchmark suite featuring partially observable environments with incomplete observations and uncertain dynamics. Experiments demonstrate that InfoSeeker achieves a 74% absolute performance gain over prior methods without sacrificing sample efficiency. Moreover, InfoSeeker generalizes across LLMs and outperforms baselines on established benchmarks such as robotic manipulation and web navigation. These findings underscore the importance of tightly integrating planning and information seeking for robust behavior in partially observable environments.

  Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) improves reasoning in large language models (LLMs) but struggles with exploration, an issue that still persists for multimodal LLMs (MLLMs). Current methods treat the visual input as a fixed, deterministic condition, overlooking a critical source of ambiguity and struggling to build policies robust to plausible visual variations. We introduce $\textbf{VOGUE (Visual Uncertainty Guided Exploration)}$, a novel method that shifts exploration from the output (text) to the input (visual) space. By treating the image as a stochastic context, VOGUE quantifies the policy's sensitivity to visual perturbations using the symmetric KL divergence between a "raw" and "noisy" branch, creating a direct signal for uncertainty-aware exploration. This signal shapes the learning objective via an uncertainty-proportional bonus, which, combined with a token-entropy bonus and an annealed sampling schedule, effectively balances exploration and exploitation. Implemented within GRPO on two model scales (Qwen2.5-VL-3B/7B), VOGUE boosts pass@1 accuracy by an average of 2.6% on three visual math benchmarks and 3.7% on three general-domain reasoning benchmarks, while simultaneously increasing pass@4 performance and mitigating the exploration decay commonly observed in RL fine-tuning. Our work shows that grounding exploration in the inherent uncertainty of visual inputs is an effective strategy for improving multimodal reasoning.

  Knowledge graph completion (KGC) aims to predict missing triples in knowledge graphs (KGs) by leveraging existing triples and textual information. Recently, generative large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly employed for graph tasks. However, current approaches typically encode graph context in textual form, which fails to fully exploit the potential of LLMs for perceiving and reasoning about graph structures. To address this limitation, we propose DrKGC (Dynamic Subgraph Retrieval-Augmented LLMs for Knowledge Graph Completion). DrKGC employs a flexible lightweight model training strategy to learn structural embeddings and logical rules within the KG. It then leverages a novel bottom-up graph retrieval method to extract a subgraph for each query guided by the learned rules. Finally, a graph convolutional network (GCN) adapter uses the retrieved subgraph to enhance the structural embeddings, which are then integrated into the prompt for effective LLM fine-tuning. Experimental results on two general domain benchmark datasets and two biomedical datasets demonstrate the superior performance of DrKGC. Furthermore, a realistic case study in the biomedical domain highlights its interpretability and practical utility.

  Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a key method for improving Large Language Models' reasoning capabilities, yet recent evidence suggests it may paradoxically shrink the reasoning boundary rather than expand it. This paper investigates the shrinkage issue of RLVR by analyzing its learning dynamics and reveals two critical phenomena that explain this failure. First, we expose negative interference in RLVR, where learning to solve certain training problems actively reduces the likelihood of correct solutions for others, leading to the decline of Pass@$k$ performance, or the probability of generating a correct solution within $k$ attempts. Second, we uncover the winner-take-all phenomenon: RLVR disproportionately reinforces problems with high likelihood, correct solutions, under the base model, while suppressing other initially low-likelihood ones. Through extensive theoretical and empirical analysis on multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks, we show that this effect arises from the inherent on-policy sampling in standard RL objectives, causing the model to converge toward narrow solution strategies. Based on these insights, we propose a simple yet effective data curation algorithm that focuses RLVR learning on low-likelihood problems, achieving notable improvement in Pass@$k$ performance.

  Artificial intelligence is undergoing the paradigm shift from closed language models to interconnected agent systems capable of external perception and information integration. As a representative embodiment, Deep Research Agents (DRAs) systematically exhibit the capabilities for task decomposition, cross-source retrieval, multi-stage reasoning, and structured output, which markedly enhance performance on complex and open-ended tasks. However, existing benchmarks remain deficient in evaluation dimensions, response formatting, and scoring mechanisms, limiting their capacity to assess such systems effectively. This paper introduces a rigorous benchmark and a multidimensional evaluation framework tailored to DRAs and report-style responses. The benchmark comprises 214 expert-curated challenging queries distributed across 10 broad thematic domains, each accompanied by manually constructed reference bundles to support composite evaluation. The framework enables comprehensive evaluation of long-form reports generated by DRAs, incorporating integrated scoring metrics for semantic quality, topical focus, and retrieval trustworthiness. Extensive experimentation confirms the superior performance of mainstream DRAs over web-search-tool-augmented reasoning models, yet reveals considerable scope for further improvement. This study provides a robust foundation for capability assessment, architectural refinement, and paradigm advancement in DRA systems.

  OpenAI's o3-preview reasoning model exceeded human accuracy on the ARC-AGI benchmark, but does that mean state-of-the-art models recognize and reason with the abstractions that the task creators intended? We investigate models' abstraction abilities on ConceptARC. We evaluate models under settings that vary the input modality (textual vs. visual), whether the model is permitted to use external Python tools, and, for reasoning models, the amount of reasoning effort. In addition to measuring output accuracy, we perform fine-grained evaluation of the natural-language rules that models generate to explain their solutions. This dual evaluation lets us assess whether models solve tasks using the abstractions ConceptARC was designed to elicit, rather than relying on surface-level patterns. Our results show that, while some models using text-based representations match human output accuracy, the best models' rules are often based on surface-level ``shortcuts'' and capture intended abstractions far less often than humans. Thus their capabilities for general abstract reasoning may be overestimated by evaluations based on accuracy alone. In the visual modality, AI models' output accuracy drops sharply, yet our rule-level analysis reveals that models might be underestimated, as they still exhibit a substantial share of rules that capture intended abstractions, but are often unable to correctly apply these rules. In short, our results show that models still lag humans in abstract reasoning, and that using accuracy alone to evaluate abstract reasoning on ARC-like tasks may overestimate abstract-reasoning capabilities in textual modalities and underestimate it in visual modalities. We believe that our evaluation framework offers a more faithful picture of multimodal models' abstract reasoning abilities and a more principled way to track progress toward human-like, abstraction-centered intelligence.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning abilities in complex tasks, often relying on Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. However, due to their autoregressive token-level generation, the reasoning process is largely constrained to local decision-making and lacks global planning. This limitation frequently results in redundant, incoherent, or inaccurate reasoning, which significantly degrades overall performance. Existing approaches, such as tree-based algorithms and reinforcement learning (RL), attempt to address this issue but suffer from high computational costs and often fail to produce optimal reasoning trajectories. To tackle this challenge, we propose Plan-Then-Action Enhanced Reasoning with Group Relative Policy Optimization PTA-GRPO, a two-stage framework designed to improve both high-level planning and fine-grained CoT reasoning. In the first stage, we leverage advanced LLMs to distill CoT into compact high-level guidance, which is then used for supervised fine-tuning (SFT). In the second stage, we introduce a guidance-aware RL method that jointly optimizes the final output and the quality of high-level guidance, thereby enhancing reasoning effectiveness. We conduct extensive experiments on multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks, including MATH, AIME2024, AIME2025, and AMC, across diverse base models such as Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, Qwen3-8B, Qwen3-14B, and LLaMA3.2-3B. Experimental results demonstrate that PTA-GRPO consistently achieves stable and significant improvements across different models and tasks, validating its effectiveness and generalization.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success across a wide range of industries, primarily due to their impressive generative abilities. Yet, their potential in applications requiring cognitive abilities, such as psychological counseling, remains largely untapped. This paper investigates the key question: Can LLMs be effectively applied to psychological counseling? To determine whether an LLM can effectively take on the role of a psychological counselor, the first step is to assess whether it meets the qualifications required for such a role, namely the ability to pass the U.S. National Counselor Certification Exam (NCE). This is because, just as a human counselor must pass a certification exam to practice, an LLM must demonstrate sufficient psychological knowledge to meet the standards required for such a role. To address this, we introduce PsychoBench, a benchmark grounded inthis http URLcounselor examinations, a licensure test for professional counselors that requires about 70% accuracy to pass. PsychoBench comprises approximately 2,252 carefully curated single-choice questions, crafted to require deep understanding and broad enough to cover various sub-disciplines of psychology. This benchmark provides a comprehensive assessment of an LLM's ability to function as a counselor. Our evaluation shows that advanced models such as GPT-4o, Llama3.3-70B, and Gemma3-27B achieve well above the passing threshold, while smaller open-source models (e.g., Qwen2.5-7B, Mistral-7B) remain far below it. These results suggest that only frontier LLMs are currently capable of meeting counseling exam standards, highlighting both the promise and the challenges of developing psychology-oriented LLMs.

  We present InvThink, a simple yet powerful approach that gives large language models (LLMs) the capability of inverse thinking: reasoning through failure modes before generating responses. Unlike existing safety alignment methods that optimize directly for safe response, InvThink instructs models to 1) enumerate potential harms, 2) analyze their consequences, and 3) generate safe outputs that proactively avoid these risks. Our method reveals three key findings: (i) safety improvements show stronger scaling with model size compared to existing safety methods. (ii) InvThink mitigates safety tax; by training models to systematically consider failure modes, it preserves general reasoning capabilities on standard benchmarks. (iii) beyond general safety tasks, InvThink excels in high-stakes domains including external-facing (medicine, finance, law) and agentic (blackmail, murder) risk scenarios, achieving up to 15.7% reduction in harmful responses compared to baseline methods like SafetyPrompt. We further implement InvThink via supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning across three LLM families. These results suggest that inverse reasoning provides a scalable and generalizable path toward safer, more capable language models.

  Large language model (LLM) agents deployed for multi-step tasks frequently fail in predictable ways: attempting actions with unmet preconditions, issuing redundant commands, or mishandling environment constraints. While retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) can improve performance by providing runtime guidance, it requires maintaining external knowledge databases and adds computational overhead at every deployment. We propose a simple pipeline that converts inference-time retrieval into learned competence through distillation. Our approach: (1) extracts compact, reusable hints from agent failures, (2) uses these hints to generate improved teacher trajectories via one-shot retrieval at episode start, and (3) trains student models on these trajectories with hint strings removed, forcing internalization rather than memorization. Across two interactive benchmarks, ALFWorld (household tasks) and WebShop (online shopping), distilled students consistently outperform baseline agents, achieving up to 91% success on ALFWorld (vs. 79% for baselines) and improving WebShop scores to 72 (vs. 61 for baselines), while using 10-60% fewer tokens than retrieval-augmented teachers depending on the environment. The approach generalizes across model scales (7B/14B parameters) and agent architectures (ReAct/StateAct), demonstrating that retrieval benefits can be effectively internalized through targeted fine-tuning without permanent runtime dependencies.

  Recent works on context and memory benchmarking have primarily focused on conversational instances but the need for evaluating memory in dynamic enterprise environments is crucial for its effective application. We introduce MEMTRACK, a benchmark designed to evaluate long-term memory and state tracking in multi-platform agent environments. MEMTRACK models realistic organizational workflows by integrating asynchronous events across multiple communication and productivity platforms such as Slack, Linear and Git. Each benchmark instance provides a chronologically platform-interleaved timeline, with noisy, conflicting, cross-referring information as well as potential codebase/file-system comprehension and exploration. Consequently, our benchmark tests memory capabilities such as acquistion, selection and conflict resolution. We curate the MEMTRACK dataset through both manual expert driven design and scalable agent based synthesis, generating ecologically valid scenarios grounded in real world software development processes. We introduce pertinent metrics for Correctness, Efficiency, and Redundancy that capture the effectiveness of memory mechanisms beyond simple QA performance. Experiments across SoTA LLMs and memory backends reveal challenges in utilizing memory across long horizons, handling cross-platform dependencies, and resolving contradictions. Notably, the best performing GPT-5 model only achieves a 60\% Correctness score on MEMTRACK. This work provides an extensible framework for advancing evaluation research for memory-augmented agents, beyond existing focus on conversational setups, and sets the stage for multi-agent, multi-platform memory benchmarking in complex organizational settings

  The rapid advancement of reasoning capabilities in large language models (LLMs) has led to notable improvements on mathematical benchmarks. However, many of the most commonly used evaluation datasets (e.g., AIME 2024) are widely available online, making it difficult to disentangle genuine reasoning from potential memorization. Furthermore, these benchmarks do not evaluate proof-writing capabilities, which are crucial for many mathematical tasks. To address this, we introduce MathArena, a new benchmark based on the following key insight: recurring math competitions provide a stream of high-quality, challenging problems that can be used for real-time evaluation of LLMs. By evaluating models as soon as new problems are released, we effectively eliminate the risk of contamination. Using this framework, we find strong signs of contamination in AIME 2024. Nonetheless, evaluations on harder competitions, such as CMIMC 2025, demonstrate impressive reasoning capabilities in top-performing models. MathArena is also the first benchmark for proof-writing capabilities. On IMO 2025, top models achieve slightly less than 40%, demonstrating both notable progress and significant room for improvement. So far, we have evaluated over $50$ models across seven competitions, totaling $162$ problems. As an evolving benchmark, MathArena will continue to track the progress of LLMs on newly released competitions, ensuring rigorous and up-to-date evaluation of mathematical reasoning.

  Contextual Markov Decision Processes (CMDPs) offer a framework for sequential decision-making under external signals, but existing methods often fail to generalize in high-dimensional or unstructured contexts, resulting in excessive computation and unstable performance. We propose an information-theoretic summarization approach that uses large language models (LLMs) to compress contextual inputs into low-dimensional, semantically rich summaries. These summaries augment states by preserving decision-critical cues while reducing redundancy. Building on the notion of approximate context sufficiency, we provide, to our knowledge, the first regret bounds and a latency-entropy trade-off characterization for CMDPs. Our analysis clarifies how informativeness impacts computational cost. Experiments across discrete, continuous, visual, and recommendation benchmarks show that our method outperforms raw-context and non-context baselines, improving reward, success rate, and sample efficiency, while reducing latency and memory usage. These findings demonstrate that LLM-based summarization offers a scalable and interpretable solution for efficient decision-making in context-rich, resource-constrained environments.

  Diffusion language models (dLLMs) offer a promising, non-autoregressive paradigm for text generation, yet training them for complex reasoning remains a key challenge. Current reinforcement learning approaches often rely on sparse, outcome-based rewards, which can reinforce flawed reasoning paths that lead to coincidentally correct answers. We argue that this stems from a fundamental mismatch with the natural structure of reasoning. We first propose a theoretical framework that formalizes complex problem solving as a hierarchical selection process, where an intractable global constraint is decomposed into a series of simpler, localized logical steps. This framework provides a principled foundation for algorithm design, including theoretical insights into the identifiability of this latent reasoning structure. Motivated by this theory, we identify unstructured refinement -- a failure mode where a model's iterative steps do not contribute meaningfully to the solution -- as a core deficiency in existing methods. We then introduce Step-Aware Policy Optimization (SAPO), a novel RL algorithm that aligns the dLLM's denoising process with the latent reasoning hierarchy. By using a process-based reward function that encourages incremental progress, SAPO guides the model to learn structured, coherent reasoning paths. Our empirical results show that this principled approach significantly improves performance on challenging reasoning benchmarks and enhances the interpretability of the generation process.

  High-assurance reasoning, particularly in critical domains such as law and medicine, requires conclusions that are accurate, verifiable, and explicitly grounded in evidence. This reasoning relies on premises codified from rules, statutes, and contracts, inherently involving defeasible or non-monotonic logic due to numerous exceptions, where the introduction of a single fact can invalidate general rules, posing significant challenges. While large language models (LLMs) excel at processing natural language, their capabilities in standard inference tasks do not translate to the rigorous reasoning required over high-assurance text guidelines. Core reasoning challenges within such texts often manifest specific logical structures involving negation, implication, and, most critically, defeasible rules and exceptions. In this paper, we propose a novel neurosymbolically-grounded architecture called LOGicalThought (LogT) that uses an advanced logical language and reasoner in conjunction with an LLM to construct a dual symbolic graph context and logic-based context. These two context representations transform the problem from inference over long-form guidelines into a compact grounded evaluation. Evaluated on four multi-domain benchmarks against four baselines, LogT improves overall performance by 11.84% across all LLMs. Performance improves significantly across all three modes of reasoning: by up to +10.2% on negation, +13.2% on implication, and +5.5% on defeasible reasoning compared to the strongest baseline.

  Modern deployments increasingly allocate large test-time compute (thousands of tokens or many node expansions) to boost reliability. Under such budgets, standard Tree-of-Thoughts-style search exhibits two pathologies: breadth saturation (additional samples mostly produce near-duplicates, so width stops growing) and depth myopia (noisy short-horizon utilities prune branches whose payoff appears after a few more steps). We propose Lateral Tree-of-Thoughts (LToT), a drop-in controller that separates utility from logical consistency and treats low-utility but consistent candidates as assets rather than waste. The frontier is split into mainlines (high-utility candidates used for exploitation) and laterals (consistent, initially low-utility candidates that receive short, cheap probes before judgment). LToT explores laterals via Lateral Racing with Short-Circuit (LR--SC): a capped successive-halving race that spreads tiny probes across a very wide lateral set, uses width-aware thresholds with repeat-to-confirm, and immediately promotes a branch once its envelope clears the mainline bar; mainlines are kept intentionally narrow so surplus compute is invested where width is cheap. We prove a pseudolinear lateral cost $\Theta(N_0 \log_{\eta} N_0)$ with logarithmically many rungs (initial lateral width $N_0$; culling factor $\eta>1$), in contrast to the exponential growth of uncapped mainlines. Empirical evaluations on benchmark tasks are in preparation and will be added in a future revision. In short, LToT turns large test-time budgets into principled diversity while preserving promotion discipline, mitigating saturation and myopia without inflating compute.

  As governments move to regulate AI, there is growing interest in using Large Language Models (LLMs) to assess whether or not an AI system complies with a given AI Regulation (AIR). However, there is presently no way to benchmark the performance of LLMs at this task. To fill this void, we introduce AIReg-Bench: the first benchmark dataset designed to test how well LLMs can assess compliance with the EU AI Act (AIA). We created this dataset through a two-step process: (1) by prompting an LLM with carefully structured instructions, we generated 120 technical documentation excerpts (samples), each depicting a fictional, albeit plausible, AI system - of the kind an AI provider might produce to demonstrate their compliance with AIR; (2) legal experts then reviewed and annotated each sample to indicate whether, and in what way, the AI system described therein violates specific Articles of the AIA. The resulting dataset, together with our evaluation of whether frontier LLMs can reproduce the experts' compliance labels, provides a starting point to understand the opportunities and limitations of LLM-based AIR compliance assessment tools and establishes a benchmark against which subsequent LLMs can be compared. The dataset and evaluation code are available atthis https URL.

  At the core of Deep Research is knowledge mining, the task of extracting structured information from massive unstructured text in response to user instructions. Large language models (LLMs) excel at interpreting such instructions but are prohibitively expensive to deploy at scale, while traditional pipelines of classifiers and extractors remain efficient yet brittle and unable to generalize to new tasks. We introduce Falconer, a collaborative framework that combines the agentic reasoning of LLMs with lightweight proxy models for scalable knowledge mining. In Falconer, LLMs act as planners, decomposing user instructions into executable pipelines, and as annotators, generating supervision to train small proxies. The framework unifies classification and extraction into two atomic operations, get label and get span, enabling a single instruction-following model to replace multiple task-specific components. To evaluate the consistency between proxy models incubated by Falconer and annotations provided by humans and large models, we construct new benchmarks covering both planning and end-to-end execution. Experiments show that Falconer closely matches state-of-the-art LLMs in instruction-following accuracy while reducing inference cost by up to 90% and accelerating large-scale knowledge mining by more than 20x, offering an efficient and scalable foundation for Deep Research.

  System logs represent a valuable source of Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI), capturing attacker behaviors, exploited vulnerabilities, and traces of malicious activity. Yet their utility is often limited by lack of structure, semantic inconsistency, and fragmentation across devices and sessions. Extracting actionable CTI from logs therefore requires approaches that can reconcile noisy, heterogeneous data into coherent and interoperable representations. We introduce OntoLogX, an autonomous Artificial Intelligence (AI) agent that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to transform raw logs into ontology-grounded Knowledge Graphs (KGs). OntoLogX integrates a lightweight log ontology with Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and iterative correction steps, ensuring that generated KGs are syntactically and semantically valid. Beyond event-level analysis, the system aggregates KGs into sessions and employs a LLM to predict MITRE ATT&CK tactics, linking low-level log evidence to higher-level adversarial objectives. We evaluate OntoLogX on both logs from a public benchmark and a real-world honeypot dataset, demonstrating robust KG generation across multiple KGs backends and accurate mapping of adversarial activity to ATT&CK tactics. Results highlight the benefits of retrieval and correction for precision and recall, the effectiveness of code-oriented models in structured log analysis, and the value of ontology-grounded representations for actionable CTI extraction.

  Modern engineering increasingly relies on vast datasets generated by experiments and simulations, driving a growing demand for efficient, reliable, and broadly applicable modeling strategies. There is also heightened interest in developing data-driven approaches, particularly neural network models, for effective prediction and analysis of scientific datasets. Traditional data-driven methods frequently involve extensive manual intervention, limiting their ability to scale effectively and generalize to diverse applications. In this study, we propose an innovative pipeline utilizing Large Language Model (LLM) agents to automate data-driven modeling and analysis, with a particular emphasis on regression tasks. We evaluate two LLM-agent frameworks: a multi-agent system featuring specialized collaborative agents, and a single-agent system based on the Reasoning and Acting (ReAct) paradigm. Both frameworks autonomously handle data preprocessing, neural network development, training, hyperparameter optimization, and uncertainty quantification (UQ). We validate our approach using a critical heat flux (CHF) prediction benchmark, involving approximately 25,000 experimental data points from the OECD/NEA benchmark dataset. Results indicate that our LLM-agent-developed model surpasses traditional CHF lookup tables and delivers predictive accuracy and UQ on par with state-of-the-art Bayesian optimized deep neural network models developed by human experts. These outcomes underscore the significant potential of LLM-based agents to automate complex engineering modeling tasks, greatly reducing human workload while meeting or exceeding existing standards of predictive performance.

  Existing multi-agent learning approaches have developed interactive training environments to explicitly promote collaboration among multiple Large Language Models (LLMs), thereby constructing stronger multi-agent systems (MAS). However, during inference, they require re-executing the MAS to obtain final solutions, which diverges from human cognition that individuals can enhance their reasoning capabilities through interactions with others and resolve questions independently in the future. To investigate whether multi-agent interaction can enhance LLMs' independent problem-solving ability, we introduce ILR, a novel co-learning framework for MAS that integrates two key components: Dynamic Interaction and Perception Calibration. Specifically, Dynamic Interaction first adaptively selects either cooperative or competitive strategies depending on question difficulty and model ability. LLMs then exchange information through Idea3 (Idea Sharing, Idea Analysis, and Idea Fusion), an innovative interaction paradigm designed to mimic human discussion, before deriving their respective final answers. In Perception Calibration, ILR employs Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to train LLMs while integrating one LLM's reward distribution characteristics into another's reward function, thereby enhancing the cohesion of multi-agent interactions. We validate ILR on three LLMs across two model families of varying scales, evaluating performance on five mathematical benchmarks and one coding benchmark. Experimental results show that ILR consistently outperforms single-agent learning, yielding an improvement of up to 5% over the strongest baseline. We further discover that Idea3 can enhance the robustness of stronger LLMs during multi-agent inference, and dynamic interaction types can boost multi-agent learning compared to pure cooperative or competitive strategies.

  We investigated Agentic RL with large language models on the \textsc{TravelPlanner} benchmark. Our approach, \textsc{Planner-R1}, achieved a \textbf{56.9\%} final-pass rate with only 180 training queries, a $2.7\times$ improvement over GPT-5's $21.2\%$ baseline and the strongest agentic result on the public leaderboard. A central finding was that smaller models (8B) were highly responsive to reward shaping: with dense process-level signals, they reached competitive performance while being $3.5\times$ more compute-efficient and $1.5\times$ more memory-efficient than 32B models. Larger models were more robust under sparse rewards but exhibited smaller relative gains from shaping and higher variance across runs. While curriculum learning offered no significant benefit, shaped rewards consistently amplified learning dynamics, making 8B models the most efficient setting for agentic RL. Crucially, these gains did not come at the cost of overfitting: fine-tuned models mostly maintained or exceeded baseline performance on out-of-domain tasks, including \textsc{Multi-IF}, \textsc{NaturalPlan}, and $\tau$-\textsc{Bench}. These results establish reward shaping as a decisive lever for scaling agentic RL, highlight the competitive strength of smaller models, and demonstrate that efficiency can be achieved without sacrificing generalization.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) for Graph Reasoning have been extensively studied over the past two years, involving enabling LLMs to understand graph structures and reason on graphs to solve various graph problems, with graph algorithm problems being the most prevalent. Recent studies underscore the potential of LLMs in handling graph reasoning tasks, but their performance is underwhelming. In this work, we point out issues with existing methods and benchmarks, and rethink the direction that LLMs for graph reasoning should strive toward. We find that base models, e.g., GPT-4o-mini, are largely underestimated due to improper reasoning focus. Base models with reasoning focus redirected from replicating graph algorithms to designing them can easily solve most graph reasoning tasks in existing benchmarks. To truly evaluate the graph reasoning capabilities of LLMs, we construct a more challenging GraphAlgorithm benchmark, comprising 239 different graph problems and 3,041 test instances collected from 4 competition platforms. Finally, we introduce a simple and strong baseline Simple-Reasoning-Then-Coding (Simple-RTC)-which guides LLMs to design graph algorithms first and then code to address graph reasoning tasks. Simple-RTC achieves near-perfect accuracy on existing benchmarks and significantly outperforms GPT-4o-mini and all prior methods on the GraphAlgorithm benchmark. This strong baseline encourages further advancements in LLMs for Graph Reasoning in the future.

  We study multi-turn multi-agent orchestration, where multiple large language model (LLM) agents interact over multiple turns by iteratively proposing answers or casting votes until reaching consensus. Using four LLMs (Gemini 2.5 Pro, GPT-5, Grok 4, and Claude Sonnet 4) on GPQA-Diamond, IFEval, and MuSR, we conduct two experiments: (i) benchmarking orchestration against single-LLM baselines; and (ii) ablations on GPQA-Diamond that vary whether agents see who authored answers and whether they can observe ongoing votes. Orchestration matches or exceeds the strongest single model and consistently outperforms the others. Analysis of best-achievable orchestration performance shows potential for further gains. The ablations show that revealing authorship increases self-voting and ties, and that showing ongoing votes amplifies herding, which speeds convergence but can sometimes yield premature consensus.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promising capabilities for solving Operations Research (OR) problems. While reinforcement learning serves as a powerful paradigm for LLM training on OR problems, existing works generally face two key limitations. First, outcome reward suffers from the credit assignment problem, where correct final answers can reinforce flawed reasoning. Second, conventional discriminative process supervision is myopic, failing to evaluate the interdependent steps of OR modeling holistically. To this end, we introduce StepORLM, a novel self-evolving framework with generative process supervision. At its core, StepORLM features a co-evolutionary loop where a policy model and a generative process reward model (GenPRM) iteratively improve on each other. This loop is driven by a dual-feedback mechanism: definitive, outcome-based verification from an external solver, and nuanced, holistic process evaluation from the GenPRM. The combined signal is used to align the policy via Weighted Direct Preference Optimization (W-DPO) and simultaneously refine the GenPRM. Our resulting 8B-parameter StepORLM establishes a new state-of-the-art across six benchmarks, significantly outperforming vastly larger generalist models, agentic methods, and specialized baselines. Moreover, the co-evolved GenPRM is able to act as a powerful and universally applicable process verifier, substantially boosting the inference scaling performance of both our own model and other existing LLMs.

  This paper presents an evaluation framework for assessing Large Language Models' (LLMs) capabilities in combinatorial optimization, specifically addressing the 2D bin-packing problem. We introduce a systematic methodology that combines LLMs with evolutionary algorithms to generate and refine heuristic solutions iteratively. Through comprehensive experiments comparing LLM generated heuristics against traditional approaches (Finite First-Fit and Hybrid First-Fit), we demonstrate that LLMs can produce more efficient solutions while requiring fewer computational resources. Our evaluation reveals that GPT-4o achieves optimal solutions within two iterations, reducing average bin usage from 16 to 15 bins while improving space utilization from 0.76-0.78 to 0.83. This work contributes to understanding LLM evaluation in specialized domains and establishes benchmarks for assessing LLM performance in combinatorial optimization tasks.

  Data science, which transforms raw data into actionable insights, is critical for data-driven decision-making. However, these tasks are often complex, involving steps for exploring multiple data sources and synthesizing findings to deliver insightful answers. While large language models (LLMs) show significant promise in automating this process, they often struggle with heterogeneous data formats and generate sub-optimal analysis plans, as verifying plan sufficiency is inherently difficult without ground-truth labels for such open-ended tasks. To overcome these limitations, we introduce DS-STAR, a novel data science agent. Specifically, DS-STAR makes three key contributions: (1) a data file analysis module that automatically explores and extracts context from diverse data formats, including unstructured types; (2) a verification step where an LLM-based judge evaluates the sufficiency of the analysis plan at each stage; and (3) a sequential planning mechanism that starts with a simple, executable plan and iteratively refines it based on the DS-STAR's feedback until its sufficiency is verified. This iterative refinement allows DS-STAR to reliably navigate complex analyses involving diverse data sources. Our experiments show that DS-STAR achieves state-of-the-art performance across three challenging benchmarks: DABStep, KramaBench, and DA-Code. Moreover, DS-STAR particularly outperforms baselines on hard tasks that require processing multiple data files with heterogeneous formats.

  Schemas play a vital role in ensuring data quality and supporting usability in the Semantic Web and natural language processing. Traditionally, their creation demands substantial involvement from knowledge engineers and domain experts. Leveraging the impressive capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in tasks like ontology engineering, we explore schema generation using LLMs. To bridge the resource gap, we introduce two datasets: YAGO Schema and Wikidata EntitySchema, along with novel evaluation metrics. The LLM-based pipelines utilize local and global information from knowledge graphs (KGs) to generate schemas in Shape Expressions (ShEx). Experiments demonstrate LLMs' strong potential in producing high-quality ShEx schemas, paving the way for scalable, automated schema generation for large KGs. Furthermore, our benchmark introduces a new challenge for structured generation, pushing the limits of LLMs on syntactically rich formalisms.

  Autonomous AI agents that can follow instructions and perform complex multi-step tasks have tremendous potential to boost human productivity. However, to perform many of these tasks, the agents need access to personal information from their users, raising the question of whether they are capable of using it appropriately. In this work, we introduce a new benchmark AgentDAM that measures if AI web-navigation agents follow the privacy principle of ``data minimization''. For the purposes of our benchmark, data minimization means that the agent uses a piece of potentially sensitive information only if it is ``necessary'' to complete a particular task. Our benchmark simulates realistic web interaction scenarios end-to-end and is adaptable to all existing web navigation agents. We use AgentDAM to evaluate how well AI agents built on top of GPT-4, Llama-3 and Claude can limit processing of potentially private information, and show that they are prone to inadvertent use of unnecessary sensitive information. We also propose a prompting-based defense that reduces information leakage, and demonstrate that our end-to-end benchmarking provides a more realistic measure than probing LLMs about privacy. Our results highlight that further research is needed to develop AI agents that can prioritize data minimization at inference time.

  As we consider entrusting Large Language Models (LLMs) with key societal and decision-making roles, measuring their alignment with human cognition becomes critical. This requires methods that can assess how these systems represent information and facilitate comparisons with human understanding across diverse tasks. To meet this need, we adapted Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA), a method that uses pairwise similarity ratings to quantify alignment between AIs and humans. We tested this approach on semantic alignment across text and image modalities, measuring how different Large Language and Vision Language Model (LLM and VLM) similarity judgments aligned with human responses at both group and individual levels. GPT-4o showed the strongest alignment with human performance among the models we tested, particularly when leveraging its text processing capabilities rather than image processing, regardless of the input modality. However, no model we studied adequately captured the inter-individual variability observed among human participants, and only moderately aligned with any individual human's responses. This method helped uncover certain hyperparameters and prompts that could steer model behavior to have more or less human-like qualities at an inter-individual or group level. Pairwise ratings and RSA enable the efficient and flexible quantification of human-AI alignment, which complements existing accuracy-based benchmark tasks. We demonstrate the utility of this approach across multiple modalities (words, sentences, images) for understanding how LLMs encode knowledge and for examining representational alignment with human cognition.
