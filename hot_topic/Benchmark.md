- **[Fast Visuomotor Policy for Robotic Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12483)**  `arXiv:2510.12483`  `cs.RO` `cs.CV`  
  _Jingkai Jia, Tong Yang, Xueyao Chen, Chenhuan Liu, Wenqiang Zhang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present a fast and effective policy framework for robotic manipulation, named Energy Policy, designed for high-frequency robotic tasks and resource-constrained systems. Unlike existing robotic policies, Energy Policy natively predicts multimodal actions in a single forward pass, enabling high-precision manipulation at high speed. The framework is built upon two core components. First, we adopt the energy score as the learning objective to facilitate multimodal action modeling. Second, we introduce an energy MLP to implement the proposed objective while keeping the architecture simple and efficient. We conduct comprehensive experiments in both simulated environments and real-world robotic tasks to evaluate the effectiveness of Energy Policy. The results show that Energy Policy matches or surpasses the performance of state-of-the-art manipulation methods while significantly reducing computational overhead. Notably, on the MimicGen benchmark, Energy Policy achieves superior performance with at a faster inference compared to existing approaches.

  Safe and interpretable motion planning in complex urban environments needs to reason about bidirectional multi-agent interactions. This reasoning requires to estimate the costs of potential ego driving maneuvers. Many existing planners generate initial trajectories with sampling-based methods and refine them by optimizing on learned predictions of future environment states, which requires a cost function that encodes the desired vehicle behavior. Designing such a cost function can be very challenging, especially if a wide range of complex urban scenarios has to be considered. We propose HYPE: HYbrid Planning with Ego proposal-conditioned predictions, a planner that integrates multimodal trajectory proposals from a learned proposal model as heuristic priors into a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) refinement. To model bidirectional interactions, we introduce an ego-conditioned occupancy prediction model, enabling consistent, scene-aware reasoning. Our design significantly simplifies cost function design in refinement by considering proposal-driven guidance, requiring only minimalistic grid-based cost terms. Evaluations on large-scale real-world benchmarks nuPlan and DeepUrban show that HYPE effectively achieves state-of-the-art performance, especially in safety and adaptability.

- **[ManiAgent: An Agentic Framework for General Robotic Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11660)**  `arXiv:2510.11660`  `cs.RO` `cs.AI`  
  _Yi Yang, Kefan Gu, Yuqing Wen, Hebei Li, Yucheng Zhao, Tiancai Wang, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  While Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have demonstrated impressive capabilities in robotic manipulation, their performance in complex reasoning and long-horizon task planning is limited by data scarcity and model capacity. To address this, we introduce ManiAgent, an agentic architecture for general manipulation tasks that achieves end-to-end output from task descriptions and environmental inputs to robotic manipulation actions. In this framework, multiple agents involve inter-agent communication to perform environmental perception, sub-task decomposition and action generation, enabling efficient handling of complex manipulation scenarios. Evaluations show ManiAgent achieves an 86.8% success rate on the SimplerEnv benchmark and 95.8% on real-world pick-and-place tasks, enabling efficient data collection that yields VLA models with performance comparable to those trained on human-annotated datasets.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Deploying reinforcement learning (RL) safely in the real world is challenging, as policies trained in simulators must face the inevitable sim-to-real gap. Robust safe RL techniques are provably safe, however difficult to scale, while domain randomization is more practical yet prone to unsafe behaviors. We address this gap by proposing SPiDR, short for Sim-to-real via Pessimistic Domain Randomization -- a scalable algorithm with provable guarantees for safe sim-to-real transfer. SPiDR uses domain randomization to incorporate the uncertainty about the sim-to-real gap into the safety constraints, making it versatile and highly compatible with existing training pipelines. Through extensive experiments on sim-to-sim benchmarks and two distinct real-world robotic platforms, we demonstrate that SPiDR effectively ensures safety despite the sim-to-real gap while maintaining strong performance.

- **[BridgeVLA: Input-Output Alignment for Efficient 3D Manipulation Learning with Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07961)**  `arXiv:2506.07961`  `cs.RO` `cs.AI`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recently, leveraging pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) for building vision-language-action (VLA) models has emerged as a promising approach to effective robot manipulation learning. However, only few methods incorporate 3D signals into VLMs for action prediction, and they do not fully leverage the spatial structure inherent in 3D data, leading to low sample efficiency. In this paper, we introduce BridgeVLA, a novel 3D VLA model that (1) projects 3D inputs to multiple 2D images, ensuring input alignment with the VLM backbone, and (2) utilizes 2D heatmaps for action prediction, unifying the input and output spaces within a consistent 2D image space. In addition, we propose a scalable pre-training method that equips the VLM backbone with the capability to predict 2D heatmaps before downstream policy learning. Extensive experiments show the proposed method is able to learn 3D manipulation efficiently and effectively. BridgeVLA outperforms state-of-the-art baseline methods across three simulation benchmarks. In RLBench, it improves the average success rate from 81.4% to 88.2%. In COLOSSEUM, it demonstrates significantly better performance in challenging generalization settings, boosting the average success rate from 56.7% to 64.0%. In GemBench, it surpasses all the comparing baseline methods in terms of average success rate. In real-robot experiments, BridgeVLA outperforms a state-of-the-art baseline method by 32% on average. It generalizes robustly in multiple out-of-distribution settings, including visual disturbances and unseen instructions. Remarkably, it is able to achieve a success rate of 96.8% on 10+ tasks with only 3 trajectories per task, highlighting its extraordinary sample efficiency. Project Website:this https URL

- **[Maximal Adaptation, Minimal Guidance: Permissive Reactive Robot Task Planning with Humans in the Loop](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12662)**  `arXiv:2510.12662`  `cs.RO`  
  _Oz Gitelson, Satya Prakash Nayak, Ritam Raha, Anne-Kathrin Schmuck_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present a novel framework for human-robot \emph{logical} interaction that enables robots to reliably satisfy (infinite horizon) temporal logic tasks while effectively collaborating with humans who pursue independent and unknown tasks. The framework combines two key capabilities: (i) \emph{maximal adaptation} enables the robot to adjust its strategy \emph{online} to exploit human behavior for cooperation whenever possible, and (ii) \emph{minimal tunable feedback} enables the robot to request cooperation by the human online only when necessary to guarantee progress. This balance minimizes human-robot interference, preserves human autonomy, and ensures persistent robot task satisfaction even under conflicting human goals. We validate the approach in a real-world block-manipulation task with a Franka Emika Panda robotic arm and in the Overcooked-AI benchmark, demonstrating that our method produces rich, \emph{emergent} cooperative behaviors beyond the reach of existing approaches, while maintaining strong formal guarantees.

- **[MTIL: Encoding Full History with Mamba for Temporal Imitation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12410)**  `arXiv:2505.12410`  `cs.RO`  
  _Yulin Zhou, Yuankai Lin, Fanzhe Peng, Jiahui Chen, Kaiji Huang, Hua Yang, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Standard imitation learning (IL) methods have achieved considerable success in robotics, yet often rely on the Markov assumption, which falters in long-horizon tasks where history is crucial for resolving perceptual ambiguity. This limitation stems not only from a conceptual gap but also from a fundamental computational barrier: prevailing architectures like Transformers are often constrained by quadratic complexity, rendering the processing of long, high-dimensional observation sequences infeasible. To overcome this dual challenge, we introduce Mamba Temporal Imitation Learning (MTIL). Our approach represents a new paradigm for robotic learning, which we frame as a practical synthesis of World Model and Dynamical System concepts. By leveraging the linear-time recurrent dynamics of State Space Models (SSMs), MTIL learns an implicit, action-oriented world model that efficiently encodes the entire trajectory history into a compressed, evolving state. This allows the policy to be conditioned on a comprehensive temporal context, transcending the confines of Markovian approaches. Through extensive experiments on simulated benchmarks (ACT, Robomimic, LIBERO) and on challenging real-world tasks, MTIL demonstrates superior performance against SOTA methods like ACT and Diffusion Policy, particularly in resolving long-term temporal ambiguities. Our findings not only affirm the necessity of full temporal context but also validate MTIL as a powerful and a computationally feasible approach for learning long-horizon, non-Markovian behaviors from high-dimensional observations.

- **[GPA-RAM: Grasp-Pretraining Augmented Robotic Attention Mamba for Spatial Task Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19683)**  `arXiv:2504.19683`  `cs.RO`  
  _Juyi Sheng, Yangjun Liu, Sheng Xu, Zhixin Yang, Mengyuan Liu_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Most existing robot manipulation methods prioritize task learning by enhancing perception through complex deep network architectures. However, they face challenges in real-time collision-free planning. Hence, Robotic Attention Mamba (RAM) is designed for refined planning. Specifically, by integrating Mamba and parallel single-view attention, RAM aligns multi-view vision and task-related language features, ensuring efficient fine-grained task planning with linear complexity and robust real-time performance. Nevertheless, it has the potential for further improvement in high-precision grasping and manipulation. Thus, Grasp-Pretraining Augmentation (GPA) is devised, with a grasp pose feature extractor pretrained utilizing object grasp poses directly inherited from whole-task demonstrations. Subsequently, the extracted grasp features are fused with the spatially aligned planning features from RAM through attention-based Pre-trained Location Fusion, preserving high-resolution grasping cues overshadowed by an overemphasis on global planning. To summarize, we propose Grasp-Pretraining Augmented Robotic Attention Mamba (GPA-RAM), dividing spatial task learning into RAM for planning skill learning and GPA for grasping skill learning. GPA-RAM demonstrates superior performance across three robot systems with distinct camera configurations in simulation and the real world. Compared with previous state-of-the-art methods, it improves the absolute success rate by 8.2% (from 79.3% to 87.5%) on the RLBench multi-task benchmark and 40% (from 16% to 56%), 12% (from 86% to 98%) on the ALOHA bimanual manipulation tasks, while delivering notably faster inference. Furthermore, experimental results demonstrate that both RAM and GPA enhance task learning, with GPA proving robust to different architectures of pretrained grasp pose feature extractors.

- **[HEAL: An Empirical Study on Hallucinations in Embodied Agents Driven by Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15065)**  `arXiv:2506.15065`  `cs.LG` `cs.RO`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being adopted as the cognitive core of embodied agents. However, inherited hallucinations, which stem from failures to ground user instructions in the observed physical environment, can lead to navigation errors, such as searching for a refrigerator that does not exist. In this paper, we present the first systematic study of hallucinations in LLM-based embodied agents performing long-horizon tasks under scene-task inconsistencies. Our goal is to understand to what extent hallucinations occur, what types of inconsistencies trigger them, and how current models respond. To achieve these goals, we construct a hallucination probing set by building on an existing benchmark, capable of inducing hallucination rates up to 40x higher than base prompts. Evaluating 12 models across two simulation environments, we find that while models exhibit reasoning, they fail to resolve scene-task inconsistencies-highlighting fundamental limitations in handling infeasible tasks. We also provide actionable insights on ideal model behavior for each scenario, offering guidance for developing more robust and reliable planning strategies.

- **[Optimistic Multi-Agent Policy Gradient](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01953)**  `arXiv:2311.01953`  `cs.LG` `cs.MA`  
  _Wenshuai Zhao, Yi Zhao, Zhiyuan Li, Juho Kannala, Joni Pajarinen_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  *Relative overgeneralization* (RO) occurs in cooperative multi-agent learning tasks when agents converge towards a suboptimal joint policy due to overfitting to suboptimal behavior of other agents. No methods have been proposed for addressing RO in multi-agent policy gradient (MAPG) methods although these methods produce state-of-the-art results. To address this gap, we propose a general, yet simple, framework to enable optimistic updates in MAPG methods that alleviate the RO problem. Our approach involves clipping the advantage to eliminate negative values, thereby facilitating optimistic updates in MAPG. The optimism prevents individual agents from quickly converging to a local optimum. Additionally, we provide a formal analysis to show that the proposed method retains optimality at a fixed point. In extensive evaluations on a diverse set of tasks including the *Multi-agent MuJoCo* and *Overcooked* benchmarks, our method outperforms strong baselines on 13 out of 19 tested tasks and matches the performance on the rest.

- **[Don't Walk the Line: Boundary Guidance for Filtered Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11834)**  `arXiv:2510.11834`  `cs.LG` `cs.CL`  
  _Sarah Ball, Andreas Haupt_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Generative models are increasingly paired with safety classifiers that filter harmful or undesirable outputs. A common strategy is to fine-tune the generator to reduce the probability of being filtered, but this can be suboptimal: it often pushes the model toward producing samples near the classifier's decision boundary, increasing both false positives and false negatives. We propose Boundary Guidance, a reinforcement learning fine-tuning method that explicitly steers generation away from the classifier's margin. On a benchmark of jailbreak and ambiguous prompts, Boundary Guidance improves both the safety and the utility of outputs, as judged by LLM-as-a-Judge evaluations. Comprehensive ablations across model scales and reward designs demonstrate the robustness of our approach.

- **[SCAN: Self-Denoising Monte Carlo Annotation for Robust Process Reward Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16548)**  `arXiv:2509.16548`  `cs.LG` `cs.CL`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Process reward models (PRMs) offer fine-grained, step-level evaluations that facilitate deeper reasoning processes in large language models (LLMs), proving effective in complex tasks like mathematical reasoning. However, developing PRMs is challenging due to the high cost and limited scalability of human-annotated data. Synthetic data from Monte Carlo (MC) estimation is a promising alternative but suffers from a high noise ratio, which can cause overfitting and hinder large-scale training. In this work, we conduct a preliminary study on the noise distribution in synthetic data from MC estimation, identifying that annotation models tend to both underestimate and overestimate step correctness due to limitations in their annotation capabilities. Building on these insights, we propose Self-Denoising Monte Carlo Annotation (SCAN), an efficient data synthesis and noise-tolerant learning framework. Our key findings indicate that: (1) Even lightweight models (e.g., 1.5B parameters) can produce high-quality annotations through a self-denoising strategy, enabling PRMs to achieve superior performance with only 6% the inference cost required by vanilla MC estimation. (2) With our robust learning strategy, PRMs can effectively learn from this weak supervision, achieving a 39.2 F1 score improvement (from 19.9 to 59.1) in ProcessBench. Despite using only a compact synthetic dataset, our models surpass strong baselines, including those trained on large-scale human-annotated datasets such as PRM800K. Furthermore, performance continues to improve as we scale up the synthetic data, highlighting the potential of SCAN for scalable, cost-efficient, and robust PRM training.

- **[DFAMS: Dynamic-flow guided Federated Alignment based Multi-prototype Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20353)**  `arXiv:2508.20353`  `cs.LG` `cs.CL`

  Federated Retrieval (FR) routes queries across multiple external knowledge sources, to mitigate hallucinations of LLMs, when necessary external knowledge is distributed. However, existing methods struggle to retrieve high-quality and relevant documents for ambiguous queries, especially in cross-domain scenarios, which significantly limits their effectiveness in supporting downstream generation tasks. Inspired by Dynamic Information Flow (DIF), we propose DFAMS, a novel framework that leverages DIF to identify latent query intents and construct semantically aligned knowledge partitions for accurate retrieval across heterogeneous sources. Specifically, DFAMS probes the DIF in LLMs by leveraging gradient signals from a few annotated queries and employing Shapley value-based attribution to trace neuron activation paths associated with intent recognition and subdomain boundary detection. Then, DFAMS leverages DIF to train an alignment module via multi-prototype contrastive learning, enabling fine-grained intra-source modeling and inter-source semantic alignment across knowledge bases. Experimental results across five benchmarks show that DFAMS outperforms advanced FR methods by up to 14.37\% in knowledge classification accuracy, 5.38\% in retrieval recall, and 6.45\% in downstream QA accuracy, demonstrating its effectiveness in complex FR scenarios.

- **[Time-IMM: A Dataset and Benchmark for Irregular Multimodal Multivariate Time Series](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10412)**  `arXiv:2506.10412`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI` `cs.CL`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Time series data in real-world applications such as healthcare, climate modeling, and finance are often irregular, multimodal, and messy, with varying sampling rates, asynchronous modalities, and pervasive missingness. However, existing benchmarks typically assume clean, regularly sampled, unimodal data, creating a significant gap between research and real-world deployment. We introduce Time-IMM, a dataset specifically designed to capture cause-driven irregularity in multimodal multivariate time series. Time-IMM represents nine distinct types of time series irregularity, categorized into trigger-based, constraint-based, and artifact-based mechanisms. Complementing the dataset, we introduce IMM-TSF, a benchmark library for forecasting on irregular multimodal time series, enabling asynchronous integration and realistic evaluation. IMM-TSF includes specialized fusion modules, including a timestamp-to-text fusion module and a multimodality fusion module, which support both recency-aware averaging and attention-based integration strategies. Empirical results demonstrate that explicitly modeling multimodality on irregular time series data leads to substantial gains in forecasting performance. Time-IMM and IMM-TSF provide a foundation for advancing time series analysis under real-world conditions. The dataset is publicly available atthis https URL, and the benchmark library can be accessed atthis https URL.

- **[SG-XDEAT: Sparsity-Guided Cross-Dimensional and Cross-Encoding Attention with Target-Aware Conditioning in Tabular Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12659)**  `arXiv:2510.12659`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Chih-Chuan Cheng, Yi-Ju Tseng_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We propose SG-XDEAT (Sparsity-Guided Cross Dimensional and Cross-Encoding Attention with Target Aware Conditioning), a novel framework designed for supervised learning on tabular data. At its core, SG-XDEAT employs a dual-stream encoder that decomposes each input feature into two parallel representations: a raw value stream and a target-conditioned (label-aware) stream. These dual representations are then propagated through a hierarchical stack of attention-based modules. SG-XDEAT integrates three key components: (i) Cross-Dimensional self-attention, which captures intra-view dependencies among features within each stream; (ii) Cross-Encoding self-attention, which enables bidirectional interaction between raw and target-aware representations; and (iii) an Adaptive Sparse Self-Attention (ASSA) mechanism, which dynamically suppresses low-utility tokens by driving their attention weights toward zero--thereby mitigating the impact of noise. Empirical results on multiple public benchmarks show consistent gains over strong baselines, confirming that jointly modeling raw and target-aware views--while adaptively filtering noise--yields a more robust deep tabular learner.

- **[Learning-To-Measure: In-context Active Feature Acquisition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12624)**  `arXiv:2510.12624`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Yuta Kobayashi, Zilin Jing, Jiayu Yao, Hongseok Namkoong, Shalmali Joshi_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Active feature acquisition (AFA) is a sequential decision-making problem where the goal is to improve model performance for test instances by adaptively selecting which features to acquire. In practice, AFA methods often learn from retrospective data with systematic missingness in the features and limited task-specific labels. Most prior work addresses acquisition for a single predetermined task, limiting scalability. To address this limitation, we formalize the meta-AFA problem, where the goal is to learn acquisition policies across various tasks. We introduce Learning-to-Measure (L2M), which consists of i) reliable uncertainty quantification over unseen tasks, and ii) an uncertainty-guided greedy feature acquisition agent that maximizes conditional mutual information. We demonstrate a sequence-modeling or autoregressive pre-training approach that underpins reliable uncertainty quantification for tasks with arbitrary missingness. L2M operates directly on datasets with retrospective missingness and performs the meta-AFA task in-context, eliminating per-task retraining. Across synthetic and real-world tabular benchmarks, L2M matches or surpasses task-specific baselines, particularly under scarce labels and high missingness.

- **[Deep SPI: Safe Policy Improvement via World Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12312)**  `arXiv:2510.12312`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Florent Delgrange, Raphael Avalos, Willem R√∂pke_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Safe policy improvement (SPI) offers theoretical control over policy updates, yet existing guarantees largely concern offline, tabular reinforcement learning (RL). We study SPI in general online settings, when combined with world model and representation learning. We develop a theoretical framework showing that restricting policy updates to a well-defined neighborhood of the current policy ensures monotonic improvement and convergence. This analysis links transition and reward prediction losses to representation quality, yielding online, "deep" analogues of classical SPI theorems from the offline RL literature. Building on these results, we introduce DeepSPI, a principled on-policy algorithm that couples local transition and reward losses with regularised policy updates. On the ALE-57 benchmark, DeepSPI matches or exceeds strong baselines, including PPO and DeepMDPs, while retaining theoretical guarantees.

- **[Revisiting Meta-Learning with Noisy Labels: Reweighting Dynamics and Theoretical Guarantees](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12209)**  `arXiv:2510.12209`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Yiming Zhang, Chester Holtz, Gal Mishne, Alex Cloninger_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Learning with noisy labels remains challenging because over-parameterized networks memorize corrupted supervision. Meta-learning-based sample reweighting mitigates this by using a small clean subset to guide training, yet its behavior and training dynamics lack theoretical understanding. We provide a rigorous theoretical analysis of meta-reweighting under label noise and show that its training trajectory unfolds in three phases: (i) an alignment phase that amplifies examples consistent with a clean subset and suppresses conflicting ones; (ii) a filtering phase driving noisy example weights toward zero until the clean subset loss plateaus; and (iii) a post-filtering phase in which noise filtration becomes perturbation-sensitive. The mechanism is a similarity-weighted coupling between training and clean subset signals together with clean subset training loss contraction; in the post-filtering regime where the clean-subset loss is sufficiently small, the coupling term vanishes and meta-reweighting loses discriminatory power. Guided by this analysis, we propose a lightweight surrogate for meta-reweighting that integrates mean-centering, row shifting, and label-signed modulation, yielding more stable performance while avoiding expensive bi-level optimization. Across synthetic and real noisy-label benchmarks, our method consistently outperforms strong reweighting/selection baselines.

  Standard supervised learners attempt to learn a model from a labeled dataset. Given a small set of labeled instances, and a pool of unlabeled instances, a budgeted learner can use its given budget to pay to acquire the labels of some unlabeled instances, which it can then use to produce a model. Here, we explore budgeted learning in the context of survival datasets, which include (right) censored instances, where we know only a lower bound on an instance's time-to-event. Here, that learner can pay to (partially) label a censored instance -- e.g., to acquire the actual time for an instance [perhaps go from (3 yr, censored) to (7.2 yr, uncensored)], or other variants [e.g., learn about one more year, so go from (3 yr, censored) to either (4 yr, censored) or perhaps (3.2 yr, uncensored)]. This serves as a model of real world data collection, where follow-up with censored patients does not always lead to uncensoring, and how much information is given to the learner model during data collection is a function of the budget and the nature of the data itself. We provide both experimental and theoretical results for how to apply state-of-the-art budgeted learning algorithms to survival data and the respective limitations that exist in doing so. Our approach provides bounds and time complexity asymptotically equivalent to the standard active learning method BatchBALD. Moreover, empirical analysis on several survival tasks show that our model performs better than other potential approaches on several benchmarks.

  Transformer-based deep learning methods have become the standard approach for modeling diverse data such as sequences, images, and graphs. These methods rely on self-attention, which treats data as an unordered set of elements. This ignores the neighborhood structure or graph topology of the data and requires inductive biases--such as position embeddings in sequences and images, or random walks in graphs--to incorporate topology. However, designing such task-specific biases requires significant effort and can introduce side effects that hinder generalization. We introduce Chimera, a unified model that directly incorporates data topology in a principled way, removing the need for domain-specific biases. The key idea is that state space models--which naturally do not require position embeddings--can be generalized to capture any graph topology. Our experiments show that Chimera achieves strong performance across language, vision, and graph domains, outperforming BERT on GLUE by 0.7 points, ViT on ImageNet-1k by 2.6%, and all baselines on the Long Range Graph Benchmark. We further propose algorithmic optimizations to improve Chimera's efficiency: (1) for Directed Acyclic Graphs, Chimera can be implemented as a linear-time recurrence; (2) for general graphs, a simple mathematical relaxation achieves Transformer's quadratic complexity without domain-specific heuristics. These results validate Chimera's core contribution and support the idea that data topology is a powerful inductive bias across modalities.

  Deep learning-based automatic sleep staging has significantly advanced in performance and plays a crucial role in the diagnosis of sleep disorders. However, those models often struggle to generalize on unseen subjects due to variability in physiological signals, resulting in degraded performance in out-of-distribution scenarios. To address this issue, domain generalization approaches have recently been studied to ensure generalized performance on unseen domains during training. Among those techniques, contrastive learning has proven its validity in learning domain-invariant features by aligning samples of the same class across different domains. Despite its potential, many existing methods are insufficient to extract adequately domain-invariant representations, as they do not explicitly address domain characteristics embedded within the unshared information across samples. In this paper, we posit that mitigating such domain-relevant attributes-referred to as excess domain-relevant information-is key to bridging the domain gap. However, the direct strategy to mitigate the domain-relevant attributes often overfits features at the high-level information, limiting their ability to leverage the diverse temporal and spectral information encoded in the multiple feature levels. To address these limitations, we propose a novel MEASURE (Multi-scalE minimAl SUfficient Representation lEarning) framework, which effectively reduces domain-relevant information while preserving essential temporal and spectral features for sleep stage classification. In our exhaustive experiments on publicly available sleep staging benchmark datasets, SleepEDF-20 and MASS, our proposed method consistently outperformed state-of-the-art methods.

  Solving math problems through verifiable languages such as Lean has significantly impacted both the mathematics and computer science communities. Current state-of-the-art models are often trained with expensive online Reinforcement Learning (RL) or expert iteration. However, these approaches rely on fixed problem sets, which causes inefficient training and limits the model to tackle complex problems. To overcome these limitations, we propose GAR: Generative Adversarial Reinforcement learning, a comprehensive RL training framework that jointly trains the problem composer and solver in an adversarial loop. GAR introduces an implicit curriculum learning mechanism, which aligns task difficulty with the prover's evolving capability. It thereby improves the training efficiency and enables stronger performance of proving advanced theorems. Experiments show that with GAR training, Goedel-Prover-V2-8B and DeepSeek-Prover-V2-7B achieve an average relative improvement in pass@32 of 4.20% on MiniF2F-Test benchmark, while DeepSeek-Prover-V2's pass@32 on ProofNet-Test increases from 22.58% to 25.81%. Beyond formal proving, GAR establishes a general RL paradigm for co-evolution of problem generation and solving under verifiable environments.

  The escalating complexity of network threats and the inherent class imbalance in traffic data present formidable challenges for modern Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS). While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel in modeling topological structures and Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs) are proficient in capturing time-series dependencies, a framework that synergistically integrates both while explicitly addressing data imbalance remains an open challenge. This paper introduces a novel deep learning framework, named Gated Temporal Convolutional Network and Graph (GTCN-G), engineered to overcome these limitations. Our model uniquely fuses a Gated TCN (G-TCN) for extracting hierarchical temporal features from network flows with a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) designed to learn from the underlying graph structure. The core innovation lies in the integration of a residual learning mechanism, implemented via a Graph Attention Network (GAT). This mechanism preserves original feature information through residual connections, which is critical for mitigating the class imbalance problem and enhancing detection sensitivity for rare malicious activities (minority classes). We conducted extensive experiments on two public benchmark datasets, UNSW-NB15 and ToN-IoT, to validate our approach. The empirical results demonstrate that the proposed GTCN-G model achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming existing baseline models in both binary and multi-class classification tasks.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Most recent RL for LLMs (RL4LLM) methods avoid explicit critics, replacing them with average advantage baselines. This shift is largely pragmatic: conventional value functions are computationally expensive to train at LLM scale and often fail under sparse rewards and long reasoning horizons. We revisit this bottleneck from an architectural perspective and introduce Asymmetric Proximal Policy Optimization (AsyPPO), a simple and scalable framework that restores the critics role while remaining efficient in large-model settings. AsyPPO employs a set of lightweight mini-critics, each trained on disjoint prompt shards. This design encourages diversity while preserving calibration, reducing value-estimation bias. Beyond robust estimation, AsyPPO leverages inter-critic uncertainty to refine the policy update: (i) masking advantages in states where critics agree and gradients add little learning signal, and (ii) filtering high-divergence states from entropy regularization, suppressing spurious exploration. After training on open-source data with only 5,000 samples, AsyPPO consistently improves learning stability and performance across multiple benchmarks over strong baselines, such as GRPO, achieving performance gains of more than six percent on Qwen3-4b-Base and about three percent on Qwen3-8b-Base and Qwen3-14b-Base over classic PPO, without additional tricks. These results highlight the importance of architectural innovations for scalable, efficient algorithms.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large vision-language models (LVLMs) achieve strong performance on multimodal tasks, yet they often default to their language prior (LP) -- memorized textual patterns from pre-training while under-utilizing visual evidence. Prior analyses of LP mostly rely on input-output probing, which fails to reveal the internal mechanisms governing when and how vision influences model behavior. To address this gap, we present the first systematic analysis of language prior through the lens of chain-of-embedding, which examines the layer-wise representation dynamics within LVLMs. Our analysis reveals a universal phenomenon: each model exhibits a Visual Integration Point (VIP), a critical layer at which visual information begins to meaningfully reshape hidden representations and influence decoding. Building on this observation, we introduce the Total Visual Integration (TVI) estimator, which aggregates representation distance beyond the VIP to quantify how strongly visual query influences response generation. Across 54 model-dataset combinations spanning 9 contemporary LVLMs and 6 benchmarks, we demonstrate that VIP consistently emerges, and that TVI reliably predicts the strength of language prior. This offers a principled toolkit for diagnosing and understanding language prior in LVLMs.

  Collecting high-quality training examples for language model fine-tuning is expensive, with practical budgets limiting the amount of data that can be procured. We investigate whether example difficulty affects GRPO training effectiveness by comparing selection strategies (easy, medium, hard, random) across multiple models and reasoning tasks. Training on the hardest 10\% of examples (those where the base model fails most often) yields dramatic performance gains up to 47\%, while easy examples produce minimal improvements of 3-15\%. This occurs because GRPO requires outcome variance to generate learning signals; hard examples maintain mixed success/failure outcomes throughout training while easy examples quickly converge to consistent success, eliminating learning opportunities. Moreover, models trained on hard examples show superior out-of-distribution generalization, with only hard-trained models achieving meaningful gains on the AIME2025 benchmark. Our findings provide clear guidance: when budget-constrained, prioritize collecting and annotating examples where your base model struggles, as these drive nearly all learning value in GRPO fine-tuning

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Time Series Forecasting (TSF) faces persistent challenges in modeling intricate temporal dependencies across different scales. Despite recent advances leveraging different decomposition operations and novel architectures based on CNN, MLP or Transformer, existing methods still struggle with static decomposition strategies, fragmented dependency modeling, and inflexible fusion mechanisms, limiting their ability to model intricate temporal dependencies. To explicitly solve the mentioned three problems respectively, we propose a novel Dynamic Multi-Scale Coordination Framework (DMSC) with Multi-Scale Patch Decomposition block (EMPD), Triad Interaction Block (TIB) and Adaptive Scale Routing MoE block (ASR-MoE). Specifically, EMPD is designed as a built-in component to dynamically segment sequences into hierarchical patches with exponentially scaled granularities, eliminating predefined scale constraints through input-adaptive patch adjustment. TIB then jointly models intra-patch, inter-patch, and cross-variable dependencies within each layer's decomposed representations. EMPD and TIB are jointly integrated into layers forming a multi-layer progressive cascade architecture, where coarse-grained representations from earlier layers adaptively guide fine-grained feature extraction in subsequent layers via gated pathways. And ASR-MoE dynamically fuses multi-scale predictions by leveraging specialized global and local experts with temporal-aware weighting. Comprehensive experiments on thirteen real-world benchmarks demonstrate that DMSC consistently maintains state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance and superior computational efficiency for TSF tasks.

  _Yu He, Yingxi Li, Colin White, Ellen Vitercik_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As large language models (LLMs) take on increasingly complex tasks, understanding their algorithmic reasoning abilities has become essential. However, existing evaluations focus on distinct and isolated tasks. We propose a unified diagnostic lens: structural reasoning--understanding and manipulating relationships like order, hierarchy, and connectivity. We introduce DSR-Bench, the first benchmark to systematically evaluate LLM structural reasoning through canonical data structures, which serve as interpretable, algorithmically meaningful abstractions. DSR-Bench spans 20 data structures, 35 operations, and 4,140 synthetically generated problem instances with minimal contamination. The benchmark's hierarchical design pinpoints specific failure modes, while its fully automated evaluation ensures objective and consistent assessment. Benchmarking ten state-of-the-art LLMs reveals critical limitations: the top-performing model scores only 0.498 out of 1 on challenging instances. Three additional evaluation suites reveal further weaknesses: models perform poorly on spatial data and natural language scenarios, and fail to reason over their own generated code. DSR-Bench offers a principled diagnostic tool for structural reasoning, helping expose reasoning bottlenecks and guide the development of more capable and reliable LLMs.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Post-training of large language models is essential for adapting pre-trained language models (PLMs) to align with human preferences and downstream tasks. While PLMs typically exhibit well-calibrated confidence, post-trained language models (PoLMs) often suffer from over-confidence, assigning high confidence to both correct and incorrect outputs, which can undermine reliability in critical applications. A major obstacle in calibrating PoLMs is the scarcity of labeled data for individual downstream tasks. To address this, we propose Disagreement-Aware Confidence Alignment (DACA), a novel unsupervised method to optimize the parameters (e.g., temperature $\tau$) in post-hoc confidence calibration. Our method is motivated by the under-confidence issue caused by prediction disagreement between the PLM and PoLM while aligning their confidence via temperature scaling. Theoretically, the PLM's confidence underestimates PoLM's prediction accuracy on disagreement examples, causing a larger $\tau$ and producing under-confident predictions. DACA mitigates this by selectively using only agreement examples for calibration, effectively decoupling the influence of disagreement. In this manner, our method avoids an overly large $\tau$ in temperature scaling caused by disagreement examples, improving calibration performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, improving the average ECE of open-sourced and API-based LLMs (e.g. GPT-4o) by up to 15.08$\%$ on common benchmarks.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Ensuring data quality at scale remains a persistent challenge for large organizations. Despite recent advances, maintaining accurate and consistent data is still complex, especially when dealing with multiple data modalities. Traditional error detection and correction methods tend to focus on a single modality, typically a table, and often miss cross-modal errors that are common in domains like e-Commerce and healthcare, where image, tabular, and text data co-exist. To address this gap, we take an initial step towards cross-modal error detection in tabular data, by benchmarking several methods. Our evaluation spans four datasets and five baseline approaches. Among them, Cleanlab, a label error detection framework, and DataScope, a data valuation method, perform the best when paired with a strong AutoML framework, achieving the highest F1 scores. Our findings indicate that current methods remain limited, particularly when applied to heavy-tailed real-world data, motivating further research in this area.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Despite the striking successes of deep neural networks trained with gradient-based optimization, these methods differ fundamentally from their biological counterparts. This gap raises key questions about how nature achieves robust, sample-efficient learning at minimal energy costs and solves the credit-assignment problem without backpropagation. We take a step toward bridging contemporary AI and computational neuroscience by studying how neural dynamics can support fully local, distributed learning that scales to simple machine-learning benchmarks. Using tools from statistical mechanics, we identify conditions for the emergence of robust dynamical attractors in random asymmetric recurrent networks. We derive a closed-form expression for the number of fixed points as a function of self-coupling strength, and we reveal a phase transition in their structure: below a critical self-coupling, isolated fixed points coexist with exponentially many narrow clusters showing the overlap-gap property; above it, subdominant yet dense and extensive clusters appear. These fixed points become accessible, including to a simple asynchronous dynamical rule, after an algorithm-dependent self-coupling threshold. Building on this analysis, we propose a biologically plausible algorithm for supervised learning with any binary recurrent network. Inputs are mapped to fixed points of the dynamics, by relaxing under transient external stimuli and stabilizing the resulting configurations via local plasticity. We show that our algorithm can learn an entangled version of MNIST, leverages depth to develop hierarchical representations and increase hetero-association capacity, and is applicable to several architectures. Finally, we highlight the strong connection between algorithm performance and the unveiled phase transition, and we suggest a cortex-inspired alternative to self-couplings for its emergence.

  Recent advances in open-source vision-language models (VLMs) offer new opportunities for understanding complex and subjective multimodal phenomena such as sarcasm. In this work, we evaluate seven state-of-the-art VLMs - BLIP2, InstructBLIP, OpenFlamingo, LLaVA, PaliGemma, Gemma3, and Qwen-VL - on their ability to detect multimodal sarcasm using zero-, one-, and few-shot prompting. Furthermore, we evaluate the models' capabilities in generating explanations to sarcastic instances. We evaluate the capabilities of VLMs on three benchmark sarcasm datasets (Muse, MMSD2.0, and SarcNet). Our primary objectives are twofold: (1) to quantify each model's performance in detecting sarcastic image-caption pairs, and (2) to assess their ability to generate human-quality explanations that highlight the visual-textual incongruities driving sarcasm. Our results indicate that, while current models achieve moderate success in binary sarcasm detection, they are still not able to generate high-quality explanations without task-specific finetuning.

  Large Language Model (LLM)-based Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) have emerged as a powerful paradigm for tackling complex, multi-step tasks across diverse domains. However, despite their impressive capabilities, MAS remain susceptible to adversarial manipulation. Existing studies typically examine isolated attack surfaces or specific scenarios, leaving a lack of holistic understanding of MAS vulnerabilities. To bridge this gap, we introduce PEAR, a benchmark for systematically evaluating both the utility and vulnerability of planner-executor MAS. While compatible with various MAS architectures, our benchmark focuses on the planner-executor structure, which is a practical and widely adopted design. Through extensive experiments, we find that (1) a weak planner degrades overall clean task performance more severely than a weak executor; (2) while a memory module is essential for the planner, having a memory module for the executor does not impact the clean task performance; (3) there exists a trade-off between task performance and robustness; and (4) attacks targeting the planner are particularly effective at misleading the system. These findings offer actionable insights for enhancing the robustness of MAS and lay the groundwork for principled defenses in multi-agent settings.

  Model merging provides a scalable alternative to multi-task training by combining specialized finetuned models through parameter arithmetic, enabling efficient deployment without the need for joint training or access to all task data. While recent methods have shown promise, existing evaluations are limited in both model scale and task diversity, leaving open questions about their applicability to large, domain-specialized LLMs. To tackle the challenges, we introduce MergeBench, a comprehensive evaluation suite designed to assess model merging at scale. MergeBench builds on state-of-the-art open-source language models, including Llama and Gemma families at 2B to 9B scales, and covers five key domains: instruction following, mathematics, multilingual understanding, coding and safety. We standardize finetuning and evaluation protocols, and assess eight representative merging methods across multi-task performance, forgetting and runtime efficiency. Based on extensive experiments, we provide practical guidelines for algorithm selection and share insights showing that model merging tends to perform better on stronger base models, with techniques such as merging coefficient tuning and sparsification improving knowledge retention. However, several challenges remain, including the computational cost on large models, the gap for in-domain performance compared to multi-task models, and the underexplored role of model merging in standard LLM training pipelines. We hope MergeBench provides a foundation for future research to advance the understanding and practical application of model merging. Our project page is at \href{this https URL}{this https URL}.

  Learning the solution operators of PDEs on arbitrary domains is challenging due to the diversity of possible domain shapes, in addition to the often intricate underlying physics. We propose an end-to-end graph neural network (GNN) based neural operator to learn PDE solution operators from data on point clouds in arbitrary domains. Our multi-scale model maps data between input/output point clouds by passing it through a downsampled regional mesh. The approach includes novel elements aimed at ensuring spatio-temporal resolution invariance. Our model, termed RIGNO, is tested on a challenging suite of benchmarks composed of various time-dependent and steady PDEs defined on a diverse set of domains. We demonstrate that RIGNO is significantly more accurate than neural operator baselines and robustly generalizes to unseen resolutions both in space and in time.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Federated Continual Learning (FCL) aims to enable sequentially privacy-preserving model training on streams of incoming data that vary in edge devices by preserving previous knowledge while adapting to new data. Current FCL literature focuses on restricted data privacy and access to previously seen data while imposing no constraints on the training overhead. This is unreasonable for FCL applications in real-world scenarios, where edge devices are primarily constrained by resources such as storage, computational budget, and label rate. We revisit this problem with a large-scale benchmark and analyze the performance of state-of-the-art FCL approaches under different resource-constrained settings. Various typical FCL techniques and six datasets in two incremental learning scenarios (Class-IL and Domain-IL) are involved in our experiments. Through extensive experiments amounting to a total of over 1,000+ GPU hours, we find that, under limited resource-constrained settings, existing FCL approaches, with no exception, fail to achieve the expected performance. Our conclusions are consistent in the sensitivity analysis. This suggests that most existing FCL methods are particularly too resource-dependent for real-world deployment. Moreover, we study the performance of typical FCL techniques with resource constraints and shed light on future research directions in FCL.

  The advancement of Embodied AI heavily relies on large-scale, simulatable 3D scene datasets characterized by scene diversity and realistic layouts. However, existing datasets typically suffer from limitations in data scale or diversity, sanitized layouts lacking small items, and severe object collisions. To address these shortcomings, we introduce \textbf{InternScenes}, a novel large-scale simulatable indoor scene dataset comprising approximately 40,000 diverse scenes by integrating three disparate scene sources, real-world scans, procedurally generated scenes, and designer-created scenes, including 1.96M 3D objects and covering 15 common scene types and 288 object classes. We particularly preserve massive small items in the scenes, resulting in realistic and complex layouts with an average of 41.5 objects per region. Our comprehensive data processing pipeline ensures simulatability by creating real-to-sim replicas for real-world scans, enhances interactivity by incorporating interactive objects into these scenes, and resolves object collisions by physical simulations. We demonstrate the value of InternScenes with two benchmark applications: scene layout generation and point-goal navigation. Both show the new challenges posed by the complex and realistic layouts. More importantly, InternScenes paves the way for scaling up the model training for both tasks, making the generation and navigation in such complex scenes possible. We commit to open-sourcing the data, models, and benchmarks to benefit the whole community.

  Affordances are the potential actions an agent can perform on an object, as observed by a camera. Visual affordance prediction is formulated differently for tasks such as grasping detection, affordance classification, affordance segmentation, and hand pose estimation. This diversity in formulations leads to inconsistent definitions that prevent fair comparisons between methods. In this paper, we propose a unified formulation of visual affordance prediction by accounting for the complete information on the objects of interest and the interaction of the agent with the objects to accomplish a task. This unified formulation allows us to comprehensively and systematically review disparate visual affordance works, highlighting strengths and limitations of both methods and datasets. We also discuss reproducibility issues, such as the unavailability of methods implementation and experimental setups details, making benchmarks for visual affordance prediction unfair and unreliable. To favour transparency, we introduce the Affordance Sheet, a document that details the solution, datasets, and validation of a method, supporting future reproducibility and fairness in the community.

  Effective scene representation is critical for the visual grounding ability of representations, yet existing methods for 3D Visual Grounding are often constrained. They either only focus on geometric and visual cues, or, like traditional 3D scene graphs, lack the multi-dimensional attributes needed for complex reasoning. To bridge this gap, we introduce the Diverse Semantic Map (DSM) framework, a novel scene representation framework that enriches robust geometric models with a spectrum of VLM-derived semantics, including appearance, physical properties, and affordances. The DSM is first constructed online by fusing multi-view observations within a temporal sliding window, creating a persistent and comprehensive world model. Building on this foundation, we propose DSM-Grounding, a new paradigm that shifts grounding from free-form VLM queries to a structured reasoning process over the semantic-rich map, markedly improving accuracy and interpretability. Extensive evaluations validate our approach's superiority. On the ScanRefer benchmark, DSM-Grounding achieves a state-of-the-art 59.06% overall accuracy of IoU@0.5, surpassing others by 10%. In semantic segmentation, our DSM attains a 67.93% F-mIoU, outperforming all baselines, including privileged ones. Furthermore, successful deployment on physical robots for complex navigation and grasping tasks confirms the framework's practical utility in real-world scenarios.

  3D scene understanding has been transformed by open-vocabulary language models that enable interaction via natural language. However, at present the evaluation of these representations is limited to datasets with closed-set semantics that do not capture the richness of language. This work presents OpenLex3D, a dedicated benchmark for evaluating 3D open-vocabulary scene representations. OpenLex3D provides entirely new label annotations for scenes from Replica, ScanNet++, and HM3D, which capture real-world linguistic variability by introducing synonymical object categories and additional nuanced descriptions. Our label sets provide 13 times more labels per scene than the original datasets. By introducing an open-set 3D semantic segmentation task and an object retrieval task, we evaluate various existing 3D open-vocabulary methods on OpenLex3D, showcasing failure cases, and avenues for improvement. Our experiments provide insights on feature precision, segmentation, and downstream capabilities. The benchmark is publicly available at:this https URL.

  Benthic habitat mapping is fundamental for understanding marine ecosystems, guiding conservation efforts, and supporting sustainable resource management. Yet, the scarcity of large, annotated datasets limits the development and benchmarking of machine learning models in this domain. This paper introduces a thorough multi-modal dataset, comprising about a million side-scan sonar (SSS) tiles collected along the coast of Catalonia (Spain), complemented by bathymetric maps and a set of co-registered optical images from targeted surveys using an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). Approximately \num{36000} of the SSS tiles have been manually annotated with segmentation masks to enable supervised fine-tuning of classification models. All the raw sensor data, together with mosaics, are also released to support further exploration and algorithm development. To address challenges in multi-sensor data fusion for AUVs, we spatially associate optical images with corresponding SSS tiles, facilitating self-supervised, cross-modal representation learning. Accompanying open-source preprocessing and annotation tools are provided to enhance accessibility and encourage research. This resource aims to establish a standardized benchmark for underwater habitat mapping, promoting advancements in autonomous seafloor classification and multi-sensor integration.

  While an image is worth more than a thousand words, only a few provide crucial information for a given task and thus should be focused on. In light of this, ideal text-to-image (T2I) retrievers should prioritize specific visual attributes relevant to queries. To evaluate current retrievers on handling attribute-focused queries, we build COCO-Facet, a COCO-based benchmark with 9,112 queries about diverse attributes of interest. We find that CLIP-like retrievers, which are widely adopted due to their efficiency and zero-shot ability, have poor and imbalanced performance, possibly because their image embeddings focus on global semantics and subjects while leaving out other details. Notably, we reveal that even recent Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM)-based, stronger retrievers with a larger output dimension struggle with this limitation. Hence, we hypothesize that retrieving with general image embeddings is suboptimal for performing such queries. As a solution, we propose to use promptable image embeddings enabled by these multimodal retrievers, which boost performance by highlighting required attributes. Our pipeline for deriving such embeddings generalizes across query types, image pools, and base retriever architectures. To enhance real-world applicability, we offer two acceleration strategies: Pre-processing promptable embeddings and using linear approximations. We show that the former yields a 15% improvement in Recall@5 when prompts are predefined, while the latter achieves an 8% improvement when prompts are only available during inference.

  Recently, remarkable progress has been made in Unified Multimodal Models (UMMs), which integrate vision-language generation and understanding capabilities within a single framework. However, a significant gap exists where a model's strong visual understanding often fails to transfer to its visual generation. A model might correctly understand an image based on user instructions, yet be unable to generate a faithful image from text prompts. This phenomenon directly raises a compelling question: Can a model achieve self-improvement by using its understanding module to reward its generation module? To bridge this gap and achieve self-improvement, we introduce SRUM, a self-rewarding post-training framework that can be directly applied to existing UMMs of various designs. SRUM creates a feedback loop where the model's own understanding module acts as an internal ``evaluator'', providing corrective signals to improve its generation module, without requiring additional human-labeled data. To ensure this feedback is comprehensive, we designed a global-local dual reward system. To tackle the inherent structural complexity of images, this system offers multi-scale guidance: a \textbf{global reward} ensures the correctness of the overall visual semantics and layout, while a \textbf{local reward} refines fine-grained, object-level fidelity. SRUM leads to powerful capabilities and shows strong generalization, boosting performance on T2I-CompBench from 82.18 to \textbf{88.37} and on T2I-ReasonBench from 43.82 to \textbf{46.75}. Overall, our work establishes a powerful new paradigm for enabling a UMMs' understanding module to guide and enhance its own generation via self-rewarding.

  Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant capabilities in joint visual and linguistic tasks. However, existing Visual Question Answering (VQA) benchmarks often fail to evaluate deep semantic understanding, particularly in complex domains like visual art analysis. Confined to simple syntactic structures and surface-level attributes, these questions fail to capture the diversity and depth of human visual inquiry. This limitation incentivizes models to exploit statistical shortcuts rather than engage in visual reasoning. To address this gap, we introduce VQArt-Bench, a new, large-scale VQA benchmark for the cultural heritage domain. This benchmark is constructed using a novel multi-agent pipeline where specialized agents collaborate to generate nuanced, validated, and linguistically diverse questions. The resulting benchmark is structured along relevant visual understanding dimensions that probe a model's ability to interpret symbolic meaning, narratives, and complex visual relationships. Our evaluation of 14 state-of-the-art MLLMs on this benchmark reveals significant limitations in current models, including a surprising weakness in simple counting tasks and a clear performance gap between proprietary and open-source models.

  Recent advances in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have established a two-component architecture, where a pre-trained Vision-Language Model (VLM) encodes visual observations and task descriptions, and an action decoder maps these representations to continuous actions. Diffusion models have been widely adopted as action decoders due to their ability to model complex, multimodal action distributions. However, they require multiple iterative denoising steps at inference time or downstream techniques to speed up sampling, limiting their practicality in real-world settings where high-frequency control is crucial. In this work, we present NinA (Normalizing Flows in Action), a fast and expressive alternative to diffusion-based decoders for VLAs. NinA replaces the diffusion action decoder with a Normalizing Flow (NF) that enables one-shot sampling through an invertible transformation, significantly reducing inference time. We integrate NinA into the FLOWER VLA architecture and fine-tune on the LIBERO benchmark. Our experiments show that NinA matches the performance of its diffusion-based counterpart under the same training regime, while achieving substantially faster inference. These results suggest that NinA offers a promising path toward efficient, high-frequency VLA control without compromising performance.

  Recent studies have revealed the potential of training open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) to unleash LLMs' reasoning ability for enhancing vision-language navigation (VLN) performance, and simultaneously mitigate the domain gap between LLMs' training corpus and the VLN task. However, these approaches predominantly adopt straightforward input-output mapping paradigms, causing the mapping learning difficult and the navigational decisions unexplainable. Chain-of-Thought (CoT) training is a promising way to improve both navigational decision accuracy and interpretability, while the complexity of the navigation task makes the perfect CoT labels unavailable and may lead to overfitting through pure CoT supervised fine-tuning. To address these issues, we propose EvolveNav, a novel sElf-improving embodied reasoning paradigm that realizes adaptable and generalizable navigational reasoning for boosting LLM-based vision-language Navigation. Specifically, EvolveNav involves a two-stage training process: (1) Formalized CoT Supervised Fine-Tuning, where we train the model with curated formalized CoT labels to first activate the model's navigational reasoning capabilities, and simultaneously increase the reasoning speed; (2) Self-Reflective Post-Training, where the model is iteratively trained with its own reasoning outputs as self-enriched CoT labels to enhance the supervision diversity. A self-reflective auxiliary task is also designed to encourage the model to learn correct reasoning patterns by contrasting with wrong ones. Experimental results under both task-specific and cross-task training paradigms demonstrate the consistent superiority of EvolveNav over previous LLM-based VLN approaches on various popular benchmarks, including R2R, REVERIE, CVDN, and SOON.

  The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly reshaped the trajectory of the AI revolution. Nevertheless, these LLMs exhibit a notable limitation, as they are primarily adept at processing textual information.

  Scaling Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models on large-scale data offers a promising path to achieving a more generalized driving intelligence. However, VLA models are limited by a ``supervision deficit'': the vast model capacity is supervised by sparse, low-dimensional actions, leaving much of their representational power underutilized. To remedy this, we propose \textbf{DriveVLA-W0}, a training paradigm that employs world modeling to predict future images. This task generates a dense, self-supervised signal that compels the model to learn the underlying dynamics of the driving environment. We showcase the paradigm's versatility by instantiating it for two dominant VLA archetypes: an autoregressive world model for VLAs that use discrete visual tokens, and a diffusion world model for those operating on continuous visual features. Building on the rich representations learned from world modeling, we introduce a lightweight action expert to address the inference latency for real-time deployment. Extensive experiments on the NAVSIM v1/v2 benchmark and a 680x larger in-house dataset demonstrate that DriveVLA-W0 significantly outperforms BEV and VLA baselines. Crucially, it amplifies the data scaling law, showing that performance gains accelerate as the training dataset size increases.

  Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are increasingly applied in real-world scenarios where user-provided images are often imperfect, requiring active image manipulations such as cropping, editing, or enhancement to uncover salient visual cues. Beyond static visual perception, MLLMs must also think with images: dynamically transforming visual content and integrating it with other tools to solve complex tasks. However, this shift from treating vision as passive context to a manipulable cognitive workspace remains underexplored. Most existing benchmarks still follow a think about images paradigm, where images are regarded as static inputs. To address this gap, we introduce IRIS, an Interactive Reasoning with Images and Systems that evaluates MLLMs' ability to perceive, transform, and reason across complex visual-textual tasks under the think with images paradigm. IRIS comprises 1,204 challenging, open-ended vision tasks (603 single-turn, 601 multi-turn) spanning across five diverse domains, each paired with detailed rubrics to enable systematic evaluation. Our evaluation shows that current MLLMs struggle with tasks requiring effective integration of vision and general-purpose tools. Even the strongest model (GPT-5-think) reaches only 18.68% pass rate. We further observe divergent tool-use behaviors, with OpenAI models benefiting from diverse image manipulations while Gemini-2.5-pro shows no improvement. By introducing the first benchmark centered on think with images, IRIS offers critical insights for advancing visual intelligence in MLLMs.

In a field of study like image classification, where data is of utmost importance, we need to find more reliable methods which can overcome the scarcity of data to produce results comparable to previous benchmark results. In most cases, obtaining labeled data is very difficult because of the high cost of human labor and in some cases impossible. The purpose of this paper is to discuss Domain Adaptation and various methods to implement it.

MammoDINO achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple breast cancer screening tasks and generalizes well across five benchmark datasets.

  In recent years, while cloud-based MLLMs such as QwenVL, InternVL, GPT-4o, Gemini, and Claude Sonnet have demonstrated outstanding performance with enormous model sizes reaching hundreds of billions of parameters, they significantly surpass the limitations in memory, power consumption, and computing capacity of edge devices such as mobile phones. This paper introduces AndesVL, a suite of mobile-side MLLMs with 0.6B to 4B parameters based on Qwen3's LLM and various visual encoders. We comprehensively outline the model architectures, training pipeline, and training data of AndesVL, which achieves first-tier performance across a wide range of open-source benchmarks, including fields such as text-rich image understanding, reasoning and math, multi-image comprehension, general VQA, hallucination mitigation, multilingual understanding, and GUI-related tasks when compared with state-of-the-art models of a similar scale. Furthermore, we introduce a 1+N LoRA architecture alongside a Quantization-Aware LoRA Fine-Tuning (QALFT) framework to facilitate efficient task adaptation and model compression during mobile-side deployment of AndesVL. Moreover, utilizing our cache eviction algorithm -- OKV -- along with customized speculative decoding and compression strategies, we achieve a 6.7x peak decoding speedup ratio, up to 30.9% memory reduction, and 1.8 bits-per-weight when deploying AndesVL-4B on MediaTek Dimensity 9500 chips.

  Object detection has long been dominated by traditional coordinate regression-based models, such as YOLO, DETR, and Grounding DINO. Although recent efforts have attempted to leverage MLLMs to tackle this task, they face challenges like low recall rate, duplicate predictions, coordinate misalignment, etc. In this work, we bridge this gap and propose Rex-Omni, a 3B-scale MLLM that achieves state-of-the-art object perception performance. On benchmarks like COCO and LVIS, Rex-Omni attains performance comparable to or exceeding regression-based models (e.g., DINO, Grounding DINO) in a zero-shot setting. This is enabled by three key designs: 1) Task Formulation: we use special tokens to represent quantized coordinates from 0 to 999, reducing the model's learning difficulty and improving token efficiency for coordinate prediction; 2) Data Engines: we construct multiple data engines to generate high-quality grounding, referring, and pointing data, providing semantically rich supervision for training; \3) Training Pipelines: we employ a two-stage training process, combining supervised fine-tuning on 22 million data with GRPO-based reinforcement post-training. This RL post-training leverages geometry-aware rewards to effectively bridge the discrete-to-continuous coordinate prediction gap, improve box accuracy, and mitigate undesirable behaviors like duplicate predictions that stem from the teacher-guided nature of the initial SFT stage. Beyond conventional detection, Rex-Omni's inherent language understanding enables versatile capabilities such as object referring, pointing, visual prompting, GUI grounding, spatial referring, OCR and key-pointing, all systematically evaluated on dedicated benchmarks. We believe that Rex-Omni paves the way for more versatile and language-aware visual perception systems.

  This paper presents a comprehensive study and benchmark on Efficient Perceptual Super-Resolution (EPSR). While significant progress has been made in efficient PSNR-oriented super resolution, approaches focusing on perceptual quality metrics remain relatively inefficient. Motivated by this gap, we aim to replicate or improve the perceptual results of Real-ESRGAN while meeting strict efficiency constraints: a maximum of 5M parameters and 2000 GFLOPs, calculated for an input size of 960x540 pixels. The proposed solutions were evaluated on a novel dataset consisting of 500 test images of 4K resolution, each degraded using multiple degradation types, without providing the original high-quality counterparts. This design aims to reflect realistic deployment conditions and serves as a diverse and challenging benchmark. The top-performing approach manages to outperform Real-ESRGAN across all benchmark datasets, demonstrating the potential of efficient methods in the perceptual domain. This paper establishes the modern baselines for efficient perceptual super resolution.

  Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) swarm systems necessitate efficient collaborative perception mechanisms for diverse operational scenarios. Current Bird's Eye View (BEV)-based approaches exhibit two main limitations: bounding-box representations fail to capture complete semantic and geometric information of the scene, and their performance significantly degrades when encountering undefined or occluded objects. To address these limitations, we propose a novel multi-UAV collaborative occupancy prediction framework. Our framework effectively preserves 3D spatial structures and semantics through integrating a Spatial-Aware Feature Encoder and Cross-Agent Feature Integration. To enhance efficiency, we further introduce Altitude-Aware Feature Reduction to compactly represent scene information, along with a Dual-Mask Perceptual Guidance mechanism to adaptively select features and reduce communication overhead. Due to the absence of suitable benchmark datasets, we extend three datasets for evaluation: two virtual datasets (Air-to-Pred-Occ and UAV3D-Occ) and one real-world dataset (GauUScene-Occ). Experiments results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, significantly outperforming existing collaborative methods while reducing communication overhead to only a fraction of previous approaches.

  Earth observation (EO) satellites produce massive streams of multispectral image time series, posing pressing challenges for storage and transmission. Yet, learned EO compression remains fragmented, lacking publicly available pretrained models and misaligned with advances in compression for natural imagery. Image codecs overlook temporal redundancy, while video codecs rely on motion priors that fail to capture the radiometric evolution of largely static scenes. We introduce TerraCodec (TEC), a family of learned codecs tailored to EO. TEC includes efficient image-based variants adapted to multispectral inputs, as well as a Temporal Transformer model (TEC-TT) that leverages dependencies across time. To overcome the fixed-rate setting of today's neural codecs, we present Latent Repacking, a novel method for training flexible-rate transformer models that operate on varying rate-distortion settings. Trained on Sentinel-2 data, TerraCodec outperforms classical codecs, achieving 3-10x stronger compression at equivalent image quality. Beyond compression, TEC-TT enables zero-shot cloud inpainting, surpassing state-of-the-art methods on the AllClear benchmark. Our results establish bespoke, learned compression algorithms as a promising direction for Earth observation. Code and model weights will be released under a permissive license.

  Drone-based multi-object tracking is essential yet highly challenging due to small targets, severe occlusions, and cluttered backgrounds. Existing RGB-based tracking algorithms heavily depend on spatial appearance cues such as color and texture, which often degrade in aerial views, compromising reliability. Multispectral imagery, capturing pixel-level spectral reflectance, provides crucial cues that enhance object discriminability under degraded spatial conditions. However, the lack of dedicated multispectral UAV datasets has hindered progress in this domain. To bridge this gap, we introduce MMOT, the first challenging benchmark for drone-based multispectral multi-object tracking. It features three key characteristics: (i) Large Scale - 125 video sequences with over 488.8K annotations across eight categories; (ii) Comprehensive Challenges - covering diverse conditions such as extreme small targets, high-density scenarios, severe occlusions, and complex motion; and (iii) Precise Oriented Annotations - enabling accurate localization and reduced ambiguity under aerial perspectives. To better extract spectral features and leverage oriented annotations, we further present a multispectral and orientation-aware MOT scheme adapting existing methods, featuring: (i) a lightweight Spectral 3D-Stem integrating spectral features while preserving compatibility with RGB pretraining; (ii) an orientation-aware Kalman filter for precise state estimation; and (iii) an end-to-end orientation-adaptive transformer. Extensive experiments across representative trackers consistently show that multispectral input markedly improves tracking performance over RGB baselines, particularly for small and densely packed objects. We believe our work will advance drone-based multispectral multi-object tracking research. Our MMOT, code, and benchmarks are publicly available atthis https URL.

  Chest Xray imaging is a widely used diagnostic tool in modern medicine, and its high utilization creates substantial workloads for radiologists. To alleviate this burden, vision language models are increasingly applied to automate Chest Xray radiology report generation (CXRRRG), aiming for clinically accurate descriptions while reducing manual effort. Conventional approaches, however, typically rely on single images, failing to capture the longitudinal context necessary for producing clinically faithful comparison statements. Recently, growing attention has been directed toward incorporating longitudinal data into CXR RRG, enabling models to leverage historical studies in ways that mirror radiologists diagnostic workflows. Nevertheless, existing surveys primarily address single image CXRRRG and offer limited guidance for longitudinal settings, leaving researchers without a systematic framework for model design. To address this gap, this survey provides the first comprehensive review of longitudinal radiology report generation (LRRG). Specifically, we examine dataset construction strategies, report generation architectures alongside longitudinally tailored designs, and evaluation protocols encompassing both longitudinal specific measures and widely used benchmarks. We further summarize LRRG methods performance, alongside analyses of different ablation studies, which collectively highlight the critical role of longitudinal information and architectural design choices in improving model performance. Finally, we summarize five major limitations of current research and outline promising directions for future development, aiming to lay a foundation for advancing this emerging field.

  Recent studies have shown that agent-based systems leveraging large language models (LLMs) for key information retrieval and integration have emerged as a promising approach for long video understanding. However, these systems face two major challenges. First, they typically perform modeling and reasoning on individual frames, struggling to capture the temporal context of consecutive frames. Second, to reduce the cost of dense frame-level captioning, they adopt sparse frame sampling, which risks discarding crucial information. To overcome these limitations, we propose VideoLucy, a deep memory backtracking framework for long video understanding. Inspired by the human recollection process from coarse to fine, VideoLucy employs a hierarchical memory structure with progressive granularity. This structure explicitly defines the detail level and temporal scope of memory at different hierarchical depths. Through an agent-based iterative backtracking mechanism, VideoLucy systematically mines video-wide, question-relevant deep memories until sufficient information is gathered to provide a confident answer. This design enables effective temporal understanding of consecutive frames while preserving critical details. In addition, we introduce EgoMem, a new benchmark for long video understanding. EgoMem is designed to comprehensively evaluate a model's ability to understand complex events that unfold over time and capture fine-grained details in extremely long videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of VideoLucy. Built on open-source models, VideoLucy significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on multiple long video understanding benchmarks, achieving performance even surpassing the latest proprietary models such as GPT-4o.

  Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) aims to infer complete 3D geometry and semantics from monocular images, serving as a crucial capability for camera-based perception in autonomous driving. However, existing SSC methods relying on temporal stacking or depth projection often lack explicit motion reasoning and struggle with occlusions and noisy depth supervision. We propose CurriFlow, a novel semantic occupancy prediction framework that integrates optical flow-based temporal alignment with curriculum-guided depth fusion. CurriFlow employs a multi-level fusion strategy to align segmentation, visual, and depth features across frames using pre-trained optical flow, thereby improving temporal consistency and dynamic object understanding. To enhance geometric robustness, a curriculum learning mechanism progressively transitions from sparse yet accurate LiDAR depth to dense but noisy stereo depth during training, ensuring stable optimization and seamless adaptation to real-world deployment. Furthermore, semantic priors from the Segment Anything Model (SAM) provide category-agnostic supervision, strengthening voxel-level semantic learning and spatial consistency. Experiments on the SemanticKITTI benchmark demonstrate that CurriFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance with a mean IoU of 16.9, validating the effectiveness of our motion-guided and curriculum-aware design for camera-based 3D semantic scene completion.

  With the increasing integration of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) into the medical field, comprehensive evaluation of their performance in various medical domains becomes critical. However, existing benchmarks primarily assess general medical tasks, inadequately capturing performance in nuanced areas like the spine, which relies heavily on visual input. To address this, we introduce SpineBench, a comprehensive Visual Question Answering (VQA) benchmark designed for fine-grained analysis and evaluation of MLLMs in the spinal domain. SpineBench comprises 64,878 QA pairs from 40,263 spine images, covering 11 spinal diseases through two critical clinical tasks: spinal disease diagnosis and spinal lesion localization, both in multiple-choice format. SpineBench is built by integrating and standardizing image-label pairs from open-source spinal disease datasets, and samples challenging hard negative options for each VQA pair based on visual similarity (similar but not the same disease), simulating real-world challenging scenarios. We evaluate 12 leading MLLMs on SpineBench. The results reveal that these models exhibit poor performance in spinal tasks, highlighting limitations of current MLLM in the spine domain and guiding future improvements in spinal medicine applications.

  Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is crucial when deploying deep neural networks in the real world to ensure the reliability and safety of their applications. One main challenge in OOD detection is that neural network models often produce overconfident predictions on OOD data. While some methods using auxiliary OOD datasets or generating fake OOD images have shown promising OOD detection performance, they are limited by the high costs of data collection and training. In this study, we propose a novel and effective OOD detection method that utilizes local background features as fake OOD features for model training. Inspired by the observation that OOD images generally share similar background regions with ID images, the background features are extracted from ID images as simulated OOD visual representations during training based on the local invariance of convolution. Through being optimized to reduce the $L_2$-norm of these background features, the neural networks are able to alleviate the overconfidence issue on OOD data. Extensive experiments on multiple standard OOD detection benchmarks confirm the effectiveness of our method and its wide combinatorial compatibility with existing post-hoc methods, with new state-of-the-art performance achieved from our method.

  We propose two novel loss functions, Multiplicative Loss and Confidence-Adaptive Multiplicative Loss, for semantic segmentation in medical and cellular images. Although Cross Entropy and Dice Loss are widely used, their additive combination is sensitive to hyperparameters and often performs suboptimally, especially with limited data. Medical images suffer from data scarcity due to privacy, ethics, and costly annotations, requiring robust and efficient training objectives. Our Multiplicative Loss combines Cross Entropy and Dice losses multiplicatively, dynamically modulating gradients based on prediction confidence. This reduces penalties for confident correct predictions and amplifies gradients for incorrect overconfident ones, stabilizing optimization. Building on this, Confidence-Adaptive Multiplicative Loss applies a confidence-driven exponential scaling inspired by Focal Loss, integrating predicted probabilities and Dice coefficients to emphasize difficult samples. This enhances learning under extreme data scarcity by strengthening gradients when confidence is low. Experiments on cellular and medical segmentation benchmarks show our framework consistently outperforms tuned additive and existing loss functions, offering a simple, effective, and hyperparameter-free mechanism for robust segmentation under challenging data limitations.

  Micro-expressions are brief, involuntary facial movements that typically last less than half a second and often reveal genuine emotions. Accurately recognizing these subtle expressions is critical for applications in psychology, security, and behavioral analysis. However, micro-expression recognition (MER) remains a challenging task due to the subtle and transient nature of facial cues and the limited availability of annotated data. While dynamic image (DI) representations have been introduced to summarize temporal motion into a single frame, conventional DI-based methods often overlook the distinct characteristics of different temporal phases within a micro-expression. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel dual-stream framework, DIANet, which leverages phase-aware dynamic images - one encoding the onset-to-apex phase and the other capturing the apex-to-offset phase. Each stream is processed by a dedicated convolutional neural network, and a cross-attention fusion module is employed to adaptively integrate features from both streams based on their contextual relevance. Extensive experiments conducted on three benchmark MER datasets (CASME-II, SAMM, and MMEW) demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms conventional single-phase DI-based approaches. The results highlight the importance of modeling temporal phase information explicitly and suggest a promising direction for advancing MER.

  Recent advances in end-to-end (E2E) autonomous driving have been enabled by training on diverse large-scale driving datasets, yet autonomous driving models still struggle in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. The COOOL benchmark targets this gap by encouraging hazard understanding beyond closed taxonomies, and the 2COOOL challenge extends it to generating human-interpretable incident reports. We present a hierarchical reasoning framework for incident report generation from dashcam videos that integrates frame-level captioning, incident frame detection, and fine-grained reasoning within vision-language models (VLMs). We further improve factual accuracy and readability through model ensembling and a Blind A/B Scoring selection protocol. On the official 2COOOL open leaderboard, our method ranks 2nd among 29 teams and achieves the best CIDEr-D score, producing accurate and coherent incident narratives. These results indicate that hierarchical reasoning with VLMs is a promising direction for accident analysis and for broader understanding of safety-critical traffic events.

  _Jiahuan Zhou, Kai Zhu, Zhenyu Cui, Zichen Liu, Xu Zou, Gang Hua_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recently, pre-trained state space models have shown great potential for video classification, which sequentially compresses visual tokens in videos with linear complexity, thereby improving the processing efficiency of video data while maintaining high performance. To apply powerful pre-trained models to downstream tasks, prompt learning is proposed to achieve efficient downstream task adaptation with only a small number of fine-tuned parameters. However, the sequentially compressed visual prompt tokens fail to capture the spatial and temporal contextual information in the video, thus limiting the effective propagation of spatial information within a video frame and temporal information between frames in the state compression model and the extraction of discriminative information. To tackle the above issue, we proposed a State Space Prompting (SSP) method for video understanding, which combines intra-frame and inter-frame prompts to aggregate and propagate key spatiotemporal information in the video. Specifically, an Intra-Frame Gathering (IFG) module is designed to aggregate spatial key information within each frame. Besides, an Inter-Frame Spreading (IFS) module is designed to spread discriminative spatio-temporal information across different frames. By adaptively balancing and compressing key spatio-temporal information within and between frames, our SSP effectively propagates discriminative information in videos in a complementary manner. Extensive experiments on four video benchmark datasets verify that our SSP significantly outperforms existing SOTA methods by 2.76% on average while reducing the overhead of fine-tuning parameters.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Old-photo face restoration poses significant challenges due to compounded degradations such as breakage, fading, and severe blur. Existing pre-trained diffusion-guided methods either rely on explicit degradation priors or global statistical guidance, which struggle with localized artifacts or face color. We propose Self-Supervised Selective-Guided Diffusion (SSDiff), which leverages pseudo-reference faces generated by a pre-trained diffusion model under weak guidance. These pseudo-labels exhibit structurally aligned contours and natural colors, enabling region-specific restoration via staged supervision: structural guidance applied throughout the denoising process and color refinement in later steps, aligned with the coarse-to-fine nature of diffusion. By incorporating face parsing maps and scratch masks, our method selectively restores breakage regions while avoiding identity mismatch. We further construct VintageFace, a 300-image benchmark of real old face photos with varying degradation levels. SSDiff outperforms existing GAN-based and diffusion-based methods in perceptual quality, fidelity, and regional controllability. Code link:this https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  With the excellent representation capabilities of Pre-Trained Models (PTMs), remarkable progress has been made in non-rehearsal Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) research. However, it remains an extremely challenging task due to three conundrums: increasingly large model complexity, non-smooth representation shift during incremental learning and inconsistency between stage-wise sub-problem optimization and global inference. In this work, we propose the Discriminative Representation Learning (DRL) framework to specifically address these challenges. To conduct incremental learning effectively and yet efficiently, the DRL's network, called Incremental Parallel Adapter (IPA) network, is built upon a PTM and increasingly augments the model by learning a lightweight adapter with a small amount of parameter learning overhead in each incremental stage. The adapter is responsible for adapting the model to new classes, it can inherit and propagate the representation capability from the current model through parallel connection between them by a transfer gate. As a result, this design guarantees a smooth representation shift between different incremental stages. Furthermore, to alleviate inconsistency and enable comparable feature representations across incremental stages, we design the Decoupled Anchor Supervision (DAS). It decouples constraints of positive and negative samples by respectively comparing them with the virtual anchor. This decoupling promotes discriminative representation learning and aligns the feature spaces learned at different stages, thereby narrowing the gap between stage-wise local optimization over a subset of data and global inference across all classes. Extensive experiments on six benchmarks reveal that our DRL consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art methods throughout the entire CIL period while maintaining high efficiency in both training and inference phases.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Foundation models are transforming Earth observation, but their potential for hyperspectral crop mapping remains underexplored. This study benchmarks three foundation models for cereal crop mapping using hyperspectral imagery: HyperSigma, DOFA, and Vision Transformers pre-trained on the SpectralEarth dataset (a large multitemporal hyperspectral archive). Models were fine-tuned on manually labeled data from a training region and evaluated on an independent test region. Performance was measured with overall accuracy (OA), average accuracy (AA), and F1-score. HyperSigma achieved an OA of 34.5% (+/- 1.8%), DOFA reached 62.6% (+/- 3.5%), and the SpectralEarth model achieved an OA of 93.5% (+/- 0.8%). A compact SpectralEarth variant trained from scratch achieved 91%, highlighting the importance of model architecture for strong generalization across geographic regions and sensor platforms. These results provide a systematic evaluation of foundation models for operational hyperspectral crop mapping and outline directions for future model development.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) face an inherent trade-off between faithfulness and creativity, as different tasks require varying degrees of associative reasoning. However, existing methods lack the flexibility to modulate this reasoning strength, limiting MLLMs' adaptability across factual and creative scenarios. To bridge this gap, we propose equipping MLLMs with mechanisms that enable flexible control over associative reasoning. We begin by investigating the internal mechanisms underlying associative behavior in MLLMs and find that: (1) middle layers play a pivotal role in shaping model's associative tendencies, (2) modifying representations in these layers effectively regulates associative reasoning strength, and (3) hallucinations can be exploited to derive steering vectors that guide this modulation. Building on these findings, we introduce Flexible Association Control (FlexAC), a lightweight and training-free framework for modulating associative behavior in MLLMs. FlexAC first induces hallucination-guided intermediate representations to encode associative directions. Then, it selects high-association instances to construct effective associative steering vectors, whose strengths are adaptively calibrated to balance creative guidance with output stability. Finally, recognizing the multi-dimensional nature of associative reasoning, FlexAC incorporates task-specific associative vectors derived from a forward pass on a few target-domain samples, enabling models to follow diverse associative directions and better adapt to creative tasks. Notably, our method achieves up to a 5.8x improvement in creativity on Creation-MMBench and a 29% reduction in hallucination rate on CHAIR, surpassing existing baselines and demonstrating its effectiveness in enabling flexible control over associative reasoning in MLLMs. Our code is available atthis https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advancements in multimodal reward models (RMs) have substantially improved post-training for visual generative models. However, current RMs face inherent limitations: (1) visual inputs consume large context budgets, forcing fewer frames and causing loss of fine-grained details; and (2) all visual information is packed into the initial prompt, exacerbating hallucination and forgetting during chain-of-thought reasoning. To overcome these issues, we introduce VideoReward Thinker (VR-Thinker), a thinking-with-image framework that equips the RM with visual reasoning operations (e.g., select frame) and a configurable visual memory window. This allows the RM to actively acquire and update visual evidence within context limits, improving reasoning fidelity and reliability. We activate visual reasoning via a reinforcement fine-tuning pipeline: (i) Cold Start with curated visual chain-of-thought data to distill basic reasoning skills and operation formatting; (ii) select samples whose per-dimension and overall judgments are all correct, then conduct Rejection sampling Fine-Tuning on these high-quality traces to further enhance reasoning; and (iii) apply Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to strengthen reasoning. Our approach delivers state-of-the-art accuracy among open-source models on video preference benchmarks, especially for longer videos: a 7B VR-Thinker achieves 80.5% on VideoGen Reward, 82.3% on GenAI-Bench, and 75.6% on MJ-Bench-Video. These results validate the effectiveness and promise of thinking-with-image multimodal reward modeling.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Image segmentation, the process of dividing images into meaningful regions, is critical in medical applications for accurate diagnosis, treatment planning, and disease monitoring. Although manual segmentation by healthcare professionals produces precise outcomes, it is time-consuming, costly, and prone to variability due to differences in human expertise. Artificial intelligence (AI)-based methods have been developed to address these limitations by automating segmentation tasks; however, they often require large, annotated datasets that are rarely available in practice and frequently struggle to generalize across diverse imaging conditions due to inter-patient variability and rare pathological cases. In this paper, we propose Joint Retrieval Augmented Segmentation (J-RAS), a joint training method for guided image segmentation that integrates a segmentation model with a retrieval model. Both models are jointly optimized, enabling the segmentation model to leverage retrieved image-mask pairs to enrich its anatomical understanding, while the retrieval model learns segmentation-relevant features beyond simple visual similarity. This joint optimization ensures that retrieval actively contributes meaningful contextual cues to guide boundary delineation, thereby enhancing the overall segmentation performance. We validate J-RAS across multiple segmentation backbones, including U-Net, TransUNet, SAM, and SegFormer, on two benchmark datasets: ACDC and M&Ms, demonstrating consistent improvements. For example, on the ACDC dataset, SegFormer without J-RAS achieves a mean Dice score of 0.8708$\pm$0.042 and a mean Hausdorff Distance (HD) of 1.8130$\pm$2.49, whereas with J-RAS, the performance improves substantially to a mean Dice score of 0.9115$\pm$0.031 and a mean HD of 1.1489$\pm$0.30. These results highlight the method's effectiveness and its generalizability across architectures and datasets.

  Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant advances in visual understanding tasks. However, their capacity to comprehend human-centric scenes has rarely been explored, primarily due to the absence of comprehensive evaluation benchmarks that take into account both the human-oriented granular level and higher-dimensional causal reasoning ability. Such high-quality evaluation benchmarks face tough obstacles, given the physical complexity of the human body and the difficulty of annotating granular structures. In this paper, we propose Human-MME, a curated benchmark designed to provide a more holistic evaluation of MLLMs in human-centric scene understanding. Compared with other existing benchmarks, our work provides three key features: 1. Diversity in human scene, spanning 4 primary visual domains with 15 secondary domains and 43 sub-fields to ensure broad scenario coverage. 2. Progressive and diverse evaluation dimensions, evaluating the human-based activities progressively from the human-oriented granular perception to the higher-dimensional reasoning, consisting of eight dimensions with 19,945 real-world image question pairs and an evaluation suite. 3. High-quality annotations with rich data paradigms, constructing the automated annotation pipeline and human-annotation platform, supporting rigorous manual labeling to facilitate precise and reliable model assessment. Our benchmark extends the single-target understanding to the multi-person and multi-image mutual understanding by constructing the choice, short-answer, grounding, ranking and judgment question components, and complex questions of their combination. The extensive experiments on 17 state-of-the-art MLLMs effectively expose the limitations and guide future MLLMs research toward better human-centric image understanding.

  The webpage-to-code task requires models to understand visual representations of webpages and generate corresponding code. However, existing benchmarks primarily focus on static screenshot-to-code tasks, thereby overlooking the dynamic interactions fundamental to real-world web applications. To address this limitation, this paper introduces IWR-Bench, a novel benchmark for evaluating the capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) in interactive webpage reconstruction from video. IWR-Bench comprises 113 meticulously curated tasks from 100 real-world websites, with 1,001 actions and featuring diverse interaction complexities (e.g., web games), visual styles, and domains. Aligning with standard web development practices, each task includes not only user interaction videos but also all crawled static assets (e.g., images, videos). This benchmark evaluates models on two fundamental challenges: comprehensive multi-modal reasoning to infer interaction logic from video and assets, and advanced code generation to translate this logic into functional code. An agent-as-a-judge framework with a comprehensive metric system automatically assesses the functional correctness and visual fidelity of generated webpages. Extensive experiments on 28 LVLMs reveal a significant challenge: the best model achieves an overall score of only 36.35%, as functional correctness (24.39% IFS) lags significantly behind visual fidelity (64.25% VFS). These results highlight critical limitations in current models' ability to reason about temporal dynamics and synthesize event-driven logic, establishing IWR-Bench as a challenging frontier for vision-language research.

  Generating realistic, context-aware two-person motion conditioned on diverse modalities remains a central challenge in computer graphics, animation, and human-computer interaction. We introduce DualFlow, a unified and efficient framework for multi-modal two-person motion generation. DualFlow conditions 3D motion synthesis on diverse inputs, including text, music, and prior motion sequences. Leveraging rectified flow, it achieves deterministic straight-line sampling paths between noise and data, reducing inference time and mitigating error accumulation common in diffusion-based models. To enhance semantic grounding, DualFlow employs a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) module that retrieves motion exemplars using music features and LLM-based text decompositions of spatial relations, body movements, and rhythmic patterns. We use contrastive objective that further strengthens alignment with conditioning signals and introduce synchronization loss that improves inter-person coordination. Extensive evaluations across text-to-motion, music-to-motion, and multi-modal interactive benchmarks show consistent gains in motion quality, responsiveness, and efficiency. DualFlow produces temporally coherent and rhythmically synchronized motions, setting state-of-the-art in multi-modal human motion generation.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present LongLive, a frame-level autoregressive (AR) framework for real-time and interactive long video generation. Long video generation presents challenges in both efficiency and quality. Diffusion and Diffusion-Forcing models can produce high-quality videos but suffer from low efficiency due to bidirectional attention. Causal attention AR models support KV caching for faster inference, but often degrade in quality on long videos due to memory challenges during long-video training. In addition, beyond static prompt-based generation, interactive capabilities, such as streaming prompt inputs, are critical for dynamic content creation, enabling users to guide narratives in real time. This interactive requirement significantly increases complexity, especially in ensuring visual consistency and semantic coherence during prompt transitions. To address these challenges, LongLive adopts a causal, frame-level AR design that integrates a KV-recache mechanism that refreshes cached states with new prompts for smooth, adherent switches; streaming long tuning to enable long video training and to align training and inference (train-long-test-long); and short window attention paired with a frame-level attention sink, shorten as frame sink, preserving long-range consistency while enabling faster generation. With these key designs, LongLive fine-tunes a 1.3B-parameter short-clip model to minute-long generation in just 32 GPU-days. At inference, LongLive sustains 20.7 FPS on a single NVIDIA H100, achieves strong performance on VBench in both short and long videos. LongLive supports up to 240-second videos on a single H100 GPU. LongLive further supports INT8-quantized inference with only marginal quality loss.

  The emergence of advanced multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has significantly enhanced AI assistants' ability to process complex information across modalities. Recently, egocentric videos, by directly capturing user focus, actions, and context in an unified coordinate, offer an exciting opportunity to enable proactive and personalized AI user experiences with MLLMs. However, existing benchmarks overlook the crucial role of gaze as an indicator of user intent. To address this gap, we introduce EgoGazeVQA, an egocentric gaze-guided video question answering benchmark that leverages gaze information to improve the understanding of longer daily-life videos. EgoGazeVQA consists of gaze-based QA pairs generated by MLLMs and refined by human annotators. Our experiments reveal that existing MLLMs struggle to accurately interpret user intentions. In contrast, our gaze-guided intent prompting methods significantly enhance performance by integrating spatial, temporal, and intent-related cues. We further conduct experiments on gaze-related fine-tuning and analyze how gaze estimation accuracy impacts prompting effectiveness. These results underscore the value of gaze for more personalized and effective AI assistants in egocentric settings. Project page:this https URL

  Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been applied to autonomous driving to support decision-making in complex real-world scenarios. However, their training on static, web-sourced image-text pairs fundamentally limits the precise spatiotemporal reasoning required to understand and predict dynamic traffic scenes. We address this critical gap with STRIDE-QA, a large-scale visual question answering (VQA) dataset for physically grounded reasoning from an ego-centric perspective. Constructed from 100 hours of multi-sensor driving data in Tokyo, capturing diverse and challenging conditions, STRIDE-QA is the largest VQA dataset for spatiotemporal reasoning in urban driving, offering 16 million QA pairs over 285K frames. Grounded by dense, automatically generated annotations including 3D bounding boxes, segmentation masks, and multi-object tracks, the dataset uniquely supports both object-centric and ego-centric reasoning through three novel QA tasks that require spatial localization and temporal prediction. Our benchmarks demonstrate that existing VLMs struggle significantly, achieving near-zero scores on prediction consistency. In contrast, VLMs fine-tuned on STRIDE-QA exhibit dramatic performance gains, achieving 55% success in spatial localization and 28% consistency in future motion prediction, compared to near-zero scores from general-purpose VLMs. Therefore, STRIDE-QA establishes a comprehensive foundation for developing more reliable VLMs for safety-critical autonomous systems.

  Both limited annotation and domain shift are significant challenges frequently encountered in medical image segmentation, leading to derivative scenarios like semi-supervised medical (SSMIS), semi-supervised medical domain generalization (Semi-MDG) and unsupervised medical domain adaptation (UMDA). Conventional methods are generally tailored to specific tasks in isolation, the error accumulation hinders the effective utilization of unlabeled data and limits further improvements, resulting in suboptimal performance when these issues occur. In this paper, we aim to develop a generic framework that masters all three tasks. We found that the key to solving the problem lies in how to generate reliable pseudo labels for the unlabeled data in the presence of domain shift with labeled data and increasing the diversity of the model. To tackle this issue, we employ a Diverse Teaching and Label Propagation Network (DTLP-Net) to boosting the Generic Semi-Supervised Medical Image Segmentation. Our DTLP-Net involves a single student model and two diverse teacher models, which can generate reliable pseudo-labels for the student model. The first teacher model decouple the training process with labeled and unlabeled data, The second teacher is momentum-updated periodically, thus generating reliable yet divers pseudo-labels. To fully utilize the information within the data, we adopt inter-sample and intra-sample data augmentation to learn the global and local knowledge. In addition, to further capture the voxel-level correlations, we propose label propagation to enhance the model robust. We evaluate our proposed framework on five benchmark datasets for SSMIS, UMDA, and Semi-MDG tasks. The results showcase notable improvements compared to state-of-the-art methods across all five settings, indicating the potential of our framework to tackle more challenging SSL scenarios.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper addresses the challenge of fully unsupervised image anomaly detection (FUIAD), where training data may contain unlabeled anomalies. Conventional methods assume anomaly-free training data, but real-world contamination leads models to absorb anomalies as normal, degrading detection performance. To mitigate this, we propose a two-stage framework that systematically exploits inherent learning bias in models. The learning bias stems from: (1) the statistical dominance of normal samples, driving models to prioritize learning stable normal patterns over sparse anomalies, and (2) feature-space divergence, where normal data exhibit high intra-class consistency while anomalies display high diversity, leading to unstable model responses. Leveraging the learning bias, stage 1 partitions the training set into subsets, trains sub-models, and aggregates cross-model anomaly scores to filter a purified dataset. Stage 2 trains the final detector on this dataset. Experiments on the Real-IAD benchmark demonstrate superior anomaly detection and localization performance under different noise conditions. Ablation studies further validate the framework's contamination resilience, emphasizing the critical role of learning bias exploitation. The model-agnostic design ensures compatibility with diverse unsupervised backbones, offering a practical solution for real-world scenarios with imperfect training data.

The Online aspect emphasizes the need to process and reason over incrementally acquired observations, while the Spatio-Temporal component requires integrating current visual inputs with historical memory to support dynamic spatial reasoning. OST-Bench better reflects the challenges of real-world embodied perception. Built on an efficient data collection pipeline, OST-Bench consists of 1.4k scenes and 10k question-answer pairs collected from ScanNet, Matterport3D, and ARKitScenes. We evaluate several leading MLLMs on OST-Bench and observe that they fall short on tasks requiring complex spatio-temporal reasoning. Under the online setting, their accuracy declines as the exploration horizon extends and the memory grows. Through further experimental analysis, we identify common error patterns across models and find that both complex clue-based spatial reasoning demands and long-term memory retrieval requirements significantly drop model performance along two separate axes, highlighting the core challenges that must be addressed to improve online embodied reasoning. To foster further research and development in the field, our codes, dataset, and benchmark are available. Our project page is:this https URL

- **[Normalize Filters! Classical Wisdom for Deep Vision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04401)**  `arXiv:2506.04401`  `cs.CV`  
  _Gustavo Perez, Stella X. Yu_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Classical image filters, such as those for averaging or differencing, are carefully normalized to ensure consistency, interpretability, and to avoid artifacts like intensity shifts, halos, or ringing. In contrast, convolutional filters learned end-to-end in deep networks lack such constraints. Although they may resemble wavelets and blob/edge detectors, they are not normalized in the same or any way. Consequently, when images undergo atmospheric transfer, their responses become distorted, leading to incorrect outcomes. We address this limitation by proposing filter normalization, followed by learnable scaling and shifting, akin to batch normalization. This simple yet effective modification ensures that the filters are atmosphere-equivariant, enabling co-domain symmetry. By integrating classical filtering principles into deep learning (applicable to both convolutional neural networks and convolution-dependent vision transformers), our method achieves significant improvements on artificial and natural intensity variation benchmarks. Our ResNet34 could even outperform CLIP by a large margin. Our analysis reveals that unnormalized filters degrade performance, whereas filter normalization regularizes learning, promotes diversity, and improves robustness and generalization.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Worldwide image geolocalization-the task of predicting GPS coordinates from images taken anywhere on Earth-poses a fundamental challenge due to the vast diversity in visual content across regions. While recent approaches adopt a two-stage pipeline of retrieving candidates and selecting the best match, they typically rely on simplistic similarity heuristics and point-wise supervision, failing to model spatial relationships among candidates. In this paper, we propose GeoRanker, a distance-aware ranking framework that leverages large vision-language models to jointly encode query-candidate interactions and predict geographic proximity. In addition, we introduce a multi-order distance loss that ranks both absolute and relative distances, enabling the model to reason over structured spatial relationships. To support this, we curate GeoRanking, the first dataset explicitly designed for geographic ranking tasks with multimodal candidate information. GeoRanker achieves state-of-the-art results on two well-established benchmarks (IM2GPS3K and YFCC4K), significantly outperforming current best methods.

  _Qi Wang, Yanrui Yu, Ye Yuan, Rui Mao, Tianfei Zhou_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) has shown great promise in achieving humanlevel reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), and has recently been extended to MLLMs. Nevertheless, reasoning about videos, which is a fundamental aspect of human intelligence, remains a persistent challenge due to the complex logic, temporal and causal structures inherent in video data. To fill this gap, we propose VideoRFT, a novel approach that extends the RFT paradigm to cultivate human-like video reasoning capabilities in MLLMs. VideoRFT follows the standard two-stage scheme in RFT: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with chain-of-thought (CoT) annotations, followed by reinforcement learning (RL) to improve generalization. A central challenge to achieve this in the video domain lies in the scarcity of large-scale, high-quality video CoT datasets. We address this by building a multi-expert-driven, cognition-inspired CoT curation pipeline. First, we devise a cognition-inspired prompting strategy to elicit a reasoning LLM to generate preliminary CoTs based solely on rich, structured, and literal representations of video content. Subsequently, these CoTs are revised by a MLLM conditioned on the actual video, ensuring visual consistency and reducing visual hallucinations. This pipeline results in two new datasets,this http URL-CoT-102K for SFT and VideoRFT-RL-310K for RL. To further strengthen the RL phase, we introduce a novel semantic-consistency reward that explicitly promotes the alignment between textual reasoning and visual evidence. This reward encourages the model to produce coherent, context-aware reasoning outputs grounded in visual input. Extensive experiments show that VideoRFT achieves state-of-the-art performance on six video reasoning benchmarks.

  _Samuel Stevens, S M Rayeed, Jenna Kline_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The practical application of AI tools for specific computer vision tasks relies on the "small-data regime" of hundreds to thousands of labeled samples. This small-data regime is vital for applications requiring expensive expert annotations, such as ecological monitoring, medical diagnostics or industrial quality control. We find, however, that computer vision research has ignored the small data regime as evaluations increasingly focus on zero- and few-shot learning. We use the Natural World Tasks (NeWT) benchmark to compare multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) and vision-only methods across varying training set sizes. MLLMs exhibit early performance plateaus, while vision-only methods improve throughout the small-data regime, with performance gaps widening beyond 10 training examples. We provide the first comprehensive comparison between these approaches in small-data contexts and advocate for explicit small-data evaluations in AI research to better bridge theoretical advances with practical deployments.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  With the rapid growth of video generative models (VGMs), it is essential to develop reliable and comprehensive automatic metrics for AI-generated videos (AIGVs). Existing methods either use off-the-shelf models optimized for other tasks or rely on human assessment data to train specialized evaluators. These approaches are constrained to specific evaluation aspects and are difficult to scale with the increasing demands for finer-grained and more comprehensive evaluations. To address this issue, this work investigates the feasibility of using multimodal large language models (MLLMs) as a unified evaluator for AIGVs, leveraging their strong visual perception and language understanding capabilities. To evaluate the performance of automatic metrics in unified AIGV evaluation, we introduce a benchmark called UVE-Bench. UVE-Bench collects videos generated by state-of-the-art VGMs and provides pairwise human preference annotations across 15 evaluation aspects. Using UVE-Bench, we extensively evaluate 18 MLLMs. Our empirical results suggest that while advanced MLLMs (e.g., Qwen2VL-72B and InternVL2.5-78B) still lag behind human evaluators, they demonstrate promising ability in unified AIGV evaluation, significantly surpassing existing specialized evaluation methods. Additionally, we conduct an in-depth analysis of key design choices that impact the performance of MLLM-driven evaluators, offering valuable insights for future research on AIGV evaluation.

  Early wildfire detection (EWD) is of the utmost importance to enable rapid response efforts, and thus minimize the negative impacts of wildfire spreads.To this end, we present PYRONEAR-2025, a new dataset composed of both images and videos, allowing for the training and evaluation of smoke plume detection models, including sequential models. The data is sourced from: (i) web-scraped videos of wildfires from public networks of cameras for wildfire detection in-the-wild, (ii) videos from our in-house network of cameras, and (iii) a small portion of synthetic and real images.This dataset includes around 150,000 manual annotations on 50,000 images, covering 640 wildfires, PYRONEAR-2025 surpasses existing datasets in size and diversity. It includes data from France, Spain, Chile and the United States. Finally, it is composed of both images and videos, allowing for the training and evaluation of smoke plume detection models, including sequential models.We ran cross-dataset experiments using a lightweight state-of-the-art object detection model, as the ones used in-real-life, and found out the proposed dataset is particularly challenging, with F1 score of around 70\%, but more stable than existing datasets. Finally, its use in concordance with other public datasets helps to reach higher results overall.Last but not least, the video part of the dataset can be used to train a lightweight sequential model, improving global recall while maintaining precision for earlier detections.[We make both our code and data available online](this https URL).

  _Patrick Haller, Mark Ibrahim, Polina Kirichenko, Levent Sagun, Samuel J. Bell_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  For Large Language Models (LLMs) to be reliable, they must learn robust knowledge that can be generally applied in diverse settings -- often unlike those seen during training. Yet, extensive research has shown that LLM performance can be brittle, with models exhibiting excessive sensitivity to trivial input variations. In this work, we explore whether this brittleness is a direct result of unstable internal knowledge representations. To explore this question, we build on previous work showing that LLM representations encode statement truthfulness -- i.e., true, factual statements can be easily separated from false, inaccurate ones. Specifically, we test the robustness of learned knowledge by evaluating representation separability on samples that have undergone superficial transformations to drive them out-of-distribution (OOD), such as typos or reformulations. By applying semantically-preserving perturbations, we study how separability degrades as statements become more OOD, across four LLM families, five evaluation datasets, and three knowledge probing methods. Our results reveal that internal representations of statement truthfulness collapse as the samples' presentations become less similar to those seen during pre-training. While LLMs can often distinguish between true and false statements when they closely resemble the pre-training data, this ability is highly dependent on the statement's exact surface form. These findings offer a possible explanation for brittle benchmark performance: LLMs may learn shallow, non-robust knowledge representations that allow for only limited generalizability. Our work presents a fundamental challenge for the utility of truthfulness probes, and more broadly, calls for further research on improving the robustness of learned knowledge representations.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) excel at complex reasoning but are traditionally evaluated in static, "frozen world" settings: model responses are assumed to be instantaneous, and the context of a request is presumed to be immutable over the duration of the response. While generally true for short-term tasks, the "frozen world" assumption breaks down in modern reasoning tasks such as assistive programming, where models may take hours to think through problems and code may change dramatically from the time the model starts thinking to the model's final output. In this work, we challenge the frozen world assumption and evaluate LRM robustness under two realistic dynamic scenarios: interruptions, which test the quality of the model's partial outputs on a limited budget, and dynamic context, which tests model adaptation to in-flight changes. Across mathematics and programming benchmarks that require long-form reasoning, static evaluations consistently overestimate robustness: even state-of-the-art LRMs, which achieve high accuracy in static settings, can fail unpredictably when interrupted or exposed to changing context, with performance dropping by up to 60% when updates are introduced late in the reasoning process. Our analysis further reveals several novel failure modes, including reasoning leakage, where models fold the reasoning into their final answer when interrupted; panic, where under time pressure models abandon reasoning entirely and return incorrect answers; and self-doubt, where performance degrades while incorporating updated information.

  _Maike Behrendt, Stefan Sylvius Wagner, Stefan Harmeling_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The [CLS] token in BERT is commonly used as a fixed-length representation for classification tasks, yet prior work has shown that both other tokens and intermediate layers encode valuable contextual information. In this work, we study lightweight extensions to BERT that refine the [CLS] representation by aggregating information across layers and tokens. Specifically, we explore three modifications: (i) max-pooling the [CLS] token across multiple layers, (ii) enabling the [CLS] token to attend over the entire final layer using an additional multi-head attention (MHA) layer, and (iii) combining max-pooling across the full sequence with MHA. Our approach, called MaxPoolBERT, enhances BERT's classification accuracy (especially on low-resource tasks) without requiring new pre-training or significantly increasing model size. Experiments on the GLUE benchmark show that MaxPoolBERT consistently achieves a better performance than the standard BERT base model on low resource tasks of the GLUE benchmark.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have shown strong performance in natural language understanding and generation tasks. However, LLMs continue to encounter challenges with hallucinations, where models generate plausible but incorrect information. While several factors contribute to hallucinations, the impact of ill-formed prompts, prompts with ambiguous wording, incorrect grammar, or incomplete information, was relatively under explored. To address this, we introduce Multi-stage Prompt Refinement (MPR), a framework designed to systematically improve these ill-formed prompts across multiple stages. Each stage addresses specific errors such as punctuation, typographical mistakes, and misuse of key terms, using small language models (SLMs) fine-tuned for these tasks. MPR iteratively enhances the clarity of prompts with additional context and employs a self-reflection mechanism with ranking to prioritize the most relevant input. Experimental results on hallucination benchmarks show that prompts refined by MPR achieve over an 85~\% win rate compared to their original forms, demonstrating its effectiveness in reducing hallucinations and improving LLM output accuracy. Interestingly, we reveal that MPR can be combined with existing post-hoc hallucination mitigation frameworks, further enhancing its versatility. MPR provides a lightweight and adaptable solution for enhancing LLM reliability across various domains.

  _Sunny Yu, Ahmad Jabbar, Robert Hawkins, Dan Jurafsky, Myra Cheng_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Different open-ended generation tasks require different degrees of output diversity. However, current LLMs are often miscalibrated. They collapse to overly homogeneous outputs for creative tasks and hallucinate diverse but incorrect responses for factual tasks. We argue that these two failure modes are unified by, and can both be addressed by, the notion of effective generation space size (GSS) -- the set of semantically distinct outputs a model considers for a prompt. We present GSSBench, a task suite of prompt pairs with ground-truth GSS relationships to assess different metrics and understand where models diverge from desired behavior. We find that hallucination detection metrics, particularly EigenScore, consistently outperform standard diversity and uncertainty quantification metrics, while using only model internals, providing interpretable insights into a model's internal task representations. We demonstrate three applications of GSS: (1) detecting prompt ambiguity and predicting clarification questions for better grounding, (2) interpreting overthinking and underthinking in reasoning models, and (3) steering models to expand their generation space to yield high-quality and diverse outputs.

  Test-time scaling is a family of techniques to improve LLM outputs at inference time by performing extra computation. To the best of our knowledge, test-time scaling has been limited to domains with verifiably correct answers, like mathematics and coding. We transfer test-time scaling to the LeWiDi-2025 tasks to evaluate annotation disagreements. We experiment with three test-time scaling methods: two benchmark algorithms (Model Averaging and Majority Voting), and a Best-of-N sampling method. The two benchmark methods improve LLM performance consistently on the LeWiDi tasks, but the Best-of-N method does not. Our experiments suggest that the Best-of-N method does not currently transfer from mathematics to LeWiDi tasks, and we analyze potential reasons for this gap.

  Large language models (LLMs) have grown more powerful in language generation, producing fluent text and even imitating personal style. Yet, this ability also heightens the risk of identity impersonation. To the best of our knowledge, no prior work has examined personalized machine-generated text (MGT) detection. In this paper, we introduce \dataset, the first benchmark for evaluating detector robustness in personalized settings, built from literary and blog texts paired with their LLM-generated imitations. Our experimental results demonstrate large performance gaps across detectors in personalized settings: some state-of-the-art models suffer significant drops. We attribute this limitation to the \textit{feature-inversion trap}, where features that are discriminative in general domains become inverted and misleading when applied to personalized text. Based on this finding, we propose \method, a simple and reliable way to predict detector performance changes in personalized settings. \method identifies latent directions corresponding to inverted features and constructs probe datasets that differ primarily along these features to evaluate detector dependence. Our experiments show that \method can accurately predict both the direction and the magnitude of post-transfer changes, showing 85\% correlation with the actual performance gaps. We hope that this work will encourage further research on personalized text detection.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Tokenization disparities pose a significant barrier to achieving equitable access to artificial intelligence across linguistically diverse populations. This study conducts a large-scale cross-linguistic evaluation of tokenization efficiency in over 200 languages to systematically quantify computational inequities in large language models (LLMs). Using a standardized experimental framework, we applied consistent preprocessing and normalization protocols, followed by uniform tokenization through the tiktoken library across all language samples. Comprehensive tokenization statistics were collected using established evaluation metrics, including Tokens Per Sentence (TPS) and Relative Tokenization Cost (RTC), benchmarked against English baselines. Our cross-linguistic analysis reveals substantial and systematic disparities: Latin-script languages consistently exhibit higher tokenization efficiency, while non-Latin and morphologically complex languages incur significantly greater token inflation, often 3-5 times higher RTC ratios. These inefficiencies translate into increased computational costs and reduced effective context utilization for underrepresented languages. Overall, the findings highlight structural inequities in current AI systems, where speakers of low-resource and non-Latin languages face disproportionate computational disadvantages. Future research should prioritize the development of linguistically informed tokenization strategies and adaptive vocabulary construction methods that incorporate typological diversity, ensuring more inclusive and computationally equitable multilingual AI systems.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed across high-impact domains, from clinical decision support and legal analysis to hiring and education, making fairness and bias evaluation before deployment critical. However, existing evaluations lack grounding in real-world scenarios and do not account for differences in harm severity, e.g., a biased decision in surgery should not be weighed the same as a stylistic bias in text summarization. To address this gap, we introduce HALF (Harm-Aware LLM Fairness), a deployment-aligned framework that assesses model bias in realistic applications and weighs the outcomes by harm severity. HALF organizes nine application domains into three tiers (Severe, Moderate, Mild) using a five-stage pipeline. Our evaluation results across eight LLMs show that (1) LLMs are not consistently fair across domains, (2) model size or performance do not guarantee fairness, and (3) reasoning models perform better in medical decision support but worse in education. We conclude that HALF exposes a clear gap between previous benchmarking success and deployment readiness.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Drug repurposing plays a critical role in accelerating treatment discovery, especially for complex and rare diseases. Biomedical knowledge graphs (KGs), which encode rich clinical associations, have been widely adopted to support this task. However, existing methods largely overlook common-sense biomedical concept knowledge in real-world labs, such as mechanistic priors indicating that certain drugs are fundamentally incompatible with specific treatments. To address this gap, we propose LLaDR, a Large Language Model-assisted framework for Drug Repurposing, which improves the representation of biomedical concepts within KGs. Specifically, we extract semantically enriched treatment-related textual representations of biomedical entities from large language models (LLMs) and use them to fine-tune knowledge graph embedding (KGE) models. By injecting treatment-relevant knowledge into KGE, LLaDR largely improves the representation of biomedical concepts, enhancing semantic understanding of under-studied or complex indications. Experiments based on benchmarks demonstrate that LLaDR achieves state-of-the-art performance across different scenarios, with case studies on Alzheimer's disease further confirming its robustness and effectiveness.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  With the widespread use of multi-modal Large Language models (MLLMs), safety issues have become a growing concern. Multi-turn dialogues, which are more common in everyday interactions, pose a greater risk than single prompts; however, existing benchmarks do not adequately consider this situation. To encourage the community to focus on the safety issues of these models in multi-turn dialogues, we introduce SafeMT, a benchmark that features dialogues of varying lengths generated from harmful queries accompanied by images. This benchmark consists of 10,000 samples in total, encompassing 17 different scenarios and four jailbreak methods. Additionally, we propose Safety Index (SI) to evaluate the general safety of MLLMs during conversations. We assess the safety of 17 models using this benchmark and discover that the risk of successful attacks on these models increases as the number of turns in harmful dialogues rises. This observation indicates that the safety mechanisms of these models are inadequate for recognizing the hazard in dialogue interactions. We propose a dialogue safety moderator capable of detecting malicious intent concealed within conversations and providing MLLMs with relevant safety policies. Experimental results from several open-source models indicate that this moderator is more effective in reducing multi-turn ASR compared to existed guard models.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  End-to-end Large Speech Language Models (LSLMs) have demonstrated impressive conversational generation abilities, yet consistently fall short of traditional pipeline systems on semantic understanding benchmarks. In this work, we reveal through systematic experimentation that although LSLMs lose some text input performance after speech-text alignment training, the performance gap between speech and text inputs is more pronounced, which we refer to as the modality gap. To understand this gap, we analyze both coarse- and fine-grained text and speech representations. At the coarse-grained level, representations of speech and text in deeper layers are found to be increasingly aligned in direction (cosine similarity), while concurrently diverging in magnitude (Euclidean distance). We further find that representation similarity is strongly correlated with the modality gap. At the fine-grained level, a spontaneous token-level alignment pattern between text and speech representations is observed. Based on this, we introduce the Alignment Path Score to quantify token-level alignment quality, which exhibits stronger correlation with the modality gap. Building on these insights, we design targeted interventions on critical tokens through angle projection and length normalization. These strategies demonstrate the potential to improve correctness for speech inputs. Our study provides the first systematic empirical analysis of the modality gap and alignment mechanisms in LSLMs, offering both theoretical and methodological guidance for future optimization.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Autoformalisation, the task of expressing informal mathematical statements in formal language, is often viewed as a direct translation process. This, however, disregards a critical preceding step: conjecturing. Many mathematical problems cannot be formalised directly without first conjecturing a conclusion such as an explicit answer, or a specific bound. Since Large Language Models (LLMs) already struggle with autoformalisation, and the evaluation of their conjecturing ability is limited and often entangled within autoformalisation or proof, it is particularly challenging to understand its effect. To address this gap, we augment existing datasets to create ConjectureBench, and redesign the evaluation framework and metric specifically to measure the conjecturing capabilities of LLMs both as a distinct task and within the autoformalisation pipeline. Our evaluation of foundational models, including GPT-4.1 and DeepSeek-V3.1, reveals that their autoformalisation performance is substantially overestimated when the conjecture is accounted for during evaluation. However, the conjecture should not be assumed to be provided. We design an inference-time method, Lean-FIRe to improve conjecturing and autoformalisation, which, to the best of our knowledge, achieves the first successful end-to-end autoformalisation of 13 PutnamBench problems with GPT-4.1 and 7 with DeepSeek-V3.1. We demonstrate that while LLMs possess the requisite knowledge to generate accurate conjectures, improving autoformalisation performance requires treating conjecturing as an independent task, and investigating further how to correctly integrate it within autoformalisation. Finally, we provide forward-looking guidance to steer future research toward improving conjecturing, an overlooked step of formal mathematical reasoning.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at both informal and formal (e.g. Lean 4) mathematical reasoning but still struggle with autoformalisation, the task of transforming informal into formal mathematical statements. Autoformalisation helps pair the informal reasoning of LLMs with formal proof assistants which enable machine-verifiable generation and mitigate hallucinations. Yet, the performance of current Math LLMs is constrained by the scarcity of large-scale corpora, particularly those containing pairs of informal and formal statements. Although current models are trained to generate code from natural language instructions, structural and syntactic differences between these and formal mathematics limit effective transfer learning. We propose TopoAlign, a framework that unlocks widely available code repositories as training resources for Math LLMs. TopoAlign decomposes code into docstrings, main functions, and dependency functions, and reassembles these components into analogues that structurally mirror formal statements. This produces structurally aligned code data that can be used for training Math LLMs without requiring additional human annotation. We train two state-of-the-art models, DeepSeek-Math and Herald, and evaluate them on the minif2f, Putnam, and ProofNet benchmarks. TopoAlign provides substantial gains for DeepSeek-Math, improving performance by 17.77% on BEq@10 and 68.82% on typecheck@10. Despite introducing no new mathematical knowledge, our framework achieves gains of 0.12% and 1.09% for Herald on BEq@10 and typecheck@10, respectively, demonstrating that training on aligned code data is beneficial even for specialized models.

  Large language models (LLMs) such as GPT, Gemini, and Claude often appear adept at solving classic logic puzzles--but how much genuine reasoning underlies their answers? Recent evidence suggests that these models frequently rely on memorized templates rather than reasoning from first principles. When puzzles are slightly modified, their performance collapses, revealing a striking fragility. In particular, we asked: Have LLMs addressed these issues? To what extent? How about perturbations to other puzzles? Is there a general way of reformulating the prompt so that the models do better? To examine these things systematically, we introduce PHANTOM RECALL, a benchmark comprising 25 well-known logic puzzles and 149 carefully designed perturbations that preserve reasoning structure but alter superficial details and solutions. We evaluate eleven leading LLMs and identify a recurring failure mode--phantom recall--where models confidently reproduce memorized solutions or spurious rationales that no longer fit the altered scenario. To probe and mitigate this issue, we contribute three tools: (i) an automated logical-equivalence judge to detect reasoning mismatches, (ii) a taxonomy of fine-grained reasoning error categories, and (iii) a prompting-based mitigation framework guided by these categories. Despite near-perfect accuracy on unmodified puzzles, models significantly underperform humans on perturbed ones, exhibiting both phantom recall and over-elaboration. Our findings reveal a crucial limitation: LLMs often fail to re-reason when contextual cues shift--highlighting the gap between linguistic fluency and logical understanding.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  LLMs have advanced text-to-SQL generation, yet monolithic architectures struggle with complex reasoning and schema diversity. We propose AGENTIQL, an agent-inspired multi-expert framework that combines a reasoning agent for question decomposition, a coding agent for sub-query generation, and a refinement step for column selection. An adaptive router further balances efficiency and accuracy by selecting between our modular pipeline and a baseline parser. Several steps in the pipeline can be executed in parallel, making the framework scalable to larger workloads. Evaluated on the Spider benchmark, AGENTIQL improves execution accuracy and interpretability and achieves up to 86.07% EX with 14B models using the Planner&Executor merging strategy. The attained performance is contingent upon the efficacy of the routing mechanism, thereby narrowing the gap to GPT-4-based SOTA (89.65% EX) while using much smaller open-source LLMs. Beyond accuracy, AGENTIQL enhances transparency by exposing intermediate reasoning steps, offering a robust, scalable, and interpretable approach to semantic parsing.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong performance on static medical Question Answering (QA) tasks, yet their reasoning often deteriorates in multi-turn clinical dialogues where patient information is scattered across turns. This paper introduces TriMediQ, a triplet-structured approach that enhances the reasoning reliability of LLMs through explicit knowledge integration. TriMediQ first employs a frozen triplet extraction LLM to convert patient responses into clinically grounded triplets, ensuring factual precision via constrained prompting. These triplets are incorporated into a patient-specific Knowledge Graph (KG), from which a trainable projection module consisting of a graph encoder and a projector captures relational dependencies while keeping all LLM parameters frozen. During inference, the projection module guides multi-hop reasoning over the KG, enabling coherent clinical dialogue understanding. Experiments on two interactive medical QA benchmarks show that TriMediQ achieves up to 10.4\% improvement in accuracy over five existing baselines on the iMedQA dataset. These results demonstrate that structuring patient information as triplets can effectively improve the reasoning capability of LLMs in multi-turn medical QA.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As multimodal LLM-driven agents continue to advance in autonomy and generalization, evaluation based on static datasets can no longer adequately assess their true capabilities in dynamic environments and diverse tasks. Existing LLM-based synthetic data methods are largely designed for LLM training and evaluation, and thus cannot be directly applied to agent tasks that require tool use and interactive capabilities. While recent studies have explored automatic agent task generation with LLMs, most efforts remain limited to text or image analysis, without systematically modeling multi-step interactions in web environments. To address these challenges, we propose Graph2Eval, a knowledge graph-based framework that automatically generates both multimodal document comprehension tasks and web interaction tasks, enabling comprehensive evaluation of agents' reasoning, collaboration, and interactive capabilities. In our approach, knowledge graphs constructed from multi-source external data serve as the task space, where we translate semantic relations into structured multimodal tasks using subgraph sampling, task templates, and meta-paths. A multi-stage filtering pipeline based on node reachability, LLM scoring, and similarity analysis is applied to guarantee the quality and executability of the generated tasks. Furthermore, Graph2Eval supports end-to-end evaluation of multiple agent types (Single-Agent, Multi-Agent, Web Agent) and measures reasoning, collaboration, and interaction capabilities. We instantiate the framework with Graph2Eval-Bench, a curated dataset of 1,319 tasks spanning document comprehension and web interaction scenarios. Experiments show that Graph2Eval efficiently generates tasks that differentiate agent and model performance, revealing gaps in reasoning, collaboration, and web interaction across different settings and offering a new perspective for agent evaluation.

  _Kelli Henry, Steven Xu, Kaitlin Blotske, Moriah Cargile, Erin F. Barreto, Brian Murray, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Purpose: Large language models (LLMs) have proven performance for certain diagnostic tasks, however limited studies have evaluated their consistency in recommending appropriate medication regimens for a given diagnosis. Medication management is a complex task that requires synthesis of drug formulation and complete order instructions for safe use. Here, the performance of GPT 4o, an LLM available with ChatGPT, was tested for three medication management tasks. Methods: GPT-4o performance was tested using three medication tasks: identifying available formulations for a given generic drug name, identifying drug-drug interactions (DDI) for a given medication regimen, and preparing a medication order for a given generic drug name. For each experiment, the models raw text response was captured exactly as returned and evaluated using clinician evaluation in addition to standard LLM metrics, including Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF IDF) vectors, normalized Levenshtein similarity, and Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation (ROUGE 1/ROUGE L F1) between each response and its reference string. Results: For the first task of drug-formulation matching, GPT-4o had 49% accuracy for generic medications being matched to all available formulations, with an average of 1.23 omissions per medication and 1.14 hallucinations per medication. For the second task of drug-drug interaction identification, the accuracy was 54.7% for identifying the DDI pair. For the third task, GPT-4o generated order sentences containing no medication or abbreviation errors in 65.8% of cases. Conclusions: Model performance for basic medication tasks was consistently poor. This evaluation highlights the need for domain-specific training through clinician-annotated datasets and a comprehensive evaluation framework for benchmarking performance.

  Knowledge graphs (KGs) are the cornerstone of the semantic web, offering up-to-date representations of real-world entities and relations. Yet large language models (LLMs) remain largely static after pre-training, causing their internal knowledge to become outdated and limiting their utility in time-sensitive web applications. To bridge this gap between dynamic knowledge and static models, a prevalent approach is to enhance LLMs with KGs. However, prevailing methods typically rely on parameter-invasive fine-tuning, which risks catastrophic forgetting and often degrades LLMs' general capabilities. Moreover, their static integration frameworks cannot keep pace with the continuous evolution of real-world KGs, hindering their deployment in dynamic web environments. To bridge this gap, we introduce KGA (\textit{\underline{K}nowledge \underline{G}raph-guided \underline{A}ttention}), a novel framework that dynamically integrates external KGs into LLMs exclusively at inference-time without any parameter modification. Inspired by research on neuroscience, we rewire the self-attention module by innovatively introducing two synergistic pathways: a \textit{bottom-up knowledge fusion} pathway and a \textit{top-down attention guidance} pathway. The \textit{bottom-up pathway} dynamically integrates external knowledge into input representations via input-driven KG fusion, which is akin to the \textit{stimulus-driven attention process} in the human brain. Complementarily, the \textit{top-down pathway} aims to assess the contextual relevance of each triple through a \textit{goal-directed verification process}, thereby suppressing task-irrelevant signals and amplifying knowledge-relevant patterns. By synergistically combining these two pathways, our method supports real-time knowledge fusion. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks verify KGA's strong fusion performance and efficiency.

  Recent advancements in Large Language Model (LLM) safety have primarily focused on mitigating attacks crafted in natural language or common ciphers (e.g. Base64), which are likely integrated into newer models' safety training. However, we reveal a paradoxical vulnerability: as LLMs advance in reasoning, they inadvertently become more susceptible to novel jailbreaking attacks. Enhanced reasoning enables LLMs to interpret complex instructions and decode complex user-defined ciphers, creating an exploitable security gap. To study this vulnerability, we introduce Attacks using Custom Encryptions (ACE), a jailbreaking technique that encodes malicious queries with novel ciphers. Extending ACE, we introduce Layered Attacks using Custom Encryptions (LACE), which applies multi-layer ciphers to amplify attack complexity. Furthermore, we develop CipherBench, a benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs' accuracy in decoding encrypted benign text. Our experiments reveal a critical trade-off: LLMs that are more capable of decoding ciphers are more vulnerable to LACE, with success rates on gpt-oss-20b escalating from 60% under ACE to 72% with LACE. These findings highlight a critical insight: as LLMs become more adept at deciphering complex user ciphers--many of which cannot be preemptively included in safety training--they become increasingly exploitable.

  We present ACADATA, a high-quality parallel dataset for academic translation, that consists of two subsets: ACAD-TRAIN, which contains approximately 1.5 million author-generated paragraph pairs across 96 language directions and ACAD-BENCH, a curated evaluation set of almost 6,000 translations covering 12 directions. To validate its utility, we fine-tune two Large Language Models (LLMs) on ACAD-TRAIN and benchmark them on ACAD-BENCH against specialized machine-translation systems, general-purpose, open-weight LLMs, and several large-scale proprietary models. Experimental results demonstrate that fine-tuning on ACAD-TRAIN leads to improvements in academic translation quality by +6.1 and +12.4 d-BLEU points on average for 7B and 2B models respectively, while also improving long-context translation in a general domain by up to 24.9% when translating out of English. The fine-tuned top-performing model surpasses the best propietary and open-weight models on academic translation domain. By releasing ACAD-TRAIN, ACAD-BENCH and the fine-tuned models, we provide the community with a valuable resource to advance research in academic domain and long-context translation.

  Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful paradigm to enhance the factuality of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, existing RAG systems often suffer from an unfaithfulness issue, where the model's response contradicts evidence from the retrieved context. Existing approaches to improving contextual faithfulness largely rely on external interventions, such as prompt engineering, decoding constraints, or reward-based fine-tuning. These works treat the LLM as a black box and overlook a crucial question: how does the LLM internally integrate retrieved evidence with its parametric memory, particularly under knowledge conflicts? To address this gap, we conduct a probing-based analysis of hidden-state representations in LLMs and observe three findings: knowledge integration occurs hierarchically, conflicts manifest as latent signals at the sentence level, and irrelevant context is often amplified when aligned with parametric knowledge. Building on these findings, we propose CLEAR (Conflict-Localized and Enhanced Attention for RAG), a framework that (i) decomposes context into fine-grained sentence-level knowledge, (ii) employs hidden-state probing to localize conflicting knowledge, and (iii) introduces conflict-aware fine-tuning to guide the model to accurately integrate retrieved evidence. Extensive experiments across three benchmarks demonstrate that CLEAR substantially improves both accuracy and contextual faithfulness, consistently outperforming strong baselines under diverse conflict conditions.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  While large language models (LLMs) show considerable promise across various fields, they have notable limitations in handling multi-document question answering (Multi-doc QA) tasks. The first challenge is long-range dependency modeling, where LLMs struggle to focus on key information in long texts, which weakens important semantic connections. Second, most LLMs suffer from the ''lost-in-the-middle'' issue, where they have difficulty processing information in the middle of long inputs. Current solutions either truncate global dependencies or demand costly finetuning, ultimately lacking a universal and simple solution for these challenges. To resolve these limitations, we propose Dual-Stage Adaptive Sharpening (DSAS) containing two modules. (i) The Contextual Gate Weighting (CGW) module alleviates ''lost-in-the-middle'' by assessing paragraph relevance through layer-wise attention tracking and position-aware weighting. (ii) The Reciprocal Attention Suppression (RAS) module enhances focus on critical paragraphs by suppressing information exchange between key and irrelevant texts, thus mitigating the limitations in long-range dependency modeling. Notably, DSAS functions as a plug-and-play solution requiring no architectural modifications or extra training parameters. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate DSAS's efficacy across mainstream LLMs (Llama, Qwen, Mistral, and Deepseek), with an average F1-score improvement of 4.2% in Multi-doc QA tasks on Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct. Ablation studies confirm the essential contributions of both the CGW and RAS modules. In addition, detailed discussions in the Appendix further validate the robustness and scalability of DSAS.

  Recent advances in text-to-image (T2I) generation have achieved impressive results, yet existing models often struggle with simple or underspecified prompts, leading to suboptimal image-text alignment, aesthetics, and quality. We propose a prompt rewriting framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to refine user inputs before feeding them into T2I backbones. Our approach introduces a carefully designed reward system and an iterative direct preference optimization (DPO) training pipeline, enabling the rewriter to enhance prompts without requiring supervised fine-tuning data. We evaluate our method across diverse T2I models and benchmarks. Results show that our prompt rewriter consistently improves image-text alignment, visual quality, and aesthetics, outperforming strong baselines. Furthermore, we demonstrate strong transferability by showing that a prompt rewriter trained on one T2I backbone generalizes effectively to others without needing to be retrained. We also systematically study scalability, evaluating how performance gains scale with the capacity of the large LLM used as the rewriter. These findings highlight that prompt rewriting is an effective, scalable, and practical model-agnostic strategy for improving T2I systems. We plan to release the code and trained prompt rewriters soon.

  Enhancing LLMs with the ability to actively search external knowledge is crucial for complex and real-world tasks. Current approaches either rely on prompting to elicit the model's innate agent capabilities, or suffer from performance ceilings and collapse when applying RL to complex interactive tasks, leaving their true agentic potential untapped. To address this, we introduce \textbf{D}ynamic-filter \textbf{S}equence-level \textbf{P}olicy \textbf{O}ptimization (DSPO), an improved RL algorithm designed for robust agent training through sequence-level optimization and dynamic sample filtering. We train our model purely through RL to interleave multi-turn search and reasoning, obviating the need for supervised demonstration data. Across multiple QA benchmarks, our 7B model improves over a comparable previous work by \textbf{34.1\%}, and even outperforms the 14B model from previous work in complex multihop QA such as HotpotQA by nearly \textbf{9\% relative}, maintaining exceptional training stability.

  Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have achieved remarkable performance on complex reasoning tasks by adopting the "think-then-answer" paradigm, which enhances both accuracy and interpretability. However, current LRMs exhibit two critical limitations when processing non-English languages: (1) They often struggle to maintain input-output language consistency; (2) They generally perform poorly with wrong reasoning paths and lower answer accuracy compared to English. These limitations significantly degrade the user experience for non-English speakers and hinder the global deployment of LRMs. To address these limitations, we propose M-Thinker, which is trained by the GRPO algorithm that involves a Language Consistency (LC) reward and a novel Cross-lingual Thinking Alignment (CTA) reward. Specifically, the LC reward defines a strict constraint on the language consistency between the input, thought, and answer. Besides, the CTA reward compares the model's non-English reasoning paths with its English reasoning path to transfer its own reasoning capability from English to non-English languages. Through an iterative RL procedure, our M-Thinker-1.5B/7B models not only achieve nearly 100% language consistency and superior performance on two multilingual benchmarks (MMATH and PolyMath), but also exhibit excellent generalization on out-of-domain languages.

  Reward modeling, crucial for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences, is often bottlenecked by the high cost of preference data. Existing textual data synthesis methods are computationally expensive. We propose a novel framework LENS for synthesizing preference data directly in the LLM's latent embedding space. Our method employs a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to learn a structured latent representation of response embeddings. By performing controlled perturbations in this latent space and decoding back to the embedding space, we efficiently generate diverse, semantically consistent synthetic preference pairs, bypassing costly text generation and annotation. We provide theoretical guarantees that our synthesized pairs approximately preserve original preference ordering and improve reward model generalization. Empirically, our latent-space synthesis significantly outperforms text-based augmentation on standard benchmarks, achieving superior results while being 18x faster in generation and using a 16,000x smaller model. Our work offers a scalable and effective alternative for enhancing reward modeling through efficient data augmentation. Code is publicly available atthis https URL

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as automatic judges to evaluate system outputs in tasks such as summarization, dialogue, and creative writing. A faithful judge should base its verdicts solely on response quality and explicitly acknowledge the factors shaping its decision. We show that current LLM judges fail on both counts by relying on shortcuts introduced in the prompt. Our study uses two evaluation datasets: ELI5, a benchmark for long-form question answering, and LitBench, a recent benchmark for creative writing. Both datasets provide pairwise comparisons, where the evaluator must choose which of two responses is better. From each dataset we construct 100 pairwise judgment tasks and employ two widely used models, GPT-4o and Gemini-2.5-Flash, as evaluators in the role of LLM-as-a-judge. For each pair, we assign superficial cues to the responses, provenance cues indicating source identity (Human, Expert, LLM, or Unknown) and recency cues indicating temporal origin (Old, 1950 vs. New, 2025), while keeping the rest of the prompt fixed. Results reveal consistent verdict shifts: both models exhibit a strong recency bias, systematically favoring new responses over old, as well as a clear provenance hierarchy (Expert > Human > LLM > Unknown). These biases are especially pronounced in GPT-4o and in the more subjective and open-ended LitBench domain. Crucially, cue acknowledgment is rare: justifications almost never reference the injected cues, instead rationalizing decisions in terms of content qualities. These findings demonstrate that current LLM-as-a-judge systems are shortcut-prone and unfaithful, undermining their reliability as evaluators in both research and deployment.

  Large language models (LLMs) increasingly rely on chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting to solve mathematical and logical reasoning tasks. Yet, a central question remains: to what extent are these generated rationales \emph{faithful} to the underlying computations, rather than post-hoc narratives shaped by hints that function as answer shortcuts embedded in the prompt? Following prior work on hinted vs.\ unhinted prompting, we present a systematic study of CoT faithfulness under controlled hint manipulations. Our experimental design spans four datasets (AIME, GSM-Hard, MATH-500, UniADILR), two state-of-the-art models (GPT-4o and Gemini-2-Flash), and a structured set of hint conditions varying in correctness (correct and incorrect), presentation style (sycophancy and data leak), and complexity (raw answers, two-operator expressions, four-operator expressions). We evaluate both task accuracy and whether hints are explicitly acknowledged in the reasoning. Our results reveal three key findings. First, correct hints substantially improve accuracy, especially on harder benchmarks and logical reasoning, while incorrect hints sharply reduce accuracy in tasks with lower baseline competence. Second, acknowledgement of hints is highly uneven: equation-based hints are frequently referenced, whereas raw hints are often adopted silently, indicating that more complex hints push models toward verbalizing their reliance in the reasoning process. Third, presentation style matters: sycophancy prompts encourage overt acknowledgement, while leak-style prompts increase accuracy but promote hidden reliance. This may reflect RLHF-related effects, as sycophancy exploits the human-pleasing side and data leak triggers the self-censoring side. Together, these results demonstrate that LLM reasoning is systematically shaped by shortcuts in ways that obscure faithfulness.

  Large language models (LLMs) excel at complex reasoning but can still exhibit harmful behaviors. Current alignment strategies typically embed safety into model weights, making these controls implicit, static, and difficult to modify. This paper introduces Cognition-of-Thought (CooT), a novel decoding-time framework that equips LLMs with an explicit cognitive self-monitoring loop. CooT couples a standard text Generator with a cognitive Perceiver that continuously monitors the unfolding sequence. The Perceiver uses a structured, precedence-based hierarchy of principles (e.g., safety over obedience) to detect potential misalignments as they arise. When violations are flagged, CooT intervenes by rolling back the generation to the point of error and regenerating under injected guidance that combines universal social priors with context-specific warnings. CooT thus transforms alignment from a fixed property into an explicit, dynamic, and auditable process active during inference, allowing for flexible policy updates without retraining the model. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks and model families confirm that CooT consistently improves safety and social reasoning performance.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) aims to mitigate hallucinations in large language models (LLMs) by grounding responses in retrieved documents. Yet, RAG-based LLMs still hallucinate even when provided with correct and sufficient context. A growing line of work suggests that this stems from an imbalance between how models use external context and their internal knowledge, and several approaches have attempted to quantify these signals for hallucination detection. However, existing methods require extensive hyperparameter tuning, limiting their generalizability. We propose LUMINA, a novel framework that detects hallucinations in RAG systems through context-knowledge signals: external context utilization is quantified via distributional distance, while internal knowledge utilization is measured by tracking how predicted tokens evolve across transformer layers. We further introduce a framework for statistically validating these measurements. Experiments on common RAG hallucination benchmarks and four open-source LLMs show that LUMINA achieves consistently high AUROC and AUPRC scores, outperforming prior utilization-based methods by up to +13% AUROC on HalluRAG. Moreover, LUMINA remains robust under relaxed assumptions about retrieval quality and model matching, offering both effectiveness and practicality.

  Augmenting large language models (LLMs) with browsing tools substantially improves their potential as deep search agents to solve complex, real-world tasks. Yet, open LLMs still perform poorly in such settings due to limited long-horizon reasoning capacity with browsing tools and the lack of sufficiently difficult supervised data. To address these challenges, we present DeepDive to advance deep search agents. First, we propose a strategy to automatically synthesize complex, difficult, and hard-to-find questions from open knowledge graphs. Second, we apply end-to-end multi-turn reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance LLMs' long-horizon reasoning with deep search. To encourage diversity and reduce redundancy, we design a redundancy penalty that discourages repeated similar queries. Experiments show that DeepDive-32B achieves a new open-source competitive result on BrowseComp, outperforming WebSailor, DeepSeek-R1-Browse, and Search-o1. We demonstrate that multi-turn RL training improves deep search ability and significantly contributes to the performance improvements across multiple benchmarks. We observe that DeepDive enables test-time scaling of tool calls and parallel sampling. All datasets, models, and code are publicly available atthis https URL.

  Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs)-based text embedding models primarily focus on data scaling or synthesis, yet limited exploration of training techniques and data quality, thereby constraining performance. In this work, we propose KaLM-Embedding-V2, a series of versatile and compact embedding models, systematically incentivizing advanced embedding capability in LLMs by superior training techniques and high-quality data. For model architecture, we implement the models on a 0.5B compact size with simple mean-pooling to produce fixed-length embeddings and remove the causal attention mask to enable fully bidirectional representation learning. For training techniques, we propose a progressive multi-stage training pipeline: pre-training on weakly supervised large-scale datasets, fine-tuning with supervised high-quality datasets, and contrastive distillation with fine-grained soft signals, integrated with focal-style reweighting and online hard-negative mixing to emphasize difficult samples and enrich hard negatives, respectively. For training data, we curate over 20 categories for pre-training and 100 categories for fine-tuning and contrastive distillation, to improve both performance and generalization, leveraging task-specific instructions, hard-negative mining, and example-based multi-class labeling to ensure high quality. Combining these techniques, our KaLM-Embedding-V2 series achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark, outperforming models of comparable size and rivaling models 3-26x larger, setting a new standard for versatile and compact embedding models under 1B parameters.

  _Priyanka Dey, Yugal Khanter, Aayush Bothra, Jieyu Zhao, Emilio Ferrara_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As LLMs become central to interactive applications, ranging from tutoring to mental health, the ability to express personality in culturally appropriate ways is increasingly important. While recent works have explored personality evaluation of LLMs, they largely overlook the interplay between culture and personality. To address this, we introduce CulturalPersonas, the first large-scale benchmark with human validation for evaluating LLMs' personality expression in culturally grounded, behaviorally rich contexts. Our dataset spans 3,000 scenario-based questions across six diverse countries, designed to elicit personality through everyday scenarios rooted in local values. We evaluate three LLMs, using both multiple-choice and open-ended response formats. Our results show that CulturalPersonas improves alignment with country-specific human personality distributions (over a 20% reduction in Wasserstein distance across models and countries) and elicits more expressive, culturally coherent outputs compared to existing benchmarks. CulturalPersonas surfaces meaningful modulated trait outputs in response to culturally grounded prompts, offering new directions for aligning LLMs to global norms of behavior. By bridging personality expression and cultural nuance, we envision that CulturalPersonas will pave the way for more socially intelligent and globally adaptive LLMs.

  Large language model (LLM) agents have shown impressive capabilities in human language comprehension and reasoning, yet their potential in cybersecurity remains underexplored. We introduce DefenderBench, a practical, open-source toolkit for evaluating language agents across offense, defense, and cybersecurity knowledge-based tasks. DefenderBench includes environments for network intrusion, malicious content detection, code vulnerability analysis, and cybersecurity knowledge assessment. It is intentionally designed to be affordable and easily accessible for researchers while providing fair and rigorous assessment. We benchmark several state-of-the-art (SoTA) and popular LLMs, including both open- and closed-weight models, using a standardized agentic framework. Our results show that Claude-3.7-sonnet performs best with a DefenderBench score of 81.65, followed by Claude-3.7-sonnet-think with 78.40, while the best open-weight model, Llama 3.3 70B, is not far behind with a DefenderBench score of 71.81. DefenderBench's modular design allows seamless integration of custom LLMs and tasks, promoting reproducibility and fair comparisons.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited strong reasoning capabilities and achieved remarkable performance in mathematical problem-solving tasks. Recently, distilling reasoning ability from long-form Chains-of-Thought (CoTs) has emerged as a promising approach for enhancing Small Language Models (SLMs). Existing studies typically treat SLMs as student models and use long-form CoTs as supervision signals for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to transfer reasoning ability. However, such long-form CoT teachers are usually unaware of the student model's capacity, which limits the effective utilization of the provided reasoning traces. To overcome this limitation, we propose errOr-aware self-ReflectION (ORION), a framework that refines teacher CoTs through an Error-Aware Reflection process. ORION enables the student model to construct more tailored teacher CoTs by refining teacher CoTs and incorporating its own reasoning errors. Experiments on multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that ORION consistently improves performance by more than 2% over all baselines. Further analysis reveals that the CoTs constructed by ORION exhibit higher coherence and logical consistency, thereby serving as more effective supervision signals for SFT.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent thinking models trained with reinforcement learning and backward-checking CoT often suffer from overthinking: they produce excessively long outputs even on simple problems, wasting computation. Existing evaluations, based on token efficiency, give an incomplete view as they neglect problem difficulty and intermediate computation costs. We formalize reasoning efficiency as a relative measure between thinking and instruct models, treating instruct models as the minimal-effort baseline. A systematic study across four thinking models and multiple benchmarks reveals two consistent patterns: (i) instruct models achieve higher efficiency overall, and (ii) problem difficulty affects efficiency, with thinking models wasting computation on easy problems but providing value on harder ones. Building on this insight, we propose COTHINK, a simple two-stage pipeline: an instruct model drafts a brief outline, and a thinking model expands it. On GSM8K, MATH500, and AIME24, COTHINK cuts token usage by 21.1% while keeping accuracy on four thinking models, and remains competitive with strong efficiency baselines.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Human social interactions depend on the ability to infer others' unspoken intentions, emotions, and beliefs-a cognitive skill grounded in the psychological concept of Theory of Mind (ToM). While large language models (LLMs) excel in semantic understanding tasks, they struggle with the ambiguity and contextual nuance inherent in human communication. To bridge this gap, we introduce MetaMind, a multi-agent framework inspired by psychological theories of metacognition, designed to emulate human-like social reasoning. MetaMind decomposes social understanding into three collaborative stages: (1) a Theory-of-Mind Agent generates hypotheses about user mental states (e.g., intent, emotion), (2) a Moral Agent refines these hypotheses using cultural norms and ethical constraints, and (3) a Response Agent generates contextually appropriate responses while validating alignment with inferred intent. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance across three challenging benchmarks, with 35.7% improvement in real-world social scenarios and 6.2% gain in ToM reasoning. Notably, it enables LLMs to match human-level performance on key ToM tasks for the first time. Ablation studies confirm the necessity of all components, which showcase the framework's ability to balance contextual plausibility, social appropriateness, and user adaptation. This work advances AI systems toward human-like social intelligence, with applications in empathetic dialogue and culturally sensitive interactions. Code is available atthis https URL.

  Humans understand new combinations of words encountered if they are combinations of words recognized from different contexts, an ability called Compositional Generalization. The COGS benchmark (Kim and Linzen, 2020)arXiv:2010.05465reports 0% accuracy for Transformer models on some structural generalizations. We use (Weiss et al., 2021)arXiv:2106.06981's Restricted Access Sequence Processing (RASP), a Transformer-equivalent programming language, to demonstrate that a Transformer Encoder-Decoder can perform COGS and the semantically equivalent ReCOGS_pos (Wu et al., 2024)arXiv:2303.13716systematically and compositionally: Our RASP models attain near perfect scores on structural generalization splits on COGS (exact match) and ReCOGS_pos (semantic exact match). Our RASP models show the (Re)COGS tasks do not require a hierarchical or tree-structured solution (contrary to (Kim and Linzen, 2020)arXiv:2010.05465, (Yao and Koller, 2022)arXiv:2210.13050, (Murty et al., 2022)arXiv:2211.01288, (Liu et al., 2021)arXiv:2107.06516): we use word-level tokens with an "embedding" layer that tags with possible part of speech, applying just once per encoder pass 19 attention-head compatible flat pattern-matching rules (easily identified with specific training examples), shown using grammar coverage (Zeller et al., 2023) to cover the non-recursive aspects of the input grammar, plus masking out prepositional phrases ("pp noun") and/or sentential complements (cp) when recognizing grammar patterns and extracting nouns related to the main verb in the sentence, and output the next logical form (LF) token (repeating until the LF is complete). The models do not apply recursive, tree-structured rules like "np_det pp np -> np_pp -> np", but score near perfect semantic and string exact match on both COGS and ReCOGS pp recursion, cp recursion using the decoder loop.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce AgentAda, the first LLM-powered analytics agent that can learn and use new analytics skills to extract more specialized insights. Unlike existing methods that require users to manually decide which data analytics method to apply, AgentAda automatically identifies the skill needed from a library of analytical skills to perform the analysis. This also allows AgentAda to use skills that existing LLMs cannot perform out of the box. The library covers a range of methods, including clustering, predictive modeling, and NLP techniques like BERT, which allow AgentAda to handle complex analytics tasks based on what the user needs. AgentAda's dataset-to-insight extraction strategy consists of three key steps: (I) a question generator to generate queries relevant to the user's goal and persona, (II) a hybrid Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-based skill matcher to choose the best data analytics skill from the skill library, and (III) a code generator that produces executable code based on the retrieved skill's documentation to extract key patterns. We also introduce KaggleBench, a benchmark of curated notebooks across diverse domains, to evaluate AgentAda's performance. We conducted a human evaluation demonstrating that AgentAda provides more insightful analytics than existing tools, with 48.78% of evaluators preferring its analyses, compared to 27.67% for the unskilled agent. We also propose a novel LLM-as-a-judge approach that we show is aligned with human evaluation as a way to automate insight quality evaluation at larger scale.

  _Yunbo Long, Yuhan Liu, Liming Xu, Alexandra Brintrup_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The emergence of autonomous Large Language Model (LLM) agents has created a new ecosystem of strategic, agent-to-agent interactions. However, a critical challenge remains unaddressed: in high-stakes, emotion-sensitive domains like debt collection, LLM agents pre-trained on human dialogue are vulnerable to exploitation by adversarial counterparts who simulate negative emotions to derail negotiations. To fill this gap, we first contribute a novel dataset of simulated debt recovery scenarios and a multi-agent simulation framework. Within this framework, we introduce EmoDebt, an LLM agent architected for robust performance. Its core innovation is a Bayesian-optimized emotional intelligence engine that reframes a model's ability to express emotion in negotiation as a sequential decision-making problem. Through online learning, this engine continuously tunes EmoDebt's emotional transition policies, discovering optimal counter-strategies against specific debtor tactics. Extensive experiments on our proposed benchmark demonstrate that EmoDebt achieves significant strategic robustness, substantially outperforming non-adaptive and emotion-agnostic baselines across key performance metrics, including success rate and operational efficiency. By introducing both a critical benchmark and a robustly adaptive agent, this work establishes a new foundation for deploying strategically robust LLM agents in adversarial, emotion-sensitive debt interactions.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit impressive reasoning abilities, yet their reliance on structured step-by-step processing reveals a critical limitation. In contrast, human cognition fluidly adapts between intuitive, heuristic (System 1) and analytical, deliberative (System 2) reasoning depending on the context. This difference between human cognitive flexibility and LLMs' reliance on a single reasoning style raises a critical question: while human fast heuristic reasoning evolved for its efficiency and adaptability, is a uniform reasoning approach truly optimal for LLMs, or does its inflexibility make them brittle and unreliable when faced with tasks demanding more agile, intuitive responses? To answer these questions, we explicitly align LLMs to these reasoning styles by curating a dataset with valid System 1 and System 2 answers, and evaluate their performance across reasoning benchmarks. Our results reveal an accuracy-efficiency trade-off: System 2-aligned models excel in arithmetic and symbolic reasoning, while System 1-aligned models perform better in commonsense reasoning tasks. To analyze the reasoning spectrum, we interpolated between the two extremes by varying the proportion of alignment data, which resulted in a monotonic change in accuracy. A mechanistic analysis of model responses shows that System 1 models employ more definitive outputs, whereas System 2 models demonstrate greater uncertainty. Building on these findings, we further combine System 1- and System 2-aligned models based on the entropy of their generations, without additional training, and obtain a dynamic model that outperforms across nearly all benchmarks. This work challenges the assumption that step-by-step reasoning is always optimal and highlights the need for adapting reasoning strategies based on task demands.

  While reasoning and multilingual capabilities in language models (LMs) have achieved remarkable progress in recent years, their integration into a unified paradigm - multilingual reasoning - is at a nascent stage. Multilingual reasoning requires language models to handle logical reasoning across languages while addressing misalignment, biases, and challenges in low-resource settings. This survey provides the first in-depth review of multilingual reasoning in LMs. In this survey, we provide a systematic overview of existing methods that leverage LMs for multilingual reasoning, specifically outlining the challenges, motivations, and foundational aspects of applying language models to reason across diverse languages. We provide an overview of the standard data resources used for training multilingual reasoning in LMs and the evaluation benchmarks employed to assess their multilingual capabilities. Next, we analyze various state-of-the-art methods and their performance on these benchmarks. Finally, we explore future research opportunities to improve multilingual reasoning in LMs, focusing on enhancing their ability to handle diverse languages and complex reasoning tasks.

  _Xiang Liu, Zhenheng Tang, Peijie Dong, Zeyu Li, Yue Liu, Bo Li, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) require significant GPU memory when processing long texts, with the key value (KV) cache consuming up to 70\% of total memory during inference. Although existing compression methods reduce memory by evaluating the importance of individual tokens, they overlook critical semantic relationships between tokens, resulting in fragmented context and degraded performance. We introduce ChunkKV, which fundamentally reimagines KV cache compression by treating semantic chunks - rather than isolated tokens - as basic compression units. This approach preserves complete linguistic structures and contextual integrity, ensuring that essential meaning is retained even under aggressive compression. Our innovation includes a novel layer-wise index reuse technique that exploits the higher cross-layer similarity of preserved indices in ChunkKV, reducing computational overhead and improving throughput by 26.5\%. Comprehensive evaluations on challenging benchmarks: LongBench, Needle-In-A-HayStack, GSM8K, and JailbreakV demonstrate that ChunkKV outperforms state-of-the-art methods by up to 8.7\% in precision while maintaining the same compression ratio. These results confirm that semantic-aware compression significantly enhances both efficiency and performance for long-context LLM inference, providing a simple yet effective solution to the memory bottleneck problem.

  This paper introduces AFRIDOC-MT, a document-level multi-parallel translation dataset covering English and five African languages: Amharic, Hausa, Swahili, Yor√πb√°, and Zulu. The dataset comprises 334 health and 271 information technology news documents, all human-translated from English to these languages. We conduct document-level translation benchmark experiments by evaluating neural machine translation (NMT) models and large language models (LLMs) for translations between English and these languages, at both the sentence and pseudo-document levels. These outputs are realigned to form complete documents for evaluation. Our results indicate that NLLB-200 achieved the best average performance among the standard NMT models, while GPT-4o outperformed general-purpose LLMs. Fine-tuning selected models led to substantial performance gains, but models trained on sentences struggled to generalize effectively to longer documents. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that some LLMs exhibit issues such as under-generation, repetition of words or phrases, and off-target translations, especially for African languages.

  Embodied decision-making enables agents to translate high-level goals into executable actions through continuous interactions within the physical world, forming a cornerstone of general-purpose embodied intelligence. Large language models (LLMs), with their general decision-making capabilities, offer a promising path to realize this potential; however, LLMs trained solely on language lack exposure to physical environments, limiting their true embodied understanding. To bridge this gap, we propose the concept of a training ground: a comprehensive infrastructure that provides task and scene simulation, embodied interaction, and feedback signals, offering a one-stop solution for LLM acquire genuine embodied decision-making skills. In this work, we present EmboMatrix, the first training ground of its kind, providing massive and diverse tasks with efficient simulation and precise rewards. EmboMatrix incorporates a series of novel techniques: a multi-agent data engine for large-scale task and scene generation, a distributed heterogeneous-hardware system for scalable simulation, and a multi-level reward architecture for precise supervision. Leveraging EmboMatrix, we cultivate EmboBrain, an LLM whose embodied decision-making abilities emerge from extensive embodied interactions. Experiments show that EmboBrain-7B surpasses the 671B DeepSeek-R1 baseline by 9.5\% on two challenging embodied decision-making benchmarks, demonstrating the power of interactive, environment-grounded learning for building truly intelligent embodied agents.

  We present Ax-Prover, a multi-agent system for automated theorem proving in Lean that can solve problems across diverse scientific domains and operate either autonomously or collaboratively with human experts. To achieve this, Ax-Prover approaches scientific problem solving through formal proof generation, a process that demands both creative reasoning and strict syntactic rigor. Ax-Prover meets this challenge by equipping Large Language Models (LLMs), which provide knowledge and reasoning, with Lean tools via the Model Context Protocol (MCP), which ensure formal correctness. To evaluate its performance as an autonomous prover, we benchmark our approach against frontier LLMs and specialized prover models on two public math benchmarks and on two Lean benchmarks we introduce in the fields of abstract algebra and quantum theory. On public datasets, Ax-Prover is competitive with state-of-the-art provers, while it largely outperform them on the new benchmarks. This shows that, unlike specialized systems that struggle to generalize, our tool-based agentic theorem prover approach offers a generalizable methodology for formal verification across diverse scientific domains. Furthermore, we demonstrate Ax-Prover's assistant capabilities in a practical use case, showing how it enabled an expert mathematician to formalize the proof of a complex cryptography theorem.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  AI reasoning agents are already able to solve a variety of tasks by deploying tools, simulating outcomes of multiple hypotheses and reflecting on them. In doing so, they perform computation, although not in the classical sense -- there is no program being executed. Still, if they perform computation, can AI agents be universal? Can chain-of-thought reasoning solve any computable task? How does an AI Agent learn to reason? Is it a matter of model size? Or training dataset size?In this work, we reinterpret the role of learning in the context of AI Agents, viewing them as compute-capable stochastic dynamical systems, and highlight the role of time in a foundational principle for learning to reason. In doing so, we propose a shift from classical inductive learning to transductive learning -- where the objective is not to approximate the distribution of past data, but to capture their algorithmic structure to reduce the time needed to find solutions to new tasks.Transductive learning suggests that, counter to Shannon's theory, a key role of information in learning is about reduction of time rather than reconstruction error. In particular, we show that the optimal speed-up that a universal solver can achieve using past data is tightly related to their algorithmic information. Using this, we show a theoretical derivation for the observed power-law scaling of inference time versus training time. We then show that scaling model size can lead to behaviors that, while improving accuracy on benchmarks, fail any reasonable test of intelligence, let alone super-intelligence: In the limit of infinite space and time, large models can behave as savants, able to brute-force through any task without any insight. Instead, we argue that the key quantity to optimize when scaling reasoning models is time, whose critical role in learning has so far only been indirectly considered.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multimodal reasoning with vision-language models (VLMs) often suffers from hallucinations, as models tend to generate explanations after only a superficial inspection of the image. We present \textbf{CoRGI}(\textbf{C}hain \textbf{o}f \textbf{R}easoning with \textbf{G}rounded \textbf{I}nsights), a framework that enhances reasoning reliability through post-hoc verification of chain-of-thought outputs. Given a VLM-generated rationale, CoRGI decomposes it into step-wise statements, grounds each step in visual evidence, and filters or corrects unsupported claims before producing the final answer. Experiments on five challenging benchmark-VCR, ScienceQA, MMMU, MathVista, and HallusionBenc-demonstrate that CoRGI consistently improves both answer accuracy and explanation faithfulness across multiple VLM backbones, including Qwen-2.5VL, LLaVA-1.6, and Gemma3-12B. Beyond quantitative gains, qualitative analyses further illustrate how the verification process reduces hallucination and strengthens interpretability, suggesting that post-hoc visual grounding is a promising direction for building more trustworthy and transparent multimodal reasoning systems.

  This review surveys the rapid evolution of Meta AI's LLaMA (Large Language Model Meta AI) series - from LLaMA 1 through LLaMA 4 and the specialized parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods developed for these models. We first describe the LLaMA family of foundation models (7B-65B to 288B parameters), their architectures (including native multimodal and Mixtureof-Experts variants), and key performance characteristics. We then describe and discuss the concept of PEFT, which adapts large pre-trained models by updating only a small subset of parameters, and review five PEFT methods that have been applied to LLaMA: LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation), LLaMA-Adapter V1 and V2, LLaMA-Excitor, and QLoRA (Quantized LoRA). We discuss each method's mechanism, parameter savings, and example application to LLaMA (e.g., instruction tuning, multimodal tasks). We provide structured discussion and analysis of model and adapter architectures, parameter counts, and benchmark results (including examples where fine-tuned LLaMA models outperform larger baselines). Finally, we examine real-world use cases where LLaMA-based models and PEFT have been successfully applied (e.g., legal and medical domains), and we discuss ongoing challenges and future research directions (such as scaling to even larger contexts and improving robustness). This survey paper provides a one-stop resource for ML researchers and practitioners interested in LLaMA models and efficient fine-tuning strategies.

  AI agents have been developed for complex real-world tasks from coding to customer service. But AI agent evaluations suffer from many challenges that undermine our understanding of how well agents really work. We introduce the Holistic Agent Leaderboard (HAL) to address these challenges. We make three main contributions. First, we provide a standardized evaluation harness that orchestrates parallel evaluations across hundreds of VMs, reducing evaluation time from weeks to hours while eliminating common implementation bugs. Second, we conduct three-dimensional analysis spanning models, scaffolds, and benchmarks. We validate the harness by conducting 21,730 agent rollouts across 9 models and 9 benchmarks in coding, web navigation, science, and customer service with a total cost of about $40,000. Our analysis reveals surprising insights, such as higher reasoning effort reducing accuracy in the majority of runs. Third, we use LLM-aided log inspection to uncover previously unreported behaviors, such as searching for the benchmark on HuggingFace instead of solving a task, or misusing credit cards in flight booking tasks. We share all agent logs, comprising 2.5B tokens of language model calls, to incentivize further research into agent behavior. By standardizing how the field evaluates agents and addressing common pitfalls in agent evaluation, we hope to shift the focus from agents that ace benchmarks to agents that work reliably in the real world.

  Travel planning is a valuable yet complex task that poses significant challenges even for advanced large language models (LLMs). While recent benchmarks have advanced in evaluating LLMs' planning capabilities, they often fall short in evaluating feasibility, reliability, and engagement of travel plans. We introduce a comprehensive benchmark for travel planning that unifies fine-grained criteria into a single reward, enabling direct comparison of plan quality and seamless integration with reinforcement learning (RL). Our evaluator achieves moderate agreement with travel-expert annotations (60.75%) and outperforms multiple LLM-as-judge baselines. We further release a large-scale dataset of 4,870 queries including 219 real-world, free-form requests for generalization to authentic user intent. Using this benchmark, we conduct extensive experiments across diverse methods and LLMs, including test-time computation, neuro-symbolic approaches, supervised fine-tuning, and RL via GRPO. Across base models, RL generally improves itinerary feasibility over prompt-only and supervised baselines, yielding higher unified reward scores.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Human feedback plays a pivotal role in aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. However, such feedback is often noisy or inconsistent, which can degrade the quality of reward models and hinder alignment. While various automated data cleaning methods have been proposed to mitigate this issue, a systematic evaluation of their effectiveness and generalizability remains lacking. To bridge this gap, we introduce the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating 13 preference data cleaning methods in the context of LLM alignment.

  Accuracy remains a standard metric for evaluating AI systems, but it offers limited insight into how models arrive at their solutions. In this work, we introduce a benchmark based on brainteasers written in long narrative form to probe more deeply into the types of reasoning strategies that models use. Brainteasers are well-suited for this goal because they can be solved with multiple approaches, such as a few-step solution that uses a creative insight or a longer solution that uses more brute force. We investigate large language models (LLMs) across multiple layers of reasoning, focusing not only on correctness but also on the quality and creativity of their solutions. We investigate many aspects of the reasoning process: (1) semantic parsing of the brainteasers into precise mathematical competition style formats; (2) generating solutions from these mathematical forms; (3) self-correcting solutions based on gold solutions; (4) producing step-by-step sketches of solutions; and (5) making use of hints. We find that LLMs are in many cases able to find creative, insightful solutions to brainteasers, suggesting that they capture some of the capacities needed to solve novel problems in creative ways. Nonetheless, there also remain situations where they rely on brute force despite the availability of more efficient, creative solutions, highlighting a potential direction for improvement in the reasoning abilities of LLMs.

  The large language model (LLM) has achieved significant success across various domains. However, the inherent complexity of causal problems and causal theory poses challenges in accurately describing them in natural language, making it difficult for LLM to comprehend and use them effectively. Causal methods are not easily conveyed through natural language, which hinders LLM's ability to apply them accurately. Additionally, causal datasets are typically tabular, while LLM excels in handling natural language data, creating a structural mismatch that impedes effective reasoning with tabular data. To address these challenges, we have equipped the LLM with causal tools within an agent framework, named the Causal Agent, enabling it to tackle causal problems. The causal agent comprises tools, memory, and reasoning modules. In the tool module, the causal agent calls Python code and uses the encapsulated causal function module to align tabular data with natural language. In the reasoning module, the causal agent performs reasoning through multiple iterations with the tools. In the memory module, the causal agent maintains a dictionary instance where the keys are unique names and the values are causal graphs. To verify the causal ability of the causal agent, we established a Causal Tabular Question Answer (CausalTQA) benchmark consisting of four levels of causal problems: variable level, edge level, causal graph level, and causal effect level. CausalTQA consists of about 1.4K for these four levels questions. Causal agent demonstrates remarkable efficacy on the four-level causal problems, with accuracy rates all above 80\%. Through verification on the real-world dataset QRData, the causal agent is 6\% higher than the original SOTA.

  With advancements in reasoning capabilities, Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly employed for automated judgment tasks. While LLMs-as-Judges offer promise in automating evaluations, current approaches often rely on simplistic aggregation methods (e.g., majority voting), which can fail even when individual agents provide correct answers. To address this, we propose a multi-agent debate judge framework where agents collaboratively reason and iteratively refine their responses. We formalize the debate process mathematically, analyzing agent interactions and proving that debate amplifies correctness compared to static ensembles. To enhance efficiency, we introduce a stability detection mechanism that models judge consensus dynamics via a time-varying Beta-Binomial mixture, with adaptive stopping based on distributional similarity (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test). This mechanism models the judges' collective correct rate dynamics using a time-varying mixture of Beta-Binomial distributions and employs an adaptive stopping criterion based on distributional similarity (Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic). Experiments across multiple benchmarks and models demonstrate that our framework improves judgment accuracy over majority voting while maintaining computational efficiency.

  Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated impressive performance on complex tasks, including logical puzzle games that require deriving solutions satisfying all constraints. However, whether they can flexibly apply appropriate rules to varying conditions, particularly when faced with non-canonical game variants, remains an open question. Existing corpora focus on popular puzzles like 9x9 Sudoku, risking overfitting to canonical formats and memorization of solution patterns, which can mask deficiencies in understanding novel rules or adapting strategies to new variants. To address this, we introduce HardcoreLogic, a challenging benchmark of over 5,000 puzzles across 10 games, designed to test the robustness of LRMs on the "long-tail" of logical games. HardcoreLogic systematically transforms canonical puzzles through three dimensions: Increased Complexity (IC), Uncommon Elements (UE), and Unsolvable Puzzles (UP), reducing reliance on shortcut memorization. Evaluations on a diverse set of LRMs reveal significant performance drops, even for models achieving top scores on existing benchmarks, indicating heavy reliance on memorized stereotypes. While increased complexity is the dominant source of difficulty, models also struggle with subtle rule variations that do not necessarily increase puzzle difficulty. Our systematic error analysis on solvable and unsolvable puzzles further highlights gaps in genuine reasoning. Overall, HardcoreLogic exposes the limitations of current LRMs and establishes a benchmark for advancing high-level logical reasoning.

  The surge in user-generated reviews has amplified the need for interpretable models that can provide fine-grained insights. Existing prototype-based models offer intuitive explanations but typically operate at coarse granularity (sentence or document level) and fail to address the multi-label nature of real-world text classification. We propose ProtoSiTex, a semi-interpretable framework designed for fine-grained multi-label text classification. ProtoSiTex employs a dual-phase alternating training strategy: an unsupervised prototype discovery phase that learns semantically coherent and diverse prototypes, and a supervised classification phase that maps these prototypes to class labels. A hierarchical loss function enforces consistency across sub-sentence, sentence, and document levels, enhancing interpretability and alignment. Unlike prior approaches, ProtoSiTex captures overlapping and conflicting semantics using adaptive prototypes and multi-head attention. We also introduce a benchmark dataset of hotel reviews annotated at the sub-sentence level with multiple labels. Experiments on this dataset and two public benchmarks (binary and multi-class) show that ProtoSiTex achieves state-of-the-art performance while delivering faithful, human-aligned explanations, establishing it as a robust solution for semi-interpretable multi-label text classification.

  Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a fundamental paradigm for expanding Large Language Models beyond their static training limitations. However, a critical misalignment exists between current RAG capabilities and real-world information environments. Modern knowledge repositories are inherently multimodal, containing rich combinations of textual content, visual elements, structured tables, and mathematical expressions. Yet existing RAG frameworks are limited to textual content, creating fundamental gaps when processing multimodal documents. We present RAG-Anything, a unified framework that enables comprehensive knowledge retrieval across all modalities. Our approach reconceptualizes multimodal content as interconnected knowledge entities rather than isolated data types. The framework introduces dual-graph construction to capture both cross-modal relationships and textual semantics within a unified representation. We develop cross-modal hybrid retrieval that combines structural knowledge navigation with semantic matching. This enables effective reasoning over heterogeneous content where relevant evidence spans multiple modalities. RAG-Anything demonstrates superior performance on challenging multimodal benchmarks, achieving significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods. Performance gains become particularly pronounced on long documents where traditional approaches fail. Our framework establishes a new paradigm for multimodal knowledge access, eliminating the architectural fragmentation that constrains current systems. Our framework is open-sourced at:this https URL.

  The reliable evaluation of large language models (LLMs) in medical applications remains an open challenge, particularly in capturing the complexity of multi-turn doctor-patient interactions that unfold in real clinical environments. Existing evaluation methods typically rely on post hoc review of full conversation transcripts, thereby neglecting the dynamic, context-sensitive nature of medical dialogues and the evolving informational needs of patients. In this work, we present MedKGEval, a novel multi-turn evaluation framework for clinical LLMs grounded in structured medical knowledge. Our approach introduces three key contributions: (1) a knowledge graph-driven patient simulation mechanism, where a dedicated control module retrieves relevant medical facts from a curated knowledge graph, thereby endowing the patient agent with human-like and realistic conversational behavior. This knowledge graph is constructed by integrating open-source resources with additional triples extracted from expert-annotated datasets; (2) an in-situ, turn-level evaluation framework, where each model response is assessed by a Judge Agent for clinical appropriateness, factual correctness, and safety as the dialogue progresses using a suite of fine-grained, task-specific metrics; (3) a comprehensive multi-turn benchmark of eight state-of-the-art LLMs, demonstrating MedKGEval's ability to identify subtle behavioral flaws and safety risks that are often overlooked by conventional evaluation pipelines. Although initially designed for Chinese and English medical applications, our framework can be readily extended to additional languages by switching the input knowledge graphs, ensuring seamless bilingual support and domain-specific applicability.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) have recently been extended beyond traditional text generation to serve as interactive agents capable of using external tools based on user intent. However, current LLM agents still show limited ability to handle goal-oriented queries, which require decomposing a high-level objective into multiple interdependent API calls with correct planning and execution. Current approaches mainly rely on zero-shot evaluation due to the absence of training data. While proprietary closed-source models such as GPT-4 demonstrate strong reasoning abilities, smaller open-source models struggle to perform complex tool use effectively. Thus, we propose a novel training framework GOAT, which enables fine-tuning of LLM agents in a human annotation-free setting. GOAT automatically constructs synthetic datasets of goal-oriented API execution tasks directly from given API documents, equipping models with the ability to reason over interdependent calls and generate coherent responses. Through extensive experiments, we show that GOAT-trained agents achieve state-of-the-art performance across multiple existing goal-oriented benchmarks. In addition, we introduce GOATBench, a new goal-oriented API execution benchmark, and demonstrate that agents trained with GOAT also excel in this setting. These results highlight GOAT as a practical path toward building robust open-source LLM agents capable of complex reasoning and tool use.

  Current deep-research agents run in a ''fire-and-forget'' mode: once started, they give users no way to fix errors or add expert knowledge during execution. We present ResearStudio, the first open-source framework that places real-time human control at its core. The system follows a Collaborative Workshop design. A hierarchical Planner-Executor writes every step to a live ''plan-as-document,'' a fast communication layer streams each action, file change, and tool call to a web interface. At any moment, the user can pause the run, edit the plan or code, run custom commands, and resume -- switching smoothly between AI-led, human-assisted and human-led, AI-assisted modes. In fully autonomous mode, ResearStudio achieves state-of-the-art results on the GAIA benchmark, surpassing systems like OpenAI's DeepResearch and Manus. These results show that strong automated performance and fine-grained human control can coexist. The full code, protocol, and evaluation scripts are available atthis https URL. We will continue to update the repository to encourage further work on safe and controllable research agents. Our live demo is publicly accessible atthis http URL. We support the development of DeepScientist, which can be accessed atthis https URL.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable abilities in scientific reasoning, yet their reasoning capabilities in materials science remain underexplored. To fill this gap, we introduce MatSciBench, a comprehensive college-level benchmark comprising 1,340 problems that span the essential subdisciplines of materials science. MatSciBench features a structured and fine-grained taxonomy that categorizes materials science questions into 6 primary fields and 31 sub-fields, and includes a three-tier difficulty classification based on the reasoning length required to solve each question. MatSciBench provides detailed reference solutions enabling precise error analysis and incorporates multimodal reasoning through visual contexts in numerous questions. Evaluations of leading models reveal that even the highest-performing model, Gemini-2.5-Pro, achieves under 80% accuracy on college-level materials science questions, highlighting the complexity of MatSciBench. Our systematic analysis of different reasoning strategie--basic chain-of-thought, tool augmentation, and self-correction--demonstrates that no single method consistently excels across all scenarios. We further analyze performance by difficulty level, examine trade-offs between efficiency and accuracy, highlight the challenges inherent in multimodal reasoning tasks, analyze failure modes across LLMs and reasoning methods, and evaluate the influence of retrieval-augmented generation. MatSciBench thus establishes a comprehensive and solid benchmark for assessing and driving improvements in the scientific reasoning capabilities of LLMs within the materials science domain.

  Variant and gene interpretation are fundamental to personalized medicine and translational biomedicine. However, traditional approaches are manual and labor-intensive. Generative language models (LMs) can facilitate this process, accelerating the translation of fundamental research into clinically-actionable insights. While existing benchmarks have attempted to quantify the capabilities of LMs for interpreting scientific data, these studies focus on narrow tasks that do not translate to real-world research. To meet these challenges, we introduce CGBench, a robust benchmark that tests reasoning capabilities of LMs on scientific publications. CGBench is built from ClinGen, a resource of expert-curated literature interpretations in clinical genetics. CGBench measures the ability to 1) extract relevant experimental results following precise protocols and guidelines, 2) judge the strength of evidence, and 3) categorize and describe the relevant outcome of experiments. We test 8 different LMs and find that while models show promise, substantial gaps exist in literature interpretation, especially on fine-grained instructions. Reasoning models excel in fine-grained tasks but non-reasoning models are better at high-level interpretations. Finally, we measure LM explanations against human explanations with an LM judge approach, revealing that models often hallucinate or misinterpret results even when correctly classifying evidence. CGBench reveals strengths and weaknesses of LMs for precise interpretation of scientific publications, opening avenues for future research in AI for clinical genetics and science more broadly.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Although Long Reasoning Models (LRMs) have achieved superior performance on various reasoning scenarios, they often suffer from increased computational costs and inference latency caused by overthinking. To address these limitations, we propose Adaptive Dual Reasoner, which supports two reasoning modes: fast thinking and slow thinking. ADR dynamically alternates between these modes based on the contextual complexity during reasoning. ADR is trained in two stages: (1) A cold-start stage using supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to equip the model with the ability to integrate both fast and slow reasoning modes, in which we construct a hybrid reasoning dataset through a dedicated pipeline to provide large-scale supervision. (2) A reinforcement learning stage for optimizing reasoning effort, where we introduce Entropy-guided Hybrid Policy Optimization EHPO, an RL training framework employing an entropy-guided dynamic rollout strategy for branching at high-entropy units and a difficulty-aware penalty to balance fast and slow reasoning. Across challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks, ADR achieves an effective balance between reasoning performance and efficiency among state-of-the-art approaches. Specifically, ADR yields a performance gain of up to 6.1%, while reducing the reasoning output length by 49.5% to 59.3%.

  Concise reasoning in large language models seeks to generate only essential intermediate steps needed to arrive at a final answer, thereby alleviating issues of overthinking. Most proposed approaches hinge on carefully hand-crafted heuristics, struggling to balance concision with performance, often failing to adapt across domains and model scales. In this work, we address these challenges by introducing a principled and pragmatic strategy, performance-aware length updating (PALU). As a principled algorithm, PALU formulates concise reasoning as a constrained optimization problem, minimizing response length subject to a performance constraint, and then applies Lagrangian optimization to convert it into a tractable unconstrained problem. As a pragmatic solution, PALU streamlines complicated update rules through three approximations: (i) estimating performance with off-policy rollouts, (ii) truncating the Lagrange multiplier to two extremes, and (iii) replacing gradient-based updates with quantile-driven length adjustments. PALU reduces output length by 65% while improving accuracy by 15% when applied to DeepSeek-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, averaged over five benchmarks, outperforming a range of alternative methods. Furthermore, PALU is demonstrated to adapt across both domain (logic, STEM and math) and model scale (1.5B, 7B, 14B) entrenching the algorithm as a practical and effective concise reasoning approach.

  The increasing integration of Industrial IoT (IIoT) exposes critical cyber-physical systems to sophisticated, multi-stage attacks that elude traditional defenses lacking contextual awareness. This paper introduces L2M-AID, a novel framework for Autonomous Industrial Defense using LLM-empowered, Multi-agent reinforcement learning. L2M-AID orchestrates a team of collaborative agents, each driven by a Large Language Model (LLM), to achieve adaptive and resilient security. The core innovation lies in the deep fusion of two AI paradigms: we leverage an LLM as a semantic bridge to translate vast, unstructured telemetry into a rich, contextual state representation, enabling agents to reason about adversary intent rather than merely matching patterns. This semantically-aware state empowers a Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) algorithm, MAPPO, to learn complex cooperative strategies. The MARL reward function is uniquely engineered to balance security objectives (threat neutralization) with operational imperatives, explicitly penalizing actions that disrupt physical process stability. To validate our approach, we conduct extensive experiments on the benchmark SWaT dataset and a novel synthetic dataset generated based on the MITRE ATT&CK for ICS framework. Results demonstrate that L2M-AID significantly outperforms traditional IDS, deep learning anomaly detectors, and single-agent RL baselines across key metrics, achieving a 97.2% detection rate while reducing false positives by over 80% and improving response times by a factor of four. Crucially, it demonstrates superior performance in maintaining physical process stability, presenting a robust new paradigm for securing critical national infrastructure.

  Operations research (OR) is a core methodology that supports complex system decision-making, with broad applications in transportation, supply chain management, and production scheduling. However, traditional approaches that rely on expert-driven modeling and manual parameter tuning often struggle with large-scale, dynamic, and multi-constraint problems, limiting scalability and real-time applicability. Large language models (LLMs), with capabilities in semantic understanding, structured generation, and reasoning control, offer new opportunities to overcome these challenges. They can translate natural language problem descriptions into mathematical models or executable code, generate heuristics, evolve algorithms, and directly solve optimization tasks. This shifts the paradigm from human-driven processes to intelligent human-AI collaboration. This paper systematically reviews progress in applying LLMs to OR, categorizing existing methods into three pathways: automatic modeling, auxiliary optimization, and direct solving. It also examines evaluation benchmarks and domain-specific applications, and highlights key challenges, including unstable semantic-to-structure mapping, fragmented research, limited generalization and interpretability, insufficient evaluation systems, and barriers to industrial deployment. Finally, it outlines potential research directions. Overall, LLMs demonstrate strong potential to reshape the OR paradigm by enhancing interpretability, adaptability, and scalability, paving the way for next-generation intelligent optimization systems.

  Agentic AI has significantly extended the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by enabling complex reasoning and tool use. However, most existing frameworks are tailored to domains such as mathematics, coding, or web automation, and fall short on geospatial tasks that require spatial reasoning, multi-hop planning, and real-time map interaction. To address these challenges, we introduce MapAgent, a hierarchical multi-agent plug-and-play framework with customized toolsets and agentic scaffolds for map-integrated geospatial reasoning. Unlike existing flat agent-based approaches that treat tools uniformly-often overwhelming the LLM when handling similar but subtly different geospatial APIs-MapAgent decouples planning from execution. A high-level planner decomposes complex queries into subgoals, which are routed to specialized modules. For tool-heavy modules-such as map-based services-we then design a dedicated map-tool agent that efficiently orchestrates related APIs adaptively in parallel to effectively fetch geospatial data relevant for the query, while simpler modules (e.g., solution generation or answer extraction) operate without additional agent overhead. This hierarchical design reduces cognitive load, improves tool selection accuracy, and enables precise coordination across similar APIs. We evaluate MapAgent on four diverse geospatial benchmarks-MapEval-Textual, MapEval-API, MapEval-Visual, and MapQA-and demonstrate substantial gains over state-of-the-art tool-augmented and agentic baselines. We open-source our framwork atthis https URL.
