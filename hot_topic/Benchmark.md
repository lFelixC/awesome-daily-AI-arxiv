- **[GraphEQA: Using 3D Semantic Scene Graphs for Real-time Embodied Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14480)**  `arXiv:2412.14480`  `cs.RO` `cs.CL` `cs.CV` `cs.LG`

  In Embodied Question Answering (EQA), agents must explore and develop a semantic understanding of an unseen environment to answer a situated question with confidence. This problem remains challenging in robotics, due to the difficulties in obtaining useful semantic representations, updating these representations online, and leveraging prior world knowledge for efficient planning and exploration. To address these limitations, we propose GraphEQA, a novel approach that utilizes real-time 3D metric-semantic scene graphs (3DSGs) and task relevant images as multi-modal memory for grounding Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to perform EQA tasks in unseen environments. We employ a hierarchical planning approach that exploits the hierarchical nature of 3DSGs for structured planning and semantics-guided exploration. We evaluate GraphEQA in simulation on two benchmark datasets, HM-EQA and OpenEQA, and demonstrate that it outperforms key baselines by completing EQA tasks with higher success rates and fewer planning steps. We further demonstrate GraphEQA in multiple real-world home and office environments.

  Imitation learning has been a trend recently, yet training a generalist agent across multiple tasks still requires large-scale expert demonstrations, which are costly and labor-intensive to collect. To address the challenge of limited supervision, we propose Self-Evolved Imitation Learning (SEIL), a framework that progressively improves a few-shot model through simulator interactions. The model first attempts tasksin the simulator, from which successful trajectories are collected as new demonstrations for iterative refinement. To enhance the diversity of these demonstrations, SEIL employs dual-level augmentation: (i) Model-level, using an Exponential Moving Average (EMA) model to collaborate with the primary model, and (ii) Environment-level, introducing slight variations in initial object positions. We further introduce a lightweight selector that filters complementary and informative trajectories from the generated pool to ensure demonstration quality. These curated samples enable the model to achieve competitive performance with far fewer training examples. Extensive experiments on the LIBERO benchmark show that SEIL achieves a new state-of-the-art performance in few-shot imitation learning scenarios. Code is available atthis https URL.

  In robot imitation learning, policy performance is tightly coupled with the quality and composition of the demonstration data. Yet, developing a precise understanding of how individual demonstrations contribute to downstream outcomes - such as closed-loop task success or failure - remains a persistent challenge. We propose CUPID, a robot data curation method based on a novel influence function-theoretic formulation for imitation learning policies. Given a set of evaluation rollouts, CUPID estimates the influence of each training demonstration on the policy's expected return. This enables ranking and selection of demonstrations according to their impact on the policy's closed-loop performance. We use CUPID to curate data by 1) filtering out training demonstrations that harm policy performance and 2) subselecting newly collected trajectories that will most improve the policy. Extensive simulated and hardware experiments show that our approach consistently identifies which data drives test-time performance. For example, training with less than 33% of curated data can yield state-of-the-art diffusion policies on the simulated RoboMimic benchmark, with similar gains observed in hardware. Furthermore, hardware experiments show that our method can identify robust strategies under distribution shift, isolate spurious correlations, and even enhance the post-training of generalist robot policies.

  Vision Language Models (VLMs) have recently been adopted in robotics for their capability in common sense reasoning and generalizability. Existing work has applied VLMs to generate task and motion planning from natural language instructions and simulate training data for robot learning. In this work, we explore using VLM to interpret human demonstration videos and generate robot task planning. Our method integrates keyframe selection, visual perception, and VLM reasoning into a pipeline. We named it SeeDo because it enables the VLM to ''see'' human demonstrations and explain the corresponding plans to the robot for it to ''do''. To validate our approach, we collected a set of long-horizon human videos demonstrating pick-and-place tasks in three diverse categories and designed a set of metrics to comprehensively benchmark SeeDo against several baselines, including state-of-the-art video-input VLMs. The experiments demonstrate SeeDo's superior performance. We further deployed the generated task plans in both a simulation environment and on a real robot arm.

- **[Discrete Diffusion for Reflective Vision-Language-Action Models in Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20109)**  `arXiv:2509.20109`  `cs.RO` `cs.AI` `cs.CL`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  End-to-End (E2E) solutions have emerged as a mainstream approach for autonomous driving systems, with Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models representing a new paradigm that leverages pre-trained multimodal knowledge from Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to interpret and interact with complex real-world environments. However, these methods remain constrained by the limitations of imitation learning, which struggles to inherently encode physical rules during training. Existing approaches often rely on complex rule-based post-refinement, employ reinforcement learning that remains largely limited to simulation, or utilize diffusion guidance that requires computationally expensive gradient calculations. To address these challenges, we introduce ReflectDrive, a novel learning-based framework that integrates a reflection mechanism for safe trajectory generation via discrete diffusion. We first discretize the two-dimensional driving space to construct an action codebook, enabling the use of pre-trained Diffusion Language Models for planning tasks through fine-tuning. Central to our approach is a safety-aware reflection mechanism that performs iterative self-correction without gradient computation. Our method begins with goal-conditioned trajectory generation to model multi-modal driving behaviors. Based on this, we apply local search methods to identify unsafe tokens and determine feasible solutions, which then serve as safe anchors for inpainting-based regeneration. Evaluated on the NAVSIM benchmark, ReflectDrive demonstrates significant advantages in safety-critical trajectory generation, offering a scalable and reliable solution for autonomous driving systems.

- **[AnchDrive: Bootstrapping Diffusion Policies with Hybrid Trajectory Anchors for End-to-End Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20253)**  `arXiv:2509.20253`  `cs.RO` `cs.AI`  
  _Jinhao Chai, Anqing Jiang, Hao Jiang, Shiyi Mu, Zichong Gu, Shugong Xu_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  End-to-end multi-modal planning has become a transformative paradigm in autonomous driving, effectively addressing behavioral multi-modality and the generalization challenge in long-tail scenarios. We propose AnchDrive, a framework for end-to-end driving that effectively bootstraps a diffusion policy to mitigate the high computational cost of traditional generative models. Rather than denoising from pure noise, AnchDrive initializes its planner with a rich set of hybrid trajectory anchors. These anchors are derived from two complementary sources: a static vocabulary of general driving priors and a set of dynamic, context-aware trajectories. The dynamic trajectories are decoded in real-time by a Transformer that processes dense and sparse perceptual features. The diffusion model then learns to refine these anchors by predicting a distribution of trajectory offsets, enabling fine-grained refinement. This anchor-based bootstrapping design allows for efficient generation of diverse, high-quality trajectories. Experiments on the NAVSIM benchmark confirm that AnchDrive sets a new state-of-the-art and shows strong gen?eralizability

- **[RoboSSM: Scalable In-context Imitation Learning via State-Space Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19658)**  `arXiv:2509.19658`  `cs.RO` `cs.AI`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In-context imitation learning (ICIL) enables robots to learn tasks from prompts consisting of just a handful of demonstrations. By eliminating the need for parameter updates at deployment time, this paradigm supports few-shot adaptation to novel tasks. However, recent ICIL methods rely on Transformers, which have computational limitations and tend to underperform when handling longer prompts than those seen during training. In this work, we introduce RoboSSM, a scalable recipe for in-context imitation learning based on state-space models (SSM). Specifically, RoboSSM replaces Transformers with Longhorn -- a state-of-the-art SSM that provides linear-time inference and strong extrapolation capabilities, making it well-suited for long-context prompts. We evaluate our approach on the LIBERO benchmark and compare it against strong Transformer-based ICIL baselines. Experiments show that RoboSSM extrapolates effectively to varying numbers of in-context demonstrations, yields high performance on unseen tasks, and remains robust in long-horizon scenarios. These results highlight the potential of SSMs as an efficient and scalable backbone for ICIL. Our code is available atthis https URL.

- **[Techno-Economic analysis for Smart Hangar inspection operations through Sensing and Localisation at scale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20229)**  `arXiv:2509.20229`  `cs.RO`  
  _Angelos Plastropoulos, Nicolas P. Avdelidis, Argyrios Zolotas_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The accuracy, resilience, and affordability of localisation are fundamental to autonomous robotic inspection within aircraft maintenance and overhaul (MRO) hangars. Hangars typically feature tall ceilings and are often made of materials such as metal. Due to its nature, it is considered a GPS-denied environment, with extensive multipath effects and stringent operational constraints that collectively create a uniquely challenging environment. This persistent gap highlights the need for domain-specific comparative studies, including rigorous cost, accuracy, and integration assessments, to inform a reliable and scalable deployment of a localisation system in the Smart Hangar. This paper presents the first techno-economic roadmap that benchmarks motion capture (MoCap), ultra-wideband (UWB), and a ceiling-mounted camera network across three operational scenarios: robot localisation, asset tracking, and surface defect detection within a 40x50 m hangar bay. A dual-layer optimisation for camera selection and positioning framework is introduced, which couples market-based camera-lens selection with an optimisation solver, producing camera layouts that minimise hardware while meeting accuracy targets. The roadmap equips MRO planners with an actionable method to balance accuracy, coverage, and budget, demonstrating that an optimised vision architecture has the potential to unlock robust and cost-effective sensing for next-generation Smart Hangars.

- **[Robot Trajectron V2: A Probabilistic Shared Control Framework for Navigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19954)**  `arXiv:2509.19954`  `cs.RO`  
  _Pinhao Song, Yurui Du, Ophelie Saussus, Sofie De Schrijver, Irene Caprara, Peter Janssen, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We propose a probabilistic shared-control solution for navigation, called Robot Trajectron V2 (RT-V2), that enables accurate intent prediction and safe, effective assistance in human-robot interaction. RT-V2 jointly models a user's long-term behavioral patterns and their noisy, low-dimensional control signals by combining a prior intent model with a posterior update that accounts for real-time user input and environmental context. The prior captures the multimodal and history-dependent nature of user intent using recurrent neural networks and conditional variational autoencoders, while the posterior integrates this with uncertain user commands to infer desired actions. We conduct extensive experiments to validate RT-V2 across synthetic benchmarks, human-computer interaction studies with keyboard input, and brain-machine interface experiments with non-human primates. Results show that RT-V2 outperforms the state of the art in intent estimation, provides safe and efficient navigation support, and adequately balances user autonomy with assistive intervention. By unifying probabilistic modeling, reinforcement learning, and safe optimization, RT-V2 offers a principled and generalizable approach to shared control for diverse assistive technologies.

  _Keyu Wang, Bingcong Lu, Zhengxue Cheng, Hengdi Zhang, Li Song_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Achieving diverse and stable dexterous grasping for general and deformable objects remains a fundamental challenge in robotics, due to high-dimensional action spaces and uncertainty in perception. In this paper, we present D3Grasp, a multimodal perception-guided reinforcement learning framework designed to enable Diverse and Deformable Dexterous Grasping. We firstly introduce a unified multimodal representation that integrates visual and tactile perception to robustly grasp common objects with diverse properties. Second, we propose an asymmetric reinforcement learning architecture that exploits privileged information during training while preserving deployment realism, enhancing both generalization and sample efficiency. Third, we meticulously design a training strategy to synthesize contact-rich, penetration-free, and kinematically feasible grasps with enhanced adaptability to deformable and contact-sensitive objects. Extensive evaluations confirm that D3Grasp delivers highly robust performance across large-scale and diverse object categories, and substantially advances the state of the art in dexterous grasping for deformable and compliant objects, even under perceptual uncertainty and real-world disturbances. D3Grasp achieves an average success rate of 95.1% in real-world trials,outperforming prior methods on both rigid and deformable objects benchmarks.

- **[Beyond Human Demonstrations: Diffusion-Based Reinforcement Learning to Generate Data for VLA Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19752)**  `arXiv:2509.19752`  `cs.RO`

  Vision-language-action (VLA) models have shown strong generalization across tasks and embodiments; however, their reliance on large-scale human demonstrations limits their scalability owing to the cost and effort of manual data collection. Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a potential alternative to generate demonstrations autonomously, yet conventional RL algorithms often struggle on long-horizon manipulation tasks with sparse rewards. In this paper, we propose a modified diffusion policy optimization algorithm to generate high-quality and low-variance trajectories, which contributes to a diffusion RL-powered VLA training pipeline. Our algorithm benefits from not only the high expressiveness of diffusion models to explore complex and diverse behaviors but also the implicit regularization of the iterative denoising process to yield smooth and consistent demonstrations. We evaluate our approach on the LIBERO benchmark, which includes 130 long-horizon manipulation tasks, and show that the generated trajectories are smoother and more consistent than both human demonstrations and those from standard Gaussian RL policies. Further, training a VLA model exclusively on the diffusion RL-generated data achieves an average success rate of 81.9%, which outperforms the model trained on human data by +5.3% and that on Gaussian RL-generated data by +12.6%. The results highlight our diffusion RL as an effective alternative for generating abundant, high-quality, and low-variance demonstrations for VLA models.

  _Akshay Jaitly, Jon Arrizabalaga, Guanrui Li_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Planning collision free trajectories in complex environments remains a core challenge in robotics. Existing corridor based planners which rely on decomposition of the free space into collision free subsets scale poorly with environmental complexity and require explicit allocations of time windows to trajectory segments. We introduce a new trajectory parameterization that represents trajectories in a nonconvex collision free corridor as being in a convex cartesian product of balls. This parameterization allows us to decouple problem size from geometric complexity of the solution and naturally avoids explicit time allocation by allowing trajectories to evolve continuously inside ellipsoidal corridors. Building on this representation, we formulate the Orthogonal Trust Region Problem (Orth-TRP), a specialized convex program with separable block constraints, and develop a solver that exploits this parallel structure and the unique structure of each parallel subproblem for efficient optimization. Experiments on a quadrotor trajectory planning benchmark show that our approach produces smoother trajectories and lower runtimes than state-of-the-art corridor based planners, especially in highly complicated environments.

  _Liquan Wang, Jiangjie Bian, Eric Heiden, Animesh Garg_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Robotic manipulation tasks involving cutting deformable objects remain challenging due to complex topological behaviors, difficulties in perceiving dense object states, and the lack of efficient evaluation methods for cutting outcomes. In this paper, we introduce TopoCut, a comprehensive benchmark for multi-step robotic cutting tasks that integrates a cutting environment and generalized policy learning. TopoCut is built upon three core components: (1) We introduce a high-fidelity simulation environment based on a particle-based elastoplastic solver with compliant von Mises constitutive models, augmented by a novel damage-driven topology discovery mechanism that enables accurate tracking of multiple cutting pieces. (2) We develop a comprehensive reward design that integrates the topology discovery with a pose-invariant spectral reward model based on Laplace-Beltrami eigenanalysis, facilitating consistent and robust assessment of cutting quality. (3) We propose an integrated policy learning pipeline, where a dynamics-informed perception module predicts topological evolution and produces particle-wise, topology-aware embeddings to support PDDP (Particle-based Score-Entropy Discrete Diffusion Policy) for goal-conditioned policy learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TopoCut supports trajectory generation, scalable learning, precise evaluation, and strong generalization across diverse object geometries, scales, poses, and cutting goals.

  _Min Dai, Aaron D. Ames_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present RoMoCo, an open-source C++ toolbox for the synthesis and evaluation of reduced-order model-based planners and whole-body controllers for bipedal and humanoid robots. RoMoCo's modular architecture unifies state-of-the-art planners and whole-body locomotion controllers under a consistent API, enabling rapid prototyping and reproducible benchmarking. By leveraging reduced-order models for platform-agnostic gait generation, RoMoCo enables flexible controller design across diverse robots. We demonstrate its versatility and performance through extensive simulations on the Cassie, Unitree H1, and G1 robots, and validate its real-world efficacy with hardware experiments on the Cassie and G1 humanoids.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Closed-loop control remains an open challenge in soft robotics. The nonlinear responses of soft actuators under dynamic loading conditions limit the use of analytic models for soft robot control. Traditional methods of controlling soft robots underutilize their configuration spaces to avoid nonlinearity, hysteresis, large deformations, and the risk of actuator damage. Furthermore, episodic data-driven control approaches such as reinforcement learning (RL) are traditionally limited by sample efficiency and inconsistency across initializations. In this work, we demonstrate RL for reliably learning control policies for dynamic balancing tasks in real-time single-shot hardware deployments. We use a deformable Stewart platform constructed using parallel, 3D-printed soft actuators based on motorized handed shearing auxetic (HSA) structures. By introducing a curriculum learning approach based on expanding neighborhoods of a known equilibrium, we achieve reliable single-deployment balancing at arbitrary coordinates. In addition to benchmarking the performance of model-based and model-free methods, we demonstrate that in a single deployment, Maximum Diffusion RL is capable of learning dynamic balancing after half of the actuators are effectively disabled, by inducing buckling and by breaking actuators with bolt cutters. Training occurs with no prior data, in as fast as 15 minutes, with performance nearly identical to the fully-intact platform. Single-shot learning on hardware facilitates soft robotic systems reliably learning in the real world and will enable more diverse and capable soft robots.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  A central challenge for multi-robot systems is fusing independently gathered perception data into a unified representation. Despite progress in Collaborative SLAM (C-SLAM), benchmarking remains hindered by the scarcity of dedicated multi-robot datasets. Many evaluations instead partition single-robot trajectories, a practice that may only partially reflect true multi-robot operations and, more critically, lacks standardization, leading to results that are difficult to interpret or compare across studies. While several multi-robot datasets have recently been introduced, they mostly contain short trajectories with limited inter-robot overlap and sparse intra-robot loop closures. To overcome these limitations, we introduce CU-Multi, a dataset collected over multiple days at two large outdoor sites on the University of Colorado Boulder campus. CU-Multi comprises four synchronized runs with aligned start times and controlled trajectory overlap, replicating the distinct perspectives of a robot team. It includes RGB-D sensing, RTK GPS, semantic LiDAR, and refined ground-truth odometry. By combining overlap variation with dense semantic annotations, CU-Multi provides a strong foundation for reproducible evaluation in multi-robot collaborative perception tasks.

  Finding high-quality solutions quickly is an important objective in motion planning. This is especially true for high-degree-of-freedom robots. Satisficing planners have traditionally found feasible solutions quickly but provide no guarantees on their optimality, while almost-surely asymptotically optimal (a.s.a.o.) planners have probabilistic guarantees on their convergence towards an optimal solution but are more computationally expensive.This paper uses the AO-x meta-algorithm to extend the satisficing RRT-Connect planner to optimal planning. The resulting Asymptotically Optimal RRT-Connect (AORRTC) finds initial solutions in similar times as RRT-Connect and uses any additional planning time to converge towards the optimal solution in an anytime manner. It is proven to be probabilistically complete and a.s.a.o.AORRTC was tested with the Panda (7 DoF) and Fetch (8 DoF) robotic arms on the MotionBenchMaker dataset. These experiments show that AORRTC finds initial solutions as fast as RRT-Connect and faster than the tested state-of-the-art a.s.a.o. algorithms while converging to better solutions faster. AORRTC finds solutions to difficult high-DoF planning problems in milliseconds where the other a.s.a.o. planners could not consistently find solutions in seconds. This performance was demonstrated both with and without single instruction/multiple data (SIMD) acceleration.

- **[Knowledge Base-Aware Orchestration: A Dynamic, Privacy-Preserving Method for Multi-Agent Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19599)**  `arXiv:2509.19599`  `cs.MA` `cs.AI`  
  _Danilo Trombino, Vincenzo Pecorella, Alessandro de Giulii, Davide Tresoldi_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multi-agent systems (MAS) are increasingly tasked with solving complex, knowledge-intensive problems where effective agent orchestration is critical. Conventional orchestration methods rely on static agent descriptions, which often become outdated or incomplete. This limitation leads to inefficient task routing, particularly in dynamic environments where agent capabilities continuously evolve. We introduce Knowledge Base-Aware (KBA) Orchestration, a novel approach that augments static descriptions with dynamic, privacy-preserving relevance signals derived from each agent's internal knowledge base (KB). In the proposed framework, when static descriptions are insufficient for a clear routing decision, the orchestrator prompts the subagents in parallel. Each agent then assesses the task's relevance against its private KB, returning a lightweight ACK signal without exposing the underlying data. These collected signals populate a shared semantic cache, providing dynamic indicators of agent suitability for future queries. By combining this novel mechanism with static descriptions, our method achieves more accurate and adaptive task routing preserving agent autonomy and data confidentiality. Benchmarks show that our KBA Orchestration significantly outperforms static description-driven methods in routing precision and overall system efficiency, making it suitable for large-scale systems that require higher accuracy than standard description-driven routing.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) is a growing research area which gained significant traction in recent years, extending Deep RL applications to a much wider range of problems. A particularly challenging class of problems in this domain is Heterogeneous Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (HeMARL), where agents with different sensors, resources, or capabilities must cooperate based on local information. The large number of real-world situations involving heterogeneous agents makes it an attractive research area, yet underexplored, as most MARL research focuses on homogeneous agents (e.g., a swarm of identical robots). In MARL and single-agent RL, standardized environments such as ALE and SMAC have allowed to establish recognized benchmarks to measure progress. However, there is a clear lack of such standardized testbed for cooperative HeMARL. As a result, new research in this field often uses simple environments, where most algorithms perform near optimally, or uses weakly heterogeneous MARL environments.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Federated continual learning (FCL) tackles scenarios of learning from continuously emerging task data across distributed clients, where the key challenge lies in addressing both temporal forgetting over time and spatial forgetting simultaneously. Recently, prompt-based FCL methods have shown advanced performance through task-wise promptthis http URLthis study, we underscore that the existing prompt-based FCL methods are prone to class-wise knowledge coherence between prompts across clients. The class-wise knowledge coherence includes two aspects: (1) intra-class distribution gap across clients, which degrades the learned semantics across prompts, (2) inter-prompt class-wise relevance, which highlights cross-class knowledge confusion. During prompt communication, insufficient class-wise coherence exacerbates knowledge conflicts among new prompts and induces interference with old prompts, intensifying both spatial and temporal forgetting. To address these issues, we propose a novel Class-aware Client Knowledge Interaction (C${}^2$Prompt) method that explicitly enhances class-wise knowledge coherence during prompt communication. Specifically, a local class distribution compensation mechanism (LCDC) is introduced to reduce intra-class distribution disparities across clients, thereby reinforcing intra-class knowledge consistency. Additionally, a class-aware prompt aggregation scheme (CPA) is designed to alleviate inter-class knowledge confusion by selectively strengthening class-relevant knowledge aggregation. Extensive experiments on multiple FCL benchmarks demonstrate that C${}^2$Prompt achieves state-of-the-art performance. Our source code is available atthis https URL

- **[TIMED: Adversarial and Autoregressive Refinement of Diffusion-Based Time Series Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19638)**  `arXiv:2509.19638`  `cs.LG` `cs.CV`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Generating high-quality synthetic time series is a fundamental yet challenging task across domains such as forecasting and anomaly detection, where real data can be scarce, noisy, or costly to collect. Unlike static data generation, synthesizing time series requires modeling both the marginal distribution of observations and the conditional temporal dependencies that govern sequential dynamics. We propose TIMED, a unified generative framework that integrates a denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) to capture global structure via a forward-reverse diffusion process, a supervisor network trained with teacher forcing to learn autoregressive dependencies through next-step prediction, and a Wasserstein critic that provides adversarial feedback to ensure temporal smoothness and fidelity. To further align the real and synthetic distributions in feature space, TIMED incorporates a Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) loss, promoting both diversity and sample quality. All components are built using masked attention architectures optimized for sequence modeling and are trained jointly to effectively capture both unconditional and conditional aspects of time series data. Experimental results across diverse multivariate time series benchmarks demonstrate that TIMED generates more realistic and temporally coherent sequences than state-of-the-art generative models.

- **[PromptCoT 2.0: Scaling Prompt Synthesis for Large Language Model Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19894)**  `arXiv:2509.19894`  `cs.LG` `cs.CL`  
  _Xueliang Zhao, Wei Wu, Jian Guan, Zhuocheng Gong, Lingpeng Kong_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) are evolving from conversational systems into strong reasoners for tasks such as Olympiad mathematics and competitive programming. While scaling parameters and test-time computation has driven progress, a key bottleneck is the lack of high-quality training problems: human-curated datasets are costly and limited, while existing synthetic corpora are often too easy or narrow. PromptCoT 1.0 showed that injecting rationales into prompt synthesis increases problem difficulty. Building on this, we present PromptCoT 2.0, a scalable framework that replaces hand-crafted heuristics with an expectation-maximization (EM) loop, where rationales are iteratively refined to guide prompt construction. This produces problems that are both harder and more diverse than prior corpora. The synthetic prompts support two post-training regimes: (1) Self-Play, where strong models improve autonomously via verifiable feedback without stronger teachers; and (2) Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), where weaker models learn from teacher-distilled traces. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach. In self-play, applying PromptCoT 2.0 to Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507 sets new state-of-the-art results at the 30B scale, with +4.4, +4.8, and +5.3 on AIME 24/25 and HMMT 25, +6.1 and +5.0 on LiveCodeBench v5/v6, and +35 Elo on Codeforces. In SFT, training Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct solely on synthetic prompts boosts accuracy to 73.1 (AIME 24), 65.6 (AIME 25), and 53.4 (LiveCodeBench v5), surpassing models trained on human or hybrid data. Analyses further confirm that PromptCoT 2.0 yields fundamentally harder and distributionally distinct problems. These results establish prompt synthesis as a new axis for scaling reasoning and position PromptCoT 2.0 as a scalable foundation for future open-source models.

  Policy-based reinforcement learning currently plays an important role in improving LLMs on mathematical reasoning tasks. However, existing rollout-based reinforcement learning methods (GRPO, DAPO, GSPO, etc.) fail to explicitly consider LLMs' learning ability for samples of different difficulty levels, which is contrary to the human cognitive process of mathematical reasoning tasks from easy to difficult. Intuitively, we find that the variance of the rollout group's reward in RLVR partly reflects the difficulty of the current sample for LLMs. Samples that are too easy or too difficult have a lower variance, while samples with moderate difficulty have a higher variance. Based on this, we propose VCRL, a curriculum reinforcement learning framework that dynamically controls the difficulty of training samples based on the variance of group rewards. Experiments on five mathematical benchmarks and two models reveal the advantages of VCRL over the current LLM RL baselines.

  Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as an effective approach for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), especially in scenarios where supervised fine-tuning (SFT) falls short due to limited chain-of-thought (CoT) data. Among RL-based post-training methods, group relative advantage estimation, as exemplified by Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), has attracted considerable attention for eliminating the dependency on the value model, thereby simplifying training compared to traditional approaches like Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). However, we observe that exsiting group relative advantage estimation method still suffers from training inefficiencies, particularly when the estimated advantage approaches zero. To address this limitation, we propose Advantage-Augmented Policy Optimization (AAPO), a novel RL algorithm that optimizes the cross-entropy (CE) loss using advantages enhanced through a momentum-based estimation scheme. This approach effectively mitigates the inefficiencies associated with group relative advantage estimation. Experimental results on multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate the superior performance of AAPO.

  Reinforcement learning (RL) has proven effective in strengthening the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). A widely adopted method, Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), has shown strong empirical results in training DeepSeek-R1. However, GRPO fails to update the policy when all responses within a group are incorrect (i.e., \emph{all-negative-sample} groups). This limitation underscores a key gap between artificial and human intelligence: unlike humans, who can learn from mistakes, GRPO discards these signals. Our first contribution is to introduce a simple framework that mitigates the all-negative-sample issue by incorporating response diversity within groups using a \textit{step-wise} judge model, which can be either directly trained or adapted from existing LLMs. We prove that this diversification can accelerate GRPO's learning dynamics in a simplified setting. We also empirically validate the proposed stepwise guided policy optimization (SGPO) method, demonstrating consistent gains across model sizes (7B, 14B, 32B) in offline and online training on 9 benchmarks, including base and distilled variants. Our results highlight two advantages: (i) SGPO surpasses GRPO, especially in the early and mid-training stages where all-negative-sample groups are prevalent; and (ii) SGPO does not require judge models to generate correct answers, differentiating it from knowledge distillation methods.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  LLM-judged benchmarks are increasingly used to evaluate complex model behaviors, yet their design introduces failure modes absent in conventional ground-truth based benchmarks. We argue that without tight objectives and verifiable constructions, benchmark rankings can produce high-confidence rankings that are in fact largely noise. We introduce two mechanisms to diagnose these issues. Schematic adherence quantifies how much of a judge's overall verdict is explained by the explicit evaluation schema, revealing unexplained variance when judges deviate from their own rubric. Psychometric validity aggregates internal consistency and discriminant validity signals to quantify irreducible uncertainty in any benchmarking run. Applying these tools to Arena-Hard Auto, we find severe schema incoherence and factor collapse across popular judges: for example, unexplained variance exceeding 90 percent for DeepSeek-R1-32B and factor correlations above 0.93 for most criteria. We also show that the ELO-style aggregation used by Arena-Hard Auto collapses and masks genuine ranking uncertainty. Our results highlight design failures that undermine validity and offer actionable principles for building better-scoped, reliability-aware LLM-judged benchmarks. We release our code atthis https URL

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Current LLM unlearning methods face a critical security vulnerability that undermines their fundamental purpose: while they appear to successfully remove sensitive or harmful knowledge, this ``forgotten" information remains precariously recoverable through relearning attacks. We identify that the root cause is that conventional methods optimizing the forgetting loss at individual data points will drive model parameters toward sharp minima in the loss landscape. In these unstable regions, even minimal parameter perturbations can drastically alter the model's behaviors. Consequently, relearning attacks exploit this vulnerability by using just a few fine-tuning samples to navigate the steep gradients surrounding these unstable regions, thereby rapidly recovering knowledge that was supposedly erased. This exposes a critical robustness gap between apparent unlearning and actual knowledge removal. To address this issue, we propose StableUN, a bi-level feedback-guided optimization framework that explicitly seeks more stable parameter regions via neighborhood-aware optimization. It integrates forgetting feedback, which uses adversarial perturbations to probe parameter neighborhoods, with remembering feedback to preserve model utility, aligning the two objectives through gradient projection. Experiments on WMDP and MUSE benchmarks demonstrate that our method is significantly more robust against both relearning and jailbreaking attacks while maintaining competitive utility performance.

  Ensuring fairness in machine learning remains a significant challenge, as models often inherit biases from their training data. Generative models have recently emerged as a promising approach to mitigate bias at the data level while preserving utility. However, many rely on deep architectures, despite evidence that simpler models can be highly effective for tabular data. In this work, we introduce TABFAIRGDT, a novel method for generating fair synthetic tabular data using autoregressive decision trees. To enforce fairness, we propose a soft leaf resampling technique that adjusts decision tree outputs to reduce bias while preserving predictive performance. Our approach is non-parametric, effectively capturing complex relationships between mixed feature types, without relying on assumptions about the underlying data distributions. We evaluate TABFAIRGDT on benchmark fairness datasets and demonstrate that it outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) deep generative models, achieving better fairness-utility trade-off for downstream tasks, as well as higher synthetic data quality. Moreover, our method is lightweight, highly efficient, and CPU-compatible, requiring no data pre-processing. Remarkably, TABFAIRGDT achieves a 72% average speedup over the fastest SOTA baseline across various dataset sizes, and can generate fair synthetic data for medium-sized datasets (10 features, 10K samples) in just one second on a standard CPU, making it an ideal solution for real-world fairness-sensitive applications.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Exploration in reinforcement learning (RL) remains challenging, particularly in sparse-reward settings. While foundation models possess strong semantic priors, their capabilities as zero-shot exploration agents in classic RL benchmarks are not well understood. We benchmark LLMs and VLMs on multi-armed bandits, Gridworlds, and sparse-reward Atari to test zero-shot exploration. Our investigation reveals a key limitation: while VLMs can infer high-level objectives from visual input, they consistently fail at precise low-level control: the "knowing-doing gap". To analyze a potential bridge for this gap, we investigate a simple on-policy hybrid framework in a controlled, best-case scenario. Our results in this idealized setting show that VLM guidance can significantly improve early-stage sample efficiency, providing a clear analysis of the potential and constraints of using foundation models to guide exploration rather than for end-to-end control.

  We draw an analogy between static friction in classical mechanics and extrapolation error in off-policy RL, and use it to formulate a constraint that prevents the policy from drifting toward unsupported actions. In this study, we present Frictional Q-learning, a deep reinforcement learning algorithm for continuous control, which extends batch-constrained reinforcement learning. Our algorithm constrains the agent's action space to encourage behavior similar to that in the replay buffer, while maintaining a distance from the manifold of the orthonormal action space. The constraint preserves the simplicity of batch-constrained, and provides an intuitive physical interpretation of extrapolation error. Empirically, we further demonstrate that our algorithm is robustly trained and achieves competitive performance across standard continuous control benchmarks.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Diffusion-based world models have demonstrated strong capabilities in synthesizing realistic long-horizon trajectories for offline reinforcement learning (RL). However, many existing methods do not directly generate actions alongside states and rewards, limiting their compatibility with standard value-based offline RL algorithms that rely on one-step temporal difference (TD) learning. While prior work has explored joint modeling of states, rewards, and actions to address this issue, such formulations often lead to increased training complexity and reduced performance in practice. We propose \textbf{DAWM}, a diffusion-based world model that generates future state-reward trajectories conditioned on the current state, action, and return-to-go, paired with an inverse dynamics model (IDM) for efficient action inference. This modular design produces complete synthetic transitions suitable for one-step TD-based offline RL, enabling effective and computationally efficient training. Empirically, we show that conservative offline RL algorithms such as TD3BC and IQL benefit significantly from training on these augmented trajectories, consistently outperforming prior diffusion-based baselines across multiple tasks in the D4RL benchmark.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Despite achieving excellent performance on benchmarks, deep neural networks often underperform in real-world deployment due to sensitivity to minor, often imperceptible shifts in input data, known as distributional shifts. These shifts are common in practical scenarios but are rarely accounted for during evaluation, leading to inflated performance metrics. To address this gap, we propose a novel methodology for the verification, evaluation, and risk assessment of deep learning systems. Our approach explicitly models the incidence of distributional shifts at runtime by estimating their probability from outputs of out-of-distribution detectors. We combine these estimates with conditional probabilities of network correctness, structuring them in a binary tree. By traversing this tree, we can compute credible and precise estimates of network accuracy. We assess our approach on five different datasets, with which we simulate deployment conditions characterized by differing frequencies of distributional shift. Our approach consistently outperforms conventional evaluation, with accuracy estimation errors typically ranging between 0.01 and 0.1. We further showcase the potential of our approach on a medical segmentation benchmark, wherein we apply our methods towards risk assessment by associating costs with tree nodes, informing cost-benefit analyses and value-judgments. Ultimately, our approach offers a robust framework for improving the reliability and trustworthiness of deep learning systems, particularly in safety-critical applications, by providing more accurate performance estimates and actionable risk assessments.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multivariate time series forecasting is essential in domains such as finance, transportation, climate, and energy. However, existing patch-based methods typically adopt fixed-length segmentation, overlooking the heterogeneity of local temporal dynamics and the decoding heterogeneity of forecasting. Such designs lose details in information-dense regions, introduce redundancy in stable segments, and fail to capture the distinct complexities of short-term and long-term horizons. We propose TimeMosaic, a forecasting framework that aims to address temporal heterogeneity. TimeMosaic employs adaptive patch embedding to dynamically adjust granularity according to local information density, balancing motif reuse with structural clarity while preserving temporal continuity. In addition, it introduces segment-wise decoding that treats each prediction horizon as a related subtask and adapts to horizon-specific difficulty and information requirements, rather than applying a single uniform decoder. Extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate that TimeMosaic delivers consistent improvements over existing methods, and our model trained on the large-scale corpus with 321 billion observations achieves performance competitive with state-of-the-art TSFMs.

  Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is widely used to efficiently adapt Transformers by adding trainable low-rank matrices to attention projections. While effective, these matrices are considered independent for each attention projection (Query, Key, and Value) and each layer. Recent extensions have considered joint, tensor-based adaptations, but only in limited forms and without a systematic framework. We introduce TensLoRA, a unified framework that aggregates LoRA updates into higher-order tensors and models a broad family of tensor-based low-rank adaptations. Our formulation generalizes existing tensor-based methods and enables mode-specific compression rates, allowing parameter budgets to be tailored according to the modality and task. Experiments on vision and language benchmarks reveal that the tensor construction directly impacts performance, sometimes better than standard LoRA under similar parameter counts.

To prevent transferring task-irrelevant noise through the shared pathway, we integrate a task-aware discriminator within a GAN. The discriminator encourages the shared expert to pass only task-aligned information during sequential training.

  Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents have demonstrated remarkable progress in automating complex user interface interactions through reinforcement learning. However, current approaches face a fundamental dilemma: offline RL enables stable training on pre-collected trajectories, but struggles with multi-step task execution for lack of trajectory-level reward signals; online RL captures these signals through environment interaction, but suffers from sparse rewards and prohibitive deployment costs. To address it, we present Semi-online Reinforcement Learning, a novel paradigm that simulates online RL on offline trajectories. During each rollout process, we preserve the original model output within the multi-turn dialogue, where a Patch Module adaptively recovers the divergence between rollout and expert trajectories. To capture long-term training signals, Semi-online RL introduces discounted future returns into the reward computation and optimizes the policy with weighted step-level and episode-level advantages. We further introduce Semi-Online Performance (SOP), a metric that aligns better with true online performance, serving as a practical and effective proxy for real-world evaluation. Experiments show that ours Semi-online RL achieves SOTA performance among 7B models across four dynamic benchmarks, with significant gains over the base model (e.g., +12.0% on AndroidWorld, +23.8% on AITW), demonstrating significant progress in bridging the gap between offline training efficiency and online multi-turn reasoning.

  Fine-tuning massive pre-trained language models across many tasks demands adapters that are both parameter-efficient and expressive. We introduce \textbf{Kron-LoRA}, a hybrid adapter that combines Kronecker-structured factorization with low-rank LoRA compression-an integration that, to our knowledge, has not been explored in parameter-efficient fine-tuning or in matrix approximation literature. Kron-LoRA achieves up to 4$\times$ fewer parameters than standard LoRA while retaining similar expressivity. Experiments on DistilBERT, Mistral-7B, LLaMA-2-7B, and LLaMA-3-8B across eight benchmarks show that Kron-LoRA matches or exceeds LoRA baselines with modest memory savings and only a 5-8\% speed overhead. In sequential fine-tuning, it also delivers competitive cross-task transfer despite using only one-quarter of the adapter parameters. Kron-LoRA thus offers a scalable, sustainable solution for multi-task adaptation of large language models.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Anomaly detection in complex dynamical systems is essential for ensuring reliability, safety, and efficiency in industrial and cyber-physical infrastructures. Predictive maintenance helps prevent costly failures, while cybersecurity monitoring has become critical as digitized systems face growing threats. Many of these systems exhibit oscillatory behaviors and bounded motion, requiring anomaly detection methods that capture structured temporal dependencies while adhering to physical consistency principles. In this work, we propose a system-theoretic approach to anomaly detection, grounded in classical embedding theory and physics-inspired consistency principles. We build upon the Fractal Whitney Embedding Prevalence Theorem that extends traditional embedding techniques to complex system dynamics. Additionally, we introduce state-derivative pairs as an embedding strategy to capture system evolution. To enforce temporal coherence, we develop a Temporal Differential Consistency Autoencoder (TDC-AE), incorporating a TDC-Loss that aligns the approximated derivatives of latent variables with their dynamic representations. We evaluate our method on two subsets (FD001, FD003) of the C-MAPSS dataset, a benchmark for turbofan engine degradation. TDC-AE machtes LSTMs and outperforms Transformers while achieving a nearly 100x reduction in MAC operations, making it particularly suited for lightweight edge computing. Our findings support the hypothesis that anomalies disrupt stable system dynamics, providing a robust signal for anomaly detection.

  Modelling dynamically evolving spatio-temporal signals is a prominent challenge in the Graph Neural Network (GNN) literature. Notably, GNNs assume an existing underlying graph structure. While this underlying structure may not always exist or is derived independently from the signal, a temporally evolving functional network can always be constructed from multi-channel data. Graph Variate Signal Analysis (GVSA) defines a unified framework consisting of a network tensor of instantaneous connectivity profiles against a stable support usually constructed from the signal itself. Building on GVSA and tools from graph signal processing, we introduce Graph-Variate Neural Networks (GVNNs): layers that convolve spatio-temporal signals with a signal-dependent connectivity tensor combining a stable long-term support with instantaneous, data-driven interactions. This design captures dynamic statistical interdependencies at each time step without ad hoc sliding windows and admits an efficient implementation with linear complexity in sequence length. Across forecasting benchmarks, GVNNs consistently outperform strong graph-based baselines and are competitive with widely used sequence models such as LSTMs and Transformers. On EEG motor-imagery classification, GVNNs achieve strong accuracy highlighting their potential for brain-computer interface applications.

  Learning physical dynamics from data is a fundamental challenge in machine learning and scientific modeling. Real-world observational data are inherently incomplete and irregularly sampled, posing significant challenges for existing data-driven approaches. In this work, we propose a principled diffusion-based framework for learning physical systems from incomplete training samples. To this end, our method strategically partitions each such sample into observed context and unobserved query components through a carefully designed splitting strategy, then trains a conditional diffusion model to reconstruct the missing query portions given available contexts. This formulation enables accurate imputation across arbitrary observation patterns without requiring complete data supervision. Specifically, we provide theoretical analysis demonstrating that our diffusion training paradigm on incomplete data achieves asymptotic convergence to the true complete generative process under mild regularity conditions. Empirically, we show that our method significantly outperforms existing baselines on synthetic and real-world physical dynamics benchmarks, including fluid flows and weather systems, with particularly strong performance in limited and irregular observation regimes. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of our theoretically principled approach for learning and imputing partially observed dynamics.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Anomalies in multivariate time series often arise from temporal context and cross-channel coordination rather than isolated outliers. We present Pi-Transformer, a physics-informed transformer with two attention pathways: a data-driven series attention and a smoothly evolving prior attention that encodes temporal invariants such as scale-related self-similarity and phase synchrony. The prior acts as a stable reference that calibrates reconstruction error. During training, we pair a reconstruction objective with a divergence term that encourages agreement between the two attentions while keeping them meaningfully distinct; the prior is regularised to evolve smoothly and is lightly distilled towards dataset-level statistics. At inference, the model combines an alignment-weighted reconstruction signal (Energy) with a mismatch signal that highlights timing and phase disruptions, and fuses them into a single score for detection. Across five benchmarks (SMD, MSL, SMAP, SWaT, and PSM), Pi-Transformer achieves state-of-the-art or highly competitive F1, with particular strength on timing and phase-breaking anomalies. Case analyses show complementary behaviour of the two streams and interpretable detections around regime changes. Embedding physics-informed priors into attention yields a calibrated and robust approach to anomaly detection in complex multivariate systems.

  Most state-of-the-art probabilistic time series forecasting models rely on sampling to represent future uncertainty. However, this paradigm suffers from inherent limitations, such as lacking explicit probabilities, inadequate coverage, and high computational costs. In this work, we introduce \textbf{Probabilistic Scenarios}, an alternative paradigm designed to address the limitations of sampling. It operates by directly producing a finite set of \{Scenario, Probability\} pairs, thus avoiding Monte Carlo-like approximation. To validate this paradigm, we propose \textbf{TimePrism}, a simple model composed of only three parallel linear layers. Surprisingly, TimePrism achieves 9 out of 10 state-of-the-art results across five benchmark datasets on two metrics. The effectiveness of our paradigm comes from a fundamental reframing of the learning objective. Instead of modeling an entire continuous probability space, the model learns to represent a set of plausible scenarios and corresponding probabilities. Our work demonstrates the potential of the Probabilistic Scenarios paradigm, opening a promising research direction in forecasting beyond sampling.

  The effectiveness of machine learning models, particularly in unbalanced classification tasks, is often hindered by the failure to differentiate between critical instances near the decision boundary and redundant samples concentrated in the core of the data distribution. In this paper, we propose a method to systematically identify and differentiate between these two types of data. Through extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets, we show that the boundary data oversampling method improves the F1 score by up to 10\% on 96\% of the datasets, whereas our core-aware reduction method compresses datasets up to 90\% while preserving their accuracy, making it 10 times more powerful than the original dataset. Beyond imbalanced classification, our method has broader implications for efficient model training, particularly in computationally expensive domains such as Large Language Model (LLM) training. By prioritizing high-quality, decision-relevant data, our approach can be extended to text, multimodal, and self-supervised learning scenarios, offering a pathway to faster convergence, improved generalization, and significant computational savings. This work paves the way for future research in data-efficient learning, where intelligent sampling replaces brute-force expansion, driving the next generation of AI advancements.

  Boreal forests store 30-40% of terrestrial carbon, much in climate-vulnerable permafrost soils, making their management critical for climate mitigation. However, optimizing forest management for both carbon sequestration and permafrost preservation presents complex trade-offs that current tools cannot adequately address. We introduce $\textbf{BoreaRL}$, the first multi-objective reinforcement learning environment for climate-adaptive boreal forest management, featuring a physically-grounded simulator of coupled energy, carbon, and water fluxes. BoreaRL supports two training paradigms: site-specific mode for controlled studies and generalist mode for learning robust policies under environmental stochasticity. Through evaluation of multi-objective RL algorithms, we reveal a fundamental asymmetry in learning difficulty: carbon objectives are significantly easier to optimize than thaw (permafrost preservation) objectives, with thaw-focused policies showing minimal learning progress across both paradigms. In generalist settings, standard preference-conditioned approaches fail entirely, while a naive curriculum learning approach achieves superior performance by strategically selecting training episodes. Analysis of learned strategies reveals distinct management philosophies, where carbon-focused policies favor aggressive high-density coniferous stands, while effective multi-objective policies balance species composition and density to protect permafrost while maintaining carbon gains. Our results demonstrate that robust climate-adaptive forest management remains challenging for current MORL methods, establishing BoreaRL as a valuable benchmark for developing more effective approaches. We open-source BoreaRL to accelerate research in multi-objective RL for climate applications.

  In many engineering and applied science domains, high-dimensional nonlinear filtering is still a challenging problem. Recent advances in score-based diffusion models offer a promising alternative for posterior sampling but require repeated retraining to track evolving priors, which is impractical in high dimensions. In this work, we propose the Conditional Score-based Filter (CSF), a novel algorithm that leverages a set-transformer encoder and a conditional diffusion model to achieve efficient and accurate posterior sampling without retraining. By decoupling prior modeling and posterior sampling into offline and online stages, CSF enables scalable score-based filtering across diverse nonlinear systems. Extensive experiments on benchmark problems show that CSF achieves superior accuracy, robustness, and efficiency across diverse nonlinear filtering scenarios.

  Public healthcare datasets of Chest X-Rays (CXRs) have long been a popular benchmark for developing computer vision models in healthcare. However, strong average-case performance of machine learning (ML) models on these datasets is insufficient to certify their clinical utility. In this paper, we use clinical context, as captured by prior discharge summaries, to provide a more holistic evaluation of current ``state-of-the-art'' models for the task of CXR diagnosis. Using discharge summaries recorded prior to each CXR, we derive a ``prior'' or ``pre-test'' probability of each CXR label, as a proxy for existing contextual knowledge available to clinicians when interpreting CXRs. Using this measure, we demonstrate two key findings: First, for several diagnostic labels, CXR models tend to perform best on cases where the pre-test probability is very low, and substantially worse on cases where the pre-test probability is higher. Second, we use pre-test probability to assess whether strong average-case performance reflects true diagnostic signal, rather than an ability to infer the pre-test probability as a shortcut. We find that performance drops sharply on a balanced test set where this shortcut does not exist, which may indicate that much of the apparent diagnostic power derives from inferring this clinical context. We argue that this style of analysis, using context derived from clinical notes, is a promising direction for more rigorous and fine-grained evaluation of clinical vision models.

  Variable count is among the main scalability bottlenecks for transformer modeling in multivariate time series (MTS) data. On top of this, a growing consensus in the field points to indiscriminate inter-variable mixing as a potential source of noise-accumulation and performance degradation. This is likely exacerbated by sparsity of informative signals characteristic of many MTS systems coupled with representational misalignment stemming from indiscriminate information mixing between (heterogeneous) variables. While scalability and performance are often seen as competing interests in transformer design, we show that both can be improved simultaneously in MTS by strategically constraining the representational capacity of inter-variable mixing. Our proposed method, transformer with Delegate Token Attention (DELTAformer), constrains inter-variable modeling through what we call delegate tokens which are then used to perform full, unconstrained, inter-temporal modeling. Delegate tokens act as an implicit regularizer that forces the model to be highly selective about what inter-variable information is allowed to propagate through the network. Our results show that DELTAformer scales linearly with variable-count while actually outperforming standard transformers, achieving state-of-the-art performance across benchmarks and baselines. In addition, DELTAformer can focus on relevant signals better than standard transformers in noisy MTS environments and overall exhibit superior noise-resilience. Overall, results across various experiments confirm that by aligning our model design to leverage domain-specific challenges in MTS to our advantage, DELTAformer can simultaneously achieve linear scaling while actually improving its performance against standard, quadratic transformers.

  Symbolic regression aims to discover concise, interpretable mathematical expressions that satisfy desired objectives, such as fitting data, posing a highly combinatorial optimization problem. While genetic programming has been the dominant approach, recent efforts have explored reinforcement learning methods for improving search efficiency. Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), with its ability to balance exploration and exploitation through guided search, has emerged as a promising technique for symbolic expression discovery. However, its traditional bandit strategies and sequential symbol construction often limit performance. In this work, we propose an improved MCTS framework for symbolic regression that addresses these limitations through two key innovations: (1) an extreme bandit allocation strategy tailored for identifying globally optimal expressions, with finite-time performance guarantees under polynomial reward decay assumptions; and (2) evolution-inspired state-jumping actions such as mutation and crossover, which enable non-local transitions to promising regions of the search space. These state-jumping actions also reshape the reward landscape during the search process, improving both robustness and efficiency. We conduct a thorough numerical study to the impact of these improvements and benchmark our approach against existing symbolic regression methods on a variety of datasets, including both ground-truth and black-box datasets. Our approach achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art libraries in terms of recovery rate, attains favorable positions on the Pareto frontier of accuracy versus model complexity.

  Deep learning on graphs has shown remarkable success across numerous applications, including social networks, bio-physics, traffic networks, and recommendation systems. Regardless of their successes, current methods frequently depend on the assumption that training and testing data share the same distribution, a condition rarely met in real-world scenarios. While graph-transformer (GT) backbones have recently outperformed traditional message-passing neural networks (MPNNs) in multiple in-distribution (ID) benchmarks, their effectiveness under distribution shifts remains largely unexplored. In this work, we address the challenge of out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization for graph neural networks, with a special focus on the impact of backbone architecture. We systematically evaluate GT and hybrid backbones in OOD settings and compare them to MPNNs. To do so, we adapt several leading domain generalization (DG) algorithms to work with GTs and assess their performance on a benchmark designed to test a variety of distribution shifts. Our results reveal that GT and hybrid GT-MPNN backbones demonstrate stronger generalization ability compared to MPNNs, even without specialized DG algorithms (on four out of six benchmarks). Additionally, we propose a novel post-training analysis approach that compares the clustering structure of the entire ID and OOD test datasets, specifically examining domain alignment and class separation. Highlighting its model-agnostic design, the method yielded valuable insights into both GT and MPNN backbones and appears well suited for broader DG applications beyond graph learning, offering a deeper perspective on generalization abilities that goes beyond standard accuracy metrics. Together, our findings highlight the promise of graph-transformers for robust, real-world graph learning and set a new direction for future research in OOD generalization.

  Although the power of LLM tool-use agents has ignited a flurry of recent research in this area, the curation of tool-use training data remains an open problem$-$especially for online RL training. Existing approaches to synthetic tool-use data generation tend to be non-interactive, and/or non-compositional. We introduce RandomWorld, a pipeline for the procedural generation of interactive tools and compositional tool-use data. We show that models tuned via SFT and RL on synthetic RandomWorld data improve on a range of tool-use benchmarks, and set the new SoTA for two metrics on the NESTFUL dataset. Further experiments show that downstream performance scales with the amount of RandomWorld-generated training data, opening up the possibility of further improvement through the use of entirely synthetic data.

  Recent advances in Embodied AI have enabled agents to perform increasingly complex tasks and adapt to diverse environments. However, deploying such agents in realistic human-centered scenarios, such as domestic households, remains challenging, particularly due to the difficulty of modeling individual human preferences and behaviors. In this work, we introduce PersONAL (PERSonalized Object Navigation And Localization, a comprehensive benchmark designed to study personalization in Embodied AI. Agents must identify, retrieve, and navigate to objects associated with specific users, responding to natural-language queries such as "find Lily's backpack". PersONAL comprises over 2,000 high-quality episodes across 30+ photorealistic homes from the HM3D dataset. Each episode includes a natural-language scene description with explicit associations between objects and their owners, requiring agents to reason over user-specific semantics. The benchmark supports two evaluation modes: (1) active navigation in unseen environments, and (2) object grounding in previously mapped scenes. Experiments with state-of-the-art baselines reveal a substantial gap to human performance, highlighting the need for embodied agents capable of perceiving, reasoning, and memorizing over personalized information; paving the way towards real-world assistive robot.

  In this work, we leverage informative embeddings from foundational models for unsupervised anomaly detection in medical imaging. For small datasets, a memory-bank of normative features can directly be used for anomaly detection which has been demonstrated recently. However, this is unsuitable for large medical datasets as the computational burden increases substantially. Therefore, we propose to model the distribution of normative DINOv2 embeddings with a Dirichlet Process Mixture model (DPMM), a non-parametric mixture model that automatically adjusts the number of mixture components to the data at hand. Rather than using a memory bank, we use the similarity between the component centers and the embeddings as anomaly score function to create a coarse anomaly segmentation mask. Our experiments show that through DPMM embeddings of DINOv2, despite being trained on natural images, achieve very competitive anomaly detection performance on medical imaging benchmarks and can do this while at least halving the computation time at inference. Our analysis further indicates that normalized DINOv2 embeddings are generally more aligned with anatomical structures than unnormalized features, even in the presence of anomalies, making them great representations for anomaly detection.

  Class Incremental Learning (CIL) aims to continuously learn new categories while retaining the knowledge of old ones. Pre-trained models (PTMs) show promising capabilities in CIL. However, existing approaches that apply lightweight fine-tuning to backbones still induce parameter drift, thereby compromising the generalization capability of pre-trained models. Parameter drift can be conceptualized as a form of noise that obscures critical patterns learned for previous tasks. However, recent researches have shown that noise is not always harmful. For example, the large number of visual patterns learned from pre-training can be easily abused by a single task, and introducing appropriate noise can suppress some low-correlation features, thus leaving a margin for future tasks. To this end, we propose learning beneficial noise for CIL guided by information theory and propose Mixture of Noise (Min), aiming to mitigate the degradation of backbone generalization from adapting new tasks. Specifically, task-specific noise is learned from high-dimension features of new tasks. Then, a set of weights is adjusted dynamically for optimal mixture of different task noise. Finally, Min embeds the beneficial noise into the intermediate features to mask the response of inefficient patterns. Extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets demonstrate that Min achieves state-of-the-art performance in most incremental settings, with particularly outstanding results in 50-steps incremental settings. This shows the significant potential for beneficial noise in continual learning. Code is available atthis https URL.

  Ensuring reliability is paramount in deep learning, particularly within the domain of medical imaging, where diagnostic decisions often hinge on model outputs. The capacity to separate out-of-distribution (OOD) samples has proven to be a valuable indicator of a model's reliability in research. In medical imaging, this is especially critical, as identifying OOD inputs can help flag potential anomalies that might otherwise go undetected. While many OOD detection methods rely on feature or logit space representations, recent works suggest these approaches may not fully capture OOD diversity. To address this, we propose a novel OOD scoring mechanism, called NERO, that leverages neuron-level relevance at the feature layer. Specifically, we cluster neuron-level relevance for each in-distribution (ID) class to form representative centroids and introduce a relevance distance metric to quantify a new sample's deviation from these centroids, enhancing OOD separability. Additionally, we refine performance by incorporating scaled relevance in the bias term and combining feature norms. Our framework also enables explainable OOD detection. We validate its effectiveness across multiple deep learning architectures on the gastrointestinal imaging benchmarks Kvasir and GastroVision, achieving improvements over state-of-the-art OOD detection methods.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this work, we present SpaRC, a novel Sparse fusion transformer for 3D perception that integrates multi-view image semantics with Radar and Camera point features. The fusion of radar and camera modalities has emerged as an efficient perception paradigm for autonomous driving systems. While conventional approaches utilize dense Bird's Eye View (BEV)-based architectures for depth estimation, contemporary query-based transformers excel in camera-only detection through object-centric methodology. However, these query-based approaches exhibit limitations in false positive detections and localization precision due to implicit depth modeling. We address these challenges through three key contributions: (1) sparse frustum fusion (SFF) for cross-modal feature alignment, (2) range-adaptive radar aggregation (RAR) for precise object localization, and (3) local self-attention (LSA) for focused query aggregation. In contrast to existing methods requiring computationally intensive BEV-grid rendering, SpaRC operates directly on encoded point features, yielding substantial improvements in efficiency and accuracy. Empirical evaluations on the nuScenes and TruckScenes benchmarks demonstrate that SpaRC significantly outperforms existing dense BEV-based and sparse query-based detectors. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance metrics of 67.1 NDS and 63.1 AMOTA. The code and pretrained models are available atthis https URL.

  We revisit continual learning~(CL), which enables pre-trained vision transformers (ViTs) to sequentially fine-tune on new downstream tasks over time. However, as the scale of these models increases, catastrophic forgetting remains a more serious challenge. Recent studies highlight a crossover between CL techniques and parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), which focuses on fine-tuning only a small set of trainable parameters to adapt to downstream tasks, such as low-rank adaptation (LoRA). While LoRA achieves faster convergence and requires fewer trainable parameters, it has seldom been explored in the context of continual learning. To address this gap, we propose a novel PEFT-CL method called Dual Low-Rank Adaptation (DualLoRA), which introduces both an orthogonal LoRA adapter and a residual LoRA adapter parallel to pre-trained weights in each layer. These components are orchestrated by a dynamic memory mechanism to strike a balance between stability and plasticity. Additionally, we propose a scheme to predict task identity with confidence and calibrate the model's outputs accordingly. On ViT-based models, we demonstrate that DualLoRA offers significant advantages in accuracy, inference speed, and computation efficiency in training over existing CL methods across multiple benchmarks.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Evaluating image captions requires cohesive assessment of both visual semantics and language pragmatics, which is often not entirely captured by most metrics. We introduce Redemption Score(RS), a novel hybrid framework that ranks image captions by triangulating three complementary signals: (1) Mutual Information Divergence (MID) for global image-text distributional alignment, (2) DINO-based perceptual similarity of cycle-generated images for visual grounding, and (3) LLM Text Embeddings for contextual text similarity against human references. A calibrated fusion of these signals allows RS to offer a more holistic assessment. On the Flickr8k benchmark, RS achieves a Kendall-$\tau$ of 58.42, outperforming most prior methods and demonstrating superior correlation with human judgments without requiring task-specific training. Our framework provides a more robust and nuanced evaluation by thoroughly examining both the visual accuracy and text quality together, with consistent performance across Conceptual Captions and MS COCO.

  Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) captures spatial information along with dense spectral measurements across numerous narrow wavelength bands. This rich spectral content has the potential to facilitate robust robotic perception, particularly in environments with complex material compositions, varying illumination, or other visually challenging conditions. However, current HSI semantic segmentation methods underperform due to their reliance on architectures and learning frameworks optimized for RGB inputs. In this work, we propose a novel hyperspectral adapter that leverages pretrained vision foundation models to effectively learn from hyperspectral data. Our architecture incorporates a spectral transformer and a spectrum-aware spatial prior module to extract rich spatial-spectral features. Additionally, we introduce a modality-aware interaction block that facilitates effective integration of hyperspectral representations and frozen vision Transformer features through dedicated extraction and injection mechanisms. Extensive evaluations on three benchmark autonomous driving datasets demonstrate that our architecture achieves state-of-the-art semantic segmentation performance while directly using HSI inputs, outperforming both vision-based and hyperspectral segmentation methods.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this paper, we demonstrate that CLIP can also be adapted to downstream tasks where its vision-language alignment is suboptimally learned during pre-training on web-crawled data, all without requiring fine-tuning. We explore the case of monocular depth estimation, where CLIP's contrastive prior struggles to generalize, compared to its success in domains such as generative modeling and semantic segmentation. Since CLIP fails to consistently capture similarities between image patches and natural language prompts describing distance, we eliminate the use of its pre-trained natural language token embeddings and distill the semantic prior of its frozen text encoder into a single learnable embedding matrix called "mirror". The main design goal of mirror is to derive a non-human language prompt that approximates an optimal natural language prompt: "How far is this location from the camera?" Using this approach, we jointly train two lightweight modules, a mirror and a compact decoder, on top of a frozen CLIP for dense depth prediction. Compared to conventional depth models, our framework is significantly more efficient in terms of parameters and computation. The resulting model exhibits impressive performance, matching several state-of-the-art vision models on the NYU Depth v2 and KITTI benchmark datasets, while outperforming all vision-language depth models based on a frozen CLIP prior. Experiments demonstrate that the suboptimal depth understanding of CLIP in terms of spatial and temporal consistency can be significantly corrected without either fine-tuning it or concatenating mirror with its pre-trained subword token embeddings. Furthermore, an ablation study on the convergence status of mirror shows that it is implicitly trained to capture objects, such as humans and windows, where semantic cues play an important role in detection.

  Efficient data annotation remains a critical challenge in machine learning, particularly for object detection tasks requiring extensive labeled data. Active learning (AL) has emerged as a promising solution to minimize annotation costs by selecting the most informative samples. While traditional AL approaches primarily rely on uncertainty-based selection, recent advances suggest that incorporating diversity-based strategies can enhance sampling efficiency in object detection tasks. Our approach ensures the selection of representative examples that improve model generalization. We evaluate our method on two benchmark datasets (TableBank-LaTeX, TableBank-Word) using state-of-the-art table detection architectures, CascadeTabNet and YOLOv9. Our results demonstrate that AL-based example selection significantly outperforms random sampling, reducing annotation effort given a limited budget while maintaining comparable performance to fully supervised models. Our method achieves higher mAP scores within the same annotation budget.

  Despite the existing evolution of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), a non-neglectable limitation remains in their struggle with visual text grounding, especially in text-rich images of documents. Document images, such as scanned forms and infographics, highlight critical challenges due to their complex layouts and textual content. However, current benchmarks do not fully address these challenges, as they mostly focus on visual grounding on natural images, rather than text-rich document images. Thus, to bridge this gap, we introduce TRIG, a novel task with a newly designed instruction dataset for benchmarking and improving the Text-Rich Image Grounding capabilities of MLLMs in document question-answering. Specifically, we propose an OCR-LLM-human interaction pipeline to create 800 manually annotated question-answer pairs as a benchmark and a large-scale training set of 90$ synthetic data based on four diverse datasets. A comprehensive evaluation of various MLLMs on our proposed benchmark exposes substantial limitations in their grounding capability on text-rich images. In addition, we propose two simple and effective TRIG methods based on general instruction tuning and plug-and-play efficient embedding, respectively. By finetuning MLLMs on our synthetic dataset, they promisingly improve spatial reasoning and grounding capabilities.

  Medical imaging provides critical evidence for clinical diagnosis, treatment planning, and surgical decisions, yet most existing imaging models are narrowly focused and require multiple specialized networks, limiting their generalization. Although large-scale language and multimodal models exhibit strong reasoning and multi-task capabilities, real-world clinical applications demand precise visual grounding, multimodal integration, and chain-of-thought reasoning. We introduce Citrus-V, a multimodal medical foundation model that combines image analysis with textual reasoning. The model integrates detection, segmentation, and multimodal chain-of-thought reasoning, enabling pixel-level lesion localization, structured report generation, and physician-like diagnostic inference in a single framework. We propose a novel multimodal training approach and release a curated open-source data suite covering reasoning, detection, segmentation, and document understanding tasks. Evaluations demonstrate that Citrus-V outperforms existing open-source medical models and expert-level imaging systems across multiple benchmarks, delivering a unified pipeline from visual grounding to clinical reasoning and supporting precise lesion quantification, automated reporting, and reliable second opinions.

  Spatial reasoning is a key aspect of cognitive psychology and remains a bottleneck for current vision-language models (VLMs). While extensive research has aimed to evaluate or improve VLMs' understanding of basic spatial relations, such as distinguishing left from right, near from far, and object counting, these tasks cover only the most elementary layer of spatial reasoning and are largely approaching saturation in the latest reasoning models. In this work, we introduce OmniSpatial, a comprehensive and challenging benchmark for spatial reasoning, grounded in cognitive psychology. OmniSpatial covers four major categories: dynamic reasoning, complex spatial logic, spatial interaction, and perspective-taking, with 50 fine-grained subcategories. Through careful manual annotation, we construct over 8.4K question-answer pairs. Extensive experiments show that both open- and closed-source VLMs exhibit significant limitations in comprehensive spatial reasoning. We also explore two strategies-PointGraph (explicit scene graph cues) and SpatialCoT (novel-view chain-of-thought)-to bolster spatial reasoning.

  Recent benchmarks for medical Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) emphasize leaderboard accuracy, overlooking reliability and safety. We study sycophancy -- models' tendency to uncritically echo user-provided information -- in high-stakes clinical settings. We introduce EchoBench, a benchmark to systematically evaluate sycophancy in medical LVLMs. It contains 2,122 images across 18 departments and 20 modalities with 90 prompts that simulate biased inputs from patients, medical students, and physicians. We evaluate medical-specific, open-source, and proprietary LVLMs. All exhibit substantial sycophancy; the best proprietary model (Claude 3.7 Sonnet) still shows 45.98% sycophancy, and GPT-4.1 reaches 59.15%. Many medical-specific models exceed 95% sycophancy despite only moderate accuracy. Fine-grained analyses by bias type, department, perceptual granularity, and modality identify factors that increase susceptibility. We further show that higher data quality/diversity and stronger domain knowledge reduce sycophancy without harming unbiased accuracy. EchoBench also serves as a testbed for mitigation: simple prompt-level interventions (negative prompting, one-shot, few-shot) produce consistent reductions and motivate training- and decoding-time strategies. Our findings highlight the need for robust evaluation beyond accuracy and provide actionable guidance toward safer, more trustworthy medical LVLMs.

  Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL) must contend with the dual challenge of learning new classes from scarce samples while preserving old class knowledge. Existing methods use the frozen feature extractor and class-averaged prototypes to mitigate against catastrophic forgetting and overfitting. However, new-class prototypes suffer significant estimation bias due to extreme data scarcity, whereas base-class prototypes benefit from sufficient data. In this work, we theoretically demonstrate that aligning the new-class priors with old-class statistics via Bayesian analysis reduces variance and improves prototype accuracy. Furthermore, we propose large-scale contrastive learning to enforce cross-category feature tightness. To further enrich feature diversity and inject prior information for new-class prototypes, we integrate momentum self-supervision and virtual categories into the Momentum Tightness and Contrast framework (MoTiC), constructing a feature space with rich representations and enhanced interclass cohesion. Experiments on three FSCIL benchmarks produce state-of-the-art performances, particularly on the fine-grained task CUB-200, validating our method's ability to reduce estimation bias and improve incremental learning robustness.

  The success of Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly propelled the research of video understanding. To harvest the benefits of well-trained expert models (i.e., tools), video LLMs prioritize the exploration of tool usage capabilities. Existing methods either prompt closed-source LLMs or employ the instruction tuning paradigm for tool-use fine-tuning. These methods, however, assume an established repository of fixed tools and struggle to generalize to real-world environments where tool data is perpetually evolving and streaming in. To this end, we propose to enhance open-source video LLMs with COntinuaL Tool usage (termed COLT), which automatically acquires tool-use ability in a successive tool stream without suffering 'catastrophic forgetting' of the past learned tools. Specifically, our COLT incorporates a learnable tool codebook as a tool-specific memory system. Then relevant tools are dynamically selected based on the similarity between user instruction and tool features within the codebook. To unleash the tool usage potential of video LLMs, we collect a video-centric tool-use instruction tuning dataset VideoToolBench. Extensive experiments on both previous video LLM benchmarks and the tool-use-specific VideoToolBench dataset demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our proposed COLT.

  Accurate skin cancer diagnosis is vital for early treatment and improved patient outcomes. Deep learning (DL) models have shown promise in automating skin cancer classification, yet challenges remain due to data scarcity and limited uncertainty awareness. This study presents a comprehensive evaluation of DL-based skin lesion classification with transfer learning and uncertainty quantification (UQ) on the HAM10000 dataset. We benchmark several pre-trained feature extractors -- including CLIP variants, ResNet50, DenseNet121, VGG16, and EfficientNet-V2-Large -- combined with traditional classifiers such as SVM, XGBoost, and logistic regression. Multiple principal component analysis (PCA) settings (64, 128, 256, 512) are explored, with LAION CLIP ViT-H/14 and ViT-L/14 at PCA-256 achieving the strongest baseline results. In the UQ phase, Monte Carlo Dropout (MCD), Ensemble, and Ensemble Monte Carlo Dropout (EMCD) are applied and evaluated using uncertainty-aware metrics (UAcc, USen, USpe, UPre). Ensemble methods with PCA-256 provide the best balance between accuracy and reliability. Further improvements are obtained through feature fusion of top-performing extractors at PCA-256. Finally, we propose a feature-fusion based model trained with a predictive entropy (PE) loss function, which outperforms all prior configurations across both standard and uncertainty-aware evaluations, advancing trustworthy DL-based skin cancer diagnosis.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in foundation models highlight a clear trend toward unification and scaling, showing emergent capabilities across diverse domains. While image generation and editing have rapidly transitioned from task-specific to unified frameworks, video generation and editing remain fragmented due to architectural limitations and data scarcity. In this work, we introduce EditVerse, a unified framework for image and video generation and editing within a single model. By representing all modalities, i.e., text, image, and video, as a unified token sequence, EditVerse leverages self-attention to achieve robust in-context learning, natural cross-modal knowledge transfer, and flexible handling of inputs and outputs with arbitrary resolutions and durations. To address the lack of video editing training data, we design a scalable data pipeline that curates 232K video editing samples and combines them with large-scale image and video datasets for joint training. Furthermore, we present EditVerseBench, the first benchmark for instruction-based video editing covering diverse tasks and resolutions. Extensive experiments and user studies demonstrate that EditVerse achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing existing open-source and commercial models, while exhibiting emergent editing and generation abilities across modalities.

  The escalating economic losses in agriculture due to deer intrusion, estimated to be in the hundreds of millions of dollars annually in the U.S., highlight the inadequacy of traditional mitigation strategies since these methods are often labor-intensive, costly, and ineffective for modern farming systems. To overcome this, there is a critical need for intelligent, autonomous solutions which require accurate and efficient deer detection. But the progress in this field is impeded by a significant gap in the literature, mainly the lack of a domain-specific, practical dataset and limited study on the on-field deployability of deer detection systems. Addressing this gap, this study presents a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art deep learning models for deer detection in challenging real-world scenarios. The contributions of this work are threefold. First, we introduce a curated, publicly available dataset of 3,095 annotated images with bounding-box annotations of deer, derived from the Idaho Cameratraps project. Second, we provide an extensive comparative analysis of 12 model variants across four recent YOLO architectures(v8, v9, v10, and v11). Finally, we benchmarked performance on a high-end NVIDIA RTX 5090 GPU and evaluated on two representative edge computing platforms: Raspberry Pi 5 and NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier. Results show that the real-time detection is not feasible in Raspberry Pi without hardware-specific model optimization, while NVIDIA Jetson provides greater than 30 FPS with GPU-accelerated inference on 's' and 'n' series models. This study also reveals that smaller, architecturally advanced models such as YOLOv11n, YOLOv8s, and YOLOv9s offer the optimal balance of high accuracy (AP@.5 > 0.85) and computational efficiency (FPS > 30).

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Industrial anomaly segmentation relies heavily on pixel-level annotations, yet real-world anomalies are often scarce, diverse, and costly to label. Segmentation-oriented industrial anomaly synthesis (SIAS) has emerged as a promising alternative; however, existing methods struggle to balance sampling efficiency and generation quality. Moreover, most approaches treat all spatial regions uniformly, overlooking the distinct statistical differences between anomaly and background areas. This uniform treatment hinders the synthesis of controllable, structure-specific anomalies tailored for segmentation tasks. In this paper, we propose FAST, a foreground-aware diffusion framework featuring two novel modules: the Anomaly-Informed Accelerated Sampling (AIAS) and the Foreground-Aware Reconstruction Module (FARM). AIAS is a training-free sampling algorithm specifically designed for segmentation-oriented industrial anomaly synthesis, which accelerates the reverse process through coarse-to-fine aggregation and enables the synthesis of state-of-the-art segmentation-oriented anomalies in as few as 10 steps. Meanwhile, FARM adaptively adjusts the anomaly-aware noise within the masked foreground regions at each sampling step, preserving localized anomaly signals throughout the denoising trajectory. Extensive experiments on multiple industrial benchmarks demonstrate that FAST consistently outperforms existing anomaly synthesis methods in downstream segmentation tasks. We release the code at:this https URL.

  Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer and the leading cause of cancer-related mortality in women globally. Mammography is essential for the early detection and diagnosis of breast lesions. Despite recent progress in foundation models (FMs) for mammogram analysis, their clinical translation remains constrained by several fundamental limitations, including insufficient diversity in training data, limited model generalizability, and a lack of comprehensive evaluation across clinically relevant tasks. Here, we introduce VersaMammo, a versatile foundation model for mammograms, designed to overcome these limitations. We curated the largest multi-institutional mammogram dataset to date, comprising 706,239 images from 21 sources. To improve generalization, we propose a two-stage pre-training strategy to develop VersaMammo, a mammogram foundation model. First, a teacher model is trained via self-supervised learning to extract transferable features from unlabeled mammograms. Then, supervised learning combined with knowledge distillation transfers both features and clinical knowledge into VersaMammo. To ensure a comprehensive evaluation, we established a benchmark comprising 92 specific tasks, including 68 internal tasks and 24 external validation tasks, spanning 5 major clinical task categories: lesion detection, segmentation, classification, image retrieval, and visual question answering. VersaMammo achieves state-of-the-art performance, ranking first in 50 out of 68 specific internal tasks and 20 out of 24 external validation tasks, with average ranks of 1.5 and 1.2, respectively. These results demonstrate its superior generalization and clinical utility, offering a substantial advancement toward reliable and scalable breast cancer screening and diagnosis.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Computed tomography (CT) is one of the most widely used non-invasive imaging modalities for medical diagnosis. In clinical practice, CT images are usually acquired with large slice thicknesses due to the high cost of memory storage and operation time, resulting in an anisotropic CT volume with much lower inter-slice resolution than in-plane resolution. Since such inconsistent resolution may lead to difficulties in disease diagnosis, deep learning-based volumetric super-resolution methods have been developed to improve inter-slice resolution. Most existing methods conduct single-image super-resolution on the through-plane or synthesize intermediate slices from adjacent slices; however, the anisotropic characteristic of 3D CT volume has not been well explored. In this paper, we propose a novel cross-view texture transfer approach for CT slice interpolation by fully utilizing the anisotropic nature of 3D CT volume. Specifically, we design a unique framework that takes high-resolution in-plane texture details as a reference and transfers them to low-resolution through-plane images. To this end, we introduce a multi-reference non-local attention module that extracts meaningful features for reconstructing through-plane high-frequency details from multiple in-plane images. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our method performs significantly better in CT slice interpolation than existing competing methods on public CT datasets including a real-paired benchmark, verifying the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

  _Xuekang Zhu, Ji-Zhe Zhou, Kaiwen Feng, Chenfan Qu, Yunfei Wang, Liting Zhou, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Image manipulations often entail a complex manipulation process, comprising a series of editing operations to create a deceptive image, exhibiting sequentiality and hierarchical characteristics. However, existing IML methods remain manipulation-process-agnostic, directly producing localization masks in a one-shot prediction paradigm without modeling the underlying editing steps. This one-shot paradigm compresses the high-dimensional compositional space into a single binary mask, inducing severe dimensional collapse, thereby creating a fundamental mismatch with the intrinsic nature of the IML task.To address this, we are the first to reformulate image manipulation localization as a conditional sequence prediction task, proposing the RITA framework. RITA predicts manipulated regions layer-by-layer in an ordered manner, using each step's prediction as the condition for the next, thereby explicitly modeling temporal dependencies and hierarchical structures among editing operations.To enable training and evaluation, we synthesize multi-step manipulation data and construct a new benchmark HSIM. We further propose the HSS metric to assess sequential order and hierarchical alignment. Extensive experiments show RITA achieves SOTA on traditional benchmarks and provides a solid foundation for the novel hierarchical localization task, validating its potential as a general and effective paradigm. The code and dataset will be publicly available.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Human vision is capable of transforming two-dimensional observations into an egocentric three-dimensional scene understanding, which underpins the ability to translate complex scenes and exhibit adaptive behaviors. This capability, however, remains lacking in current autonomous driving systems, where mainstream approaches primarily rely on depth-based 3D reconstruction rather than true scene understanding. To address this limitation, we propose a novel human-like framework called OmniScene. First, we introduce the OmniScene Vision-Language Model (OmniVLM), a vision-language framework that integrates multi-view and temporal perception for holistic 4D scene understanding. Then, harnessing a teacher-student OmniVLM architecture and knowledge distillation, we embed textual representations into 3D instance features for semantic supervision, enriching feature learning, and explicitly capturing human-like attentional semantics. These feature representations are further aligned with human driving behaviors, forming a more human-like perception-understanding-action architecture. In addition, we propose a Hierarchical Fusion Strategy (HFS) to address imbalances in modality contributions during multimodal integration. Our approach adaptively calibrates the relative significance of geometric and semantic features at multiple abstraction levels, enabling the synergistic use of complementary cues from visual and textual modalities. This learnable dynamic fusion enables a more nuanced and effective exploitation of heterogeneous information. We evaluate OmniScene comprehensively on the nuScenes dataset, benchmarking it against over ten state-of-the-art models across various tasks. Our approach consistently achieves superior results, establishing new benchmarks in perception, prediction, planning, and visual question answering.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Audio-driven talking face generation has received growing interest, particularly for applications requiring expressive and natural human-avatar interaction. However, most existing emotion-aware methods rely on a single modality (either audio or image) for emotion embedding, limiting their ability to capture nuanced affective cues. Additionally, most methods condition on a single reference image, restricting the model's ability to represent dynamic changes in actions or attributes across time. To address these issues, we introduce SynchroRaMa, a novel framework that integrates a multi-modal emotion embedding by combining emotional signals from text (via sentiment analysis) and audio (via speech-based emotion recognition and audio-derived valence-arousal features), enabling the generation of talking face videos with richer and more authentic emotional expressiveness and fidelity. To ensure natural head motion and accurate lip synchronization, SynchroRaMa includes an audio-to-motion (A2M) module that generates motion frames aligned with the input audio. Finally, SynchroRaMa incorporates scene descriptions generated by Large Language Model (LLM) as additional textual input, enabling it to capture dynamic actions and high-level semantic attributes. Conditioning the model on both visual and textual cues enhances temporal consistency and visual realism. Quantitative and qualitative experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that SynchroRaMa outperforms the state-of-the-art, achieving improvements in image quality, expression preservation, and motion realism. A user study further confirms that SynchroRaMa achieves higher subjective ratings than competing methods in overall naturalness, motion diversity, and video smoothness.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Computational models that predict cellular phenotypic responses to chemical and genetic perturbations can accelerate drug discovery by prioritizing therapeutic hypotheses and reducing costly wet-lab iteration. However, extracting biologically meaningful and batch-robust cell painting representations remains challenging. Conventional self-supervised and contrastive learning approaches often require a large-scale model and/or a huge amount of carefully curated data, still struggling with batch effects. We present Cross-Well Aligned Masked Siamese Network (CWA-MSN), a novel representation learning framework that aligns embeddings of cells subjected to the same perturbation across different wells, enforcing semantic consistency despite batch effects. Integrated into a masked siamese architecture, this alignment yields features that capture fine-grained morphology while remaining data- and parameter-efficient. For instance, in a gene-gene relationship retrieval benchmark, CWA-MSN outperforms the state-of-the-art publicly available self-supervised (OpenPhenom) and contrastive learning (CellCLIP) methods, improving the benchmark scores by +29\% and +9\%, respectively, while training on substantially fewer data (e.g., 0.2M images for CWA-MSN vs. 2.2M images for OpenPhenom) or smaller model size (e.g., 22M parameters for CWA-MSN vs. 1.48B parameters for CellCLIP). Extensive experiments demonstrate that CWA-MSN is a simple and effective way to learn cell image representation, enabling efficient phenotype modeling even under limited data and parameter budgets.

  Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models are driving rapid progress in robotics by enabling agents to interpret multimodal inputs and execute complex, long-horizon tasks. However, their safety and robustness against adversarial attacks remain largely underexplored. In this work, we identify and formalize a critical adversarial vulnerability in which adversarial images can "freeze" VLA models and cause them to ignore subsequent instructions. This threat effectively disconnects the robot's digital mind from its physical actions, potentially inducing inaction during critical interventions. To systematically study this vulnerability, we propose FreezeVLA, a novel attack framework that generates and evaluates action-freezing attacks via min-max bi-level optimization. Experiments on three state-of-the-art VLA models and four robotic benchmarks show that FreezeVLA attains an average attack success rate of 76.2%, significantly outperforming existing methods. Moreover, adversarial images generated by FreezeVLA exhibit strong transferability, with a single image reliably inducing paralysis across diverse language prompts. Our findings expose a critical safety risk in VLA models and highlight the urgent need for robust defense mechanisms.

  The increasing realism of AI-generated images has raised serious concerns about misinformation and privacy violations, highlighting the urgent need for accurate and interpretable detection methods. While existing approaches have made progress, most rely on binary classification without explanations or depend heavily on supervised fine-tuning, resulting in limited generalization. In this paper, we propose ThinkFake, a novel reasoning-based and generalizable framework for AI-generated image detection. Our method leverages a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) equipped with a forgery reasoning prompt and is trained using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) reinforcement learning with carefully designed reward functions. This design enables the model to perform step-by-step reasoning and produce interpretable, structured outputs. We further introduce a structured detection pipeline to enhance reasoning quality and adaptability. Extensive experiments show that ThinkFake outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the GenImage benchmark and demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization on the challenging LOKI benchmark. These results validate our framework's effectiveness and robustness. Code will be released upon acceptance.

  Recent advances in Large Vision-Language models (LVLM) have spurred significant progress in document parsing task. Compared to traditional pipeline-based methods, end-to-end paradigms have shown their excellence in converting PDF images into structured outputs through integrated Optical Character Recognition (OCR), table recognition, mathematical formula recognition and so on. However, the absence of explicit analytical stages for document layouts and reading orders limits the LVLM's capability in handling complex document types such as multi-column newspapers or posters. To address this limitation, we propose in this report Logics-Parsing: an end-to-end LVLM-based model augmented with reinforcement learning. Our model incorporates meticulously designed reward mechanisms to optimize complex layout analysis and reading order inference. In addition, we expand the model's versatility by incorporating diverse data types such as chemical formulas and handwritten Chinese characters into supervised fine-tuning. Finally, to enable rigorous evaluation of our approach, we introduce LogicsParsingBench, a curated set of 1,078 page-level PDF images spanning nine major categories and over twenty sub-categories, which will be released later. Comprehensive experiments conducted on LogicsParsingBench have validated the efficacy and State-of-the-art (SOTA) performance of our proposed model across diverse document analysis scenarios.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Semi-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a promising paradigm in medical image segmentation, offering competitive performance while substantially reducing the need for extensive manual annotation. When combined with active learning (AL), these strategies further minimize annotation burden by selectively incorporating the most informative samples. However, conventional SSL_AL hybrid approaches often rely on iterative and loop-based retraining cycles after each annotation round, incurring significant computational overhead and limiting scalability in clinical applications. In this study, we present a novel, annotation-efficient, and self-adaptive deep segmentation framework that integrates SSL with entropy-based pseudo-label filtering (FilterMatch), an AL-inspired mechanism, within the single-pass nnU-Net training segmentation framework (nnFilterMatch). By selectively excluding high-confidence pseudo-labels during training, our method circumvents the need for retraining loops while preserving the benefits of uncertainty-guided learning. We validate the proposed framework across multiple clinical segmentation benchmarks and demonstrate that it achieves performance comparable to or exceeding fully supervised models, even with only 5\%--20\% labeled data. This work introduces a scalable, end-to-end learning strategy for reducing annotation demands in medical image segmentation without compromising accuracy. Code is available here:this https URL.

  Dataset distillation aims to generate compact synthetic datasets that enable models trained on them to achieve performance comparable to those trained on full real datasets, while substantially reducing storage and computational costs. Early bi-level optimization methods (e.g., MTT) have shown promising results on small-scale datasets, but their scalability is limited by high computational overhead. To address this limitation, recent decoupled dataset distillation methods (e.g., SRe$^2$L) separate the teacher model pre-training from the synthetic data generation process. These methods also introduce random data augmentation and epoch-wise soft labels during the post-evaluation phase to improve performance and generalization. However, existing decoupled distillation methods suffer from inconsistent post-evaluation protocols, which hinders progress in the field. In this work, we propose Rectified Decoupled Dataset Distillation (RD$^3$), and systematically investigate how different post-evaluation settings affect test accuracy. We further examine whether the reported performance differences across existing methods reflect true methodological advances or stem from discrepancies in evaluation procedures. Our analysis reveals that much of the performance variation can be attributed to inconsistent evaluation rather than differences in the intrinsic quality of the synthetic data. In addition, we identify general strategies that improve the effectiveness of distilled datasets across settings. By establishing a standardized benchmark and rigorous evaluation protocol, RD$^3$ provides a foundation for fair and reproducible comparisons in future dataset distillation research.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recently, visual prompt tuning is introduced to RGB-Thermal (RGB-T) tracking as a parameter-efficient finetuning (PEFT) method. However, these PEFT-based RGB-T tracking methods typically rely solely on spatial domain information as prompts for feature extraction. As a result, they often fail to achieve optimal performance by overlooking the crucial role of frequency-domain information in prompt learning. To address this issue, we propose an efficient Visual Fourier Prompt Tracking (named VFPTrack) method to learn modality-related prompts via Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). Our method consists of symmetric feature extraction encoder with shared parameters, visual fourier prompts, and Modality Fusion Prompt Generator that generates bidirectional interaction prompts through multi-modal feature fusion. Specifically, we first use a frozen feature extraction encoder to extract RGB and thermal infrared (TIR) modality features. Then, we combine the visual prompts in the spatial domain with the frequency domain prompts obtained from the FFT, which allows for the full extraction and understanding of modality features from different domain information. Finally, unlike previous fusion methods, the modality fusion prompt generation module we use combines features from different modalities to generate a fused modality prompt. This modality prompt is interacted with each individual modality to fully enable feature interaction across different modalities. Extensive experiments conducted on three popular RGB-T tracking benchmarks show that our method demonstrates outstanding performance.

  Guidelines for transthoracic echocardiographic examination recommend the acquisition of multiple video clips from different views of the heart, resulting in a large number of clips. Typically, automated methods, for instance disease classifiers, either use one clip or average predictions from all clips. Relying on one clip ignores complementary information available from other clips, while using all clips is computationally expensive and may be prohibitive for clinical adoption.To select the optimal subset of clips that maximize performance for a specific task (image-based disease classification), we propose a method optimized through reinforcement learning. In our method, an agent learns to either keep processing view-specific clips to reduce the disease classification uncertainty, or stop processing if the achieved classification confidence is sufficient. Furthermore, we propose a learnable attention-based aggregation method as a flexible way of fusing information from multiple clips. The proposed method obtains an AUC of 0.91 on the task of detecting cardiac amyloidosis using only 30% of all clips, exceeding the performance achieved from using all clips and from other benchmarks.

  Existing models often struggle with complex temporal changes, particularly when generating videos with gradual attribute transitions. The most common prompt interpolation approach for motion transitions often fails to handle gradual attribute transitions, where inconsistencies tend to become more pronounced. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective method to extend existing models for smooth and consistent attribute transitions, through introducing frame-wise guidance during the denoising process. Our approach constructs a data-specific transitional direction for each noisy latent, guiding the gradual shift from initial to final attributes frame by frame while preserving the motion dynamics of the video. Moreover, we present the Controlled-Attribute-Transition Benchmark (CAT-Bench), which integrates both attribute and motion dynamics, to comprehensively evaluate the performance of different models. We further propose two metrics to assess the accuracy and smoothness of attribute transitions. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach performs favorably against existing baselines, achieving visual fidelity, maintaining alignment with text prompts, and delivering seamless attribute transitions. Code and CATBench are released:this https URL.

  Vision Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated superior performance across a wide range of computer vision tasks. However, structured noise artifacts in their feature maps hinder downstream applications such as segmentation and depth estimation. We propose two novel and lightweight optimisation techniques- Structured Token Augmentation (STA) and Adaptive Noise Filtering (ANF)- to improve interpretability and mitigate these artefacts. STA enhances token diversity through spatial perturbations during tokenisation, while ANF applies learnable inline denoising between transformer layers. These methods are architecture-agnostic and evaluated across standard benchmarks, including ImageNet, Ade20k, and NYUv2. Experimental results show consistent improvements in visual quality and task performance, highlighting the practical effectiveness of our approach.

  Large vision-language models (VLMs) can jointly interpret images and text, but they are also prone to absorbing and reproducing harmful social stereotypes when visual cues such as age, gender, race, clothing, or occupation are present. To investigate these risks, we introduce a news-image benchmark consisting of 1,343 image-question pairs drawn from diverse outlets, which we annotated with ground-truth answers and demographic attributes (age, gender, race, occupation, and sports). We evaluate a range of state-of-the-art VLMs and employ a large language model (LLM) as judge, with human verification. Our findings show that: (i) visual context systematically shifts model outputs in open-ended settings; (ii) bias prevalence varies across attributes and models, with particularly high risk for gender and occupation; and (iii) higher faithfulness does not necessarily correspond to lower bias. We release the benchmark prompts, evaluation rubric, and code to support reproducible and fairness-aware multimodal assessment.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Grounding large language models (LLMs) in domain-specific tasks like post-hoc dash-cam driving video analysis is challenging due to their general-purpose training and lack of structured inductive biases. As vision is often the sole modality available for such analysis (i.e., no LiDAR, GPS, etc.), existing video-based vision-language models (V-VLMs) struggle with spatial reasoning, causal inference, and explainability of events in the input video. To this end, we introduce iFinder, a structured semantic grounding framework that decouples perception from reasoning by translating dash-cam videos into a hierarchical, interpretable data structure for LLMs. iFinder operates as a modular, training-free pipeline that employs pretrained vision models to extract critical cues -- object pose, lane positions, and object trajectories -- which are hierarchically organized into frame- and video-level structures. Combined with a three-block prompting strategy, it enables step-wise, grounded reasoning for the LLM to refine a peer V-VLM's outputs and provide accurate reasoning. Evaluations on four public dash-cam video benchmarks show that iFinder's proposed grounding with domain-specific cues, especially object orientation and global context, significantly outperforms end-to-end V-VLMs on four zero-shot driving benchmarks, with up to 39% gains in accident reasoning accuracy. By grounding LLMs with driving domain-specific representations, iFinder offers a zero-shot, interpretable, and reliable alternative to end-to-end V-VLMs for post-hoc driving video understanding.

  _Shufan Li, Jiuxiang Gu, Kangning Liu, Zhe Lin, Zijun Wei, Aditya Grover, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We propose Lavida-O, a unified Masked Diffusion Model (MDM) for multimodal understanding and generation. Unlike existing multimodal MDMs such as MMaDa and Muddit which only support simple image-level understanding tasks and low-resolution image generation, Lavida-O presents a single framework that enables image-level understanding, object grounding, image editing, and high-resolution (1024px) text-to-image synthesis. Lavida-O incorporates a novel Elastic Mixture-of-Transformers (Elastic-MoT) architecture that couples a lightweight generation branch with a larger understanding branch, supported by token compression, universal text conditioning and stratified sampling for efficient and high-quality generation. Lavida-O further incorporates planning and iterative self-reflection in image generation and editing tasks, seamlessly boosting generation quality with its understanding capabilities. Lavida-O achieves state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of benchmarks including RefCOCO object grounding, GenEval text-to-image generation, and ImgEdit image editing, outperforming existing autoregressive models and continuous diffusion models such as Qwen2.5-VL and FluxKontext-dev, while offering considerable speedup at inference. These advances establish Lavida-O as a new paradigm for scalable multimodal reasoning and generation.

  Recent works have made notable advancements in enhancing unified models for text-to-image generation through the Chain-of-Thought (CoT). However, these reasoning methods separate the processes of understanding and generation, which limits their ability to guide the reasoning of unified models in addressing the deficiencies of their generative capabilities. To this end, we propose a novel reasoning framework for unified models, Understanding-in-Generation (UiG), which harnesses the robust understanding capabilities of unified models to reinforce their performance in image generation. The core insight of our UiG is to integrate generative guidance by the strong understanding capabilities during the reasoning process, thereby mitigating the limitations of generative abilities. To achieve this, we introduce "Image Editing" as a bridge to infuse understanding into the generation process. Initially, we verify the generated image and incorporate the understanding of unified models into the editing instructions. Subsequently, we enhance the generated image step by step, gradually infusing the understanding into the generation process. Our UiG framework demonstrates a significant performance improvement in text-to-image generation over existing text-to-image reasoning methods, e.g., a 3.92% gain on the long prompt setting of the TIIF benchmark.

  The generalization ability of deep learning has been extensively studied in supervised settings, yet it remains less explored in unsupervised scenarios. Recently, the Unsupervised Domain Generalization (UDG) task has been proposed to enhance the generalization of models trained with prevalent unsupervised learning techniques, such as Self-Supervised Learning (SSL). UDG confronts the challenge of distinguishing semantics from variations without category labels. Although some recent methods have employed domain labels to tackle this issue, such domain labels are often unavailable in real-world contexts. In this paper, we address these limitations by formalizing UDG as the task of learning a Minimal Sufficient Semantic Representation: a representation that (i) preserves all semantic information shared across augmented views (sufficiency), and (ii) maximally removes information irrelevant to semantics (minimality). We theoretically ground these objectives from the perspective of information theory, demonstrating that optimizing representations to achieve sufficiency and minimality directly reduces out-of-distribution risk. Practically, we implement this optimization through Minimal-Sufficient UDG (MS-UDG), a learnable model by integrating (a) an InfoNCE-based objective to achieve sufficiency; (b) two complementary components to promote minimality: a novel semantic-variation disentanglement loss and a reconstruction-based mechanism for capturing adequate variation. Empirically, MS-UDG sets a new state-of-the-art on popular unsupervised domain-generalization benchmarks, consistently outperforming existing SSL and UDG methods, without category or domain labels during representation learning.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce VocAlign, a novel source-free domain adaptation framework specifically designed for VLMs in open-vocabulary semantic segmentation. Our method adopts a student-teacher paradigm enhanced with a vocabulary alignment strategy, which improves pseudo-label generation by incorporating additional class concepts. To ensure efficiency, we use Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to fine-tune the model, preserving its original capabilities while minimizing computational overhead. In addition, we propose a Top-K class selection mechanism for the student model, which significantly reduces memory requirements while further improving adaptation performance. Our approach achieves a notable 6.11 mIoU improvement on the CityScapes dataset and demonstrates superior performance on zero-shot segmentation benchmarks, setting a new standard for source-free adaptation in the open-vocabulary setting.

  The field of 4D world modeling - aiming to jointly capture spatial geometry and temporal dynamics - has witnessed remarkable progress in recent years, driven by advances in large-scale generative models and multimodal learning. However, the development of truly general 4D world models remains fundamentally constrained by the availability of high-quality data. Existing datasets and benchmarks often lack the dynamic complexity, multi-domain diversity, and spatial-temporal annotations required to support key tasks such as 4D geometric reconstruction, future prediction, and camera-control video generation. To address this gap, we introduce OmniWorld, a large-scale, multi-domain, multi-modal dataset specifically designed for 4D world modeling. OmniWorld consists of a newly collected OmniWorld-Game dataset and several curated public datasets spanning diverse domains. Compared with existing synthetic datasets, OmniWorld-Game provides richer modality coverage, larger scale, and more realistic dynamic interactions. Based on this dataset, we establish a challenging benchmark that exposes the limitations of current state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches in modeling complex 4D environments. Moreover, fine-tuning existing SOTA methods on OmniWorld leads to significant performance gains across 4D reconstruction and video generation tasks, strongly validating OmniWorld as a powerful resource for training and evaluation. We envision OmniWorld as a catalyst for accelerating the development of general-purpose 4D world models, ultimately advancing machines' holistic understanding of the physical world.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Our objective is to develop compact video representations that are sensitive to visual change over time. To measure such time-sensitivity, we introduce a new task: chiral action recognition, where one needs to distinguish between a pair of temporally opposite actions, such as "opening vs. closing a door", "approaching vs. moving away from something", "folding vs. unfolding paper", etc. Such actions (i) occur frequently in everyday life, (ii) require understanding of simple visual change over time (in object state, size, spatial position, count . . . ), and (iii) are known to be poorly represented by many video embeddings. Our goal is to build time aware video representations which offer linear separability between these chiral pairs. To that end, we propose a self-supervised adaptation recipe to inject time-sensitivity into a sequence of frozen image features. Our model is based on an auto-encoder with a latent space with inductive bias inspired by perceptual straightening. We show that this results in a compact but time-sensitive video representation for the proposed task across three datasets: Something-Something, EPIC-Kitchens, and Charade. Our method (i) outperforms much larger video models pre-trained on large-scale video datasets, and (ii) leads to an improvement in classification performance on standard benchmarks when combined with these existing models.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Conventional multi-object tracking (MOT) systems are predominantly designed for pedestrian tracking and often exhibit limited generalization to other object categories. This paper presents a generalized tracking framework capable of handling multiple object types, with a particular emphasis on vehicle tracking in complex traffic scenes. The proposed method incorporates two key components: (1) an occlusion-aware re-identification mechanism that enhances identity preservation for heavily occluded objects, and (2) a road-structure-aware tracklet refinement strategy that utilizes semantic scene priors such as lane directions, crosswalks, and road boundaries to improve trajectory continuity and accuracy. In addition, we introduce a new benchmark dataset comprising diverse vehicle classes with frame-level tracking annotations, specifically curated to support evaluation of vehicle-focused tracking methods. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves robust performance on both the newly introduced dataset and several public benchmarks, highlighting its effectiveness in general-purpose object tracking. While our framework is designed for generalized multi-class tracking, it also achieves strong performance on conventional benchmarks, with HOTA scores of 66.4 on MOT17 and 65.7 on MOT20 test sets.

  _Tan-Hanh Pham, Chris Ngo_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Many reasoning techniques for large multimodal models adapt language model approaches, such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, which express reasoning as word sequences. While effective for text, these methods are suboptimal for multimodal contexts, struggling to align audio, visual, and textual information dynamically. To explore an alternative paradigm, we propose the Multimodal Chain of Continuous Thought (MCOUT), which enables reasoning directly in a joint latent space rather than in natural language. In MCOUT, the reasoning state is represented as a continuous hidden vector, iteratively refined and aligned with visual and textual embeddings, inspired by human reflective cognition. We develop two variants: MCOUT-Base, which reuses the language model`s last hidden state as the continuous thought for iterative reasoning, and MCOUT-Multi, which integrates multimodal latent attention to strengthen cross-modal alignment between visual and textual features. Experiments on benchmarks including MMMU, ScienceQA, and MMStar show that MCOUT consistently improves multimodal reasoning, yielding up to 8.23% accuracy gains over strong baselines and improving BLEU scores up to 8.27% across multiple-choice and open-ended tasks. These findings highlight latent continuous reasoning as a promising direction for advancing LMMs beyond language-bound CoT, offering a scalable framework for human-like reflective multimodal inference.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  With the rapid development of MLLMs, evaluating their visual capabilities has become increasingly crucial. Current benchmarks primarily fall into two main types: basic perception benchmarks, which focus on local details but lack deep reasoning (e.g., "what is in the image?"), and mainstream reasoning benchmarks, which concentrate on prominent image elements but may fail to assess subtle clues requiring intricate analysis. However, profound visual understanding and complex reasoning depend more on interpreting subtle, inconspicuous local details than on perceiving salient, macro-level objects. These details, though occupying minimal image area, often contain richer, more critical information for robust analysis. To bridge this gap, we introduce the VER-Bench, a novel framework to evaluate MLLMs' ability to: 1) identify fine-grained visual clues, often occupying on average just 0.25% of the image area; 2) integrate these clues with world knowledge for complex reasoning. Comprising 374 carefully designed questions across Geospatial, Temporal, Situational, Intent, System State, and Symbolic reasoning, each question in VER-Bench is accompanied by structured evidence: visual clues and question-related reasoning derived from them. VER-Bench reveals current models' limitations in extracting subtle visual evidence and constructing evidence-based arguments, highlighting the need to enhance models's capabilities in fine-grained visual evidence extraction, integration, and reasoning for genuine visual understanding and human-like analysis.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Endoscopic procedures are essential for diagnosing and treating internal diseases, and multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) are increasingly applied to assist in endoscopy analysis. However, current benchmarks are limited, as they typically cover specific endoscopic scenarios and a small set of clinical tasks, failing to capture the real-world diversity of endoscopic scenarios and the full range of skills needed in clinical workflows. To address these issues, we introduce EndoBench, the first comprehensive benchmark specifically designed to assess MLLMs across the full spectrum of endoscopic practice with multi-dimensional capacities. EndoBench encompasses 4 distinct endoscopic scenarios, 12 specialized clinical tasks with 12 secondary subtasks, and 5 levels of visual prompting granularities, resulting in 6,832 rigorously validated VQA pairs from 21 diverse datasets. Our multi-dimensional evaluation framework mirrors the clinical workflow--spanning anatomical recognition, lesion analysis, spatial localization, and surgical operations--to holistically gauge the perceptual and diagnostic abilities of MLLMs in realistic scenarios. We benchmark 23 state-of-the-art models, including general-purpose, medical-specialized, and proprietary MLLMs, and establish human clinician performance as a reference standard. Our extensive experiments reveal: (1) proprietary MLLMs outperform open-source and medical-specialized models overall, but still trail human experts; (2) medical-domain supervised fine-tuning substantially boosts task-specific accuracy; and (3) model performance remains sensitive to prompt format and clinical task complexity. EndoBench establishes a new standard for evaluating and advancing MLLMs in endoscopy, highlighting both progress and persistent gaps between current models and expert clinical reasoning. We publicly release our benchmark and code.

  The ability to explain complex information from chart images is vital for effective data-driven decision-making. In this work, we address the challenge of generating detailed explanations alongside answering questions about charts. We present ChartQA-X, a comprehensive dataset comprising 30,299 chart samples across four chart types, each paired with contextually relevant questions, answers, and explanations. Explanations are generated and selected based on metrics such as faithfulness, informativeness, coherence, and perplexity. Our human evaluation with 245 participants shows that model-generated explanations in ChartQA-X surpass human-written explanations in accuracy and logic and are comparable in terms of clarity and overall quality. Moreover, models fine-tuned on ChartQA-X show substantial improvements across various metrics, including absolute gains of up to 24.57 points in explanation quality, 18.96 percentage points in question-answering accuracy, and 14.75 percentage points on unseen benchmarks for the same task. By integrating explanatory narratives with answers, our approach enables agents to convey complex visual information more effectively, improving comprehension and greater trust in the generated responses.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Existing 3D human pose estimation methods often suffer in performance, when applied to cross-scenario inference, due to domain shifts in characteristics such as camera viewpoint, position, posture, and body size. Among these factors, camera viewpoints and locations have been shown to contribute significantly to the domain gap by influencing the global positions of human poses. To address this, we propose a novel framework that explicitly conducts global transformations between pose positions in the camera coordinate systems of source and target domains. We start with a Pseudo-Label Generation Module that is applied to the 2D poses of the target dataset to generate pseudo-3D poses. Then, a Global Transformation Module leverages a human-centered coordinate system as a novel bridging mechanism to seamlessly align the positional orientations of poses across disparate domains, ensuring consistent spatial referencing. To further enhance generalization, a Pose Augmentor is incorporated to address variations in human posture and body size. This process is iterative, allowing refined pseudo-labels to progressively improve guidance for domain adaptation. Our method is evaluated on various cross-dataset benchmarks, including Human3.6M, MPI-INF-3DHP, and 3DPW. The proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches and even outperforms the target-trained model.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Single underwater image enhancement (UIE) is a challenging ill-posed problem, but its development is hindered by two major issues: (1) The labels in underwater reference datasets are pseudo labels, relying on these pseudo ground truths in supervised learning leads to domain discrepancy. (2) Underwater reference datasets are scarce, making training on such small datasets prone to overfitting and distribution shift. To address these challenges, we propose Trans-UIE, a transfer learning-based UIE model that captures the fundamental paradigms of UIE through pretraining and utilizes a dataset composed of both reference and non-reference datasets for fine-tuning. However, fine-tuning the model using only reconstruction loss may introduce confirmation bias. To mitigate this, our method leverages no-reference image quality assessment (NR-IQA) metrics from above-water scenes to guide the transfer learning process across domains while generating enhanced images with the style of the above-water image domain. Additionally, to reduce the risk of overfitting during the pretraining stage, we introduce Pearson correlation loss. Experimental results on both full-reference and no-reference underwater benchmark datasets demonstrate that Trans-UIE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

  As Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) develop, their potential security issues have become increasingly prominent. Machine Unlearning (MU), as an effective strategy for forgetting specific knowledge in training data, has been widely used in privacy protection. However, MU for safety in MLLM has yet to be fully explored. To address this issue, we propose SAFEERASER, a safety unlearning benchmark for MLLMs, consisting of 3,000 images and 28.8K VQA pairs. We comprehensively evaluate unlearning methods from two perspectives: forget quality and model utility. Our findings show that existing MU methods struggle to maintain model performance while implementing the forget operation and often suffer from over-forgetting. Hence, we introduce Prompt Decouple (PD) Loss to alleviate over-forgetting through decouple prompt during unlearning process. To quantitatively measure over-forgetting mitigated by PD Loss, we propose a new metric called Safe Answer Refusal Rate (SARR). Experimental results demonstrate that combining PD Loss with existing unlearning methods can effectively prevent over-forgetting and achieve a decrease of 79.5% in the SARR metric of LLaVA-7B and LLaVA-13B, while maintaining forget quality and model utility. Our code and dataset will be released upon acceptance. Warning: This paper contains examples of harmful language and images, and reader discretion is recommended.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Current video diffusion models achieve impressive generation quality but struggle in interactive applications due to bidirectional attention dependencies. The generation of a single frame requires the model to process the entire sequence, including the future. We address this limitation by adapting a pretrained bidirectional diffusion transformer to an autoregressive transformer that generates frames on-the-fly. To further reduce latency, we extend distribution matching distillation (DMD) to videos, distilling 50-step diffusion model into a 4-step generator. To enable stable and high-quality distillation, we introduce a student initialization scheme based on teacher's ODE trajectories, as well as an asymmetric distillation strategy that supervises a causal student model with a bidirectional teacher. This approach effectively mitigates error accumulation in autoregressive generation, allowing long-duration video synthesis despite training on short clips. Our model achieves a total score of 84.27 on the VBench-Long benchmark, surpassing all previous video generation models. It enables fast streaming generation of high-quality videos at 9.4 FPS on a single GPU thanks to KV caching. Our approach also enables streaming video-to-video translation, image-to-video, and dynamic prompting in a zero-shot manner.

  Hope speech language that fosters encouragement and optimism plays a vital role in promoting positive discourse online. However, its detection remains challenging, especially in multilingual and low-resource settings. This paper presents a multilingual framework for hope speech detection using an active learning approach and transformer-based models, including mBERT and XLM-RoBERTa. Experiments were conducted on datasets in English, Spanish, German, and Urdu, including benchmark test sets from recent shared tasks. Our results show that transformer models significantly outperform traditional baselines, with XLM-RoBERTa achieving the highest overall accuracy. Furthermore, our active learning strategy maintained strong performance even with small annotated datasets. This study highlights the effectiveness of combining multilingual transformers with data-efficient training strategies for hope speech detection.

  This paper introduces a simple and scalable approach to improve the data efficiency of large language model (LLM) training by augmenting existing text data with thinking trajectories. The compute for pre-training LLMs has been growing at an unprecedented rate, while the availability of high-quality data remains limited. Consequently, maximizing the utility of available data constitutes a significant research challenge. A primary impediment is that certain high-quality tokens are difficult to learn given a fixed model capacity, as the underlying rationale for a single token can be exceptionally complex and deep. To address this issue, we propose Thinking augmented Pre-Training (TPT), a universal methodology that augments text with automatically generated thinking trajectories. Such augmentation effectively increases the volume of the training data and makes high-quality tokens more learnable through step-by-step reasoning and decomposition. We apply TPT across diverse training configurations up to $100$B tokens, encompassing pre-training with both constrained and abundant data, as well as mid-training from strong open-source checkpoints. Experimental results indicate that our method substantially improves the performance of LLMs across various model sizes and families. Notably, TPT enhances the data efficiency of LLM pre-training by a factor of $3$. For a $3$B parameter model, it improves the post-training performance by over $10\%$ on several challenging reasoning benchmarks.

  We introduce ShinkaEvolve: a new open-source framework leveraging large language models (LLMs) to advance scientific discovery with state-of-the-art performance and unprecedented efficiency. Recent advances in scaling inference time compute of LLMs have enabled significant progress in generalized scientific discovery. These approaches rely on evolutionary agentic harnesses that leverage LLMs as mutation operators to generate candidate solutions. However, current code evolution methods suffer from critical limitations: they are sample inefficient, requiring thousands of samples to identify effective solutions, and remain closed-source, hindering broad adoption and extension. ShinkaEvolve addresses these limitations, introducing three key innovations: a parent sampling technique balancing exploration and exploitation, code novelty rejection-sampling for efficient search space exploration, and a bandit-based LLM ensemble selection strategy. We evaluate ShinkaEvolve across diverse tasks, demonstrating consistent improvements in sample efficiency and solution quality. ShinkaEvolve discovers a new state-of-the-art circle packing solution using only 150 samples, designs high-performing agentic harnesses for AIME mathematical reasoning tasks, identifies improvements to ALE-Bench competitive programming solutions, and discovers novel mixture-of-expert load balancing loss functions that illuminate the space of optimization strategies. Our results demonstrate that ShinkaEvolve achieves broad applicability with exceptional sample efficiency. By providing open-source accessibility and cost-efficiency, this work democratizes open-ended discovery across diverse computational problems.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive generative capabilities across diverse tasks but remain susceptible to hallucinations, confidently generated yet factually incorrect outputs. We introduce a reference-free, token-level hallucination detection framework that leverages the variance in token log-probabilities across multiple stochastic generations. Unlike prior methods that require ground-truth references or sentence-level verification, our approach is model-agnostic, interpretable, and suited for real-time or post-hoc analysis. We evaluate our method on unanswerable question prompts from the SQuAD v2 dataset and benchmark across three autoregressive models of varying scales: GPT-Neo 125M, Falcon 1B, and Mistral 7B. Through both quantitative metrics and visual diagnostics, we show that token-level variance reliably highlights instability in model outputs and correlates with hallucination patterns. Our framework is lightweight, reproducible, and adaptable to multiple domains, offering a valuable diagnostic tool for analyzing generative reliability in LLMs.

  The use of continuous instead of discrete tokens during the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) phase of reasoning LLMs has garnered attention recently, based on the intuition that a continuous mixture of discrete tokens could simulate a superposition of several reasoning paths simultaneously. Theoretical results have formally proven that continuous tokens have much greater expressivity and can solve specific problems more efficiently. However, practical use of continuous tokens has been limited by strong training difficulties: previous works either just use continuous tokens at inference time on a pre-trained discrete-token model, or must distill the continuous CoT from ground-truth discrete CoTs and face computational costs that limit the CoT to very few tokens.This is the first work introducing a scalable method to learn continuous CoTs via reinforcement learning (RL), without distilling from reference discrete CoTs. We use "soft" tokens: mixtures of tokens together with noise on the input embedding to provide RL exploration. Computational overhead is minimal, enabling us to learn continuous CoTs with hundreds of tokens. On math reasoning benchmarks with Llama and Qwen models up to 8B, training with continuous CoTs match discrete-token CoTs for pass@1 and surpass them for pass@32, showing greater CoT diversity. In systematic comparisons, the best-performing scenario is to train with continuous CoT tokens then use discrete tokens for inference, meaning the "soft" models can be deployed in a standard way. Finally, we show continuous CoT RL training better preserves the predictions of the base model on out-of-domain tasks, thus providing a softer touch to the base model.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly aligned with human preferences through Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). Among RLHF methods, Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has gained attention for its simplicity and strong performance, notably eliminating the need for a learned value function. However, GRPO implicitly assumes a balanced domain distribution and uniform semantic alignment across groups, assumptions that rarely hold in real-world datasets. When applied to multi-domain, imbalanced data, GRPO disproportionately optimizes for dominant domains, neglecting underrepresented ones and resulting in poor generalization and fairness. We propose Domain-Informed Self-Consistency Policy Optimization (DISCO), a principled extension to GRPO that addresses inter-group imbalance with two key innovations. Domain-aware reward scaling counteracts frequency bias by reweighting optimization based on domain prevalence. Difficulty-aware reward scaling leverages prompt-level self-consistency to identify and prioritize uncertain prompts that offer greater learning value. Together, these strategies promote more equitable and effective policy learning across domains. Extensive experiments across multiple LLMs and skewed training distributions show that DISCO improves generalization, outperforms existing GRPO variants by 5% on Qwen3 models, and sets new state-of-the-art results on multi-domain alignment benchmarks.

  Alignment is vital for safely deploying large language models (LLMs). Existing techniques are either reward-based (train a reward model on preference pairs and optimize with reinforcement learning) or reward-free (directly fine-tune on ranked outputs). Recent research shows that well-tuned reward-based pipelines remain robust, and single-response demonstrations can outperform pairwise preference data. However, two challenges persist: (1) imbalanced safety datasets that overrepresent common hazards while neglecting long-tail threats; and (2) static reward models that ignore task difficulty, limiting optimization efficiency and attainable gains. We propose DR-IRL (Dynamically adjusting Rewards through Inverse Reinforcement Learning). We first train category-specific reward models using a balanced safety dataset covering seven harmful categories via IRL. Then we enhance Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) by introducing dynamic reward scaling--adjusting rewards by task difficulty--data-level hardness by text encoder cosine similarity, model-level responsiveness by reward gaps. Extensive experiments across various benchmarks and LLMs demonstrate that DR-IRL outperforms all baseline methods in safety alignment while maintaining usefulness.

  We introduce EmbeddingGemma, a new lightweight, open text embedding model based on the Gemma 3 language model family. Our innovative training recipe strategically captures knowledge from larger models via encoder-decoder initialization and geometric embedding distillation. We improve model robustness and expressiveness with a spread-out regularizer, and ensure generalizability by merging checkpoints from varied, optimized mixtures. Evaluated on the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB) across multilingual, English, and code domains, EmbeddingGemma (300M) achieves state-of-the-art results. Notably, it outperforms prior top models, both proprietary and open, with fewer than 500M parameters, and provides performance comparable to models double its size, offering an exceptional performance-to-cost ratio. Remarkably, this lead persists when quantizing model weights or truncating embedding outputs. This makes EmbeddingGemma particularly well-suited for low-latency and high-throughput use cases such as on-device applications. We provide ablation studies exploring our key design choices. We release EmbeddingGemma to the community to promote further research.

  Despite advances in Neural Machine Translation (NMT), low-resource languages like Tigrinya remain underserved due to persistent challenges, including limited corpora, inadequate tokenization strategies, and the lack of standardized evaluation benchmarks. This paper investigates transfer learning techniques using multilingual pretrained models to enhance translation quality for morphologically rich, low-resource languages. We propose a refined approach that integrates language-specific tokenization, informed embedding initialization, and domain-adaptive fine-tuning. To enable rigorous assessment, we construct a high-quality, human-aligned English-Tigrinya evaluation dataset covering diverse domains. Experimental results demonstrate that transfer learning with a custom tokenizer substantially outperforms zero-shot baselines, with gains validated by BLEU, chrF, and qualitative human evaluation. Bonferroni correction is applied to ensure statistical significance across configurations. Error analysis reveals key limitations and informs targeted refinements. This study underscores the importance of linguistically aware modeling and reproducible benchmarks in bridging the performance gap for underrepresented languages.

  Reliable evaluation of large language models is essential to ensure their applicability in practical scenarios. Traditional benchmark-based evaluation methods often rely on fixed reference answers, limiting their ability to capture important qualitative aspects of generated responses. To address these shortcomings, we propose an integrated evaluation framework called \textit{self-refining descriptive evaluation with expert-driven diagnostics}, SPEED, which utilizes specialized functional experts to perform comprehensive, descriptive analyses of model outputs. Unlike conventional approaches, SPEED actively incorporates expert feedback across multiple dimensions, including hallucination detection, toxicity assessment, and lexical-contextual appropriateness. Experimental results demonstrate that SPEED achieves robust and consistent evaluation performance across diverse domains and datasets. Additionally, by employing relatively compact expert models, SPEED demonstrates superior resource efficiency compared to larger-scale evaluators. These findings illustrate that SPEED significantly enhances fairness and interpretability in LLM evaluations, offering a promising alternative to existing evaluation methodologies.

  India's linguistic landscape is one of the most diverse in the world, comprising over 120 major languages and approximately 1,600 additional languages, with 22 officially recognized as scheduled languages in the Indian Constitution. Despite recent progress in multilingual neural machine translation (NMT), high-quality parallel corpora for Indian languages remain scarce, especially across varied domains. In this paper, we introduce a large-scale, high-quality annotated parallel corpus covering 11 of these languages : English, Telugu, Hindi, Punjabi, Odia, Kashmiri, Sindhi, Dogri, Kannada, Urdu, and Gujarati comprising a total of 772,000 bi-text sentence pairs. The dataset is carefully curated and systematically categorized into three key domains: Government, Health, and General, to enable domain-aware machine translation research and facilitate effective domain adaptation. To demonstrate the utility of CorIL and establish strong benchmarks for future research, we fine-tune and evaluate several state-of-the-art NMT models, including IndicTrans2, NLLB, and BhashaVerse. Our analysis reveals important performance trends and highlights the corpus's value in probing model capabilities. For instance, the results show distinct performance patterns based on language script, with massively multilingual models showing an advantage on Perso-Arabic scripts (Urdu, Sindhi) while other models excel on Indic scripts. This paper provides a detailed domain-wise performance analysis, offering insights into domain sensitivity and cross-script transfer learning. By publicly releasing CorIL, we aim to significantly improve the availability of high-quality training data for Indian languages and provide a valuable resource for the machine translation research community.

  Domain-specific LLMs in TCM face limitations in research settings due to constrained adaptability, insufficient evaluation datasets, and limited computational resources. This study presents TianHui, a specialized TCM LLM built through contextual data integration and domain knowledge fusion. We constructed a large-scale TCM corpus (0.97GB unsupervised data + 611,312 QA pairs) and employed a two-stage training strategy with QLoRA, DeepSpeed Stage 2, and Flash Attention 2. Evaluation on 12 benchmarks showed TianHui ranked top-three in all metrics for six datasets (APQ, TCMCD, HFR, HCCA, DHPE, TLAW) and achieved top results in the other six (TCMEE, APR, GCPMI, TCMKQA, TCMRC, ADTG). Optimal configuration was identified as LoRA rank=128, alpha=256, epoch=4, dropout=0.2, max length=2048. TianHui enables systematic preservation and scalable application of TCM knowledge.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) have attracted significant attention due to their impressive general capabilities across diverse downstream tasks. However, without domain-specific optimization, they often underperform on specialized knowledge benchmarks and even produce hallucination. Recent studies show that strategically infusing domain knowledge during pretraining can substantially improve downstream performance. A critical challenge lies in balancing this infusion trade-off: injecting too little domain-specific data yields insufficient specialization, whereas excessive infusion triggers catastrophic forgetting of previously acquired knowledge. In this work, we focus on the phenomenon of memory collapse induced by over-infusion. Through systematic experiments, we make two key observations, i.e. 1) Critical collapse point: each model exhibits a threshold beyond which its knowledge retention capabilities sharply degrade. 2) Scale correlation: these collapse points scale consistently with the model's size. Building on these insights, we propose a knowledge infusion scaling law that predicts the optimal amount of domain knowledge to inject into large LLMs by analyzing their smaller counterparts. Extensive experiments across different model sizes and pertaining token budgets validate both the effectiveness and generalizability of our scaling law.

  _Ruanjun Li, Ziheng Liu, Yuanming Shi, Jiawei Shao, Chi Zhang, Xuelong Li_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) deliver impressive generation quality, but incur very high inference cost because each output token is generated auto-regressively through all model layers. Early-exit based self-speculative decoding (EESD) has emerged to mitigate this cost. However, in practice, many approaches struggle to achieve the expected acceleration in such draft-then-verify paradigm even with a well-aligned early-exit head and selected exit position. Our analysis reveals that EESD only pays off when the vast majority of draft tokens are accepted by the LLM. Otherwise, the draft cost may overcome the acceleration gain and lead to a negative speedup. To mitigate this, we propose Pipeline-Parallel Self-Speculative Decoding (PPSD) that fully pipelines the draft and verification work so that no effort is wasted on failed predictions. It has two key innovations. We configure the model layers as a pipeline in which early-exit (draft) computations and remaining-layer (verification) computations overlap. We interleave drafting and verification per token. While the LLM is verifying the current token in its final layers, the early-exit path simultaneously drafts the next token. Such a verify-while-draft scheme keeps all units busy and validates tokens on-the-fly analogous to pipelining the speculation and verification stages. Empirical results confirm that PPSD achieves state-of-the-art acceleration in self-speculative LLM inference. On diverse benchmarks, PPSD achieves speedup ratios in the range of 2.01x~3.81x, which gains almost the optimal acceleration at the fixed acceptance rate and exit position, showcasing its advancement in providing efficient self-speculation.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Standard offline evaluations for language models -- a series of independent, state-less inferences made by models -- fail to capture how language models actually behave in practice, where personalization fundamentally alters model behavior. For instance, identical benchmark questions to the same language model can produce markedly different responses when prompted to a state-less system, in one user's chat session, or in a different user's chat session. In this work, we provide empirical evidence showcasing this phenomenon by comparing offline evaluations to field evaluations conducted by having 800 real users of ChatGPT and Gemini pose benchmark and other provided questions to their chat interfaces.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent years have witnessed a growing interest in personalizing the responses of large language models (LLMs). While existing evaluations primarily focus on whether a response aligns with a user's preferences, we argue that factuality is an equally important yet often overlooked dimension. In the context of personalization, we define a model as robust if its responses are both factually accurate and align with the user preferences. To assess this, we introduce PERG, a scalable framework for evaluating robustness in LLMs, along with a new dataset, PERGData. We evaluate fourteen models from five different model families using different prompting methods. Our findings show that current LLMs struggle with robust personalization: even the strongest models (GPT-4.1, LLaMA3-70B) fail to maintain correctness in 5% of previously successful cases without personalization, while smaller models (e.g., 7B-scale) can fail more than 20% of the time. Further analysis reveals that robustness is significantly affected by the nature of the query and the type of user preference. To mitigate these failures, we propose Pref-Aligner, a two-stage approach that improves robustness by an average of 25% across models. Our work highlights critical gaps in current evaluation practices and introduces tools and metrics to support more reliable, user-aligned LLM deployments.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The widespread presence of incomplete modalities in multimodal data poses a significant challenge to achieving accurate rumor detection. Existing multimodal rumor detection methods primarily focus on learning joint modality representations from \emph{complete} multimodal training data, rendering them ineffective in addressing the common occurrence of \emph{missing modalities} in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical soft prompt model \textsf{TriSPrompt}, which integrates three types of prompts, \textit{i.e.}, \emph{modality-aware} (MA) prompt, \emph{modality-missing} (MM) prompt, and \emph{mutual-views} (MV) prompt, to effectively detect rumors in incomplete multimodal data. The MA prompt captures both heterogeneous information from specific modalities and homogeneous features from available data, aiding in modality recovery. The MM prompt models missing states in incomplete data, enhancing the model's adaptability to missing information. The MV prompt learns relationships between subjective (\textit{i.e.}, text and image) and objective (\textit{i.e.}, comments) perspectives, effectively detecting rumors. Extensive experiments on three real-world benchmarks demonstrate that \textsf{TriSPrompt} achieves an accuracy gain of over 13\% compared to state-of-the-art methods.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multi-modal generative document parsing systems challenge traditional evaluation: unlike deterministic OCR or layout models, they often produce semantically correct yet structurally divergent outputs. Conventional metrics-CER, WER, IoU, or TEDS-misclassify such diversity as error, penalizing valid interpretations and obscuring system behavior.We introduce SCORE (Structural and COntent Robust Evaluation), an interpretation-agnostic framework that integrates (i) adjusted edit distance for robust content fidelity, (ii) token-level diagnostics to distinguish hallucinations from omissions, (iii) table evaluation with spatial tolerance and semantic alignment, and (iv) hierarchy-aware consistency checks. Together, these dimensions enable evaluation that embraces representational diversity while enforcing semantic rigor.Across 1,114 pages spanning a holistic benchmark and a field dataset, SCORE consistently revealed cross-dataset performance patterns missed by standard metrics. In 2-5% of pages with ambiguous table structures, traditional metrics penalized systems by 12-25% on average, leading to distorted rankings. SCORE corrected these cases, recovering equivalence between alternative but valid interpretations. Moreover, by normalizing generative outputs into a format-agnostic representation, SCORE reproduces traditional scores (e.g., table F1 up to 0.93) without requiring object-detection pipelines, demonstrating that generative parsing alone suffices for comprehensive evaluation.By exposing how interpretive diversity impacts evaluation outcomes and providing multi-dimensional, interpretable diagnostics, SCORE establishes foundational principles for semantically grounded, fair, and practical benchmarking of modern document parsing systems.

  The surge in scientific submissions has placed increasing strain on the traditional peer-review process, prompting the exploration of large language models (LLMs) for automated review generation. While LLMs demonstrate competence in producing structured and coherent feedback, their capacity for critical reasoning, contextual grounding, and quality sensitivity remains limited. To systematically evaluate these aspects, we propose a comprehensive evaluation framework that integrates semantic similarity analysis and structured knowledge graph metrics to assess LLM-generated reviews against human-written counterparts. We construct a large-scale benchmark of 1,683 papers and 6,495 expert reviews from ICLR and NeurIPS in multiple years, and generate reviews using five LLMs. Our findings show that LLMs perform well in descriptive and affirmational content, capturing the main contributions and methodologies of the original work, with GPT-4o highlighted as an illustrative example, generating 15.74% more entities than human reviewers in the strengths section of good papers in ICLR 2025. However, they consistently underperform in identifying weaknesses, raising substantive questions, and adjusting feedback based on paper quality. GPT-4o produces 59.42% fewer entities than real reviewers in the weaknesses and increases node count by only 5.7% from good to weak papers, compared to 50% in human reviews. Similar trends are observed across all conferences, years, and models, providing empirical foundations for understanding the merits and defects of LLM-generated reviews and informing the development of future LLM-assisted reviewing tools.

  Vector comparison in high dimensions is a fundamental task in NLP, yet it is dominated by two baselines: the raw dot product, which is unbounded and sensitive to vector norms, and the cosine similarity, which discards magnitude information entirely. This paper challenges both standards by proposing and rigorously evaluating a new class of parameter-free, magnitude-aware similarity metrics. I introduce two such functions, Overlap Similarity (OS) and Hyperbolic Tangent Similarity (HTS), designed to integrate vector magnitude and alignment in a more principled manner. To ensure that my findings are robust and generalizable, I conducted a comprehensive evaluation using four state-of-the-art sentence embedding models (all-MiniLM-L6-v2, all-mpnet-base-v2, paraphrase-mpnet-base-v2, and BAAI/bge-large-en-v1.5) across a diverse suite of eight standard NLP benchmarks, including STS-B, SICK, Quora, and PAWS. Using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test for statistical significance, my results are definitive: on the tasks requiring holistic semantic understanding (paraphrase and inference), both OS and HTS provide a statistically significant improvement in Mean Squared Error over both the raw dot product and cosine similarity, regardless of the underlying embeddingthis http URL, my findings delineate the specific domain of advantage for these metrics: for tasks requiring holistic semantic understanding like paraphrase and inference, my magnitude-aware metrics offer a statistically superior alternative. This significant improvement was not observed on benchmarks designed to test highly nuanced compositional semantics (SICK, STS-B), identifying the challenge of representing compositional text as a distinct and important direction for future work.

  The recent shift toward the Health Level Seven Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (HL7 FHIR) standard opens a new frontier for clinical AI, demanding LLM agents to navigate complex, resource-based data models instead of conventional structured health data. However, existing benchmarks have lagged behind this transition, lacking the realism needed to evaluate recent LLMs on interoperable clinical data. To bridge this gap, we introduce FHIR-AgentBench, a benchmark that grounds 2,931 real-world clinical questions in the HL7 FHIR standard. Using this benchmark, we systematically evaluate agentic frameworks, comparing different data retrieval strategies (direct FHIR API calls vs. specialized tools), interaction patterns (single-turn vs. multi-turn), and reasoning strategies (natural language vs. code generation). Our experiments highlight the practical challenges of retrieving data from intricate FHIR resources and the difficulty of reasoning over them, both of which critically affect question answering performance. We publicly release the FHIR-AgentBench dataset and evaluation suite (this https URL) to promote reproducible research and the development of robust, reliable LLM agents for clinical applications.

  Scientific literature question answering is a pivotal step towards new scientific discoveries. Recently, \textit{two-stage} retrieval-augmented generated large language models (RAG-LLMs) have shown impressive advancements in this domain. Such a two-stage framework, especially the second stage (reranker), is particularly essential in the scientific domain, where subtle differences in terminology may have a greatly negative impact on the final factual-oriented or knowledge-intensive answers. Despite this significant progress, the potential and limitations of these works remain unexplored. In this work, we present a Scientific Rerank-oriented RAG Benchmark (SciRerankBench), for evaluating rerankers within RAG-LLMs systems, spanning five scientific subjects. To rigorously assess the reranker performance in terms of noise resilience, relevance disambiguation, and factual consistency, we develop three types of question-context-answer (Q-C-A) pairs, i.e., Noisy Contexts (NC), Semantically Similar but Logically Irrelevant Contexts (SSLI), and Counterfactual Contexts (CC). Through systematic evaluation of 13 widely used rerankers on five families of LLMs, we provide detailed insights into their relative strengths and limitations. To the best of our knowledge, SciRerankBench is the first benchmark specifically developed to evaluate rerankers within RAG-LLMs, which provides valuable observations and guidance for their future development.

  Large Language Models (LLMs), despite their success in question answering, exhibit limitations in complex multi-hop question answering (MQA) tasks that necessitate non-linear, structured reasoning. This limitation stems from their inability to adequately capture deep conceptual relationships between entities. To overcome this challenge, we present **ORACLE** (**O**ntology-driven **R**easoning **A**nd **C**hain for **L**ogical **E**ucidation), a training-free framework that combines LLMs' generative capabilities with the structural benefits of knowledge graphs. Our approach operates through three stages: (1) dynamic construction of question-specific knowledge ontologies using LLMs, (2) transformation of these ontologies into First-Order Logic reasoning chains, and (3) systematic decomposition of the original query into logically coherent sub-questions. Experimental results on several standard MQA benchmarks show that our framework achieves highly competitive performance, rivaling current state-of-the-art models like DeepSeek-R1. Detailed analyses further confirm the effectiveness of each component, while demonstrating that our method generates more logical and interpretable reasoning chains than existing approaches.

  The rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs) have led to the emergence of routing techniques, which aim to efficiently select the optimal LLM from diverse candidates to tackle specific tasks, optimizing performance while reducing costs. Current LLM routing methods are limited in effectiveness due to insufficient exploration of the intrinsic connection between user queries and the characteristics of LLMs. To address this issue, in this paper, we present RadialRouter, a novel framework for LLM routing which employs a lightweight Transformer-based backbone with a radial structure named RadialFormer to articulate the query-LLMs relationship. The optimal LLM selection is performed based on the final states of RadialFormer. The pipeline is further refined by an objective function that combines Kullback-Leibler divergence with the query-query contrastive loss to enhance robustness. Experimental results on RouterBench show that RadialRouter significantly outperforms existing routing methods by 9.2\% and 5.8\% in the Balance and Cost First scenarios, respectively. Additionally, its adaptability toward different performance-cost trade-offs and the dynamic LLM pool demonstrates practical application potential.

  _Gagan Bhatia, Maxime Peyrard, Wei Zhao_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Modern BPE tokenizers often split calendar dates into meaningless fragments, e.g., 20250312 $\rightarrow$ 202, 503, 12, inflating token counts and obscuring the inherent structure needed for robust temporal reasoning. In this work, we (1) introduce a simple yet interpretable metric, termed date fragmentation ratio, that measures how faithfully a tokenizer preserves multi-digit date components; (2) release DateAugBench, a suite of 6500 examples spanning three temporal reasoning tasks: context-based date resolution, format-invariance puzzles, and date arithmetic across historical, contemporary, and future time periods; and (3) through layer-wise probing and causal attention-hop analyses, uncover an emergent date-abstraction mechanism whereby large language models stitch together the fragments of month, day, and year components for temporal reasoning. Our experiments show that excessive fragmentation correlates with accuracy drops of up to 10 points on uncommon dates like historical and futuristic dates. Further, we find that the larger the model, the faster the emergent date abstraction that heals date fragments is accomplished. Lastly, we observe a reasoning path that LLMs follow to assemble date fragments, typically differing from human interpretation (year $\rightarrow$ month $\rightarrow$ day).

  Continued pretraining and instruction tuning on large-scale multilingual data have proven to be effective in scaling large language models (LLMs) to low-resource languages. However, the unaligned nature of such data limits its ability to effectively capture cross-lingual semantics. In contrast, multi-way parallel data, where identical content is aligned across multiple languages, provides stronger cross-lingual consistency and offers greater potential for improving multilingual performance. In this paper, we introduce a large-scale, high-quality multi-way parallel corpus, TED2025, based on TED Talks. The corpus spans 113 languages, with up to 50 languages aligned in parallel, ensuring extensive multilingual coverage. Using this dataset, we investigate best practices for leveraging multi-way parallel data to enhance LLMs, including strategies for continued pretraining, instruction tuning, and the analysis of key influencing factors. Experiments on six multilingual benchmarks show that models trained on multiway parallel data consistently outperform those trained on unaligned multilingual data.

  Developing interactive agents that can understand language, perceive their surroundings, and act within the physical world is a long-standing goal of AI research. The Minecraft Collaborative Building Task (MCBT) (Narayan-Chen, Jayannavar, and Hockenmaier 2019), a two-player game in which an Architect (A) instructs a Builder (B) to construct a target structure in a simulated 3D Blocks World environment, offers a rich platform to work towards this goal. In this work, we focus on the Builder Action Prediction (BAP) subtask: predicting B's actions in a multimodal game context (Jayannavar, Narayan-Chen, and Hockenmaier 2020) - a challenging testbed for grounded instruction following, with limited training data. We holistically re-examine this task and introduce BAP v2 to address key challenges in evaluation, training data, and modeling. Specifically, we define an enhanced evaluation benchmark, featuring a cleaner test set and fairer, more insightful metrics that also reveal spatial reasoning as the primary performance bottleneck. To address data scarcity and to teach models basic spatial skills, we generate different types of synthetic MCBT data. We observe that current, LLM-based SOTA models trained on the human BAP dialogues fail on these simpler, synthetic BAP ones, but show that training models on this synthetic data improves their performance across the board. We also introduce a new SOTA model, Llama-CRAFTS, which leverages richer input representations, and achieves an F1 score of 53.0 on the BAP v2 task and strong performance on the synthetic data. While this result marks a notable 6 points improvement over previous work, it also underscores the task's remaining difficulty, establishing BAP v2 as a fertile ground for future research, and providing a useful measure of the spatial capabilities of current text-only LLMs in such embodied tasks.

  Accurately measuring gender stereotypical bias in language models is a complex task with many hidden aspects. Current benchmarks have underestimated this multifaceted challenge and failed to capture the full extent of the problem. This paper examines the inconsistencies between intrinsic stereotype benchmarks. We propose that currently available benchmarks each capture only partial facets of gender stereotypes, and when considered in isolation, they provide just a fragmented view of the broader landscape of bias in language models. Using StereoSet and CrowS-Pairs as case studies, we investigated how data distribution affects benchmark results. By applying a framework from social psychology to balance the data of these benchmarks across various components of gender stereotypes, we demonstrated that even simple balancing techniques can significantly improve the correlation between different measurement approaches. Our findings underscore the complexity of gender stereotyping in language models and point to new directions for developing more refined techniques to detect and reduce bias.

  Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) improves language model reasoning by using rule-based rewards in verifiable domains such as mathematics and code. However, RLVR leads to limited generalization for open-ended tasks -- such as writing outline essays or making meal plans -- where humans reason routinely. This paper shows that the RLVR paradigm is effective beyond verifiable domains, and introduces **RL** with **M**odel-rewarded **T**hinking (**RLMT**) for general-purpose chat capabilities. Using diverse real-world prompts, RLMT requires LMs to generate long CoT reasoning before response, and optimizes them with online RL against a preference-based reward model used in RLHF. Across 40 training runs on Llama-3.1-8B and Qwen-2.5-7B (both base and instruct) and multiple optimization algorithms (DPO, PPO, and GRPO), RLMT consistently outperforms standard RLHF pipelines. This includes substantial gains of 3-7 points on three chat benchmarks (AlpacaEval2, WildBench, and ArenaHardV2), along with 1-3 point improvements on other tasks like creative writing and general knowledge. Our best 8B model surpasses GPT-4o in chat and creative writing and rivals Claude-3.7-Sonnet (Thinking). RLMT can also be applied directly to base models without an SFT stage, akin to R1-Zero training. Remarkably, with only 7K prompts, Llama-3.1-8B base trained with our RLMT recipe outperforms Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct post-trained with a complex multi-staged pipeline with 25M+ examples. We close with qualitative and quantitative analyses of how trained models plan their responses. Our results rethink the post-training pipeline and call upon future work to understand and employ thinking more broadly.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Preference learning methods such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) have become standard for Large Language Model (LLM) post-training, yet they are often ineffective for mathematical reasoning. A key challenge is the large token overlap between preferred and dispreferred trajectories; lowering the probability of dispreferred trajectories also reduces the probability of shared useful tokens, leading to over-penalization and overall performance collapse. As a mitigation, existing algorithms include the probability of a trajectory under the current policy as a regularization term, which decreases the effect of the gradient when the probability is low. However, by the time this effect takes hold, useful tokens may have already been over-penalized as the model has begun to degrade. To address this, we propose Future Policy Aware (FPA) preference learning, which replaces the current policy with a future policy in the regularization term. This future policy is estimated via lightweight, logit-space extrapolation from a reference model toward the current model. FPA enables safer training by preemptively regularizing potentially problematic gradients. We apply FPA to DPO, RPO, and SimPER and evaluate them on the MATH and GSM8K benchmarks. FPA yields consistent performance gains, with the largest improvements observed with SimPER, achieving gains of up to 5.75%. We demonstrate that FPA provides proactive regularization while preserving the probability of shared, useful mathematical tokens, and enables longer, degradation-free training with negligible computational overhead. We will release our code publicly upon publication.

  As Speech Large Language Models (Speech LLMs) become increasingly integrated into voice-based applications, ensuring their robustness against manipulative or adversarial input becomes critical. Although prior work has studied adversarial attacks in text-based LLMs and vision-language models, the unique cognitive and perceptual challenges of speech-based interaction remain underexplored. In contrast, speech presents inherent ambiguity, continuity, and perceptual diversity, which make adversarial attacks more difficult to detect. In this paper, we introduce gaslighting attacks, strategically crafted prompts designed to mislead, override, or distort model reasoning as a means to evaluate the vulnerability of Speech LLMs. Specifically, we construct five manipulation strategies: Anger, Cognitive Disruption, Sarcasm, Implicit, and Professional Negation, designed to test model robustness across varied tasks. It is worth noting that our framework captures both performance degradation and behavioral responses, including unsolicited apologies and refusals, to diagnose different dimensions of susceptibility. Moreover, acoustic perturbation experiments are conducted to assess multi-modal robustness. To quantify model vulnerability, comprehensive evaluation across 5 Speech and multi-modal LLMs on over 10,000 test samples from 5 diverse datasets reveals an average accuracy drop of 24.3% under the five gaslighting attacks, indicating significant behavioral vulnerability. These findings highlight the need for more resilient and trustworthy speech-based AI systems.

  High lexical variation, ambiguous references, and long-range dependencies make entity resolution in literary texts particularly challenging. We present MahƒÅnƒÅma, the first large-scale dataset for end-to-end Entity Discovery and Linking (EDL) in Sanskrit, a morphologically rich and under-resourced language. Derived from the MahƒÅbhƒÅrata, the world's longest epic, the dataset comprises over 109K named entity mentions mapped to 5.5K unique entities, and is aligned with an English knowledge base to support cross-lingual linking. The complex narrative structure of MahƒÅnƒÅma, coupled with extensive name variation and ambiguity, poses significant challenges to resolution systems. Our evaluation reveals that current coreference and entity linking models struggle when evaluated on the global context of the test set. These results highlight the limitations of current approaches in resolving entities within such complex discourse. MahƒÅnƒÅma thus provides a unique benchmark for advancing entity resolution, especially in literary domains.

  We investigate whether large language models encode latent knowledge of frame semantics, focusing on frame identification, a core challenge in frame semantic parsing that involves selecting the appropriate semantic frame for a target word in context. Using the FrameNet lexical resource, we evaluate models under prompt-based inference and observe that they can perform frame identification effectively even without explicit supervision. To assess the impact of task-specific training, we fine-tune the model on FrameNet data, which substantially improves in-domain accuracy while generalizing well to out-of-domain benchmarks. Further analysis shows that the models can generate semantically coherent frame definitions, highlighting the model's internalized understanding of frame semantics.

  This study presents a novel dual-perspective approach to analyzing user reviews for ChatGPT and DeepSeek on the Google Play Store, integrating lexicon-based sentiment analysis (TextBlob) with deep learning classification models, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory (Bi LSTM) Networks. Unlike prior research, which focuses on either lexicon-based strategies or predictive deep learning models in isolation, this study conducts an extensive investigation into user satisfaction with Large Language Model (LLM) based applications. A Dataset of 4,000 authentic user reviews was collected, which were carefully preprocessed and subjected to oversampling to achieve balanced classes. The balanced test set of 1,700 Reviews were used for model testing. Results from the experiments reveal that ChatGPT received significantly more positive sentiment than DeepSeek. Furthermore, deep learning based classification demonstrated superior performance over lexicon analysis, with CNN outperforming Bi-LSTM by achieving 96.41 percent accuracy and near perfect classification of negative reviews, alongside high F1-scores for neutral and positive sentiments. This research sets a new methodological standard for measuring sentiment in LLM-based applications and provides practical insights for developers and researchers seeking to improve user-centric AI system design.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Keyphrase extraction is a fundamental task in natural language processing. However, existing unsupervised prompt-based methods for Large Language Models (LLMs) often rely on single-stage inference pipelines with uniform prompting, regardless of document length or LLM backbone. Such one-size-fits-all designs hinder the full exploitation of LLMs' reasoning and generation capabilities, especially given the complexity of keyphrase extraction across diverse scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose MAPEX, the first framework that introduces multi-agent collaboration into keyphrase extraction. MAPEX coordinates LLM-based agents through modules for expert recruitment, candidate extraction, topic guidance, knowledge augmentation, and post-processing. A dual-path strategy dynamically adapts to document length: knowledge-driven extraction for short texts and topic-guided extraction for long texts. Extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets across three different LLMs demonstrate its strong generalization and universality, outperforming the state-of-the-art unsupervised method by 2.44% and standard LLM baselines by 4.01% in F1@5 on average.

  The Romansh language, spoken in Switzerland, has limited resources for machine translation evaluation. In this paper, we present a benchmark for six varieties of Romansh: Rumantsch Grischun, a supra-regional variety, and five regional varieties: Sursilvan, Sutsilvan, Surmiran, Puter, and Vallader. Our reference translations were created by human translators based on the WMT24++ benchmark, which ensures parallelism with more than 55 other languages. An automatic evaluation of existing MT systems and LLMs shows that translation out of Romansh into German is handled relatively well for all the varieties, but translation into Romansh is still challenging.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The prevailing ``trivia-centered paradigm'' for evaluating the cultural alignment of large language models (LLMs) is increasingly inadequate as these models become more advanced and widely deployed. Existing approaches typically reduce culture to static facts or values, testing models via multiple-choice or short-answer questions that treat culture as isolated trivia. Such methods neglect the pluralistic and interactive realities of culture, and overlook how cultural assumptions permeate even ostensibly ``neutral'' evaluation settings. In this position paper, we argue for \textbf{intentionally cultural evaluation}: an approach that systematically examines the cultural assumptions embedded in all aspects of evaluation, not just in explicitly cultural tasks. We systematically characterize the what, how, and circumstances by which culturally contingent considerations arise in evaluation, and emphasize the importance of researcher positionality for fostering inclusive, culturally aligned NLP research. Finally, we discuss implications and future directions for moving beyond current benchmarking practices, discovering important applications that we don't know exist, and involving communities in evaluation design through HCI-inspired participatory methodologies.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) have become a cornerstone in Natural Language Processing (NLP), achieving impressive performance in text generation. Their token-level representations capture rich, human-aligned semantics. However, pooling these vectors into a text embedding discards crucial information. Nevertheless, many non-generative downstream tasks, such as clustering, classification, or retrieval, still depend on accurate and controllable sentence- or document-level embeddings. We explore several adaptation strategies for pre-trained, decoder-only LLMs: (i) various aggregation techniques for token embeddings, (ii) task-specific prompt engineering, and (iii) text-level augmentation via contrastive fine-tuning. Combining these components yields competitive performance on the English clustering track of the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB). An analysis of the attention map further shows that fine-tuning shifts focus from prompt tokens to semantically relevant words, indicating more effective compression of meaning into the final hidden state. Our experiments demonstrate that LLMs can be effectively adapted as text embedding models through a combination of prompt engineering and resource-efficient contrastive fine-tuning on synthetically generated positive pairs.

  Embedding-based similarity metrics between text sequences can be influenced not just by the content dimensions we most care about, but can also be biased by spurious attributes like the text's source or language. These document confounders cause problems for many applications, but especially those that need to pool texts from different corpora. This paper shows that a debiasing algorithm that removes information about observed confounders from the encoder representations substantially reduces these biases at a minimal computational cost. Document similarity and clustering metrics improve across every embedding variant and task we evaluate -- often dramatically. Interestingly, performance on out-of-distribution benchmarks is not impacted, indicating that the embeddings are not otherwise degraded.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Open benchmarks are essential for evaluating and advancing large language models, offering reproducibility and transparency. However, their accessibility makes them likely targets of test set contamination. In this work, we introduce DyePack, a framework that leverages backdoor attacks to identify models that used benchmark test sets during training, without requiring access to the loss, logits, or any internal details of the model. Like how banks mix dye packs with their money to mark robbers, DyePack mixes backdoor samples with the test data to flag models that trained on it. We propose a principled design incorporating multiple backdoors with stochastic targets, enabling exact false positive rate (FPR) computation when flagging every model. This provably prevents false accusations while providing strong evidence for every detected case of contamination. We evaluate DyePack on five models across three datasets, covering both multiple-choice and open-ended generation tasks. For multiple-choice questions, it successfully detects all contaminated models with guaranteed FPRs as low as 0.000073% on MMLU-Pro and 0.000017% on Big-Bench-Hard using eight backdoors. For open-ended generation tasks, it generalizes well and identifies all contaminated models on Alpaca with a guaranteed false positive rate of just 0.127% using six backdoors.

  The capability to precisely adhere to instructions is a cornerstone for Large Language Models (LLMs) to function as dependable agents in real-world scenarios. However, confronted with complex prompts, LLMs frequently encounter difficulties in fulfilling all specified requirements within a single response. Drawing inspiration from recent advancements in Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting and self-correction methodologies, we introduce Meeseeks (The name is inspired by Mr. Meeseeks from "Rick and Morty," a character renowned for efficiently accomplishing assigned tasks. See:this https URL), a fully automated iterative instruction-following benchmark equipped with an integrated feedback mechanism. Meeseeks identifies erroneous components in model responses and provides corresponding feedback accurately, thereby iteratively guiding the model toward self-correction. The dataset contains over 700 curated instances annotated by 32 distinct capability tags in Chinese and English. Extensive experimental results reveal that different state-of-the-art commercial and open-source LLMs exhibit vastly disparate performance, and even after 20 turns of iterative feedback-driven self-correction, nearly all models demonstrate suboptimal performance. We conducted comprehensive analysis from both macro and instance levels, uncovering numerous common issues prevalent in current state-of-the-art models, as well as several counterintuitive phenomena.

  Interaction between learner and feedback-giver has come into focus recently for post-training of Large Language Models (LLMs), through the use of reward models that judge the appropriateness of a model's response. In this paper, we investigate whether Dialogue Games -- goal-directed and rule-governed activities driven predominantly by verbal actions -- can also serve as a source of feedback signals for learning. We introduce Playpen, an environment for off- and online learning through Dialogue Game self-play, and investigate a representative set of post-training methods: supervised fine-tuning; direct alignment (DPO); and reinforcement learning with GRPO. We experiment with post-training a small LLM (Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct), evaluating performance on unseen instances of training games as well as unseen games, and on standard benchmarks. We find that imitation learning through SFT improves performance on unseen instances, but negatively impacts other skills, while interactive learning with GRPO shows balanced improvements without loss of skills. We release the framework and the baseline training setups to foster research in the promising new direction of learning in (synthetic) interaction.

  We examine three evaluation paradigms: standard benchmarks (e.g., MMLU and BBH), interactive games (e.g., Signalling Games or Taboo), and cognitive tests (e.g., for working memory or theory of mind). First, we investigate which of the former two-benchmarks or games-is most effective at discriminating LLMs of varying quality. Then, inspired by human cognitive assessments, we compile a suite of targeted tests that measure cognitive abilities deemed essential for effective language use, and we investigate their correlation with model performance in benchmarks and games. Our analyses reveal that interactive games are superior to standard benchmarks in discriminating models. Causal and logical reasoning correlate with both static and interactive tests, while differences emerge regarding core executive functions and social/emotional skills, which correlate more with games. We advocate for the development of new interactive benchmarks and targeted cognitive tasks inspired by assessing human abilities but designed specifically for LLMs.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Robot learning papers typically report a single binary success rate (SR), which obscures where a policy succeeds or fails along a multi-step manipulation task. We argue that subgoal-level reporting should become routine: for each trajectory, a vector of per-subgoal SRs that makes partial competence visible (e.g., grasp vs. pour). We propose a blueprint for StepEval, a cost-aware plug-in evaluation framework that utilizes vision-language models (VLMs) as automated judges of subgoal outcomes from recorded images or videos. Rather than proposing new benchmarks or APIs, our contribution is to outline design principles for a scalable, community-driven open-source project. In StepEval, the primary artifact for policy evaluation is the per-subgoal SR vector; however, other quantities (e.g., latency or cost estimates) are also considered for framework-optimization diagnostics to help the community tune evaluation efficiency and accuracy when ground-truth subgoal success labels are available. We discuss how such a framework can remain model-agnostic, support single- or multi-view inputs, and be lightweight enough to adopt across labs. The intended contribution is a shared direction: a minimal, extensible seed that invites open-source contributions, so that scoring the steps, not just the final goal, becomes a standard and reproducible practice.

  Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise in training agentic models that move beyond static benchmarks to engage in dynamic, multi-turn interactions. Yet, the ultimate value of such agents lies in their ability to assist users, a setting where diversity and dynamics of user interaction pose challenges. In this work, we propose UserRL, a unified framework for training and evaluating user-centric abilities through standardized gym environments paired with simulated users. We systematically vary turn-level reward assignment and trajectory-level score calculation to analyze how different formulations affect learning under the GRPO algorithm. Our experiments across Qwen3 models reveal three key findings: (i) SFT cold start is critical for unlocking initial interaction ability and enabling sustained RL improvements; (ii) deliberate trajectory scoring yields more efficient and effective multi-turn interactions; and (iii) while stronger simulated users (e.g., GPT-4o) facilitates training, open-source simulators (e.g., Qwen3-32B) remain a cost-effective and transferable option. Together, these results highlight that careful design of reward shaping and user simulation choice is as crucial as model scale, and establish UserRL as a practical pathway for developing robust user-centric agentic models. All codes and data are public for future research.

  The scaling of Large Language Models (LLMs) has exposed a critical gap between their performance on static benchmarks and their fragility in dynamic, information-rich environments. While models excel at isolated tasks, the computational limits that govern their reasoning under cognitive load remain poorly understood. In this work, we introduce a formal theory of computational cognitive load, positing that extraneous, task-irrelevant information (Context Saturation) and interference from task-switching (Attentional Residue) are key mechanisms that degrade performance. We designed the Interleaved Cognitive Evaluation (ICE), a deconfounded benchmark to systematically manipulate these load factors on challenging multi-hop reasoning tasks. A comprehensive study (N = 10 replications per item across 200 questions) revealed significant performance variations across five instruction-tuned models. Smaller open-source architectures (Llama-3-8B-Instruct, Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2) exhibited baseline brittleness, achieving 0% accuracy (SEM = 0.0) across all conditions, including clean controls, on this high-intrinsic-load task. In contrast, Gemini-2.0-Flash-001 showed partial resilience, achieving 85% accuracy in control conditions, with a statistically significant degradation under context saturation ($\beta = -0.003$ per % load, $p < 0.001$). These findings provide preliminary evidence that cognitive load is a key contributor to reasoning failures, supporting theories of hallucination-as-guessing under uncertainty. We conclude that dynamic, cognitive-aware stress testing, as exemplified by the ICE benchmark, is essential for evaluating the true resilience and safety of advanced AI systems.

However, a key limitation remains: LMs, primarily optimized for natural language understanding and generation, struggle with multi-step reasoning, planning, and using environmental feedback when attempting to solve realistic computer tasks. Towards addressing this, we propose an inference-time search algorithm for LM agents to explicitly perform exploration and multi-step planning in interactive web environments. Our approach is a form of best-first tree search that operates within the actual environment space, and is complementary with most existing state-of-the-art agents. It is the first tree search algorithm for LM agents that shows effectiveness on realistic web tasks. On the challenging VisualWebArena benchmark, applying our search algorithm on top of a GPT-4o agent yields a 39.7% relative increase in success rate compared to the same baseline without search, setting a state-of-the-art success rate of 26.4%. On WebArena, search also yields a 28.0% relative improvement over a baseline agent, setting a competitive success rate of 19.2%. Our experiments highlight the effectiveness of search for web agents, and we demonstrate that performance scales with increased test-time compute. We conduct a thorough analysis of our results to highlight improvements from search, limitations, and promising directions for future work. Our code and models are publicly released atthis https URL.

  We present Federation of Agents (FoA), a distributed orchestration framework that transforms static multi-agent coordination into dynamic, capability-driven collaboration. FoA introduces Versioned Capability Vectors (VCVs): machine-readable profiles that make agent capabilities searchable through semantic embeddings, enabling agents to advertise their capabilities, cost, and limitations. Our aarchitecturecombines three key innovations: (1) semantic routing that matches tasks to agents over sharded HNSW indices while enforcing operational constraints through cost-biased optimization, (2) dynamic task decomposition where compatible agents collaboratively break down complex tasks into DAGs of subtasks through consensus-based merging, and (3) smart clustering that groups agents working on similar subtasks into collaborative channels for k-round refinement before synthesis. Built on top of MQTT,s publish-subscribe semantics for scalable message passing, FoA achieves sub-linear complexity through hierarchical capability matching and efficient index maintenance. Evaluation on HealthBench shows 13x improvements over single-model baselines, with clustering-enhanced laboration particularly effective for complex reasoning tasks requiring multiple perspectives. The system scales horizontally while maintaining consistent performance, demonstrating that semantic orchestration with structured collaboration can unlock the collective intelligence of heterogeneous federations of AI agents.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle with complex Text-to-SQL queries that demand both sophisticated mathematical reasoning and intricate schema navigation. Existing methods often tackle these challenges in isolation, creating a fractured reasoning process that compromises logical and structural correctness. To resolve this, we introduce SteinerSQL, a framework that unifies these dual challenges into a single, graph-centric optimization problem. SteinerSQL operates in three stages: mathematical decomposition to identify required tables (terminals), optimal reasoning scaffold construction via a Steiner tree problem, and multi-level validation to ensure correctness. On the challenging LogicCat and Spider2.0-Lite benchmarks, SteinerSQL establishes a new state-of-the-art with 36.10% and 40.04% execution accuracy, respectively, using Gemini-2.5-Pro. Beyond accuracy, SteinerSQL presents a new, unified paradigm for Text-to-SQL, paving the way for more robust and principled solutions to complex reasoning tasks.

  Comprehensive evaluation of mobile agents can significantly advance their development and real-world applicability. However, existing benchmarks lack practicality and scalability due to the extensive manual effort in defining task reward signals and implementing evaluation codes. We propose AutoEval, an evaluation framework which tests mobile agents without any manual effort. Our approach designs a UI state change representation which can be used to automatically generate task reward signals, and employs a Judge System for autonomous evaluation. Evaluation shows AutoEval can automatically generate reward signals with high correlation to human-annotated signals, and achieve high accuracy (up to 94%) in autonomous evaluation comparable to human evaluation. Finally, we evaluate state-of-the-art mobile agents using our framework, providing insights into their performance and limitations.
