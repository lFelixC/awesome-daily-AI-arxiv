  Embodied Artificial Intelligence (Embodied AI) is an emerging frontier in robotics, driven by the need for autonomous systems that can perceive, reason, and act in complex physical environments. While single-arm systems have shown strong task performance, collaborative dual-arm systems are essential for handling more intricate tasks involving rigid, deformable, and tactile-sensitive objects. To advance this goal, we launched the RoboTwin Dual-Arm Collaboration Challenge at the 2nd MEIS Workshop, CVPR 2025. Built on the RoboTwin Simulation platform (1.0 and 2.0) and the AgileX COBOT-Magic Robot platform, the competition consisted of three stages: Simulation Round 1, Simulation Round 2, and a final Real-World Round. Participants totally tackled 17 dual-arm manipulation tasks, covering rigid, deformable, and tactile-based scenarios. The challenge attracted 64 global teams and over 400 participants, producing top-performing solutions like SEM and AnchorDP3 and generating valuable insights into generalizable bimanual policy learning. This report outlines the competition setup, task design, evaluation methodology, key findings and future direction, aiming to support future research on robust and generalizable bimanual manipulation policies.

- **[Simultaneous Multi-Robot Motion Planning with Projected Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03607)**  `arXiv:2502.03607`  `cs.RO` `cs.AI` `cs.LG`

  Recent advances in diffusion models hold significant potential in robotics, enabling the generation of diverse and smooth trajectories directly from raw representations of the environment. Despite this promise, applying diffusion models to motion planning remains challenging due to their difficulty in enforcing critical constraints, such as collision avoidance and kinematic feasibility. These limitations become even more pronounced in Multi-Robot Motion Planning (MRMP), where multiple robots must coordinate in shared spaces. To address these challenges, this work proposes Simultaneous MRMP Diffusion (SMD), a novel approach integrating constrained optimization into the diffusion sampling process to produce collision-free, kinematically feasible trajectories. Additionally, the paper introduces a comprehensive MRMP benchmark to evaluate trajectory planning algorithms across scenarios with varying robot densities, obstacle complexities, and motion constraints. Experimental results show SMD consistently outperforms classical and other learning-based motion planners, achieving higher success rates and efficiency in complex multi-robot environments.

- **[PAC Bench: Do Foundation Models Understand Prerequisites for Executing Manipulation Policies?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23725)**  `arXiv:2506.23725`  `cs.RO` `cs.AI`  
  _Atharva Gundawar, Som Sagar, Ransalu Senanayake_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly pivotal for generalist robot manipulation, enabling tasks such as physical reasoning, policy generation, and failure detection. However, their proficiency in these high-level applications often assumes a deep understanding of low-level physical prerequisites, a capability that remains largely unverified. For robots to perform actions reliably, they must comprehend intrinsic object properties (e.g., material, weight), action affordances (e.g., graspable, stackable), and physical constraints (e.g., stability, reachability, or an object's state, such as being closed). Despite the widespread use of VLMs in manipulation tasks, we argue that off-the-shelf models may lack this granular, physically grounded understanding, as such prerequisites are often overlooked during training.To address this critical gap, we introduce PAC Bench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to systematically evaluate VLMs on their understanding of core Properties, Affordances, and Constraints (PAC) from a task executability perspective. PAC Bench features a diverse dataset with over 30,000 annotations, comprising 673 real-world images (115 object classes, 15 property types, and 1 to 3 affordances defined per class), 100 real-world humanoid-view scenarios, and 120 unique simulated constraint scenarios across four tasks.Our evaluations reveal significant gaps in the ability of current VLMs to grasp fundamental physical concepts, highlighting limitations in their suitability for reliable robot manipulation and pointing to key areas for targeted research. PAC Bench also serves as a standardized benchmark for rigorously evaluating physical reasoning in VLMs and guiding the development of more robust, physically grounded models for robotic applications.Project Page:this https URL

- **[DexH2R: A Benchmark for Dynamic Dexterous Grasping in Human-to-Robot Handover](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23152)**  `arXiv:2506.23152`  `cs.RO`  
  _Youzhuo Wang, Jiayi Ye, Chuyang Xiao, Yiming Zhong, Heng Tao, Hang Yu, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Handover between a human and a dexterous robotic hand is a fundamental yet challenging task in human-robot collaboration. It requires handling dynamic environments and a wide variety of objects and demands robust and adaptive grasping strategies. However, progress in developing effective dynamic dexterous grasping methods is limited by the absence of high-quality, real-world human-to-robot handover datasets. Existing datasets primarily focus on grasping static objects or rely on synthesized handover motions, which differ significantly from real-world robot motion patterns, creating a substantial gap in applicability. In this paper, we introduce DexH2R, a comprehensive real-world dataset for human-to-robot handovers, built on a dexterous robotic hand. Our dataset captures a diverse range of interactive objects, dynamic motion patterns, rich visual sensor data, and detailed annotations. Additionally, to ensure natural and human-like dexterous motions, we utilize teleoperation for data collection, enabling the robot's movements to align with human behaviors and habits, which is a crucial characteristic for intelligent humanoid robots. Furthermore, we propose an effective solution, DynamicGrasp, for human-to-robot handover and evaluate various state-of-the-art approaches, including auto-regressive models and diffusion policy methods, providing a thorough comparison and analysis. We believe our benchmark will drive advancements in human-to-robot handover research by offering a high-quality dataset, effective solutions, and comprehensive evaluation metrics.

- **[ParticleFormer: A 3D Point Cloud World Model for Multi-Object, Multi-Material Robotic Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23126)**  `arXiv:2506.23126`  `cs.RO`  
  _Suning Huang, Qianzhong Chen, Xiaohan Zhang, Jiankai Sun, Mac Schwager_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  3D world models (i.e., learning-based 3D dynamics models) offer a promising approach to generalizable robotic manipulation by capturing the underlying physics of environment evolution conditioned on robot actions. However, existing 3D world models are primarily limited to single-material dynamics using a particle-based Graph Neural Network model, and often require time-consuming 3D scene reconstruction to obtain 3D particle tracks for training. In this work, we present ParticleFormer, a Transformer-based point cloud world model trained with a hybrid point cloud reconstruction loss, supervising both global and local dynamics features in multi-material, multi-object robot interactions. ParticleFormer captures fine-grained multi-object interactions between rigid, deformable, and flexible materials, trained directly from real-world robot perception data without an elaborate scene reconstruction. We demonstrate the model's effectiveness both in 3D scene forecasting tasks, and in downstream manipulation tasks using a Model Predictive Control (MPC) policy. In addition, we extend existing dynamics learning benchmarks to include diverse multi-material, multi-object interaction scenarios. We validate our method on six simulation and three real-world experiments, where it consistently outperforms leading baselines by achieving superior dynamics prediction accuracy and less rollout error in downstream visuomotor tasks.

- **[Learning Motion Skills with Adaptive Assistive Curriculum Force in Humanoid Robots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23125)**  `arXiv:2506.23125`  `cs.RO`  
  _Zhanxiang Cao, Yang Zhang, Buqing Nie, Huangxuan Lin, Haoyang Li, Yue Gao_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Learning policies for complex humanoid tasks remains both challenging and compelling. Inspired by how infants and athletes rely on external support--such as parental walkers or coach-applied guidance--to acquire skills like walking, dancing, and performing acrobatic flips, we propose A2CF: Adaptive Assistive Curriculum Force for humanoid motion learning. A2CF trains a dual-agent system, in which a dedicated assistive force agent applies state-dependent forces to guide the robot through difficult initial motions and gradually reduces assistance as the robot's proficiency improves. Across three benchmarks--bipedal walking, choreographed dancing, and backflip--A2CF achieves convergence 30% faster than baseline methods, lowers failure rates by over 40%, and ultimately produces robust, support-free policies. Real-world experiments further demonstrate that adaptively applied assistive forces significantly accelerate the acquisition of complex skills in high-dimensional robotic control.

- **[Event-based Stereo Visual-Inertial Odometry with Voxel Map](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23078)**  `arXiv:2506.23078`  `cs.RO`  
  _Zhaoxing Zhang, Xiaoxiang Wang, Chengliang Zhang, Yangyang Guo, Zikang Yuan, Xin Yang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The event camera, renowned for its high dynamic range and exceptional temporal resolution, is recognized as an important sensor for visual odometry. However, the inherent noise in event streams complicates the selection of high-quality map points, which critically determine the precision of state estimation. To address this challenge, we propose Voxel-ESVIO, an event-based stereo visual-inertial odometry system that utilizes voxel map management, which efficiently filter out high-quality 3D points. Specifically, our methodology utilizes voxel-based point selection and voxel-aware point management to collectively optimize the selection and updating of map points on a per-voxel basis. These synergistic strategies enable the efficient retrieval of noise-resilient map points with the highest observation likelihood in current frames, thereby ensureing the state estimation accuracy. Extensive evaluations on three public benchmarks demonstrate that our Voxel-ESVIO outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and computational efficiency.

  _Sepehr Samavi, Anthony Lem, Fumiaki Sato, Sirui Chen, Qiao Gu, Keijiro Yano, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  To navigate crowds without collisions, robots must interact with humans by forecasting their future motion and reacting accordingly. While learning-based prediction models have shown success in generating likely human trajectory predictions, integrating these stochastic models into a robot controller presents several challenges. The controller needs to account for interactive coupling between planned robot motion and human predictions while ensuring both predictions and robot actions are safe (i.e. collision-free). To address these challenges, we present a receding horizon crowd navigation method for single-robot multi-human environments. We first propose a diffusion model to generate joint trajectory predictions for all humans in the scene. We then incorporate these multi-modal predictions into a SICNav Bilevel MPC problem that simultaneously solves for a robot plan (upper-level) and acts as a safety filter to refine the predictions for non-collision (lower-level). Combining planning and prediction refinement into one bilevel problem ensures that the robot plan and human predictions are coupled. We validate the open-loop trajectory prediction performance of our diffusion model on the commonly used ETH/UCY benchmark and evaluate the closed-loop performance of our robot navigation method in simulation and extensive real-robot experiments demonstrating safe, efficient, and reactive robot motion.

- **[Teaching Time Series to See and Speak: Forecasting with Aligned Visual and Textual Perspectives](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24124)**  `arXiv:2506.24124`  `cs.LG` `cs.CV`  
  _Dong Sixun, Fan Wei, Teresa Wu, Fu Yanjie_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Time series forecasting traditionally relies on unimodal numerical inputs, which often struggle to capture high-level semantic patterns due to their dense and unstructured nature. While recent approaches have explored representing time series as text using large language models (LLMs), these methods remain limited by the discrete nature of token sequences and lack the perceptual intuition humans typically apply, such as interpreting visual patterns. In this paper, we propose a multimodal contrastive learning framework that transforms raw time series into structured visual and textual perspectives. Rather than using natural language or real-world images, we construct both modalities directly from numerical sequences. We then align these views in a shared semantic space via contrastive learning, enabling the model to capture richer and more complementary representations. Furthermore, we introduce a variate selection module that leverages the aligned representations to identify the most informative variables for multivariate forecasting. Extensive experiments on fifteen short-term and six long-term forecasting benchmarks demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms strong unimodal and cross-modal baselines, highlighting the effectiveness of multimodal alignment in enhancing time series forecasting.

- **[The Illusion of Progress? A Critical Look at Test-Time Adaptation for Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24000)**  `arXiv:2506.24000`  `cs.LG` `cs.CV`  
  _Lijun Sheng, Jian Liang, Ran He, Zilei Wang, Tieniu Tan_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Test-time adaptation (TTA) methods have gained significant attention for enhancing the performance of vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP during inference, without requiring additional labeled data. However, current TTA researches generally suffer from major limitations such as duplication of baseline results, limited evaluation metrics, inconsistent experimental settings, and insufficient analysis. These problems hinder fair comparisons between TTA methods and obscure their practical strengths and weaknesses. To address these challenges, we introduce TTA-VLM, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating TTA methods on VLMs. Our benchmark implements 8 episodic TTA and 7 online TTA methods within a unified and reproducible framework, and evaluates them across 15 widely used datasets. Unlike prior studies focused solely on CLIP, we extend the evaluation to SigLIP--a model trained with a Sigmoid loss--and include training-time tuning methods such as CoOp, MaPLe, and TeCoA to assess generality. Beyond classification accuracy, TTA-VLM incorporates various evaluation metrics, including robustness, calibration, out-of-distribution detection, and stability, enabling a more holistic assessment of TTA methods. Through extensive experiments, we find that 1) existing TTA methods produce limited gains compared to the previous pioneering work; 2) current TTA methods exhibit poor collaboration with training-time fine-tuning methods; 3) accuracy gains frequently come at the cost of reduced model trustworthiness. We release TTA-VLM to provide fair comparison and comprehensive evaluation of TTA methods for VLMs, and we hope it encourages the community to develop more reliable and generalizable TTA strategies.

- **[Single Image Inpainting and Super-Resolution with Simultaneous Uncertainty Guarantees by Universal Reproducing Kernels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23221)**  `arXiv:2506.23221`  `cs.LG` `cs.CV`  
  _B치lint Horv치th, Bal치zs Csan치d Cs치ji_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The paper proposes a statistical learning approach to the problem of estimating missing pixels of images, crucial for image inpainting and super-resolution problems. One of the main novelties of the method is that it also provides uncertainty quantifications together with the estimated values. Our core assumption is that the underlying data-generating function comes from a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS). A special emphasis is put on band-limited functions, central to signal processing, which form Paley-Wiener type RKHSs. The proposed method, which we call Simultaneously Guaranteed Kernel Interpolation (SGKI), is an extension and refinement of a recently developed kernel method. An advantage of SGKI is that it not only estimates the missing pixels, but also builds non-asymptotic confidence bands for the unobserved values, which are simultaneously guaranteed for all missing pixels. We also show how to compute these bands efficiently using Schur complements, we discuss a generalization to vector-valued functions, and we present a series of numerical experiments on various datasets containing synthetically generated and benchmark images, as well.

- **[Vision-QRWKV: Exploring Quantum-Enhanced RWKV Models for Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06633)**  `arXiv:2506.06633`  `cs.LG` `cs.CV`  
  _Chi-Sheng Chen_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advancements in quantum machine learning have shown promise in enhancing classical neural network architectures, particularly in domains involving complex, high-dimensional data. Building upon prior work in temporal sequence modeling, this paper introduces Vision-QRWKV, a hybrid quantum-classical extension of the Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV) architecture, applied for the first time to image classification tasks. By integrating a variational quantum circuit (VQC) into the channel mixing component of RWKV, our model aims to improve nonlinear feature transformation and enhance the expressive capacity of visual representations.We evaluate both classical and quantum RWKV models on a diverse collection of 14 medical and standard image classification benchmarks, including MedMNIST datasets, MNIST, and FashionMNIST. Our results demonstrate that the quantum-enhanced model outperforms its classical counterpart on a majority of datasets, particularly those with subtle or noisy class distinctions (e.g., ChestMNIST, RetinaMNIST, BloodMNIST). This study represents the first systematic application of quantum-enhanced RWKV in the visual domain, offering insights into the architectural trade-offs and future potential of quantum models for lightweight and efficient vision tasks.

- **[FedWSQ: Efficient Federated Learning with Weight Standardization and Distribution-Aware Non-Uniform Quantization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23516)**  `arXiv:2506.23516`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI` `cs.CV`  
  _Seung-Wook Kim, Seongyeol Kim, Jiah Kim, Seowon Ji, Se-Ho Lee_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Federated learning (FL) often suffers from performance degradation due to key challenges such as data heterogeneity and communication constraints. To address these limitations, we present a novel FL framework called FedWSQ, which integrates weight standardization (WS) and the proposed distribution-aware non-uniform quantization (DANUQ). WS enhances FL performance by filtering out biased components in local updates during training, thereby improving the robustness of the model against data heterogeneity and unstable client participation. In addition, DANUQ minimizes quantization errors by leveraging the statistical properties of local model updates. As a result, FedWSQ significantly reduces communication overhead while maintaining superior model accuracy. Extensive experiments on FL benchmark datasets demonstrate that FedWSQ consistently outperforms existing FL methods across various challenging FL settings, including extreme data heterogeneity and ultra-low-bit communication scenarios.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Video games have served as useful benchmarks for the decision-making community, but going beyond Atari games towards modern games has been prohibitively expensive for the vast majority of the research community. Prior work in modern video games typically relied on game-specific integration to obtain game features and enable online training, or on existing large datasets. An alternative approach is to train agents using imitation learning to play video games purely from images. However, this setting poses a fundamental question: which visual encoders obtain representations that retain information critical for decision making? To answer this question, we conduct a systematic study of imitation learning with publicly available pre-trained visual encoders compared to the typical task-specific end-to-end training approach in Minecraft, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, and Minecraft Dungeons. Our results show that end-to-end training can be effective with comparably low-resolution images and only minutes of demonstrations, but significant improvements can be gained by utilising pre-trained encoders such as DINOv2 depending on the game. In addition to enabling effective decision making, we show that pre-trained encoders can make decision-making research in video games more accessible by significantly reducing the cost of training.

- **[SEUF: Is Unlearning One Expert Enough for Mixture-of-Experts LLMs?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18797)**  `arXiv:2411.18797`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI` `cs.CL`  
  _Haomin Zhuang, Yihua Zhang, Kehan Guo, Jinghan Jia, Gaowen Liu, Sijia Liu, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advancements in LLMs unlearning have shown remarkable success in removing unwanted data-model influences while preserving the model's utility for legitimate knowledge. Despite these strides, sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) LLMs--a key subset of the LLM family--have remained unexplored in the context of unlearning. As MoE LLMs are celebrated for their exceptional performance, we ask:How can unlearning be performed effectively and efficiently on MoE LLMs? Our pilot study shows that the dynamic routing nature of MoE LLMs introduces unique challenges, leading to excessive forgetting, uncontrolled knowledge erasure and substantial utility drops when existing unlearning methods are applied. To address this, we propose a novel Selected-Expert Unlearning Framework (SEUF). Through expert attribution, unlearning is concentrated on the most actively engaged experts for the specified knowledge. Concurrently, an anchor loss is applied to the router to stabilize the active state of this targeted expert, ensuring focused and controlled unlearning. SEUF is compatible with various standard unlearning algorithms. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SEUF enhances both forget quality up to 5% and model utility by 35% on MoE LLMs across various benchmarks and LLM architectures (compared to standard unlearning algorithms), while only unlearning 0.06% of the model parameters.

- **[Development of Hybrid Artificial Intelligence Training on Real and Synthetic Data: Benchmark on Two Mixed Training Strategies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24093)**  `arXiv:2506.24093`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Paul Wachter, Lukas Niehaus, Julius Sch칬ning_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Synthetic data has emerged as a cost-effective alternative to real data for training artificial neural networks (ANN). However, the disparity between synthetic and real data results in a domain gap. That gap leads to poor performance and generalization of the trained ANN when applied to real-world scenarios. Several strategies have been developed to bridge this gap, which combine synthetic and real data, known as mixed training using hybrid datasets. While these strategies have been shown to mitigate the domain gap, a systematic evaluation of their generalizability and robustness across various tasks and architectures remains underexplored. To address this challenge, our study comprehensively analyzes two widely used mixing strategies on three prevalent architectures and three distinct hybrid datasets. From these datasets, we sample subsets with varying proportions of synthetic to real data to investigate the impact of synthetic and real components. The findings of this paper provide valuable insights into optimizing the use of synthetic data in the training process of any ANN, contributing to enhancing robustness and efficacy.

- **[Bridging Theory and Practice in Link Representation with Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24018)**  `arXiv:2506.24018`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Veronica Lachi, Francesco Ferrini, Antonio Longa, Bruno Lepri, Andrea Passerini, Manfred Jaeger_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are widely used to compute representations of node pairs for downstream tasks such as link prediction. Yet, theoretical understanding of their expressive power has focused almost entirely on graph-level representations. In this work, we shift the focus to links and provide the first comprehensive study of GNN expressiveness in link representation. We introduce a unifying framework, the $k_\phi$-$k_\rho$-$m$ framework, that subsumes existing message-passing link models and enables formal expressiveness comparisons. Using this framework, we derive a hierarchy of state-of-the-art methods and offer theoretical tools to analyze future architectures. To complement our analysis, we propose a synthetic evaluation protocol comprising the first benchmark specifically designed to assess link-level expressiveness. Finally, we ask: does expressiveness matter in practice? We use a graph symmetry metric that quantifies the difficulty of distinguishing links and show that while expressive models may underperform on standard benchmarks, they significantly outperform simpler ones as symmetry increases, highlighting the need for dataset-aware model selection.

- **[Calibrating Graph Neural Networks with Wavelet-Aware Temperature Scaling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23782)**  `arXiv:2506.23782`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Xiaoyang Li, Linwei Tao, Haohui Lu, Minjing Dong, Junbin Gao, Chang Xu_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated strong predictive performance on relational data; however, their confidence estimates often misalign with actual predictive correctness, posing significant limitations for deployment in safety-critical settings. While existing graph-aware calibration methods seek to mitigate this limitation, they primarily depend on coarse one-hop statistics, such as neighbor-predicted confidence, or latent node embeddings, thereby neglecting the fine-grained structural heterogeneity inherent in graph topology. In this work, we propose Wavelet-Aware Temperature Scaling (WATS), a post-hoc calibration framework that assigns node-specific temperatures based on tunable heat-kernel graph wavelet features. Specifically, WATS harnesses the scalability and topology sensitivity of graph wavelets to refine confidence estimates, all without necessitating model retraining or access to neighboring logits or predictions. Extensive evaluations across seven benchmark datasets with varying graph structures and two GNN backbones demonstrate that WATS achieves the lowest Expected Calibration Error (ECE) among all compared methods, outperforming both classical and graph-specific baselines by up to 42.3\% in ECE and reducing calibration variance by 17.24\% on average compared with graph-specific methods. Moreover, WATS remains computationally efficient, scaling well across graphs of diverse sizes and densities. Code will be released based on publication.

  _Alex Egg, Martin Iglesias Goyanes, Friso Kingma, Andreu Mora, Leandro von Werra, Thomas Wolf_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce DABstep, a novel benchmark for evaluating AI agents on realistic multi-step data analysis tasks. DABstep comprises over 450 real-world challenges derived from a financial analytics platform, requiring models to combine code-based data processing with contextual reasoning over heterogeneous documentation. Each task demands an iterative, multi-step problem-solving approach, testing capabilities in data manipulation, cross-referencing multiple sources, and precise result reporting. The benchmark provides a factoid-style answer format with automatic correctness checks for objective scoring at scale. We evaluate leading LLM-based agents, revealing a substantial performance gap: even the best agent achieves only 14.55% accuracy on the hardest tasks. We detail our benchmark's design, dataset composition, task formulation, evaluation protocol, report baseline results and analyze failure modes. DABstep is released with a public leaderboard and toolkit to accelerate research in autonomous data analysis.

- **[Accurate Parameter-Efficient Test-Time Adaptation for Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23424)**  `arXiv:2506.23424`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Heitor R. Medeiros, Hossein Sharifi-Noghabi, Gabriel L. Oliveira, Saghar Irandoust_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Real-world time series often exhibit a non-stationary nature, degrading the performance of pre-trained forecasting models. Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) addresses this by adjusting models during inference, but existing methods typically update the full model, increasing memory and compute costs. We propose PETSA, a parameter-efficient method that adapts forecasters at test time by only updating small calibration modules on the input and output. PETSA uses low-rank adapters and dynamic gating to adjust representations without retraining. To maintain accuracy despite limited adaptation capacity, we introduce a specialized loss combining three components: (1) a robust term, (2) a frequency-domain term to preserve periodicity, and (3) a patch-wise structural term for structural alignment. PETSA improves the adaptability of various forecasting backbones while requiring fewer parameters than baselines. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that PETSA achieves competitive or better performance across all horizons. Our code is available at:this https URL

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The recently proposed xLSTM is a powerful model that leverages expressive multiplicative gating and residual connections, providing the temporal capacity needed for long-horizon forecasting and representation learning. This architecture has demonstrated success in time series forecasting, lossless compression, and even large-scale language modeling tasks, where its linear memory footprint and fast inference make it a viable alternative to Transformers. Despite its growing popularity, no prior work has explored xLSTM for anomaly detection. In this work, we fill this gap by proposing xLSTMAD, the first anomaly detection method that integrates a full encoder-decoder xLSTM architecture, purpose-built for multivariate time series data. Our encoder processes input sequences to capture historical context, while the decoder is devised in two separate variants of the method. In the forecasting approach, the decoder iteratively generates forecasted future values xLSTMAD-F, while the reconstruction approach reconstructs the input time series from its encoded counterpart xLSTMAD-R. We investigate the performance of two loss functions: Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Soft Dynamic Time Warping (SoftDTW) to consider local reconstruction fidelity and global sequence alignment, respectively. We evaluate our method on the comprehensive TSB-AD-M benchmark, which spans 17 real-world datasets, using state-of-the-art challenging metrics such as VUS-PR. In our results, xLSTM showcases state-of-the-art accuracy, outperforming 23 popular anomaly detection baselines. Our paper is the first work revealing the powerful modeling capabilities of xLSTM for anomaly detection, paving the way for exciting new developments on this subject.

- **[Layer Importance for Mathematical Reasoning is Forged in Pre-Training and Invariant after Post-Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22638)**  `arXiv:2506.22638`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models can exhibit improved mathematical reasoning capabilities following post-training with instruction tuning, reinforcement learning, or knowledge distillation. However, it remains unclear whether these improvements are driven by major changes in transformer layers or from minor adjustments that leave the relative layer importance structures of the base model largely unchanged. We investigate this question through systematic layer-wise ablation experiments, examining base, instruction-tuned, knowledge-distilled, and reinforcement learning variants on mathematical reasoning benchmarks. Our findings show that mathematical reasoning gives rise to a specific layer importance structure, and this structure persists across all post-training paradigms. Removal of such layers causes accuracy drops of up to 80%. In contrast, non-mathematical tasks like factual recall exhibit no critical layers. This distinction suggests that mathematical reasoning requires specialized layers that emerge during pre-training, while other non-reasoning tasks do not. From an information-theoretic perspective, we also observe that these critical layers are the same layers where major representational transformation occurs.

  Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have significantly enhanced the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), an efficient variant of PPO that lowers RL's computational cost, still faces limited exploration, low sample efficiency and instability, constraining its performance on complex reasoning tasks. To address these limitations, we introduce EFRame, an Exploration-Filtering-Replay framework that systematically augments GRPO along three critical dimensions. EFRame performs additional rollouts to explore high-quality trajectories, applies online filtering to eliminate low-quality samples that introduce noise and variance, and leverages experience replay to repeatedly exploit rare but informative samples. EFRame establishes a complete and stable learning cycle, guiding the model through a structured transition from exploration to convergence. Our experiments across a variety of reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that EFRame not only improves the robustness and efficiency of training, but also enables access to deeper reasoning capabilities that remain unattainable under vanilla GRPO. Furthermore, EFRame enables a more fine-grained categorization of training samples, allowing for a deeper analysis of how different types of samples contribute to the learning process in RL.

  As artificial intelligence systems increasingly operate in Real-world environments, the integration of multi-modal data sources such as vision, language, and audio presents both unprecedented opportunities and critical challenges for achieving trustworthy intelligence. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that unifies federated learning with explainable multi-modal reasoning to ensure trustworthiness in decentralized, dynamic settings. Our approach, called FedMM-X (Federated Multi-Modal Explainable Intelligence), leverages cross-modal consistency checks, client-level interpretability mechanisms, and dynamic trust calibration to address challenges posed by data heterogeneity, modality imbalance, and out-of-distribution generalization. Through rigorous evaluation across federated multi-modal benchmarks involving vision-language tasks, we demonstrate improved performance in both accuracy and interpretability while reducing vulnerabilities to adversarial and spurious correlations. Further, we introduce a novel trust score aggregation method to quantify global model reliability under dynamic client participation. Our findings pave the way toward developing robust, interpretable, and socially responsible AI systems in Real-world environments.

  Accurate identification of bioactive peptides (BPs) and protein post-translational modifications (PTMs) is essential for understanding protein function and advancing therapeutic discovery. However, most computational methods remain limited in their generalizability across diverse peptide functions. Here, we present PDeepPP, a unified deep learning framework that integrates pretrained protein language models with a hybrid transformer-convolutional architecture, enabling robust identification across diverse peptide classes and PTM sites. We curated comprehensive benchmark datasets and implemented strategies to address data imbalance, allowing PDeepPP to systematically extract both global and local sequence features. Through extensive analyses-including dimensionality reduction and comparison studies-PDeepPP demonstrates strong, interpretable peptide representations and achieves state-of-the-art performance in 25 of the 33 biological identification tasks. Notably, PDeepPP attains high accuracy in antimicrobial (0.9726) and phosphorylation site (0.9984) identification, with 99.5% specificity in glycosylation site prediction and substantial reduction in false negatives in antimalarial tasks. By enabling large-scale, accurate peptide analysis, PDeepPP supports biomedical research and the discovery of novel therapeutic targets for disease treatment.

  Self-supervised learning (SSL) is an emerging paradigm that exploits supervisory signals generated from the data itself, and many recent studies have leveraged SSL to conduct graph anomaly detection. However, we empirically found that three important factors can substantially impact detection performance across datasets: 1) the specific SSL strategy employed; 2) the tuning of the strategy's hyperparameters; and 3) the allocation of combination weights when using multiple strategies. Most SSL-based graph anomaly detection methods circumvent these issues by arbitrarily or selectively (i.e., guided by label information) choosing SSL strategies, hyperparameter settings, and combination weights. While an arbitrary choice may lead to subpar performance, using label information in an unsupervised setting is label information leakage and leads to severe overestimation of a method's performance. Leakage has been criticized as "one of the top ten data mining mistakes", yet many recent studies on SSL-based graph anomaly detection have been using label information to select hyperparameters. To mitigate this issue, we propose to use an internal evaluation strategy (with theoretical analysis) to select hyperparameters in SSL for unsupervised anomaly detection. We perform extensive experiments using 10 recent SSL-based graph anomaly detection algorithms on various benchmark datasets, demonstrating both the prior issues with hyperparameter selection and the effectiveness of our proposed strategy.

  Machine unlearning (MU) aims to remove the influence of particular data points from the learnable parameters of a trained machine learning model. This is a crucial capability in light of data privacy requirements, trustworthiness, and safety in deployed models. MU is particularly challenging for deep neural networks (DNNs), such as convolutional nets or vision transformers, as such DNNs tend to memorize a notable portion of their training dataset. Nevertheless, the community lacks a rigorous and multifaceted study that looks into the success of MU methods for DNNs. In this paper, we investigate 18 state-of-the-art MU methods across various benchmark datasets and models, with each evaluation conducted over 10 different initializations, a comprehensive evaluation involving MU over 100K models. We show that, with the proper hyperparameters, Masked Small Gradients (MSG) and Convolution Transpose (CT), consistently perform better in terms of model accuracy and run-time efficiency across different models, datasets, and initializations, assessed by population-based membership inference attacks (MIA) and per-sample unlearning likelihood ratio attacks (U-LiRA). Furthermore, our benchmark highlights the fact that comparing a MU method only with commonly used baselines, such as Gradient Ascent (GA) or Successive Random Relabeling (SRL), is inadequate, and we need better baselines like Negative Gradient Plus (NG+) with proper hyperparameter selection.

  While Bayesian-based exploration often demonstrates superior empirical performance compared to bonus-based methods in model-based reinforcement learning (RL), its theoretical understanding remains limited for model-free settings. Existing provable algorithms either suffer from computational intractability or rely on stage-wise policy updates which reduce responsiveness and slow down the learning process. In this paper, we propose a novel variant of Q-learning algorithm, refereed to as RandomizedQ, which integrates sampling-based exploration with agile, step-wise, policy updates, for episodic tabular RL. We establish an $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{H^5SAT})$ regret bound, where $S$ is the number of states, $A$ is the number of actions, $H$ is the episode length, and $T$ is the total number of episodes. In addition, we present a logarithmic regret bound under a mild positive sub-optimality condition on the optimal Q-function. Empirically, RandomizedQ exhibits outstanding performance compared to existing Q-learning variants with both bonus-based and Bayesian-based exploration on standard benchmarks.

  Training data increasingly shapes not only model accuracy but also regulatory compliance and market valuation of AI assets. Yet existing valuation methods remain inadequate: model-based techniques depend on a single fitted model and inherit its biases, while algorithm-based approaches such as Data Shapley require costly retrainings at web scale. Recent Wasserstein-based model-agnostic methods rely on approximations that misrank examples relative to their true leave-one-out (LOO) utility. We introduce KAIROS, a scalable, model-agnostic valuation framework that assigns each example a distributional influence score: its contribution to the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) between the empirical training distribution and a clean reference set. Unlike Wasserstein surrogates, our MMD-based influence admits a closed-form solution that faithfully approximates the exact LOO ranking within $O(1/N^2)$ error, requires no retraining, and naturally extends to conditional kernels for unified label- and feature-error detection. Moreover, KAIROS supports efficient online updates: when a new batch of size m arrives, all scores can be updated in $O(mN)$ time, delivering up to 50x speedup without compromising ranking quality. Empirical evaluations on noise, mislabeling, and poisoning benchmarks show that KAIROS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art model-, Shapley-, and Wasserstein-based baselines in both accuracy and runtime. We provide rigorous theoretical guarantees, including symmetry for reproducible rankings and density-separation for interpretable thresholds.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Bayesian decision theory advocates the Bayes classifier as the optimal approach for minimizing the risk in machine learning problems. Current deep learning algorithms usually solve for the optimal classifier by \emph{implicitly} estimating the posterior probabilities, \emph{e.g.}, by minimizing the Softmax cross-entropy loss. This simple methodology has been proven effective for meticulously balanced academic benchmark datasets. However, it is not applicable to the long-tailed data distributions in the real world, where it leads to the gradient imbalance issue and fails to ensure the Bayes optimal decision rule. To address these challenges, this paper presents a novel approach (BAPE) that provides a more precise theoretical estimation of the data distributions by \emph{explicitly} modeling the parameters of the posterior probabilities and solving them with point estimation. Consequently, our method directly learns the Bayes classifier without gradient descent based on Bayes' theorem, simultaneously alleviating the gradient imbalance and ensuring the Bayes optimal decision rule. Furthermore, we propose a straightforward yet effective \emph{distribution adjustment} technique. This method enables the Bayes classifier trained from the long-tailed training set to effectively adapt to the test data distribution with an arbitrary imbalance factor, thereby enhancing performance without incurring additional computational costs. In addition, we demonstrate the gains of our method are orthogonal to existing learning approaches for long-tailed scenarios, as they are mostly designed under the principle of \emph{implicitly} estimating the posterior probabilities. Extensive empirical evaluations on CIFAR-10-LT, CIFAR-100-LT, ImageNet-LT, and iNaturalist demonstrate that our method significantly improves the generalization performance of popular deep networks, despite its simplicity.

  Mixture of Experts (MoE) LLMs face significant obstacles due to their massive parameter scale, which imposes memory, storage, and deployment challenges. Although recent expert merging methods promise greater efficiency by consolidating multiple experts, they are fundamentally hindered by parameter conflicts arising from expert specialization. In this paper, we present Sub-MoE, a novel MoE compression framework via Subspace Expert Merging. Our key insight is to perform joint Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) on concatenated expert weights, reducing conflicting parameters by extracting shared $U$-matrices while enabling effective merging of the expert-specific $V$ components. Specifically, Sub-MoE consists of two innovative phases: (1) Adaptive Expert Clustering, which groups functionally coherent experts via K-means clustering based on cosine similarity of expert outputs; and (2) Subspace Expert Merging, which first enforces Experts Union Decomposition to derive the shared $U$-matrix across experts in the same group, then pursues frequency-based merging for individual $V$-matrices, and finalizes expert reconstruction using the merged $V$-matrix. In this way, we align and fuse experts in a shared subspace, and can be extended with intra-expert compression for further inference optimization. Extensive experiments on Mixtral, DeepSeek, and Qwen-1.5|3 MoE LLMs demonstrate that our Sub-MoE significantly outperforms existing expert pruning and merging methods. Notably, our Sub-MoE maintains 96\%|86\% of original performance with 25\%|50\% expert reduction on Mixtral-8x7B in zero-shot benchmarks. Code will be released atthis https URL.

  Data augmentation is a promising tool for enhancing out-of-distribution generalization, where the key is to produce diverse, challenging variations of the source domain via costly targeted augmentations that maximize its generalization effect. Conversely, random augmentation is inexpensive but is deemed suboptimal due to its limited effect. In this paper, we revisit random augmentation and explore methods to address its shortcomings. We show that the stochastic nature of random augmentation can produce a set of colliding augmentations that distorts the learned features, similar to catastrophic forgetting. We propose a simple solution that improves the generalization effect of random augmentation by addressing forgetting, which displays strong generalization performance across various single source domain generalization (sDG) benchmarks.

  Predictive modeling on tabular data is the cornerstone of many real-world applications. Although gradient boosting machines and some recent deep models achieve strong performance on tabular data, they often lack interpretability. On the other hand, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated powerful capabilities to generate human-like reasoning and explanations, but remain under-performed for tabular data prediction. In this paper, we propose a new approach that leverages reasoning-based LLMs, trained using reinforcement learning, to perform more accurate and explainable predictions on tabular data. Our method introduces custom reward functions that guide the model not only toward better prediction accuracy but also toward human-understandable reasons for its predictions. The proposed method is evaluated on financial benchmark datasets and compared against established LLMs.

  The growing context lengths of large language models (LLMs) pose significant challenges for efficient inference, primarily due to GPU memory and bandwidth constraints. We present RetroInfer, a novel system that reconceptualizes the key-value (KV) cache as a vector storage system which exploits the inherent attention sparsity to accelerate long-context LLM inference. At its core is the wave index, an Attention-aWare VEctor index that enables efficient and accurate retrieval of critical tokens through techniques such as tripartite attention approximation, accuracy-bounded attention estimation, and segmented clustering. Complementing this is the wave buffer, which coordinates KV cache placement and overlaps computation and data transfer across GPU and CPU to sustain high throughput. Unlike prior sparsity-based methods that struggle with token selection and hardware coordination, RetroInfer delivers robust performance without compromising model accuracy. Experiments on long-context benchmarks show up to 4.5X speedup over full attention within GPU memory limits and up to 10.5X over sparse attention baselines when KV cache is extended to CPU memory, all while preserving full-attention-level accuracy.

  Diffusion policies have achieved superior performance in imitation learning and offline reinforcement learning (RL) due to their rich expressiveness. However, the conventional diffusion training procedure requires samples from target distribution, which is impossible in online RL since we cannot sample from the optimal policy. Backpropagating policy gradient through the diffusion process incurs huge computational costs and instability, thus being expensive and not scalable. To enable efficient training of diffusion policies in online RL, we generalize the conventional denoising score matching by reweighting the loss function. The resulting Reweighted Score Matching (RSM) preserves the optimal solution and low computational cost of denoising score matching, while eliminating the need to sample from the target distribution and allowing learning to optimize value functions. We introduce two tractable reweighted loss functions to solve two commonly used policy optimization problems, policy mirror descent and max-entropy policy, resulting in two practical algorithms named Diffusion Policy Mirror Descent (DPMD) and Soft Diffusion Actor-Critic (SDAC). We conducted comprehensive comparisons on MuJoCo benchmarks. The empirical results show that the proposed algorithms outperform recent diffusion-policy online RLs on most tasks, and the DPMD improves more than 120% over soft actor-critic on Humanoid and Ant.

  While existing federated learning approaches primarily focus on aggregating local models to construct a global model, in realistic settings, some clients may be reluctant to share their private models due to the inclusion of privacy-sensitive information. Knowledge distillation, which can extract model knowledge without accessing model parameters, is well-suited for this federated scenario. However, most distillation methods in federated learning (federated distillation) require a proxy dataset, which is difficult to obtain in the real world. Therefore, in this paper, we introduce a distributed three-player Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to implement data-free mutual distillation and propose an effective method called FedDTG. We confirmed that the fake samples generated by GAN can make federated distillation more efficient and robust. Additionally, the distillation process between clients can deliver good individual client performance while simultaneously acquiring global knowledge and protecting data privacy. Our extensive experiments on benchmark vision datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms other federated distillation algorithms in terms of generalization.

  While personalization has been explored in traditional autonomous driving systems, it remains largely overlooked in end-to-end autonomous driving (E2EAD), despite its growing prominence. This gap is critical, as user-aligned behavior is essential for trust, comfort, and widespread adoption of autonomous vehicles. A core challenge is the lack of large-scale real-world datasets annotated with diverse and fine-grained driving preferences, hindering the development and evaluation of personalized E2EAD models. In this work, we present the first large-scale real-world dataset enriched with annotations capturing diverse driving preferences, establishing a foundation for personalization in E2EAD. We extract static environmental features from real-world road topology and infer dynamic contextual cues using a fine-tuned visual language model (VLM), enabling consistent and fine-grained scenario construction. Based on these scenarios, we derive objective preference annotations through behavioral distribution analysis and rule-based heuristics. To address the inherent subjectivity of driving style, we further employ the VLM to generate subjective annotations by jointly modeling scene semantics and driver behavior. Final high-quality labels are obtained through a human-in-the-loop verification process that fuses both perspectives. Building on this dataset, we propose the first benchmark for evaluating personalized E2EAD models. We assess several state-of-the-art models with and without preference conditioning, demonstrating that incorporating personalized preferences results in behavior more aligned with human driving. Our work lays the foundation for personalized E2EAD by providing a standardized platform to systematically integrate human preferences into data-driven E2EAD systems, catalyzing future research in human-centric autonomy.

  The development of generalist robot manipulation policies has seen significant progress, driven by large-scale demonstration data across diverse environments. However, the high cost and inefficiency of collecting real-world demonstrations hinder the scalability of data acquisition. While existing simulation platforms enable controlled environments for robotic learning, the challenge of bridging the sim-to-real gap remains. To address these challenges, we propose RoboPearls, an editable video simulation framework for robotic manipulation. Built on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), RoboPearls enables the construction of photo-realistic, view-consistent simulations from demonstration videos, and supports a wide range of simulation operators, including various object manipulations, powered by advanced modules like Incremental Semantic Distillation (ISD) and 3D regularized NNFM Loss (3D-NNFM). Moreover, by incorporating large language models (LLMs), RoboPearls automates the simulation production process in a user-friendly manner through flexible command interpretation and execution. Furthermore, RoboPearls employs a vision-language model (VLM) to analyze robotic learning issues to close the simulation loop for performance enhancement. To demonstrate the effectiveness of RoboPearls, we conduct extensive experiments on multiple datasets and scenes, including RLBench, COLOSSEUM, Ego4D, Open X-Embodiment, and a real-world robot, which demonstrate our satisfactory simulation performance.

  Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is crucial for ensuring the reliability and safety of machine learning models in real-world applications, where they frequently face data distributions unseen during training. Despite progress, existing methods are often vulnerable to spurious correlations that mislead models and compromise robustness. To address this, we propose SPROD, a novel prototype-based OOD detection approach that explicitly addresses the challenge posed by unknown spurious correlations. Our post-hoc method refines class prototypes to mitigate bias from spurious features without additional data or hyperparameter tuning, and is broadly applicable across diverse backbones and OOD detection settings. We conduct a comprehensive spurious correlation OOD detection benchmarking, comparing our method against existing approaches and demonstrating its superior performance across challenging OOD datasets, such as CelebA, Waterbirds, UrbanCars, Spurious Imagenet, and the newly introduced Animals MetaCoCo. On average, SPROD improves AUROC by 4.7% and FPR@95 by 9.3% over the second best.

  In real-world vision-language applications, practitioners increasingly rely on large, pretrained foundation models rather than custom-built solutions, despite limited transparency regarding their training data and processes. While these models achieve impressive performance on general benchmarks, their effectiveness can decline notably under specialized domain shifts, such as unique imaging conditions or environmental variations. In this work, we introduce Deepbench, a framework designed to assess domain-specific robustness of vision-language models (VLMs). Deepbench leverages a large language model (LLM) to generate realistic, context-aware image corruptions tailored to specific deployment domains without requiring labeled data. We evaluate a range of contrastive vision-language architectures and architectural variants across six real-world domains and observe substantial variability in robustness, highlighting the need for targeted, domain-aware evaluation. Deepbench is released as open-source software to support further research into domain-aware robustness assessment.

  Training on test-time data enables deep learning models to adapt to dynamic environmental changes, enhancing their practical applicability. Online adaptation from source to target domains is promising but it remains highly reliant on the performance of source pretrained model. In this paper, we investigate whether test-time adaptation (TTA) methods can continuously improve models trained via self-supervised learning (SSL) without relying on source pretraining. We introduce a self-supervised TTA protocol after observing that existing TTA approaches struggle when directly applied to self-supervised models with low accuracy on the source domain. Furthermore, we propose a collaborative learning framework that integrates SSL and TTA models, leveraging contrastive learning and knowledge distillation for stepwise representation refinement. We validate our method on diverse self-supervised models, including DINO, MoCo, and iBOT, across TTA benchmarks. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach in SSL, showing that it achieves competitive performance even without source pretraining.

  Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) models have demonstrated superior performance across various visual tasks including medical image classification. However, fairness concerns, including demographic biases, have received limited attention for CLIP models. This oversight leads to critical issues, particularly those related to race and gender, resulting in disparities in diagnostic outcomes and reduced reliability for underrepresented groups. To address these challenges, we introduce AdFair-CLIP, a novel framework employing adversarial feature intervention to suppress sensitive attributes, thereby mitigating spurious correlations and improving prediction fairness. We conduct comprehensive experiments on chest X-ray (CXR) datasets, and show that AdFair-CLIP significantly enhances both fairness and diagnostic accuracy, while maintaining robust generalization in zero-shot and few-shot scenarios. These results establish new benchmarks for fairness-aware learning in CLIP-based medical diagnostic models, particularly for CXR analysis.

  Deep learning for human sensing on edge systems offers significant opportunities for smart applications. However, its training and development are hindered by the limited availability of sensor data and resource constraints of edge systems. Current methods that rely on transferring pre-trained models often encounter issues such as modality shift and high resource demands, resulting in substantial accuracy loss, resource overhead, and poor adaptability across different sensing applications. In this paper, we propose XTransfer, a first-of-its-kind method for resource-efficient, modality-agnostic model transfer. XTransfer freely leverages single or multiple pre-trained models and transfers knowledge across different modalities by (i) model repairing that safely repairs modality shift in pre-trained model layers with only few sensor data, and (ii) layer recombining that efficiently searches and recombines layers of interest from source models in a layer-wise manner to create compact models. We benchmark various baselines across diverse human sensing datasets spanning different modalities. Comprehensive results demonstrate that XTransfer achieves state-of-the-art performance on human sensing tasks while significantly reducing the costs of sensor data collection, model training, and edge deployment.

  Pre-trained vision models (PVMs) have demonstrated remarkable adaptability across a wide range of downstream vision tasks, showcasing exceptional performance. However, as these models scale to billions or even trillions of parameters, conventional full fine-tuning has become increasingly impractical due to its high computational and storage demands. To address these challenges, parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has emerged as a promising alternative, aiming to achieve performance comparable to full fine-tuning while making minimal adjustments to the model parameters. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of the latest advancements in the visual PEFT field, systematically reviewing current methodologies and categorizing them into four primary categories: addition-based, partial-based, unified-based, and multi-task tuning. In addition, this paper offers an in-depth analysis of widely used visual datasets and real-world applications where PEFT methods have been successfully applied. Furthermore, this paper introduces the V-PEFT Bench, a unified benchmark designed to standardize the evaluation of PEFT methods across a diverse set of vision tasks, ensuring consistency and fairness in comparison.

  The rapid progress of multimodal large language models (MLLM) has paved the way for Vision-Language-Action (VLA) paradigms, which integrate visual perception, natural language understanding, and control within a single policy. Researchers in autonomous driving are actively adapting these methods to the vehicle domain. Such models promise autonomous vehicles that can interpret high-level instructions, reason about complex traffic scenes, and make their own decisions. However, the literature remains fragmented and is rapidly expanding. This survey offers the first comprehensive overview of VLA for Autonomous Driving (VLA4AD). We (i) formalize the architectural building blocks shared across recent work, (ii) trace the evolution from early explainer to reasoning-centric VLA models, and (iii) compare over 20 representative models according to VLA's progress in the autonomous driving domain. We also consolidate existing datasets and benchmarks, highlighting protocols that jointly measure driving safety, accuracy, and explanation quality. Finally, we detail open challenges - robustness, real-time efficiency, and formal verification - and outline future directions of VLA4AD. This survey provides a concise yet complete reference for advancing interpretable socially aligned autonomous vehicles. Github repo is available at \href{this https URL}{SicongJiang/Awesome-VLA4AD}.

  Point-pixel registration between LiDAR point clouds and camera images is a fundamental yet challenging task in autonomous driving and robotic perception. A key difficulty lies in the modality gap between unstructured point clouds and structured images, especially under sparse single-frame LiDAR settings. Existing methods typically extract features separately from point clouds and images, then rely on hand-crafted or learned matching strategies. This separate encoding fails to bridge the modality gap effectively, and more critically, these methods struggle with the sparsity and noise of single-frame LiDAR, often requiring point cloud accumulation or additional priors to improve reliability. Inspired by recent progress in detector-free matching paradigms (e.g. MatchAnything), we revisit the projection-based approach and introduce the detector-free framework for direct point-pixel matching between LiDAR and camera views. Specifically, we project the LiDAR intensity map into a 2D view from the LiDAR perspective and feed it into an attention-based detector-free matching network, enabling cross-modal correspondence estimation without relying on multi-frame accumulation. To further enhance matching reliability, we introduce a repeatability scoring mechanism that acts as a soft visibility prior. This guides the network to suppress unreliable matches in regions with low intensity variation, improving robustness under sparse input. Extensive experiments on KITTI, nuScenes, and MIAS-LCEC-TF70 benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming prior approaches on nuScenes (even those relying on accumulated point clouds), despite using only single-frame LiDAR.

  Combining traditional RGB cameras with bio-inspired event cameras for robust object tracking has garnered increasing attention in recent years. However, most existing multimodal tracking algorithms depend heavily on high-complexity Vision Transformer architectures for feature extraction and fusion across modalities. This not only leads to substantial computational overhead but also limits the effectiveness of cross-modal interactions. In this paper, we propose an efficient RGB-Event object tracking framework based on the linear-complexity Vision Mamba network, termed Mamba-FETrack V2. Specifically, we first design a lightweight Prompt Generator that utilizes embedded features from each modality, together with a shared prompt pool, to dynamically generate modality-specific learnable prompt vectors. These prompts, along with the modality-specific embedded features, are then fed into a Vision Mamba-based FEMamba backbone, which facilitates prompt-guided feature extraction, cross-modal interaction, and fusion in a unified manner. Finally, the fused representations are passed to the tracking head for accurate target localization. Extensive experimental evaluations on multiple RGB-Event tracking benchmarks, including short-term COESOT dataset and long-term datasets, i.e., FE108 and FELT V2, demonstrate the superior performance and efficiency of the proposed tracking framework. The source code and pre-trained models will be released onthis https URL

  Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) offer exceptional fidelity for video compression by learning per-video optimized functions, but their adoption is crippled by impractically slow encoding times. Existing attempts to accelerate INR encoding often sacrifice reconstruction quality or crucial coordinate-level control essential for adaptive streaming and transcoding. We introduce SIEDD (Shared-Implicit Encoder with Discrete Decoders), a novel architecture that fundamentally accelerates INR encoding without these compromises. SIEDD first rapidly trains a shared, coordinate-based encoder on sparse anchor frames to efficiently capture global, low-frequency video features. This encoder is then frozen, enabling massively parallel training of lightweight, discrete decoders for individual frame groups, further expedited by aggressive coordinate-space sampling. This synergistic design delivers a remarkable 20-30X encoding speed-up over state-of-the-art INR codecs on HD and 4K benchmarks, while maintaining competitive reconstruction quality and compression ratios. Critically, SIEDD retains full coordinate-based control, enabling continuous resolution decoding and eliminating costly transcoding. Our approach significantly advances the practicality of high-fidelity neural video compression, demonstrating a scalable and efficient path towards real-world deployment.

  Text-to-image (T2I) models are widespread, but their limited safety guardrails expose end users to harmful content and potentially allow for model misuse. Current safety measures are typically limited to text-based filtering or concept removal strategies, able to remove just a few concepts from the model's generative capabilities. In this work, we introduce AlignGuard, a method for safety alignment of T2I models. We enable the application of Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) for safety purposes in T2I models by synthetically generating a dataset of harmful and safe image-text pairs, which we call CoProV2. Using a custom DPO strategy and this dataset, we train safety experts, in the form of low-rank adaptation (LoRA) matrices, able to guide the generation process away from specific safety-related concepts. Then, we merge the experts into a single LoRA using a novel merging strategy for optimal scaling performance. This expert-based approach enables scalability, allowing us to remove 7x more harmful concepts from T2I models compared to baselines. AlignGuard consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art on many benchmarks and establishes new practices for safety alignment in T2I networks. Code and data will be shared atthis https URL.

  Recent generative models based on score matching and flow matching have significantly advanced generation tasks, but their potential in discriminative tasks remains underexplored. Previous approaches, such as generative classifiers, have not fully leveraged the capabilities of these models for discriminative tasks due to their intricate designs. We propose Pretrained Reversible Generation (PRG), which extracts unsupervised representations by reversing the generative process of a pretrained continuous generation model. PRG effectively reuses unsupervised generative models, leveraging their high capacity to serve as robust and generalizable feature extractors for downstream tasks. This framework enables the flexible selection of feature hierarchies tailored to specific downstream tasks. Our method consistently outperforms prior approaches across multiple benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art performance among generative model based methods, including 78% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet at a resolution of 64*64. Extensive ablation studies, including out-of-distribution evaluations, further validate the effectiveness of ourthis http URLis available atthis https URL.

  Recent progress in vision-language segmentation has significantly advanced grounded visual understanding. However, these models often exhibit hallucinations by producing segmentation masks for objects not grounded in the image content or by incorrectly labeling irrelevant regions. Existing evaluation protocols for segmentation hallucination primarily focus on label or textual hallucinations without manipulating the visual context, limiting their capacity to diagnose critical failures. In response, we introduce HalluSegBench, the first benchmark specifically designed to evaluate hallucinations in visual grounding through the lens of counterfactual visual reasoning. Our benchmark consists of a novel dataset of 1340 counterfactual instance pairs spanning 281 unique object classes, and a set of newly introduced metrics that quantify hallucination sensitivity under visually coherent scene edits. Experiments on HalluSegBench with state-of-the-art vision-language segmentation models reveal that vision-driven hallucinations are significantly more prevalent than label-driven ones, with models often persisting in false segmentation, highlighting the need for counterfactual reasoning to diagnose grounding fidelity.

  Urban research involves a wide range of scenarios and tasks that require the understanding of multi-modal data. Current methods often focus on specific data types and lack a unified framework in urban field for processing them comprehensively. The recent success of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) presents a promising opportunity to overcome this limitation. In this paper, we introduce $\textit{UrbanLLaVA}$, a multi-modal large language model designed to process these four types of data simultaneously and achieve strong performance across diverse urban tasks compared with general MLLMs. In $\textit{UrbanLLaVA}$, we first curate a diverse urban instruction dataset encompassing both single-modal and cross-modal urban data, spanning from location view to global view of urban environment. Additionally, we propose a multi-stage training framework that decouples spatial reasoning enhancement from domain knowledge learning, thereby improving the compatibility and downstream performance of $\textit{UrbanLLaVA}$ across diverse urban tasks. Finally, we also extend existing benchmark for urban research to assess the performance of MLLMs across a wide range of urban tasks. Experimental results from three cities demonstrate that $\textit{UrbanLLaVA}$ outperforms open-source and proprietary MLLMs in both single-modal tasks and complex cross-modal tasks and shows robust generalization abilities across cities.

  Multimodal embedding models, built upon causal Vision Language Models (VLMs), have shown promise in various tasks. However, current approaches face three key limitations: the use of causal attention in VLM backbones is suboptimal for embedding tasks; scalability issues due to reliance on high-quality labeled paired data for contrastive learning; and limited diversity in training objectives and data. To address these issues, we propose MoCa, a two-stage framework for transforming pre-trained VLMs into effective bidirectional multimodal embedding models. The first stage, Modality-aware Continual Pre-training, introduces a joint reconstruction objective that simultaneously denoises interleaved text and image inputs, enhancing bidirectional context-aware reasoning. The second stage, Heterogeneous Contrastive Fine-tuning, leverages diverse, semantically rich multimodal data beyond simple image-caption pairs to enhance generalization and alignment. Our method addresses the stated limitations by introducing bidirectional attention through continual pre-training, scaling effectively with massive unlabeled datasets via joint reconstruction objectives, and utilizing diverse multimodal data for enhanced representation robustness. Experiments demonstrate that MoCa consistently improves performance across MMEB and ViDoRe-v2 benchmarks, achieving new state-of-the-art results, and exhibits strong scalability with both model size and training data on MMEB.

  Deepfake (DF) attacks pose a growing threat as generative models become increasingly advanced. However, our study reveals that existing DF datasets fail to deceive human perception, unlike real DF attacks that influence public discourse. It highlights the need for more realistic DF attack vectors. We introduce PhonemeFake (PF), a DF attack that manipulates critical speech segments using language reasoning, significantly reducing human perception by up to 42% and benchmark accuracies by up to 94%. We release an easy-to-use PF dataset on HuggingFace and open-source bilevel DF segment detection model that adaptively prioritizes compute on manipulated regions. Our extensive experiments across three known DF datasets reveal that our detection model reduces EER by 91% while achieving up to 90% speed-up, with minimal compute overhead and precise localization beyond existing models as a scalable solution.

  Temporal Video Grounding (TVG), the task of locating specific video segments based on language queries, is a core challenge in long-form video understanding. While recent Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have shown early promise in tackling TVG through supervised fine-tuning (SFT), their abilities to generalize remain limited. To address this, we propose a novel post-training framework that enhances the generalization capabilities of LVLMs via reinforcement learning (RL). Specifically, our contributions span three key directions: (1) Time-R1: we introduce a reasoning-guided post-training framework via RL with verifiable reward to enhance the capabilities of LVLMs on the TVG task. (2) TimeRFT: we explore data-efficient post-training strategies on our curated RL-friendly dataset, which trains the model to progressively comprehend difficult samples, leading to better generalization. (3) TVGBench: we carefully construct a small yet comprehensive benchmark for LVLM evaluation, assessing 11 types of queries and featuring balanced distributions across both videos and queries. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Time-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple downstream datasets using only 2.5K training data, while improving its general video understanding capabilities.

  Autonomous embodied agents live on an Internet of multimedia websites. Can they hop around multimodal websites to complete complex user tasks? Existing benchmarks fail to assess them in a realistic, evolving environment for their embodiment across websites. To answer this question, we present MMInA, a multihop and multimodal benchmark to evaluate the embodied agents for compositional Internet tasks, with several appealing properties: 1) Evolving real-world multimodal websites. Our benchmark uniquely operates on evolving real-world websites, ensuring a high degree of realism and applicability to natural user tasks. Our data includes 1,050 human-written tasks covering various domains such as shopping and travel, with each task requiring the agent to extract multimodal information from web pages as observations autonomously; 2) Multihop web browsing. Our dataset features naturally compositional tasks that require information from or actions on multiple websites to solve, to assess long-range reasoning capabilities on web tasks; 3) Holistic evaluation. We propose a novel protocol for evaluating an agent's progress in completing multihop tasks. We experiment with both standalone (multimodal) language models and heuristic-based web agents. Extensive experiments demonstrate that while long-chain multihop web tasks are easy for humans, they remain challenging for state-of-the-art web agents. We identify that agents are more likely to fail on the early hops when solving tasks with more hops, which results in lower task success rates. To address this issue, we propose a simple memory augmentation approach that replays past action trajectories to reflect. Our method significantly improves the performance of both the single-hop and multihop web browsing abilities. Our code and data are available atthis http URL.

  Residual connection has been extensively studied and widely applied at the model architecture level. However, its potential in the more challenging data-centric approaches remains unexplored. In this work, we introduce the concept of Data Residual Matching for the first time, leveraging data-level skip connections to facilitate data generation and mitigate data information vanishing. This approach maintains a balance between newly acquired knowledge through pixel space optimization and existing core local information identification within raw data modalities, specifically for the dataset distillation task. Furthermore, by incorporating optimization-level refinements, our method significantly improves computational efficiency, achieving superior performance while reducing training time and peak GPU memory usage by 50%. Consequently, the proposed method Fast and Accurate Data Residual Matching for Dataset Distillation (FADRM) establishes a new state-of-the-art, demonstrating substantial improvements over existing methods across multiple dataset benchmarks in both efficiency and effectiveness. For instance, with ResNet-18 as the student model and a 0.8% compression ratio on ImageNet-1K, the method achieves 47.7% test accuracy in single-model dataset distillation and 50.0% in multi-model dataset distillation, surpassing RDED by +5.7% and outperforming state-of-the-art multi-model approaches, EDC and CV-DD, by +1.4% and +4.0%.

  Lecture slide element detection and retrieval are key problems in slide understanding. Training effective models for these tasks often depends on extensive manual annotation. However, annotating large volumes of lecture slides for supervised training is labor intensive and requires domain expertise. To address this, we propose a large language model (LLM)-guided synthetic lecture slide generation pipeline, SynLecSlideGen, which produces high-quality, coherent and realistic slides. We also create an evaluation benchmark, namely RealSlide by manually annotating 1,050 real lecture slides. To assess the utility of our synthetic slides, we perform few-shot transfer learning on real data using models pre-trained on them. Experimental results show that few-shot transfer learning with pretraining on synthetic slides significantly improves performance compared to training only on real data. This demonstrates that synthetic data can effectively compensate for limited labeled lecture slides. The code and resources of our work are publicly available on our project website:this https URL.

  This paper introduces Qwen-GUI-3B, a lightweight Vision-Language Model (VLM) specifically designed for Graphical User Interface grounding tasks, achieving performance competitive with significantly larger models. Unlike large-scale VLMs (>7B parameters) that are computationally intensive and impractical for consumer-grade hardware, Qwen-GUI-3B delivers strong grounding accuracy while being fully trainable on a single GPU (RTX 4090). The model incorporates several key innovations: (i) combine cross-platform, multi-resolution dataset of 24K examples from diverse sources including mobile, desktop, and web GUI screenshots to effectively address data scarcity in high-resolution desktop environments; (ii) a two-stage fine-tuning strategy, where initial cross-platform training establishes robust GUI understanding, followed by specialized fine-tuning on high-resolution data to significantly enhance model adaptability; and (iii) data curation and redundancy reduction strategies, demonstrating that randomly sampling a smaller subset with reduced redundancy achieves performance comparable to larger datasets, emphasizing data diversity over sheer volume. Empirical evaluation on standard GUI grounding benchmarks-including ScreenSpot, ScreenSpot-v2, and the challenging ScreenSpot-Pro, highlights Qwen-GUI-3B's exceptional accuracy, achieving 84.9% on ScreenSpot and 86.4% on ScreenSpot-v2, surpassing prior models under 4B parameters. Ablation studies validate the critical role of balanced sampling and two-stage fine-tuning in enhancing robustness, particularly in high-resolution desktop scenarios.

  In this work, we focus on a novel and practical task, i.e., Time-vAriant iMage inPainting (TAMP). The aim of TAMP is to restore a damaged target image by leveraging the complementary information from a reference image, where both images captured the same scene but with a significant time gap in between, i.e., time-variant images. Different from conventional reference-guided image inpainting, the reference image under TAMP setup presents significant content distinction to the target image and potentially also suffers from damages. Such an application frequently happens in our daily lives to restore a damaged image by referring to another reference image, where there is no guarantee of the reference image's source and quality. In particular, our study finds that even state-of-the-art (SOTA) reference-guided image inpainting methods fail to achieve plausible results due to the chaotic image complementation. To address such an ill-posed problem, we propose a novel Interactive Distribution Transition Estimation (InDiTE) module which interactively complements the time-variant images with adaptive semantics thus facilitate the restoration of damaged regions. To further boost the performance, we propose our TAMP solution, namely Interactive Distribution Transition Estimation-driven Diffusion (InDiTE-Diff), which integrates InDiTE with SOTA diffusion model and conducts latent cross-reference during sampling. Moreover, considering the lack of benchmarks for TAMP task, we newly assembled a dataset, i.e., TAMP-Street, based on existing image and mask datasets. We conduct experiments on the TAMP-Street datasets under two different time-variant image inpainting settings, which show our method consistently outperform SOTA reference-guided image inpainting methods for solving TAMP.

  Despite remarkable progress in Text-to-Image models, many real-world applications require generating coherent image sets with diverse consistency requirements. Existing consistent methods often focus on a specific domain with specific aspects of consistency, which significantly constrains their generalizability to broader applications. In this paper, we propose a more challenging problem, Text-to-ImageSet (T2IS) generation, which aims to generate sets of images that meet various consistency requirements based on user instructions. To systematically study this problem, we first introduce $\textbf{T2IS-Bench}$ with 596 diverse instructions across 26 subcategories, providing comprehensive coverage for T2IS generation. Building on this, we propose $\textbf{T2IS-Eval}$, an evaluation framework that transforms user instructions into multifaceted assessment criteria and employs effective evaluators to adaptively assess consistency fulfillment between criteria and generated sets. Subsequently, we propose $\textbf{AutoT2IS}$, a training-free framework that maximally leverages pretrained Diffusion Transformers' in-context capabilities to harmonize visual elements to satisfy both image-level prompt alignment and set-level visual consistency. Extensive experiments on T2IS-Bench reveal that diverse consistency challenges all existing methods, while our AutoT2IS significantly outperforms current generalized and even specialized approaches. Our method also demonstrates the ability to enable numerous underexplored real-world applications, confirming its substantial practical value. Visit our project inthis https URL.

  In this report, we introduce Ovis-U1, a 3-billion-parameter unified model that integrates multimodal understanding, text-to-image generation, and image editing capabilities. Building on the foundation of the Ovis series, Ovis-U1 incorporates a diffusion-based visual decoder paired with a bidirectional token refiner, enabling image generation tasks comparable to leading models like GPT-4o. Unlike some previous models that use a frozen MLLM for generation tasks, Ovis-U1 utilizes a new unified training approach starting from a language model. Compared to training solely on understanding or generation tasks, unified training yields better performance, demonstrating the enhancement achieved by integrating these two tasks. Ovis-U1 achieves a score of 69.6 on the OpenCompass Multi-modal Academic Benchmark, surpassing recent state-of-the-art models such as Ristretto-3B and SAIL-VL-1.5-2B. In text-to-image generation, it excels with scores of 83.72 and 0.89 on the DPG-Bench and GenEval benchmarks, respectively. For image editing, it achieves 4.00 and 6.42 on the ImgEdit-Bench and GEdit-Bench-EN, respectively. As the initial version of the Ovis unified model series, Ovis-U1 pushes the boundaries of multimodal understanding, generation, and editing.

  Training robust and generalizable reward models for human visual preferences is essential for aligning text-to-image and text-to-video generative models with human intent. However, current reward models often fail to generalize, and supervised fine-tuning leads to memorization, demanding complex annotation pipelines. While reinforcement learning (RL), specifically Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), improves generalization, we uncover a key failure mode: a significant drop in reasoning accuracy occurs when a model's reasoning trace contradicts that of an independent, frozen vision-language model ("listener") evaluating the same output. To address this, we introduce a listener-augmented GRPO framework. Here, the listener re-evaluates the reasoner's chain-of-thought to provide a dense, calibrated confidence score, shaping the RL reward signal. This encourages the reasoner not only to answer correctly, but to produce explanations that are persuasive to an independent model. Our listener-shaped reward scheme achieves best accuracy on the ImageReward benchmark (67.4%), significantly improves out-of-distribution (OOD) performance on a large-scale human preference dataset (1.2M votes, up to +6% over naive reasoner), and reduces reasoning contradictions compared to strong GRPO and SFT baselines. These results demonstrate that listener-based rewards provide a scalable, data-efficient path to aligning vision-language models with nuanced human preferences. We will release our reasoning model here:this https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Surgical risk identification is critical for patient safety and reducing preventable medical errors. While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) show promise for automated operating room (OR) risk detection, they often exhibit visual-semantic knowledge conflicts (VS-KC), failing to identify visual safety violations despite understanding textual rules. To address this, we introduce a dataset comprising over 34,000 synthetic images generated by diffusion models, depicting operating room scenes containing entities that violate established safety rules. These images were created to alleviate data scarcity and examine MLLMs vulnerabilities. In addition, the dataset includes 214 human-annotated images that serve as a gold-standard reference for validation. This comprehensive dataset, spanning diverse perspectives, stages, and configurations, is designed to expose and study VS-KC. Fine-tuning on OR-VSKC significantly improves MLLMs' detection of trained conflict entities and generalizes well to new viewpoints for these entities, but performance on untrained entity types remains poor, highlighting learning specificity and the need for comprehensive training.

  Bed-related falls remain a leading source of injury in hospitals and long-term-care facilities, yet many commercial alarms trigger only after a patient has already left the bed. We show that early bed-exit intent can be predicted using only four low-cost load cells mounted under the bed legs. The resulting load signals are first converted into a compact set of complementary images: an RGB line plot that preserves raw waveforms and three texture maps - recurrence plot, Markov transition field, and Gramian angular field - that expose higher-order dynamics. We introduce ViFusionTST, a dual-stream Swin Transformer that processes the line plot and texture maps in parallel and fuses them through cross-attention to learn data-driven modality weights.To provide a realistic benchmark, we collected six months of continuous data from 95 beds in a long-term-care facility. On this real-world dataset ViFusionTST reaches an accuracy of 0.885 and an F1 score of 0.794, surpassing recent 1D and 2D time-series baselines across F1, recall, accuracy, and AUPRC. The results demonstrate that image-based fusion of load-sensor signals for time series classification is a practical and effective solution for real-time, privacy-preserving fall prevention.

  In this paper, we introduce OmniEval, a benchmark for evaluating omni-modality models like MiniCPM-O 2.6, which encompasses visual, auditory, and textual inputs. Compared with existing benchmarks, our OmniEval has several distinctive features: (i) Full-modal collaboration: We design evaluation tasks that highlight the strong coupling between audio and video, requiring models to effectively leverage the collaborative perception of all modalities; (ii) Diversity of videos: OmniEval includes 810 audio-visual synchronized videos, 285 Chinese videos and 525 English videos; (iii) Diversity and granularity of tasks: OmniEval contains 2617 question-answer pairs, comprising 1412 open-ended questions and 1205 multiple-choice questions. These questions are divided into 3 major task types and 12 sub-task types to achieve comprehensive evaluation. Among them, we introduce a more granular video localization task named Grounding. Then we conduct experiments on OmniEval with several omni-modality models. We hope that our OmniEval can provide a platform for evaluating the ability to construct and understand coherence from the context of all modalities. Codes and data could be found atthis https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recently, vision-language pretraining has emerged as a transformative technique that integrates the strengths of both visual and textual modalities, resulting in powerful vision-language models (VLMs). Leveraging web-scale pretraining data, these models exhibit strong zero-shot capabilities. However, their performance often deteriorates when confronted with domain-specific or specialized generalization tasks. To address this, a growing body of research focuses on transferring or generalizing the rich knowledge embedded in VLMs to various downstream applications. This survey aims to comprehensively summarize the generalization settings, methodologies, benchmarking and results in VLM literatures. Delving into the typical VLM structures, current literatures are categorized into prompt-based, parameter-based and feature-based methods according to the transferred modules. The differences and characteristics in each category are furthered summarized and discussed by revisiting the typical transfer learning (TL) settings, providing novel interpretations for TL in the era of VLMs. Popular benchmarks for VLM generalization are further introduced with thorough performance comparisons among the reviewed methods. Following the advances in large-scale generalizable pretraining, this survey also discusses the relations and differences between VLMs and up-to-date multimodal large language models (MLLM), e.g., DeepSeek-VL. By systematically reviewing the surging literatures in vision-language research from a novel and practical generalization prospective, this survey contributes to a clear landscape of current and future multimodal researches.

  Although Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at various image-related tasks, they encounter challenges in precisely aligning coordinates with spatial information within images, particularly in position-aware tasks such as visual grounding. This limitation arises from two key factors. First, MLLMs lack explicit spatial references, making it difficult to associate textual descriptions with precise image locations. Second, their feature extraction processes prioritize global context over fine-grained spatial details, leading to weak localization capability. To address these issues, we introduce VPP-LLaVA, an MLLM enhanced with Visual Position Prompt (VPP) to improve its grounding capability. VPP-LLaVA integrates two complementary mechanisms: the global VPP overlays a learnable, axis-like tensor onto the input image to provide structured spatial cues, while the local VPP incorporates position-aware queries to support fine-grainedthis http URLeffectively train our model with spatial guidance, we further introduce VPP-SFT, a curated dataset of 0.6M high-quality visual grounding samples. Designed in a compact format, it enables efficient training and is significantly smaller than datasets used by other MLLMs (e.g., ~21M samples in MiniGPT-v2), yet still provides a strong performance boost. The resulting model, VPP-LLaVA, not only achieves state-of-the-art results on standard visual grounding benchmarks but also demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization to challenging unseen datasets. Code and dataset will be released upon acceptance atthis https URL.

  We introduce Calligrapher, a novel diffusion-based framework that innovatively integrates advanced text customization with artistic typography for digital calligraphy and design applications. Addressing the challenges of precise style control and data dependency in typographic customization, our framework incorporates three key technical contributions. First, we develop a self-distillation mechanism that leverages the pre-trained text-to-image generative model itself alongside the large language model to automatically construct a style-centric typography benchmark. Second, we introduce a localized style injection framework via a trainable style encoder, which comprises both Qformer and linear layers, to extract robust style features from reference images. An in-context generation mechanism is also employed to directly embed reference images into the denoising process, further enhancing the refined alignment of target styles. Extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations across diverse fonts and design contexts confirm Calligrapher's accurate reproduction of intricate stylistic details and precise glyph positioning. By automating high-quality, visually consistent typography, Calligrapher surpasses traditional models, empowering creative practitioners in digital art, branding, and contextual typographic design.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Diffusion models have demonstrated exceptional visual quality in video generation, making them promising for autonomous driving world modeling. However, existing video diffusion-based world models struggle with flexible-length, long-horizon predictions and integrating trajectory planning. This is because conventional video diffusion models rely on global joint distribution modeling of fixed-length frame sequences rather than sequentially constructing localized distributions at each timestep. In this work, we propose Epona, an autoregressive diffusion world model that enables localized spatiotemporal distribution modeling through two key innovations: 1) Decoupled spatiotemporal factorization that separates temporal dynamics modeling from fine-grained future world generation, and 2) Modular trajectory and video prediction that seamlessly integrate motion planning with visual modeling in an end-to-end framework. Our architecture enables high-resolution, long-duration generation while introducing a novel chain-of-forward training strategy to address error accumulation in autoregressive loops. Experimental results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance with 7.4\% FVD improvement and minutes longer prediction duration compared to prior works. The learned world model further serves as a real-time motion planner, outperforming strong end-to-end planners on NAVSIM benchmarks.

  Recent progress in multimodal reasoning has been significantly advanced by textual Chain-of-Thought (CoT), a paradigm where models conduct reasoning within language. This text-centric approach, however, treats vision as a static, initial context, creating a fundamental "semantic gap" between rich perceptual data and discrete symbolic thought. Human cognition often transcends language, utilizing vision as a dynamic mental sketchpad. A similar evolution is now unfolding in AI, marking a fundamental paradigm shift from models that merely think about images to those that can truly think with images. This emerging paradigm is characterized by models leveraging visual information as intermediate steps in their thought process, transforming vision from a passive input into a dynamic, manipulable cognitive workspace. In this survey, we chart this evolution of intelligence along a trajectory of increasing cognitive autonomy, which unfolds across three key stages: from external tool exploration, through programmatic manipulation, to intrinsic imagination. To structure this rapidly evolving field, our survey makes four key contributions. (1) We establish the foundational principles of the think with image paradigm and its three-stage framework. (2) We provide a comprehensive review of the core methods that characterize each stage of this roadmap. (3) We analyze the critical landscape of evaluation benchmarks and transformative applications. (4) We identify significant challenges and outline promising future directions. By providing this structured overview, we aim to offer a clear roadmap for future research towards more powerful and human-aligned multimodal AI.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Panoramic optical flow enables a comprehensive understanding of temporal dynamics across wide fields of view. However, severe distortions caused by sphere-to-plane projections, such as the equirectangular projection (ERP), significantly degrade the performance of conventional perspective-based optical flow methods, especially in polar regions. To address this challenge, we propose PriOr-Flow, a novel dual-branch framework that leverages the low-distortion nature of the orthogonal view to enhance optical flow estimation in these regions. Specifically, we introduce the Dual-Cost Collaborative Lookup (DCCL) operator, which jointly retrieves correlation information from both the primitive and orthogonal cost volumes, effectively mitigating distortion noise during cost volume construction. Furthermore, our Ortho-Driven Distortion Compensation (ODDC) module iteratively refines motion features from both branches, further suppressing polar distortions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PriOr-Flow is compatible with various perspective-based iterative optical flow methods and consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance on publicly available panoramic optical flow datasets, setting a new benchmark for wide-field motion estimation.

  As camera-equipped robotic platforms become increasingly integrated into daily life, robotic-generated videos have begun to appear on streaming media platforms, enabling us to envision a future where humans and robots coexist. We innovatively propose the concept of Robotic-Generated Content (RGC) to term these videos generated from egocentric perspective of robots. The perceptual quality of RGC videos is critical in human-robot interaction scenarios, and RGC videos exhibit unique distortions and visual requirements that differ markedly from those of professionally-generated content (PGC) videos and user-generated content (UGC) videos. However, dedicated research on quality assessment of RGC videos is still lacking. To address this gap and to support broader robotic applications, we establish the first Robotic-Generated Content Database (RGCD), which contains a total of 2,100 videos drawn from three robot categories and sourced from diverse platforms. A subjective VQA experiment is conducted subsequently to assess human visual perception of robotic-generated videos. Finally, we conduct a benchmark experiment to evaluate the performance of 11 state-of-the-art VQA models on our database. Experimental results reveal significant limitations in existing VQA models when applied to complex, robotic-generated content, highlighting a critical need for RGC-specific VQA models.

  Viewpoint missing of objects is common in scene reconstruction, as camera paths typically prioritize capturing the overall scene structure rather than individual objects. This makes it highly challenging to achieve high-fidelity object-level modeling while maintaining accurate scene-level representation. Addressing this issue is critical for advancing downstream tasks requiring detailed object understanding and appearance modeling. In this paper, we introduce Refine Any object In any ScenE (RAISE), a novel 3D enhancement framework that leverages 3D generative priors to recover fine-grained object geometry and appearance under missing views. Starting from substituting degraded objects with proxies, via a 3D generative model with strong 3D understanding, RAISE progressively refines geometry and texture by aligning each proxy to its degraded counterpart in 7-DOF pose, followed by correcting spatial and appearance inconsistencies via registration-constrained enhancement. This two-stage refinement ensures the high-fidelity geometry and appearance of the original object in unseen views while maintaining consistency in spatial positioning, observed geometry, and appearance. Extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks show that RAISE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both novel view synthesis and geometry completion tasks.

  Benefiting from the advances in large language models and cross-modal alignment, existing multimodal large language models have achieved prominent performance in image and short video understanding. However, the understanding of long videos is still challenging, as their long-context nature results in significant computational and memory overhead. Most existing work treats long videos in the same way as short videos, which is inefficient for real-world applications and hard to generalize to even longer videos. To address these issues, we propose Flash-VStream, an efficient video language model capable of processing extremely long videos and responding to user queries in real time. Particularly, we design a Flash Memory module, containing a low-capacity context memory to aggregate long-context temporal information and model the distribution of information density, and a high-capacity augmentation memory to retrieve detailed spatial information based on this distribution. Compared to existing models, Flash-VStream achieves significant reductions in inference latency. Extensive experiments on long video benchmarks and comprehensive video benchmarks, i.e., EgoSchema, MLVU, LVBench, MVBench and Video-MME, demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance and outstanding efficiency of our method.

  We propose VisTex-OVLM, a novel image prompted object detection method that introduces visual textualization -- a process that projects a few visual exemplars into the text feature space to enhance Object-level Vision-Language Models' (OVLMs) capability in detecting rare categories that are difficult to describe textually and nearly absent from their pre-training data, while preserving their pre-trained object-text alignment. Specifically, VisTex-OVLM leverages multi-scale textualizing blocks and a multi-stage fusion strategy to integrate visual information from visual exemplars, generating textualized visual tokens that effectively guide OVLMs alongside text prompts. Unlike previous methods, our method maintains the original architecture of OVLM, maintaining its generalization capabilities while enhancing performance in few-shot settings. VisTex-OVLM demonstrates superior performance across open-set datasets which have minimal overlap with OVLM's pre-training data and achieves state-of-the-art results on few-shot benchmarks PASCAL VOC and MSCOCO.

  Open-vocabulary object detectors such as Grounding DINO are trained on vast and diverse data, achieving remarkable performance on challenging datasets. Due to that, it is unclear where to find their limitations, which is of major concern when using in safety-critical applications. Real-world data does not provide sufficient control, required for a rigorous evaluation of model generalization. In contrast, synthetically generated data allows to systematically explore the boundaries of model competence/generalization. In this work, we address two research questions: 1) Can we challenge open-vocabulary object detectors with generated image content? 2) Can we find systematic failure modes of those models? To address these questions, we design two automated pipelines using stable diffusion to inpaint unusual objects with high diversity in semantics, by sampling multiple substantives from WordNet and ChatGPT. On the synthetically generated data, we evaluate and compare multiple open-vocabulary object detectors as well as a classical object detector. The synthetic data is derived from two real-world datasets, namely LostAndFound, a challenging out-of-distribution (OOD) detection benchmark, and the NuImages dataset. Our results indicate that inpainting can challenge open-vocabulary object detectors in terms of overlooking objects. Additionally, we find a strong dependence of open-vocabulary models on object location, rather than on object semantics. This provides a systematic approach to challenge open-vocabulary models and gives valuable insights on how data could be acquired to effectively improve these models.

  Video identity customization seeks to synthesize realistic, temporally coherent videos of a specific subject, given a single reference image and a text prompt. This task presents two core challenges: (1) maintaining identity consistency while aligning with the described appearance and actions, and (2) generating natural, fluid motion without unrealistic stiffness. To address these challenges, we introduce Proteus-ID, a novel diffusion-based framework for identity-consistent and motion-coherent video customization. First, we propose a Multimodal Identity Fusion (MIF) module that unifies visual and textual cues into a joint identity representation using a Q-Former, providing coherent guidance to the diffusion model and eliminating modality imbalance. Second, we present a Time-Aware Identity Injection (TAII) mechanism that dynamically modulates identity conditioning across denoising steps, improving fine-detail reconstruction. Third, we propose Adaptive Motion Learning (AML), a self-supervised strategy that reweights the training loss based on optical-flow-derived motion heatmaps, enhancing motion realism without requiring additional inputs. To support this task, we construct Proteus-Bench, a high-quality dataset comprising 200K curated clips for training and 150 individuals from diverse professions and ethnicities for evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Proteus-ID outperforms prior methods in identity preservation, text alignment, and motion quality, establishing a new benchmark for video identity customization.

  Test-time adaptation enables a trained model to adjust to a new domain during inference, making it particularly valuable in clinical settings where such on-the-fly adaptation is required. However, existing techniques depend on large target domain datasets, which are often impractical and unavailable in medical scenarios that demand per-patient, real-time inference. Moreover, current methods commonly focus on two-dimensional images, failing to leverage the volumetric richness of medical imaging data. Bridging this gap, we propose a Patch-Based Multi-View Co-Training method for Single Image Test-Time adaptation. Our method enforces feature and prediction consistency through uncertainty-guided self-training, enabling effective volumetric segmentation in the target domain with only a single test-time image. Validated on three publicly available breast magnetic resonance imaging datasets for tumor segmentation, our method achieves performance close to the upper bound supervised benchmark while also outperforming all existing state-of-the-art methods, on average by a Dice Similarity Coefficient of 3.75%. We publicly share our accessible codebase, readily integrable with the popular nnUNet framework, atthis https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Diffusion-based video motion customization facilitates the acquisition of human motion representations from a few video samples, while achieving arbitrary subjects transfer through precise textual conditioning. Existing approaches often rely on semantic-level alignment, expecting the model to learn new motion concepts and combine them with other entities (e.g., ''cats'' or ''dogs'') to produce visually appealing results. However, video data involve complex spatio-temporal patterns, and focusing solely on semantics cause the model to overlook the visual complexity of motion. Conversely, tuning only the visual representation leads to semantic confusion in representing the intended action. To address these limitations, we propose SynMotion, a new motion-customized video generation model that jointly leverages semantic guidance and visual adaptation. At the semantic level, we introduce the dual-embedding semantic comprehension mechanism which disentangles subject and motion representations, allowing the model to learn customized motion features while preserving its generative capabilities for diverse subjects. At the visual level, we integrate parameter-efficient motion adapters into a pre-trained video generation model to enhance motion fidelity and temporal coherence. Furthermore, we introduce a new embedding-specific training strategy which \textbf{alternately optimizes} subject and motion embeddings, supported by the manually constructed Subject Prior Video (SPV) training dataset. This strategy promotes motion specificity while preserving generalization across diverse subjects. Lastly, we introduce MotionBench, a newly curated benchmark with diverse motion patterns. Experimental results across both T2V and I2V settings demonstrate that \method outperforms existing baselines. Project page:this https URL

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision Transformer have set new benchmarks in several tasks, but these models come with the lack of high computational costs which makes them impractical for resource limited hardware. Network pruning reduces the computational complexity by removing less important operations while maintaining performance. However, pruning a model on an unseen data domain, leads to a misevaluation of weight significance, resulting in suboptimal resource assignment. In this work, we find that task-sensitive layers initially fail to improve the feature representation on downstream tasks, leading to performance loss for early pruning decisions. To address this problem, we introduce Pruning by Block Benefit (P3B), a pruning method that utilizes the relative contribution on block level to globally assign parameter resources. P3B identifies low-impact components to reduce parameter allocation while preserving critical ones. Classical pruning mask optimization struggles to reactivate zero-mask-elements. In contrast, P3B sets a layerwise keep ratio based on global performance metrics, ensuring the reactivation of late-converging blocks. We show in extensive experiments that P3B is a state of the art pruning method with most noticeable gains in transfer learning tasks. Notably, P3B is able to conserve high performance, even in high sparsity regimes of 70% parameter reduction while only losing 0.64% in accuracy.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Audio-Visual Segmentation (AVS) aims to segment sound-producing objects in video frames based on the associated audio signal. Prevailing AVS methods typically adopt an audio-centric Transformer architecture, where object queries are derived from audio features. However, audio-centric Transformers suffer from two limitations: perception ambiguity caused by the mixed nature of audio, and weakened dense prediction ability due to visual detail loss. To address these limitations, we propose a new Vision-Centric Transformer (VCT) framework that leverages vision-derived queries to iteratively fetch corresponding audio and visual information, enabling queries to better distinguish between different sounding objects from mixed audio and accurately delineate their contours. Additionally, we also introduce a Prototype Prompted Query Generation (PPQG) module within our VCT framework to generate vision-derived queries that are both semantically aware and visually rich through audio prototype prompting and pixel context grouping, facilitating audio-visual information aggregation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our VCT framework achieves new state-of-the-art performances on three subsets of the AVSBench dataset. The code is available atthis https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is a powerful alternative to Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF), excelling in complex scene reconstruction and efficient rendering. However, it relies on high-quality point clouds from Structure-from-Motion (SfM), limiting its applicability. SfM also fails in texture-deficient or constrained-view scenarios, causing severe degradation in 3DGS reconstruction. To address this limitation, we propose AttentionGS, a novel framework that eliminates the dependency on high-quality initial point clouds by leveraging structural attention for direct 3D reconstruction from randomly initialization. In the early training stage, we introduce geometric attention to rapidly recover the global scene structure. As training progresses, we incorporate texture attention to refine fine-grained details and enhance rendering quality. Furthermore, we employ opacity-weighted gradients to guide Gaussian densification, leading to improved surface reconstruction. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that AttentionGS significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly in scenarios where point cloud initialization is unreliable. Our approach paves the way for more robust and flexible 3D Gaussian Splatting in real-world applications.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Existing open-vocabulary 3D semantic segmentation methods typically supervise 3D segmentation models by merging text-aligned features (e.g., CLIP) extracted from multi-view images onto 3D points. However, such approaches treat multi-view images merely as intermediaries for transferring open-vocabulary information, overlooking their rich semantic content and cross-view correspondences, which limits model effectiveness. To address this, we propose PGOV3D, a novel framework that introduces a Partial-to-Global curriculum for improving open-vocabulary 3D semantic segmentation. The key innovation lies in a two-stage training strategy. In the first stage, we pre-train the model on partial scenes that provide dense semantic information but relatively simple geometry. These partial point clouds are derived from multi-view RGB-D inputs via pixel-wise depth projection. To enable open-vocabulary learning, we leverage a multi-modal large language model (MLLM) and a 2D segmentation foundation model to generate open-vocabulary labels for each viewpoint, offering rich and aligned supervision. An auxiliary inter-frame consistency module is introduced to enforce feature consistency across varying viewpoints and enhance spatial understanding. In the second stage, we fine-tune the model on complete scene-level point clouds, which are sparser and structurally more complex. We aggregate the partial vocabularies associated with each scene and generate pseudo labels using the pre-trained model, effectively bridging the semantic gap between dense partial observations and large-scale 3D environments. Extensive experiments on ScanNet, ScanNet200, and S3DIS benchmarks demonstrate that PGOV3D achieves competitive performance in open-vocabulary 3D semantic segmentation.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Although Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated powerful capabilities in interpreting visual information, they frequently produce content that deviates from visual information, leading to object hallucination. To tackle this, recent works mostly depend on expensive manual annotations and training cost, or significantly increase inference time. In this work, we observe that LVLMs' attention to visual information is significantly stronger when answering caption queries compared to non-caption queries. Inspired by this phenomenon, we propose Caption-sensitive Attention Intervention (CAI), a training-free, plug-and-play hallucination mitigation method that leverages the attention activation pattern in response to caption queries to enhance LVLMs' visual perception capability.

  Small object detection (SOD) in anti-UAV task is a challenging problem due to the small size of UAVs and complex backgrounds. Traditional frame-based cameras struggle to detect small objects in complex environments due to their low frame rates, limited dynamic range, and data redundancy. Event cameras, with microsecond temporal resolution and high dynamic range, provide a more effective solution for SOD. However, existing event-based object detection datasets are limited in scale, feature large targets size, and lack diverse backgrounds, making them unsuitable for SOD benchmarks. In this paper, we introduce a Event-based Small object detection (EVSOD) dataset (namely EV-UAV), the first large-scale, highly diverse benchmark for anti-UAV tasks. It includes 147 sequences with over 2.3 million event-level annotations, featuring extremely small targets (averaging 6.8 $\times$ 5.4 pixels) and diverse scenarios such as urban clutter and extreme lighting conditions. Furthermore, based on the observation that small moving targets form continuous curves in spatiotemporal event point clouds, we propose Event based Sparse Segmentation Network (EV-SpSegNet), a novel baseline for event segmentation in point cloud space, along with a Spatiotemporal Correlation (STC) loss that leverages motion continuity to guide the network in retaining target events. Extensive experiments on the EV-UAV dataset demonstrate the superiority of our method and provide a benchmark for future research in EVSOD. The dataset and code are atthis https URL.

  Current multi-view 3D object detection methods typically transfer 2D features into 3D space using depth estimation or 3D position encoder, but in a fully data-driven and implicit manner, which limits the detection performance. Inspired by the success of radiance fields on 3D reconstruction, we assume they can be used to enhance the detector's ability of 3D geometry estimation. However, we observe a decline in detection performance, when we directly use them for 3D rendering as an auxiliary task. From our analysis, we find the performance drop is caused by the strong responses on the background when rendering the whole scene. To address this problem, we propose object-centric radiance fields, focusing on modeling foreground objects while discarding background noises. Specifically, we employ Object-centric Radiance Fields (OcRF) to enhance 3D voxel features via an auxiliary task of rendering foreground objects. We further use opacity - the side-product of rendering- to enhance the 2D foreground BEV features via Height-aware Opacity-based Attention (HOA), where attention maps at different height levels are generated separately via multiple networks in parallel. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes validation and test datasets demonstrate that our OcRFDet achieves superior performance, outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods with 57.2$\%$ mAP and 64.8$\%$ NDS on the nuScenes test benchmark. Code will be available atthis https URL.

  The eye-tracking video saliency prediction (VSP) task and video salient object detection (VSOD) task both focus on the most attractive objects in video and show the result in the form of predictive heatmaps and pixel-level saliency masks, respectively. In practical applications, eye tracker annotations are more readily obtainable and align closely with the authentic visual patterns of human eyes. Therefore, this paper aims to introduce fixation information to assist the detection of video salient objects under weak supervision. On the one hand, we ponder how to better explore and utilize the information provided by fixation, and then propose a Position and Semantic Embedding (PSE) module to provide location and semantic guidance during the feature learning process. On the other hand, we achieve spatiotemporal feature modeling under weak supervision from the aspects of feature selection and feature contrast. A Semantics and Locality Query (SLQ) Competitor with semantic and locality constraints is designed to effectively select the most matching and accurate object query for spatiotemporal modeling. In addition, an Intra-Inter Mixed Contrastive (IIMC) model improves the spatiotemporal modeling capabilities under weak supervision by forming an intra-video and inter-video contrastive learning paradigm. Experimental results on five popular VSOD benchmarks indicate that our model outperforms other competitors on various evaluation metrics.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Driven by large-scale contrastive vision-language pre-trained models such as CLIP, recent advancements in the image-text matching task have achieved remarkable success in representation learning. Due to image-level visual-language alignment, CLIP falls short in understanding fine-grained details such as object attributes and spatial relationships between objects. Recent efforts have attempted to compel CLIP to acquire structured visual representations by introducing prompt learning to achieve object-level alignment. While achieving promising results, they still lack the capability to perceive actions, which are crucial for describing the states or relationships between objects. Therefore, we propose to endow CLIP with fine-grained action-level understanding by introducing an LLM-enhanced action-aware multi-modal prompt-tuning method, incorporating the action-related external knowledge generated by large language models (LLMs). Specifically, we design an action triplet prompt and an action state prompt to exploit compositional semantic knowledge and state-related causal knowledge implicitly stored in LLMs. Subsequently, we propose an adaptive interaction module to aggregate attentive visual features conditioned on action-aware prompted knowledge for establishing discriminative and action-aware visual representations, which further improves the performance. Comprehensive experimental results on two benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

  Advancements in generative models have enabled image inpainting models to generate content within specific regions of an image based on provided prompts and masks. However, existing inpainting methods often suffer from problems such as semantic misalignment, structural distortion, and style inconsistency. In this work, we present MTADiffusion, a Mask-Text Alignment diffusion model designed for object inpainting. To enhance the semantic capabilities of the inpainting model, we introduce MTAPipeline, an automatic solution for annotating masks with detailed descriptions. Based on the MTAPipeline, we construct a new MTADataset comprising 5 million images and 25 million mask-text pairs. Furthermore, we propose a multi-task training strategy that integrates both inpainting and edge prediction tasks to improve structural stability. To promote style consistency, we present a novel inpainting style-consistency loss using a pre-trained VGG network and the Gram matrix. Comprehensive evaluations on BrushBench and EditBench demonstrate that MTADiffusion achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to other methods.

  Vision-and-Language Navigation in Continuous Environments (VLN-CE) requires agents to execute sequential navigation actions in complex environments guided by natural language instructions. Current approaches often struggle with generalizing to novel environments and adapting to ongoing changes during navigation.

NavMorph employs compact latent representations to model environmental dynamics, equipping agents with foresight for adaptive planning and policy refinement.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Despite the ability of text-to-image models to generate high-quality, realistic, and diverse images, they face challenges in compositional generation, often struggling to accurately represent details specified in the input prompt. A prevalent issue in compositional generation is the misalignment of spatial relationships, as models often fail to faithfully generate images that reflect the spatial configurations specified between objects in the input prompts. To address this challenge, we propose a novel probabilistic framework for modeling the relative spatial positioning of objects in a scene, leveraging the concept of Probability of Superiority (PoS). Building on this insight, we make two key contributions. First, we introduce a novel evaluation metric, PoS-based Evaluation (PSE), designed to assess the alignment of 2D and 3D spatial relationships between text and image, with improved adherence to human judgment. Second, we propose PoS-based Generation (PSG), an inference-time method that improves the alignment of 2D and 3D spatial relationships in T2I models without requiring fine-tuning. PSG employs a Part-of-Speech PoS-based reward function that can be utilized in two distinct ways: (1) as a gradient-based guidance mechanism applied to the cross-attention maps during the denoising steps, or (2) as a search-based strategy that evaluates a set of initial noise vectors to select the best one. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the PSE metric exhibits stronger alignment with human judgment compared to traditional center-based metrics, providing a more nuanced and reliable measure of complex spatial relationship accuracy in text-image alignment. Furthermore, PSG significantly enhances the ability of text-to-image models to generate images with specified spatial configurations, outperforming state-of-the-art methods across multiple evaluation metrics and benchmarks.

  Smartphone-based heart rate (HR) monitoring apps using finger-over-camera photoplethysmography (PPG) face significant challenges in performance evaluation and device compatibility due to device variability and fragmentation. Manual testing is impractical, and standardized methods are lacking. This paper presents a novel, high-throughput bench-testing platform to address this critical need. We designed a system comprising a test rig capable of holding 12 smartphones for parallel testing, a method for generating synthetic PPG test videos with controllable HR and signal quality, and a host machine for coordinating video playback and data logging. The system achieved a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 0.11% +/- 0.001% between input and measured HR, and a correlation coefficient of 0.92 +/- 0.008 between input and measured PPG signals using a clinically-validated smartphone-based HR app. Bench-testing results of 20 different smartphone models correctly classified all the devices as meeting the ANSI/CTA accuracy standards for HR monitors (MAPE <10%) when compared to a prospective clinical study with 80 participants, demonstrating high positive predictive value. This platform offers a scalable solution for pre-deployment testing of smartphone HR apps to improve app performance, ensure device compatibility, and advance the field of mobile health.

  The advancement of 3D language fields has enabled intuitive interactions with 3D scenes via natural language. However, existing approaches are typically limited to small-scale environments, lacking the scalability and compositional reasoning capabilities necessary for large, complex urban settings. To overcome these limitations, we propose GeoProg3D, a visual programming framework that enables natural language-driven interactions with city-scale high-fidelity 3D scenes. GeoProg3D consists of two key components: (i) a Geography-aware City-scale 3D Language Field (GCLF) that leverages a memory-efficient hierarchical 3D model to handle large-scale data, integrated with geographic information for efficiently filtering vast urban spaces using directional cues, distance measurements, elevation data, and landmark references; and (ii) Geographical Vision APIs (GV-APIs), specialized geographic vision tools such as area segmentation and object detection. Our framework employs large language models (LLMs) as reasoning engines to dynamically combine GV-APIs and operate GCLF, effectively supporting diverse geographic vision tasks. To assess performance in city-scale reasoning, we introduce GeoEval3D, a comprehensive benchmark dataset containing 952 query-answer pairs across five challenging tasks: grounding, spatial reasoning, comparison, counting, and measurement. Experiments demonstrate that GeoProg3D significantly outperforms existing 3D language fields and vision-language models across multiple tasks. To our knowledge, GeoProg3D is the first framework enabling compositional geographic reasoning in high-fidelity city-scale 3D environments via natural language.

  Vision-language models (VLMs) excel at descriptive tasks, but whether they truly understand scenes from visual observations remains uncertain. We introduce IR3D-Bench, a benchmark challenging VLMs to demonstrate understanding through active creation rather than passive recognition. Grounded in the analysis-by-synthesis paradigm, IR3D-Bench tasks Vision-Language Agents (VLAs) with actively using programming and rendering tools to recreate the underlying 3D structure of an input image, achieving agentic inverse rendering through tool use. This "understanding-by-creating" approach probes the tool-using generative capacity of VLAs, moving beyond the descriptive or conversational capacity measured by traditional scene understanding benchmarks. We provide a comprehensive suite of metrics to evaluate geometric accuracy, spatial relations, appearance attributes, and overall plausibility. Initial experiments on agentic inverse rendering powered by various state-of-the-art VLMs highlight current limitations, particularly in visual precision rather than basic tool usage. IR3D-Bench, including data and evaluation protocols, is released to facilitate systematic study and development of tool-using VLAs towards genuine scene understanding by creating.

  _Quang-Huy Che, Vinh-Tiep Nguyen_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) aims to segment objects from arbitrary text categories without requiring densely annotated datasets. Although contrastive learning based models enable zero-shot segmentation, they often lose fine spatial precision at pixel level, due to global representation bias. In contrast, diffusion-based models naturally encode fine-grained spatial features via attention mechanisms that capture both global context and local details. However, they often face challenges in balancing the number of iterations with the quality of the segmentation. In this work, we propose FastSeg, a novel and efficient training-free framework with only (1+1)-step of reverse process of a pretrained diffusion model (e.g., Stable Diffusion). Moreover, instead of running multiple times for different classes, FastSeg performs segmentation for all classes at once. To further enhance the segmentation quality, FastSeg introduces three key components: (i) a dual-prompt mechanism for discriminative, class-aware attention extraction, (ii) a Hierarchical Attention Refinement Method (HARD) that enhances fused cross-attention using scale-aligned selfattention maps, and (iii) a Test-Time Flipping (TTF) scheme designed to improve spatial consistency. Extensive experiments show that FastSeg achieves state-of-the-art training-free performance, obtaining 43.8% average mIoU across PASCAL VOC, PASCAL Context, and COCO Object benchmarks while maintaining superior inference efficiency. Our results demonstrate that FastSeg provides a strong foundation for extendability, bridging the gap between segmentation quality and inference efficiency.

  Virtual try-on (VTON) aims to synthesize realistic images of a person wearing a target garment, with broad applications in e-commerce and digital fashion. While recent advances in latent diffusion models have substantially improved visual quality, existing approaches still struggle with preserving fine-grained garment details, achieving precise garment-body alignment, maintaining inference efficiency, and generalizing to diverse poses and clothing styles. To address these challenges, we propose DiffFit, a novel two-stage latent diffusion framework for high-fidelity virtual try-on. DiffFit adopts a progressive generation strategy: the first stage performs geometry-aware garment warping, aligning the garment with the target body through fine-grained deformation and pose adaptation. The second stage refines texture fidelity via a cross-modal conditional diffusion model that integrates the warped garment, the original garment appearance, and the target person image for high-quality rendering. By decoupling geometric alignment and appearance refinement, DiffFit effectively reduces task complexity and enhances both generation stability and visual realism. It excels in preserving garment-specific attributes such as textures, wrinkles, and lighting, while ensuring accurate alignment with the human body. Extensive experiments on large-scale VTON benchmarks demonstrate that DiffFit achieves superior performance over existing state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative metrics and perceptual evaluations.

  Recent advances in AIGC have exacerbated the misuse of malicious deepfake content, making the development of reliable deepfake detection methods an essential means to address this challenge. Although existing deepfake detection models demonstrate outstanding performance in detection metrics, most methods only provide simple binary classification results, lacking interpretability. In critical domains such as law, interpretability is crucial for enhancing the credibility and authority of decisions. Recent studies attempt to improve the interpretability of classification results by providing spatial manipulation masks or temporal forgery segments. However, the practical effectiveness of these methods remains suboptimal due to limitations of the forgery data. Most current deepfake datasets predominantly offer binary labels, only a few datasets with localization annotations. However, they suffer from restricted forgery scenarios, limited diversity in deepfake types, and insufficient data scale, making them inadequate for complex real-world scenarios. To address this predicament, we construct a novel large-scale deepfake detection and localization ($\textbf{DDL}$) dataset containing over $\textbf{1.8M}$ forged samples and encompassing up to $\textbf{75}$ distinct deepfake methods. The DDL design incorporates four key innovations: (1) $\textbf{Diverse Forgery Scenarios}$, (2) $\textbf{Comprehensive Deepfake Methods}$, (3) $\textbf{Varied Manipulation Modes}$, and (4) $\textbf{Fine-grained Forgery Annotations}$. Through these improvements, our DDL not only provides a more challenging benchmark for complex real-world forgeries, but also offers crucial support for building next-generation deepfake detection, localization, and interpretability methods.

  Video understanding is a complex challenge that requires effective modeling of spatial-temporal dynamics. With the success of image foundation models (IFMs) in image understanding, recent approaches have explored parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) to adapt IFMs for video. However, most of these methods tend to process spatial and temporal information separately, which may fail to capture the full intricacy of video dynamics. In this paper, we propose MoMa, an efficient adapter framework that achieves full spatial-temporal modeling by integrating Mamba's selective state space modeling into IFMs. We propose a novel SeqMod operation to inject spatial-temporal information into pre-trained IFMs, without disrupting their original features. By incorporating SeqMod into a Divide-and-Modulate architecture, MoMa enhances video understanding while maintaining computational efficiency. Extensive experiments on multiple video benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of MoMa, achieving superior performance with reduced computational cost.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Video anomaly detection (VAD) is an important computer vision problem. Thanks to the mode coverage capabilities of generative models, the likelihood-based paradigm is catching growing interest, as it can model normal distribution and detect out-of-distribution anomalies. However, these likelihood-based methods are blind to the anomalies located in local modes near the learned distribution. To handle these ``unseen" anomalies, we dive into three gaps uniquely existing in VAD regarding scene, motion and appearance. Specifically, we first build a noise-conditioned score transformer for denoising score matching. Then, we introduce a scene-dependent and motion-aware score function by embedding the scene condition of input sequences into our model and assigning motion weights based on the difference between key frames of input sequences. Next, to solve the problem of blindness in principle, we integrate unaffected visual information via a novel autoregressive denoising score matching mechanism for inference. Through autoregressively injecting intensifying Gaussian noise into the denoised data and estimating the corresponding score function, we compare the denoised data with the original data to get a difference and aggregate it with the score function for an enhanced appearance perception and accumulate the abnormal context. With all three gaps considered, we can compute a more comprehensive anomaly indicator. Experiments on three popular VAD benchmarks demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our method.

  We present \textbf{Met}a-\textbf{T}oken \textbf{Le}arning (Mettle), a simple and memory-efficient method for adapting large-scale pretrained transformer models to downstream audio-visual tasks. Instead of sequentially modifying the output feature distribution of the transformer backbone, Mettle utilizes a lightweight \textit{Layer-Centric Distillation (LCD)} module to distill in parallel the intact audio or visual features embedded by each transformer layer into compact meta-tokens. This distillation process considers both pretrained knowledge preservation and task-specific adaptation. The obtained meta-tokens can be directly applied to classification tasks, such as audio-visual event localization and audio-visual video parsing. To further support fine-grained segmentation tasks, such as audio-visual segmentation, we introduce a \textit{Meta-Token Injection (MTI)} module, which utilizes the audio and visual meta-tokens distilled from the top transformer layer to guide feature adaptation in earlier layers. Extensive experiments on multiple audiovisual benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly reduces memory usage and training time while maintaining parameter efficiency and competitive accuracy.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Existing diffusion-based 3D shape completion methods typically use a conditional paradigm, injecting incomplete shape information into the denoising network via deep feature interactions (e.g., concatenation, cross-attention) to guide sampling toward complete shapes, often represented by voxel-based distance functions. However, these approaches fail to explicitly model the optimal global transport path, leading to suboptimal completions. Moreover, performing diffusion directly in voxel space imposes resolution constraints, limiting the generation of fine-grained geometric details. To address these challenges, we propose BridgeShape, a novel framework for 3D shape completion via latent diffusion Schr칬dinger bridge. The key innovations lie in two aspects: (i) BridgeShape formulates shape completion as an optimal transport problem, explicitly modeling the transition between incomplete and complete shapes to ensure a globally coherent transformation. (ii) We introduce a Depth-Enhanced Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE) to encode 3D shapes into a compact latent space, leveraging self-projected multi-view depth information enriched with strong DINOv2 features to enhance geometric structural perception. By operating in a compact yet structurally informative latent space, BridgeShape effectively mitigates resolution constraints and enables more efficient and high-fidelity 3D shape completion. BridgeShape achieves state-of-the-art performance on large-scale 3D shape completion benchmarks, demonstrating superior fidelity at higher resolutions and for unseen object classes.

  As face forgeries generated by deep neural networks become increasingly sophisticated, detecting face manipulations in digital media has posed a significant challenge, underscoring the importance of maintaining digital media integrity and combating visual disinformation. Current detection models, predominantly based on supervised training with domain-specific data, often falter against forgeries generated by unencountered techniques. In response to this challenge, we introduce \textit{Trident}, a face forgery detection framework that employs triplet learning with a Siamese network architecture for enhanced adaptability across diverse forgery methods. \textit{Trident} is trained on curated triplets to isolate nuanced differences of forgeries, capturing fine-grained features that distinguish pristine samples from manipulated ones while controlling for other variables. To further enhance generalizability, we incorporate domain-adversarial training with a forgery discriminator. This adversarial component guides our embedding model towards forgery-agnostic representations, improving its robustness to unseen manipulations. In addition, we prevent gradient flow from the classifier head to the embedding model, avoiding overfitting induced by artifacts peculiar to certain forgeries. Comprehensive evaluations across multiple benchmarks and ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework. We will release our code in a GitHub repository.

  Since there exists a notable gap between user-provided and model-preferred prompts, generating high-quality and satisfactory images using diffusion models often requires prompt engineering to optimize user inputs. Current studies on text-to-image prompt engineering can effectively enhance the style and aesthetics of generated images. However, they often neglect the semantic alignment between generated images and user descriptions, resulting in visually appealing but content-wise unsatisfying outputs. In this work, we propose VisualPrompter, a novel training-free prompt engineering framework that refines user inputs to model-preferred sentences. In particular, VisualPrompter utilizes an automatic self-reflection module to identify the missing concepts in generated images and a target-specific prompt optimization mechanism to revise the prompts in a fine-grained manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our VisualPrompter, which achieves new state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks for text-image alignment evaluation. Additionally, our framework features a plug-and-play design, making it highly adaptable to various generative models.

  Recent advances in point cloud perception have demonstrated remarkable progress in scene understanding through vision-language alignment leveraging large language models (LLMs). However, existing methods may still encounter challenges in handling complex instructions that require accurate spatial reasoning, even if the 3D point cloud data provides detailed spatial cues such as size and position for identifying the targets. To tackle this issue, we propose Relevant Reasoning Segmentation (R$^2$S), a reasoning-based segmentation framework. The framework emulates human cognitive processes by decomposing spatial reasoning into two sequential stages: first identifying relevant elements, then processing instructions guided by their associated visual priors. Furthermore, acknowledging the inadequacy of existing datasets in complex reasoning tasks, we introduce 3D ReasonSeg, a reasoning-based segmentation dataset comprising 25,185 training samples and 3,966 validation samples with precise annotations. Both quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that the R$^2$S and 3D ReasonSeg effectively endow 3D point cloud perception with stronger spatial reasoning capabilities, and we hope that they can serve as a new baseline and benchmark for future work.

  Interactive segmentation (IS) allows users to iteratively refine object boundaries with minimal cues, such as positive and negative clicks. While the Segment Anything Model (SAM) has garnered attention in the IS community for its promptable segmentation capabilities, it often struggles in specialized domains or when handling complex scenarios (e.g., camouflaged or multi-part objects). To overcome these challenges, we propose DC-TTA, a novel test-time adaptation (TTA) framework that adapts SAM on a per-sample basis by leveraging user interactions as supervision. Instead of forcing a single model to incorporate all user clicks at once, DC-TTA partitions the clicks into more coherent subsets, each processed independently via TTA with a separated model. This Divide-and-Conquer strategy reduces conflicts among diverse cues and enables more localized updates. Finally, we merge the adapted models to form a unified predictor that integrates the specialized knowledge from each subset. Experimental results across various benchmarks demonstrate that DC-TTA significantly outperforms SAM's zero-shot results and conventional TTA methods, effectively handling complex tasks such as camouflaged object segmentation with fewer interactions and improved accuracy.

  Modeling task-driven attention in driving is a fundamental challenge for both autonomous vehicles and cognitive science. Existing methods primarily predict where drivers look by generating spatial heatmaps, but fail to capture the cognitive motivations behind attention allocation in specific contexts, which limits deeper understanding of attention mechanisms. To bridge this gap, we introduce Explainable Driver Attention Prediction, a novel task paradigm that jointly predicts spatial attention regions (where), parses attended semantics (what), and provides cognitive reasoning for attention allocation (why). To support this, we present W3DA, the first large-scale explainable driver attention dataset. It enriches existing benchmarks with detailed semantic and causal annotations across diverse driving scenarios, including normal conditions, safety-critical situations, and traffic accidents. We further propose LLada, a Large Language model-driven framework for driver attention prediction, which unifies pixel modeling, semantic parsing, and cognitive reasoning within an end-to-end architecture. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of LLada, exhibiting robust generalization across datasets and driving conditions. This work serves as a key step toward a deeper understanding of driver attention mechanisms, with significant implications for autonomous driving, intelligent driver training, and human-computer interaction.

  Existing deep learning-based cross-view geo-localization methods primarily focus on improving the accuracy of cross-domain image matching, rather than enabling models to comprehensively capture contextual information around the target and minimize the cost of localization errors. To support systematic research into this Distance-Aware Cross-View Geo-Localization (DACVGL) problem, we construct Distance-Aware Campus (DA-Campus), the first benchmark that pairs multi-view imagery with precise distance annotations across three spatial resolutions. Based on DA-Campus, we formulate DACVGL as a hierarchical retrieval problem across different domains. Our study further reveals that, due to the inherent complexity of spatial relationships among buildings, this problem can only be addressed via a contrastive learning paradigm, rather than conventional metric learning. To tackle this challenge, we propose Dynamic Contrastive Learning (DyCL), a novel framework that progressively aligns feature representations according to hierarchical spatial margins. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DyCL is highly complementary to existing multi-scale metric learning methods and yields substantial improvements in both hierarchical retrieval performance and overall cross-view geo-localization accuracy. Our code and benchmark are publicly available atthis https URL.

  Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable visual reasoning abilities in natural images, text-rich documents, and graphic designs. However, their ability to interpret music sheets remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce MusiXQA, the first comprehensive dataset for evaluating and advancing MLLMs in music sheet understanding. MusiXQA features high-quality synthetic music sheets generated via MusiXTeX, with structured annotations covering note pitch and duration, chords, clefs, key/time signatures, and text, enabling diverse visual QA tasks. Through extensive evaluations, we reveal significant limitations of current state-of-the-art MLLMs in this domain. Beyond benchmarking, we developed Phi-3-MusiX, an MLLM fine-tuned on our dataset, achieving significant performance gains over GPT-based methods. The proposed dataset and model establish a foundation for future advances in MLLMs for music sheet understanding. Code, data, and model will be released upon acceptance.

  Medical image segmentation poses significant challenges due to class imbalance and the complex structure of medical images. To address these challenges, this study proposes YM-WML, a novel model for cardiac image segmentation. The model integrates a robust backbone for effective feature extraction, a YOLOv11 neck for multi-scale feature aggregation, and an attention-based segmentation head for precise and accurate segmentation. To address class imbalance, we introduce the Weighted Multi-class Exponential (WME) loss function. On the ACDC dataset, YM-WML achieves a Dice Similarity Coefficient of 91.02, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. The model demonstrates stable training, accurate segmentation, and strong generalization, setting a new benchmark in cardiac segmentation tasks.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The increasing realism of multimodal content has made misinformation more subtle and harder to detect, especially in news media where images are frequently paired with bilingual (e.g., Chinese-English) subtitles. Such content often includes localized image edits and cross-lingual inconsistencies that jointly distort meaning while remaining superficially plausible. We introduce BiMi, a bilingual multimodal framework that jointly performs region-level localization, cross-modal and cross-lingual consistency detection, and natural language explanation for misinformation analysis. To support generalization, BiMi integrates an online retrieval module that supplements model reasoning with up-to-date external context. We further release BiMiBench, a large-scale and comprehensive benchmark constructed by systematically editing real news images and subtitles, comprising 104,000 samples with realistic manipulations across visual and linguistic modalities. To enhance interpretability, we apply Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to improve explanation quality, marking the first use of GRPO in this domain. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BiMi outperforms strong baselines by up to +8.9 in classification accuracy, +15.9 in localization accuracy, and +2.5 in explanation BERTScore, advancing state-of-the-art performance in realistic, multilingual misinformation detection. Code, models, and datasets will be released.

  _Yuzhu Wang, Manni Duan, Shu Kong_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT) is a parameter-efficient fune-tuning technique that adapts a pre-trained vision Transformer (ViT) by learning a small set of parameters in the input space, known as prompts. In VPT, we uncover ``burstiness'' in the values arising from the interaction of image patch embeddings, and the key and query projectors within Transformer's self-attention module. Furthermore, the values of patch embeddings and the key and query projectors exhibit Laplacian and hyper-Laplacian distribution, respectively. Intuitively, these non-Gaussian distributions pose challenges for learning prompts. To address this, we propose whitening these data, de-correlating them and equalizing their variance towards more Gaussian before learning prompts. We derive the whitening matrix over random image patch embeddings and ViT's key and query projectors, and multiply it with the prompt to be learned in a bilinear manner. Surprisingly, this method significantly accelerates prompt tuning and boosts accuracy, e.g., $>$25 accuracy points on the CUB dataset; interestingly, it learns ``bursty prompts''. Extending the bilinear model which is known to introduce burstiness, we present a compact, low-rank version by learning two smaller matrices whose multiplication yields the final prompts. We call the proposed methods Bilinear Prompt Tuning (BPT). Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that BPT methods not only outperform various VPT methods but also reduce parameter count and computation overhead.

  _Xingyilang Yin, Jiale Wang, Xi Yang, Mutian Xu, Xu Gu, Nannan Wang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent open-vocabulary 3D scene understanding approaches mainly focus on training 3D networks through contrastive learning with point-text pairs or by distilling 2D features into 3D models via point-pixel alignment. While these methods show considerable performance in benchmarks with limited vocabularies, they struggle to handle diverse object categories as the limited amount of 3D data upbound training strong open-vocabulary 3d models. We observe that 2D multi-view fusion methods take precedence in understanding diverse concepts in 3D scenes. However, inherent noises in vision-language models lead multi-view fusion to sub-optimal performance. To this end, we introduce MVOV3D, a novel approach aimed at unleashing the potential of 2D multi-view fusion for open-vocabulary 3D scene understanding. We focus on reducing the inherent noises without training, thereby preserving the generalizability while enhancing open-world capabilities. Specifically, MVOV3D improves multi-view 2D features by leveraging precise region-level image features and text features encoded by CLIP encoders and incorporates 3D geometric priors to optimize multi-view fusion. Extensive experiments on various datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Notably, our MVOV3D achieves a new record with 14.7% mIoU on ScanNet200 and 16.2% mIoU on Matterport160 for challenge open-vocabulary semantic segmentation, outperforming current leading trained 3D networks by a significant margin.

  Automatic image cropping aims to extract the most visually salient regions while preserving essential composition elements. Traditional saliency-aware cropping methods optimize a single bounding box, making them ineffective for applications requiring multiple disjoint crops. In this work, we extend the Fixed Aspect Ratio Cropping algorithm to efficiently extract multiple non-overlapping crops in linear time. Our approach dynamically adjusts attention thresholds and removes selected crops from consideration without recomputing the entire saliency map. We discuss qualitative results and introduce the potential for future datasets and benchmarks.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Video super-resolution remains a major challenge in low-level vision tasks. To date, CNN- and Transformer-based methods have delivered impressive results. However, CNNs are limited by local receptive fields, while Transformers struggle with quadratic complexity, posing challenges for processing long sequences in VSR. Recently, Mamba has drawn attention for its long-sequence modeling, linear complexity, and large receptive fields. In this work, we propose VSRM, a novel \textbf{V}ideo \textbf{S}uper-\textbf{R}esolution framework that leverages the power of \textbf{M}amba. VSRM introduces Spatial-to-Temporal Mamba and Temporal-to-Spatial Mamba blocks to extract long-range spatio-temporal features and enhance receptive fields efficiently. To better align adjacent frames, we propose Deformable Cross-Mamba Alignment module. This module utilizes a deformable cross-mamba mechanism to make the compensation stage more dynamic and flexible, preventing feature distortions. Finally, we minimize the frequency domain gaps between reconstructed and ground-truth frames by proposing a simple yet effective Frequency Charbonnier-like loss that better preserves high-frequency content and enhances visual quality. Through extensive experiments, VSRM achieves state-of-the-art results on diverse benchmarks, establishing itself as a solid foundation for future research.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision Language Models (VLMs) show impressive capabilities in integrating and reasoning with both visual and language data. But these models make mistakes. A common finding -- similar to LLMs -- is their tendency to hallucinate, i.e., generate plausible sounding text which is not grounded in the visual input, or at worst, is contradictory. A growing consensus attributes this behavior to an over-reliance on language -- especially as the generation progresses, the model suffers from a ``fading memory effect'' with respect to the provided visual input. We study mechanisms by which this behavior can be controlled. Specifically, using ideas from geometric algebra and relational compositions, we propose the addition of a small, trainable module (named ReCo) on top of any VLM -- no other modification is needed. We show that such a lightweight module is able to mitigate the fading memory effect on three of the most widely used VLMs (InstructBLIP, LlaVA, MiniGPT4), where we see performance improvements on multiple benchmarks. Additionally, we show that our module can be combined with many of the other approaches for reducing hallucination where we achieve improved results for each one.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Agricultural image semantic segmentation is a pivotal component of modern agriculture, facilitating accurate visual data analysis to improve crop management, optimize resource utilization, and boost overall productivity. This study proposes an efficient image segmentation method for precision agriculture, focusing on accurately delineating farmland anomalies to support informed decision-making and proactive interventions. A novel Dual Atrous Separable Convolution (DAS Conv) module is integrated within the DeepLabV3-based segmentation framework. The DAS Conv module is meticulously designed to achieve an optimal balance between dilation rates and padding size, thereby enhancing model performance without compromising efficiency. The study also incorporates a strategic skip connection from an optimal stage in the encoder to the decoder to bolster the model's capacity to capture fine-grained spatial features. Despite its lower computational complexity, the proposed model outperforms its baseline and achieves performance comparable to highly complex transformer-based state-of-the-art (SOTA) models on the Agriculture Vision benchmark dataset. It achieves more than 66% improvement in efficiency when considering the trade-off between model complexity and performance, compared to the SOTA model. This study highlights an efficient and effective solution for improving semantic segmentation in remote sensing applications, offering a computationally lightweight model capable of high-quality performance in agricultural imagery.

  _Prasen Kumar Sharma, Neeraj Matiyali, Siddharth Srivastava, Gaurav Sharma_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce \textit{Preserve Anything}, a novel method for controlled image synthesis that addresses key limitations in object preservation and semantic consistency in text-to-image (T2I) generation. Existing approaches often fail (i) to preserve multiple objects with fidelity, (ii) maintain semantic alignment with prompts, or (iii) provide explicit control over scene composition. To overcome these challenges, the proposed method employs an N-channel ControlNet that integrates (i) object preservation with size and placement agnosticism, color and detail retention, and artifact elimination, (ii) high-resolution, semantically consistent backgrounds with accurate shadows, lighting, and prompt adherence, and (iii) explicit user control over background layouts and lighting conditions. Key components of our framework include object preservation and background guidance modules, enforcing lighting consistency and a high-frequency overlay module to retain fine details while mitigating unwanted artifacts. We introduce a benchmark dataset consisting of 240K natural images filtered for aesthetic quality and 18K 3D-rendered synthetic images with metadata such as lighting, camera angles, and object relationships. This dataset addresses the deficiencies of existing benchmarks and allows a complete evaluation. Empirical results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly improving feature-space fidelity (FID 15.26) and semantic alignment (CLIP-S 32.85) while maintaining competitive aesthetic quality. We also conducted a user study to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed work on unseen benchmark and observed a remarkable improvement of $\sim25\%$, $\sim19\%$, $\sim13\%$, and $\sim14\%$ in terms of prompt alignment, photorealism, the presence of AI artifacts, and natural aesthetics over existing works.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reconstructing 3D objects from a single image remains challenging, especially under real-world occlusions. While recent diffusion-based view synthesis models can generate consistent novel views from a single RGB image, they typically assume fully visible inputs and fail when parts of the object are occluded, resulting in degraded 3D reconstruction quality. We propose DeOcc-1-to-3, an end-to-end framework for occlusion-aware multi-view generation that synthesizes six structurally consistent novel views directly from a single occluded image, enabling reliable 3D reconstruction without prior inpainting or manual annotations. Our self-supervised training pipeline leverages occluded-unoccluded image pairs and pseudo-ground-truth views to teach the model structure-aware completion and view consistency. Without modifying the original architecture, we fully fine-tune the view synthesis model to jointly learn completion and multi-view generation. Additionally, we introduce the first benchmark for occlusion-aware reconstruction, covering diverse occlusion levels, object categories, and masking patterns, providing a standardized protocol for future evaluation.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper presents an end-to-end framework for reconstructing 3D parametric curves directly from multi-view edge maps. Contrasting with existing two-stage methods that follow a sequential ``edge point cloud reconstruction and parametric curve fitting'' pipeline, our one-stage approach optimizes 3D parametric curves directly from 2D edge maps, eliminating error accumulation caused by the inherent optimization gap between disconnected stages. However, parametric curves inherently lack suitability for rendering-based multi-view optimization, necessitating a complementary representation that preserves their geometric properties while enabling differentiable rendering. We propose a novel bi-directional coupling mechanism between parametric curves and edge-oriented Gaussian components. This tight correspondence formulates a curve-aware Gaussian representation, \textbf{CurveGaussian}, that enables differentiable rendering of 3D curves, allowing direct optimization guided by multi-view evidence. Furthermore, we introduce a dynamically adaptive topology optimization framework during training to refine curve structures through linearization, merging, splitting, and pruning operations. Comprehensive evaluations on the ABC dataset and real-world benchmarks demonstrate our one-stage method's superiority over two-stage alternatives, particularly in producing cleaner and more robust reconstructions. Additionally, by directly optimizing parametric curves, our method significantly reduces the parameter count during training, achieving both higher efficiency and superior performance compared to existing approaches.

  Detectors often suffer from performance drop due to domain gap between training and testing data. Recent methods explore diffusion models applied to domain generalization (DG) and adaptation (DA) tasks, but still struggle with large inference costs and have not yet fully leveraged the capabilities of diffusion models. We propose to tackle these problems by extracting intermediate features from a single-step diffusion process, improving feature collection and fusion to reduce inference time by 75% while enhancing performance on source domains (i.e., Fitness). Then, we construct an object-centered auxiliary branch by applying box-masked images with class prompts to extract robust and domain-invariant features that focus on object. We also apply consistency loss to align the auxiliary and ordinary branch, balancing fitness and generalization while preventing overfitting and improving performance on target domains (i.e., Generalization). Furthermore, within a unified framework, standard detectors are guided by diffusion detectors through feature-level and object-level alignment on source domains (for DG) and unlabeled target domains (for DA), thereby improving cross-domain detection performance (i.e., Transferability). Our method achieves competitive results on 3 DA benchmarks and 5 DG benchmarks. Additionally, experiments on COCO generalization benchmark demonstrate that our method maintains significant advantages and show remarkable efficiency in large domain shifts and low-data scenarios. Our work shows the superiority of applying diffusion models to domain generalized and adaptive detection tasks and offers valuable insights for visual perception tasks across diverse domains.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent video depth estimation methods achieve great performance by following the paradigm of image depth estimation, i.e., typically fine-tuning pre-trained video diffusion models with massive data. However, we argue that video depth estimation is not a naive extension of image depth estimation. The temporal consistency requirements for dynamic and static regions in videos are fundamentally different. Consistent video depth in static regions, typically backgrounds, can be more effectively achieved via stereo matching across all frames, which provides much stronger global 3D cues. While the consistency for dynamic regions still should be learned from large-scale video depth data to ensure smooth transitions, due to the violation of triangulation constraints. Based on these insights, we introduce StereoDiff, a two-stage video depth estimator that synergizes stereo matching for mainly the static areas with video depth diffusion for maintaining consistent depth transitions in dynamic areas. We mathematically demonstrate how stereo matching and video depth diffusion offer complementary strengths through frequency domain analysis, highlighting the effectiveness of their synergy in capturing the advantages of both. Experimental results on zero-shot, real-world, dynamic video depth benchmarks, both indoor and outdoor, demonstrate StereoDiff's SoTA performance, showcasing its superior consistency and accuracy in video depth estimation.

  Robust visual recognition in underwater environments remains a significant challenge due to complex distortions such as turbidity, low illumination, and occlusion, which severely degrade the performance of standard vision systems. This paper introduces AQUA20, a comprehensive benchmark dataset comprising 8,171 underwater images across 20 marine species reflecting real-world environmental challenges such as illumination, turbidity, occlusions, etc., providing a valuable resource for underwater visual understanding. Thirteen state-of-the-art deep learning models, including lightweight CNNs (SqueezeNet, MobileNetV2) and transformer-based architectures (ViT, ConvNeXt), were evaluated to benchmark their performance in classifying marine species under challenging conditions. Our experimental results show ConvNeXt achieving the best performance, with a Top-3 accuracy of 98.82% and a Top-1 accuracy of 90.69%, as well as the highest overall F1-score of 88.92% with moderately large parameter size. The results obtained from our other benchmark models also demonstrate trade-offs between complexity and performance. We also provide an extensive explainability analysis using GRAD-CAM and LIME for interpreting the strengths and pitfalls of the models. Our results reveal substantial room for improvement in underwater species recognition and demonstrate the value of AQUA20 as a foundation for future research in this domain.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Current multimodal large language models (MLLMs) struggle with hour-level video understanding, facing significant challenges not only in modeling the substantial information volume of long videos but also in overcoming the memory wall and resource constraints during both training and inference. Although recent training-free approaches have alleviated resource demands by compressing visual features, their reliance on incomplete visual information limits the performance potential. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{P}ivot \textbf{V}isual information \textbf{R}etrieval (\textbf{APVR}), a training-free framework that hierarchically retrieves and retains sufficient and important visual information. It breakthroughs the memory wall limitation via two complementary components: Pivot Frame Retrieval employs query expansion and iterative spatio-semantic confidence scoring to identify relevant video frames, and Pivot Token Retrieval performs query-aware attention-driven token selection within up to 1024 pivot frames. This dual granularity approach enables the processing of hour-long videos while maintaining semantic fidelity. Experimental validations demonstrate significant performance improvements, achieving 64.9\% on LongVideoBench and 68.4\% on VideoMME, which are state-of-the-art results for both training-free and training-based approaches. Meanwhile, our method provides plug-and-play integration capability with existing MLLM architectures.

  Image-to-video (I2V) generation seeks to produce realistic motion sequences from a single reference image. Although recent methods exhibit strong temporal consistency, they often struggle when dealing with complex, non-repetitive human movements, leading to unnatural deformations. To tackle this issue, we present LatentMove, a DiT-based framework specifically tailored for highly dynamic human animation. Our architecture incorporates a conditional control branch and learnable face/body tokens to preserve consistency as well as fine-grained details across frames. We introduce Complex-Human-Videos (CHV), a dataset featuring diverse, challenging human motions designed to benchmark the robustness of I2V systems. We also introduce two metrics to assess the flow and silhouette consistency of generated videos with their ground truth. Experimental results indicate that LatentMove substantially improves human animation quality--particularly when handling rapid, intricate movements--thereby pushing the boundaries of I2V generation. The code, the CHV dataset, and the evaluation metrics will be available atthis https URL--.

  Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive general capabilities across a wide range of multi-modal tasks. However, the reasoning processes of LVLMs often suffer from unreliable outputs and limited interpretability. To address this, grounded visual reasoning has emerged as a promising paradigm that enforces responses anchored on salient visual evidence regions. However, existing approaches typically rely on costly supervision such as bounding box annotations, chain-of-thought rationale or external tool calls, limiting their scalability. In this work, we propose Ground-R1, a reinforcement learning framework that enables grounded visual reasoning without requiring explicit evidence or rationale annotations. Ground-R1 consists of a grounding phase that generates evidence region rollouts based on format constraints, and an answering phase that produces responses guided by both answer correctness and format adherence rewards. Extensive experiments across multiple visual reasoning benchmarks manifest that Ground-R1 achieves superior performance and exhibits emergent cognitive behaviors such as uncertainty awareness, spatial perception, and iterative refinement, offering a scalable and interpretable alternative to existing approaches.

  Despite progress in video large language models (Video-LLMs), research on instructional video understanding, crucial for enhancing access to instructional content, remains insufficient. To address this, we introduce InstructionBench, an Instructional video understanding Benchmark, which challenges models' advanced temporal reasoning within instructional videos characterized by their strict step-by-step flow. Employing GPT-4, we formulate Q&A pairs in open-ended and multiple-choice formats to assess both Coarse-Grained event-level and Fine-Grained object-level reasoning. Our filtering strategies exclude questions answerable purely by common-sense knowledge, focusing on visual perception and analysis when evaluating Video-LLM models. The benchmark finally contains 5k questions across over 700 videos. We evaluate the latest Video-LLMs on our InstructionBench, finding that closed-source models outperform open-source ones. However, even the best model, GPT-4o, achieves only 53.42% accuracy, indicating significant gaps in temporal reasoning. To advance the field, we also develop a comprehensive instructional video dataset with over 19k Q&A pairs from nearly 2.5k videos, using an automated data generation framework, thereby enriching the community's research resources.

  Despite the similar structures of human faces, existing face alignment methods cannot learn unified knowledge from multiple datasets with different landmark annotations. The limited training samples in a single dataset commonly result in fragile robustness in this field. To mitigate knowledge discrepancies among different datasets and train a task-agnostic unified face alignment (TUFA) framework, this paper presents a strategy to unify knowledge from multiple datasets. Specifically, we calculate a mean face shape for each dataset. To explicitly align these mean shapes on an interpretable plane based on their semantics, each shape is then incorporated with a group of semantic alignment embeddings. The 2D coordinates of these aligned shapes can be viewed as the anchors of the plane. By encoding them into structure prompts and further regressing the corresponding facial landmarks using image features, a mapping from the plane to the target faces is finally established, which unifies the learning target of different datasets. Consequently, multiple datasets can be utilized to boost the generalization ability of the model. The successful mitigation of discrepancies also enhances the efficiency of knowledge transferring to a novel dataset, significantly boosts the performance of few-shot face alignment. Additionally, the interpretable plane endows TUFA with a task-agnostic characteristic, enabling it to locate landmarks unseen during training in a zero-shot manner. Extensive experiments are carried on seven benchmarks and the results demonstrate an impressive improvement in face alignment brought by knowledge discrepancies mitigation.

  Recent advancements in text-to-image generative models, particularly latent diffusion models (LDMs), have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in synthesizing high-quality images from textual prompts. However, achieving identity personalization-ensuring that a model consistently generates subject-specific outputs from limited reference images-remains a fundamental challenge. To address this, we introduce Meta-Low-Rank Adaptation (Meta-LoRA), a novel framework that leverages meta-learning to encode domain-specific priors into LoRA-based identity personalization. Our method introduces a structured three-layer LoRA architecture that separates identity-agnostic knowledge from identity-specific adaptation. In the first stage, the LoRA Meta-Down layers are meta-trained across multiple subjects, learning a shared manifold that captures general identity-related features. In the second stage, only the LoRA-Mid and LoRA-Up layers are optimized to specialize on a given subject, significantly reducing adaptation time while improving identity fidelity. To evaluate our approach, we introduce Meta-PHD, a new benchmark dataset for identity personalization, and compare Meta-LoRA against state-of-the-art methods. Our results demonstrate that Meta-LoRA achieves superior identity retention, computational efficiency, and adaptability across diverse identity conditions. Our code, model weights, and dataset are released onthis http URL.

  Class-Continual Learning (CCL) enables models to continuously learn new class knowledge while retaining previous classes, facilitating adaptation and evolution in dynamic, real-world environments. Traditional CCL methods primarily rely on visual features, which limits their effectiveness in complex, multimodal scenarios. In contrast, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) show promising potential for enhancing CCL by leveraging pre-trained knowledge and fusing multi-modal semantic cues such as text and vision. However, existing approaches struggle to mitigate catastrophic forgetting while preserving the generalization strengths of VLMs across diverse modalities. To address these challenges, we propose CalFuse, a framework for feature Calibration enhanced parameter Fusion, which enhances dynamic knowledge fusion. CalFuse introduces a dynamic feature calibration mechanism that iteratively adjusts the contribution of original visual features to the final class decision, thereby preserving the model's intrinsic generalization capability across modalities. Simultaneously, a parameter fusion strategy effectively fuses newly acquired knowledge with prior task parameters, maintaining a balance between acquiring new class representations and preserving old knowledge. Experimental results on popular benchmarks (e.g., CIFAR100 and ImageNet100) validate the superiority of the proposed method.

  Repetitive action counting, which aims to count periodic movements in a video, is valuable for video analysis applications such as fitness monitoring. However, existing methods largely rely on regression networks with limited representational capacity, which hampers their ability to accurately capture variable periodic patterns. Additionally, their supervised learning on narrow, limited training sets leads to overfitting and restricts their ability to generalize across diverse scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose CountLLM, the first large language model (LLM)-based framework that takes video data and periodic text prompts as inputs and outputs the desired counting value. CountLLM leverages the rich clues from explicit textual instructions and the powerful representational capabilities of pre-trained LLMs for repetitive action counting. To effectively guide CountLLM, we develop a periodicity-based structured template for instructions that describes the properties of periodicity and implements a standardized answer format to ensure consistency. Additionally, we propose a progressive multimodal training paradigm to enhance the periodicity-awareness of the LLM. Empirical evaluations on widely recognized benchmarks demonstrate CountLLM's superior performance and generalization, particularly in handling novel and out-of-domain actions that deviate significantly from the training data, offering a promising avenue for repetitive action counting.

  Low-light enhancement has wide applications in autonomous driving, 3D reconstruction, remote sensing, surveillance, and so on, which can significantly improve information utilization. However, most existing methods lack generalization and are limited to specific tasks such as image recovery. To address these issues, we propose Gated-Mechanism Mixture-of-Experts (GM-MoE), the first framework to introduce a mixture-of-experts network for low-light image enhancement. GM-MoE comprises a dynamic gated weight conditioning network and three sub-expert networks, each specializing in a distinct enhancement task. Combining a self-designed gated mechanism that dynamically adjusts the weights of the sub-expert networks for different data domains. Additionally, we integrate local and global feature fusion within sub-expert networks to enhance image quality by capturing multi-scale features. Experimental results demonstrate that the GM-MoE achieves superior generalization with respect to 25 compared approaches, reaching state-of-the-art performance on PSNR on 5 benchmarks and SSIM on 4 benchmarks, respectively.

  Novel View Synthesis (NVS) techniques, notably Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), can augment camera pose estimation by extending and diversifying training data. However, images generated by these methods are often plagued by spatial artifacts such as blurring and ghosting, undermining their reliability as training data for camera pose estimation. This limitation is particularly critical for Scene Coordinate Regression (SCR) methods, which aim at pixel-level 3D coordinate estimation, because rendering artifacts directly lead to estimation inaccuracies. To address this challenge, we propose a dual-criteria filtering mechanism that dynamically identifies and discards suboptimal pixels during training. The dual-criteria filter evaluates two concurrent metrics: (1) real-time SCR reprojection error, and (2) gradient threshold, across the coordinate regression domain. In addition, for visual localization problems in sparse-input scenarios, it becomes even more necessary to use NVS-generated data to assist localization. We design a coarse-to-fine Points of Interest (PoI) variant using sparse-input NVS to solve this problem. Experiments across indoor and outdoor benchmarks confirm our method's efficacy, achieving state-of-the-art localization accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency.

  The incorporation of high-resolution visual input equips multimodal large language models (MLLMs) with enhanced visual perception capabilities for real-world tasks. However, most existing high-resolution MLLMs rely on a cropping-based approach to process images, which leads to fragmented visual encoding and a sharp increase in redundant tokens. To tackle these issues, we propose the FALCON model. FALCON introduces a novel visual register technique to simultaneously: 1) Eliminate redundant tokens at the stage of visual encoding. To directly address the visual redundancy present in the output of vision encoder, we propose a Register-based Representation Compacting (ReCompact) mechanism. This mechanism introduces a set of learnable visual registers designed to adaptively aggregate essential information while discarding redundancy. It enables the encoder to produce a more compact visual representation with a minimal number of output tokens, thus eliminating the need for an additional compression module. 2) Ensure continuity in visual encoding. To address the potential encoding errors caused by fragmented visual inputs, we develop a Register Interactive Attention (ReAtten) module. This module facilitates effective and efficient information exchange across sub-images by enabling interactions between visual registers. It ensures the continuity of visual semantics throughout the encoding. We conduct comprehensive experiments with FALCON on high-resolution benchmarks across a wide range of scenarios. FALCON demonstrates superior performance with a remarkable 9-fold reduction in visual tokens.

  Referring video object segmentation (RVOS) aims to segment target objects throughout a video based on a text description. This is challenging as it involves deep vision-language understanding, pixel-level dense prediction and spatiotemporal reasoning. Despite notable progress in recent years, existing methods still exhibit a noticeable gap when considering all these aspects. In this work, we propose \textbf{ReferDINO}, a strong RVOS model that inherits region-level vision-language alignment from foundational visual grounding models, and is further endowed with pixel-level dense perception and cross-modal spatiotemporal reasoning. In detail, ReferDINO integrates two key components: 1) a grounding-guided deformable mask decoder that utilizes location prediction to progressively guide mask prediction through differentiable deformation mechanisms; 2) an object-consistent temporal enhancer that injects pretrained time-varying text features into inter-frame interaction to capture object-aware dynamic changes. Moreover, a confidence-aware query pruning strategy is designed to accelerate object decoding without compromising model performance. Extensive experimental results on five benchmarks demonstrate that our ReferDINO significantly outperforms previous methods (e.g., +3.9% (\mathcal{J}&\mathcal{F}) on Ref-YouTube-VOS) with real-time inference speed (51 FPS).

  While diffusion-based generative models have made significant strides in visual content creation, conventional approaches face computational challenges, especially for high-resolution images, as they denoise the entire image from noisy inputs. This contrasts with signal processing techniques, such as Fourier and wavelet analyses, which often employ hierarchical decompositions. Inspired by such principles, particularly the idea of signal separation, we introduce a diffusion framework leveraging multi-scale latent factorization. Our framework uniquely decomposes the denoising target, typically latent features from a pretrained Variational Autoencoder, into a low-frequency base signal capturing core structural information and a high-frequency residual signal that contributes finer, high-frequency details like textures. This decomposition into base and residual components directly informs our two-stage image generation process, which first produces the low-resolution base, followed by the generation of the high-resolution residual. Our proposed architecture facilitates reduced sampling steps during the residual learning stage, owing to the inherent ease of modeling residual information, which confers advantages over conventional full-resolution generation techniques. This specific approach of decomposing the signal into a base and a residual, conceptually akin to how wavelet analysis can separate different frequency bands, yields a more streamlined and intuitive design distinct from generic hierarchical models. Our method, \name\ (Multi-Scale Factorization), demonstrates its effectiveness by achieving FID scores of 2.08 ($256\times256$) and 2.47 ($512\times512$) on class-conditional ImageNet benchmarks, outperforming the DiT baseline (2.27 and 3.04 respectively) while also delivering a $4\times$ speed-up with the same number of sampling steps.

  Multi-object tracking (MOT) is dominated by two paradigms: tracking-by-detection (TBD) and tracking-by-query (TBQ). While TBD is decoupled and efficient, its fragmented association steps and heuristic matching pipelines often compromise robustness in complex scenarios. TBQ provides stronger semantic modeling through end-to-end learning, but suffers from high training cost and slow inference due to tight coupling between detection and association. To address these challenges, we propose TBDQ-Net, a unified tracking-by-detection-and-query (TBDQ) framework that effectively combines the strengths of both paradigms. Our method efficiently integrates pretrained, high-performance detectors with an MOT-tailored associator. The associator is lightweight and directly fetches information from the inference of detectors, enhancing the overall efficiency of the framework. The associator is also learnable, making it essential for fully end-to-end optimization, ensuring robust tracking capabilities. Specifically, the associator comprises two key modules: basic information interaction (BII) for comprehensive semantic interaction, and content-position alignment (CPA) for semantic and positional consistency. TBDQ-Net's effectiveness is extensively demonstrated on DanceTrack, SportsMOT and MOT20 benchmarks. As a structurally efficient and semantically robust tracking framework, it outperforms the leading TBD method by 6.0 IDF1 points on DanceTrack and achieves at least 37.5% faster inference than prominent TBQ methods.

  Exploring new knowledge is a fundamental human ability that can be mirrored in the development of deep neural networks, especially in the field of object detection. Open world object detection (OWOD) is an emerging area of research that adapts this principle to explore new knowledge. It focuses on recognizing and learning from objects absent from initial training sets, thereby incrementally expanding its knowledge base when new class labels are introduced. This survey paper offers a thorough review of the OWOD domain, covering essential aspects, including problem definitions, benchmark datasets, source codes, evaluation metrics, and a comparative study of existing methods. Additionally, we investigate related areas like open set recognition (OSR) and incremental learning (IL), underlining their relevance to OWOD. Finally, the paper concludes by addressing the limitations and challenges faced by current OWOD algorithms and proposes directions for future research. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive survey of the emerging OWOD field with over one hundred references, marking a significant step forward for object detection technology.

  Monocular depth estimation has seen significant advances through discriminative approaches, yet their performance remains constrained by the limitations of training datasets. While generative approaches have addressed this challenge by leveraging priors from internet-scale datasets, with recent studies showing state-of-the-art results using fine-tuned text-to-image diffusion models, there is still room for improvement. Notably, autoregressive generative approaches, particularly Visual AutoRegressive modeling, have demonstrated superior results compared to diffusion models in conditioned image synthesis, while offering faster inference times. In this work, we apply Visual Autoregressive Transformer (VAR) to the monocular depth estimation problem. However, the conventional GPT-2-style training procedure (teacher forcing) inherited by VAR yields suboptimal results for depth estimation. To address this limitation, we introduce DepthART - a novel training method formulated as a Depth Autoregressive Refinement Task. Unlike traditional VAR training with static inputs and targets, our method implements a dynamic target formulation based on model outputs, enabling self-refinement. By utilizing the model's own predictions as inputs instead of ground truth token maps during training, we frame the objective as residual minimization, effectively reducing the discrepancy between training and inference procedures. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed training approach significantly enhances the performance of VAR in depth estimation tasks. When trained on Hypersim dataset using our approach, the model achieves superior results across multiple unseen benchmarks compared to existing generative and discriminative baselines.

  Class Incremental Semantic Segmentation (CISS) aims to mitigate catastrophic forgetting by maintaining a balance between previously learned and newly introduced knowledge. Existing methods, primarily based on regularization techniques like knowledge distillation, help preserve old knowledge but often face challenges in effectively integrating new knowledge, resulting in limited overall improvement. Endpoints Weight Fusion (EWF) method, while simple, effectively addresses some of these limitations by dynamically fusing the model weights from previous steps with those from the current step, using a fusion parameter alpha determined by the relative number of previously known classes and newly introduced classes. However, the simplicity of the alpha calculation may limit its ability to fully capture the complexities of different task scenarios, potentially leading to suboptimal fusion outcomes. In this paper, we propose an enhanced approach called Adaptive Weight Fusion (AWF), which introduces an alternating training strategy for the fusion parameter, allowing for more flexible and adaptive weight integration. AWF achieves superior performance by better balancing the retention of old knowledge with the learning of new classes, significantly improving results on benchmark CISS tasks compared to the original EWF. And our experiment code will be released on Github.

However, existing 3D car datasets are either synthetic or low-quality, limiting their applications in practical scenarios and presenting a significant gap toward high-quality real-world 3D car datasets. In this paper, we propose the first large-scale 3D real car dataset, termed 3DRealCar, offering three distinctive features. (1) \textbf{High-Volume}: 2,500 cars are meticulously scanned by smartphones, obtaining car images and point clouds with real-world dimensions; (2) \textbf{High-Quality}: Each car is captured in an average of 200 dense, high-resolution 360-degree RGB-D views, enabling high-fidelity 3D reconstruction; (3) \textbf{High-Diversity}: The dataset contains various cars from over 100 brands, collected under three distinct lighting conditions, including reflective, standard, and dark. Additionally, we offer detailed car parsing maps for each instance to promote research in car parsing tasks. Moreover, we remove background point clouds and standardize the car orientation to a unified axis for the reconstruction only on cars and controllable rendering without background. We benchmark 3D reconstruction results with state-of-the-art methods across different lighting conditions in 3DRealCar.

  Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with large language models (LLMs) plays a crucial role in question answering, as LLMs possess limited knowledge and are not updated with continuously growing information. Most recent work on RAG has focused primarily on text-based or large-image retrieval, which constrains the broader application of RAG models. We recognize that object-level retrieval is essential for addressing questions that extend beyond image content. To tackle this issue, we propose a task of object retrieval for visual question answering with outside knowledge (OR-OK-VQA), aimed to extend image-based content understanding in conjunction with LLMs. A key challenge in this task is retrieving diverse objects-related images that contribute to answering the questions. To enable accurate and robust general object retrieval, it is necessary to learn embeddings for local objects. This paper introduces a novel unsupervised deep feature embedding technique called multi-scale group collaborative embedding learning (MS-GCEL), developed to learn embeddings for long-tailed objects at different scales. Additionally, we establish an OK-VQA evaluation benchmark using images from the BelgaLogos, Visual Genome, and LVIS datasets. Prior to the OK-VQA evaluation, we construct a benchmark of challenges utilizing objects extracted from the COCO 2017 and VOC 2007 datasets to support the training and evaluation of general object retrieval models. Our evaluations on both general object retrieval and OK-VQA demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The code and dataset will be publicly released for future research.

  Smartphones with multi-camera systems, featuring cameras with varying field-of-views (FoVs), are increasingly common. This variation in FoVs results in content differences across videos, paving the way for an innovative approach to video super-resolution (VSR). This method enhances the VSR performance of lower resolution (LR) videos by leveraging higher resolution reference (Ref) videos. Previous works, which operate on this principle, generally expand on traditional VSR models by combining LR and Ref inputs over time into a unified stream. However, we can expect that better results are obtained by independently aggregating these Ref image sequences temporally. Therefore, we introduce an improved method, RefVSR++, which performs the parallel aggregation of LR and Ref images in the temporal direction, aiming to optimize the use of the available data. RefVSR++ also incorporates improved mechanisms for aligning image features over time, crucial for effective VSR. Our experiments demonstrate that RefVSR++ outperforms previous works by over 1dB in PSNR, setting a new benchmark in the field.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced medical question-answering by leveraging extensive clinical data and medical literature. However, the rapid evolution of medical knowledge and the labor-intensive process of manually updating domain-specific resources pose challenges to the reliability of these systems. To address this, we introduce Agentic Medical Graph-RAG (AMG-RAG), a comprehensive framework that automates the construction and continuous updating of medical knowledge graphs, integrates reasoning, and retrieves current external evidence, such as PubMed and WikiSearch. By dynamically linking new findings and complex medical concepts, AMG-RAG not only improves accuracy but also enhances interpretability in medical queries.Evaluations on the MEDQA and MEDMCQA benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of AMG-RAG, achieving an F1 score of 74.1 percent on MEDQA and an accuracy of 66.34 percent on MEDMCQA, outperforming both comparable models and those 10 to 100 times larger. Notably, these improvements are achieved without increasing computational overhead, highlighting the critical role of automated knowledge graph generation and external evidence retrieval in delivering up-to-date, trustworthy medical insights.

  Accurate typhoon track forecasting is crucial for early system warning and disaster response. While Transformer-based models have demonstrated strong performance in modeling the temporal dynamics of dense trajectories of humans and vehicles in smart cities, they usually lack access to broader contextual knowledge that enhances the forecasting reliability of sparse meteorological trajectories, such as typhoon tracks. To address this challenge, we propose TyphoFormer, a novel framework that incorporates natural language descriptions as auxiliary prompts to improve typhoon trajectory forecasting. For each time step, we use Large Language Model (LLM) to generate concise textual descriptions based on the numerical attributes recorded in the North Atlantic hurricane database. The language descriptions capture high-level meteorological semantics and are embedded as auxiliary special tokens prepended to the numerical time series input. By integrating both textual and sequential information within a unified Transformer encoder, TyphoFormer enables the model to leverage contextual cues that are otherwise inaccessible through numerical features alone. Extensive experiments are conducted on HURDAT2 benchmark, results show that TyphoFormer consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art baseline methods, particularly under challenging scenarios involving nonlinear path shifts and limited historical observations.

  Interpretability in Table Question Answering (Table QA) is critical, especially in high-stakes domains like finance and healthcare. While recent Table QA approaches based on Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve high accuracy, they often produce ambiguous explanations of how answers are derived.We propose Plan-of-SQLs (POS), a new Table QA method that makes the model's decision-making process interpretable. POS decomposes a question into a sequence of atomic steps, each directly translated into an executable SQL command on the table, thereby ensuring that every intermediate result is transparent. Through extensive experiments, we show that: First, POS generates the highest-quality explanations among compared methods, which markedly improves the users' ability to simulate and verify the model's decisions. Second, when evaluated on standard Table QA benchmarks (TabFact, WikiTQ, and FeTaQA), POS achieves QA accuracy that is competitive to existing methods, while also offering greater efficiency-requiring significantly fewer LLM calls and table database queries (up to 25x fewer)-and more robust performance on large-sized tables. Finally, we observe high agreement (up to 90.59% in forward simulation) between LLMs and human users when making decisions based on the same explanations, suggesting that LLMs could serve as an effective proxy for humans in evaluating Table QA explanations.

  _Qiao Qiao, Yuepei Li, Qing Wang, Kang Zhou, Qi Li_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Knowledge graph completion (KGC) is a task of inferring missing triples based on existing Knowledge Graphs (KGs). Both structural and semantic information are vital for successful KGC. However, existing methods only use either the structural knowledge from the KG embeddings or the semantic information from pre-trained language models (PLMs), leading to suboptimal model performance. Moreover, since PLMs are not trained on KGs, directly using PLMs to encode triples may be inappropriate. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel framework called Bridge, which jointly encodes structural and semantic information of KGs. Specifically, we strategically encode entities and relations separately by PLMs to better utilize the semantic knowledge of PLMs and enable structured representation learning via a structural learning principle. Furthermore, to bridge the gap between KGs and PLMs, we employ a self-supervised representation learning method called BYOL to fine-tune PLMs with two different views of a triple. Unlike BYOL, which uses augmentation methods to create two semantically similar views of the same image, potentially altering the semantic information. We strategically separate the triple into two parts to create different views, thus avoiding semantic alteration. Experiments demonstrate that Bridge outperforms the SOTA models on three benchmark datasets.

  The rapid proliferation of large language models (LLMs) has stimulated researchers to seek effective and efficient approaches to deal with LLM hallucinations and low-quality outputs. Uncertainty quantification (UQ) is a key element of machine learning applications in dealing with such challenges. However, research to date on UQ for LLMs has been fragmented in terms of techniques and evaluation methodologies. In this work, we address this issue by introducing a novel benchmark that implements a collection of state-of-the-art UQ baselines and offers an environment for controllable and consistent evaluation of novel UQ techniques over various text generation tasks. Our benchmark also supports the assessment of confidence normalization methods in terms of their ability to provide interpretable scores. Using our benchmark, we conduct a large-scale empirical investigation of UQ and normalization techniques across eleven tasks, identifying the most effective approaches.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Process-level Reward Models (PRMs) are crucial for complex reasoning and decision-making tasks, where each intermediate step plays an important role in the reasoning process. Since language models are prone to various types of errors during the reasoning process, PRMs are required to possess nuanced capabilities for detecting various implicit error types in real-world scenarios. However, current benchmarks primarily focus on step correctness, failing to evaluate PRMs' performance systematically. To address this gap, we introduce PRMBench, a process-level benchmark specifically designed to assess the fine-grained error detection capabilities of PRMs. PRMBench comprises 6,216 carefully designed problems and 83,456 step-level labels, evaluating models across multiple dimensions, including simplicity, soundness, and sensitivity. In our experiments on 15 models, spanning both open-source PRMs and closed-source large language models prompted as critic models, we uncover significant weaknesses in current PRMs. These findings underscore the challenges inherent in process-level evaluation and highlight key directions for future research. We hope PRMBench can be a robust bench for advancing research on PRM evaluation and development.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Humans continuously infer the states, goals, and behaviors of others by perceiving their surroundings in dynamic, real-world social interactions. However, most Theory of Mind (ToM) benchmarks only evaluate static, text-based scenarios, which have a significant gap compared to real interactions. We propose the SoMi-ToM benchmark, designed to evaluate multi-perspective ToM in embodied multi-agent complex social interactions. This benchmark is based on rich multimodal interaction data generated by the interaction environment SoMi, covering diverse crafting goals and social relationships. Our framework supports multi-level evaluation: (1) first-person evaluation provides multimodal (visual, dialogue, action, etc.) input from a first-person perspective during a task for real-time state inference, (2) third-person evaluation provides complete third-person perspective video and text records after a task for goal and behavior inference. This evaluation method allows for a more comprehensive examination of a model's ToM capabilities from both the subjective immediate experience and the objective global observation. We constructed a challenging dataset containing 35 third-person perspective videos, 363 first-person perspective images, and 1225 expert-annotated multiple-choice questions (three options). On this dataset, we systematically evaluated the performance of human subjects and several state-of-the-art large vision-language models (LVLMs). The results show that LVLMs perform significantly worse than humans on SoMi-ToM: the average accuracy gap between humans and models is 40.1% in first-person evaluation and 26.4% in third-person evaluation. This indicates that future LVLMs need to further improve their ToM capabilities in embodied, complex social interactions.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in large language models and vision-language models have led to growing interest in explainable evaluation metrics for image captioning. However, these metrics generate explanations without standardized criteria, and the overall quality of the generated explanations remains unverified. In this paper, we propose EXPERT, a reference-free evaluation metric that provides structured explanations based on three fundamental criteria: fluency, relevance, and descriptiveness. By constructing large-scale datasets of high-quality structured explanations, we develop a two-stage evaluation template to effectively supervise a vision-language model for both scoring and explanation generation. EXPERT achieves state-of-the-art results on benchmark datasets while providing significantly higher-quality explanations than existing metrics, as validated through comprehensive human evaluation.

  _Bowen Ding, Yuhan Chen, Futing Wang, Lingfeng Ming, Tao Lin_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) excel at solving complex problems but face an overthinking dilemma. When handling simple tasks, they often produce verbose responses overloaded with thinking tokens (e.g., wait, however). These tokens trigger unnecessary high-level reasoning behaviors like reflection and backtracking, reducing efficiency. In this work, our pilot study reveals that these thinking-token-induced behaviors are not essential for effective problem-solving and may even hinder correct reasoning within constrained token budgets. We identify this phenomenon as the thinking trap. To mitigate this issue, we propose Dual Policy Preference Optimization (DuP-PO), a novel algorithm featuring: (1) A rollout sampling strategy that guarantees balanced exposure to responses with and without thinking tokens; (2) A fine-grained advantage control technique to dynamically regulate the prediction of target tokens; (3) A policy shaping method ensuring stable gradient contributions from thinking tokens. Experimental results on five popular math reasoning benchmarks show that DuP-PO performs well on the popular LRM, which significantly improves their token efficiency during reasoning, while achieving superior performance of the base model.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance on various tasks, but existing evaluation benchmarks are often static and insufficient to fully assess their robustness and generalization in realistic scenarios. Prior work using evolutionary or adversarial data augmentation has improved evaluation diversity but lacks systematic control over perturbation types and multi-step complexity, limiting comprehensive robustness analysis. To address these gaps, we propose AutoEvoEval, an evolution-based evaluation framework for close-ended tasks such as multi-choice question answering. AutoEvoEval introduces 22 interpretable atomic evolution operations and supports multi-round compositions, enabling controlled generation of diverse, challenging, and realistic test samples. We conduct extensive experiments addressing four research questions on a broad set of open- and closed-source LLMs. Our results show that atomic operations cause an average accuracy drop of 7.283\%, with structure-disrupting or misleading semantic edits causing the largest declines. Model sensitivities vary significantly for the same perturbation, and combining multiple evolution steps amplifies adversarial effects by up to 52.932\%. These findings suggest current benchmarks may overestimate true model generalization and emphasize the need for evolution-aware robustness evaluation.

  In the field of education, understanding students' opinions through their comments is crucial, especially in the Vietnamese language, where resources remain limited. Existing educational datasets often lack domain relevance and student slang. To address these gaps, we introduce NEU-ESC, a new Vietnamese dataset for Educational Sentiment Classification and Topic Classification, curated from university forums, which offers more samples, richer class diversity, longer texts, and broader vocabulary. In addition, we explore multitask learning using encoder-only language models (BERT), in which we showed that it achieves performance up to 83.7% and 79.8% accuracy for sentiment and topic classification tasks. We also benchmark our dataset and model with other datasets and models, including Large Language Models, and discuss these benchmarks. The dataset is publicly available at:this https URL.

  Active learning (AL) has demonstrated remarkable potential in reducing the annotation effort required for training machine learning models. However, despite the surging popularity of natural language generation (NLG) tasks in recent years, the application of AL to NLG has been limited. In this paper, we introduce Active Text Generation (ATGen) - a comprehensive framework that bridges AL with text generation tasks, enabling the application of state-of-the-art AL strategies to NLG. Our framework simplifies AL-empowered annotation in NLG tasks using both human annotators and automatic annotation agents based on large language models (LLMs). The framework supports LLMs deployed as services, such as ChatGPT and Claude, or operated on-premises. Furthermore, ATGen provides a unified platform for smooth implementation and benchmarking of novel AL strategies tailored to NLG tasks. Finally, we present evaluation results for state-of-the-art AL strategies across diverse settings and multiple text generation tasks. We show that ATGen reduces both the effort of human annotators and costs associated with API calls to LLM-based annotation agents.

  We present a new benchmark for evaluating Deep Search--a realistic and complex form of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) that requires source-aware, multi-hop reasoning over diverse, sparsed, but related sources. These include documents, meeting transcripts, Slack messages, GitHub, and URLs, which vary in structure and often contain human-to-human interactions. We build it using a synthetic data pipeline that simulates business workflows across product planning, development, and support stages, generating interconnected content with realistic noise and multi-hop questions with guaranteed ground-truth answers. We release our benchmark with both answerable and unanswerable queries, and retrieval pool of 39,190 enterprise artifacts, enabling fine-grained evaluation of long-context LLM and RAG systems. Our experiments reveal that even the best-performing agentic RAG methods achieve an average performance score of 32.96 on our benchmark. With further analysis, we highlight retrieval as the main bottleneck: existing methods struggle to conduct deep searches and retrieve all necessary evidence. Consequently, they often reason over partial context, leading to significant performance degradation.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Effective modeling of multifaceted relations is pivotal for Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC). However, a majority of existing approaches are predicated on static, embedding-based scoring, exhibiting inherent limitations in capturing contextual dependencies and relational dynamics. Addressing this gap, we propose the Flow-Modulated Scoring (FMS) framework. FMS comprises two principal components: (1) a semantic context learning module that encodes context-sensitive entity representations, and (2) a conditional flow-matching module designed to learn the dynamic transformation from a head to a tail embedding, governed by the aforementioned context. The resultant predictive vector field, representing the context-informed relational path, serves to dynamically refine the initial static score of an entity pair. Through this synergy of context-aware static representations and conditioned dynamic information, FMS facilitates a more profound modeling of relational semantics. Comprehensive evaluations on several standard benchmarks demonstrate that our proposed method surpasses prior state-of-the-art results.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various tasks, yet they face significant challenges in embodied task planning scenarios that require continuous environmental understanding and action generation. Existing approaches generate open-loop action scripts based on static knowledge, making it difficult to learn causal relationships between actions and environmental feedback, particularly in partially observable environments. We introduce Embodied Planner-R1, a novel outcome-driven reinforcement learning framework that enables LLMs to develop interactive capabilities through autonomous exploration with minimal supervision. Our framework incorporates three key innovations: (1) Without human annotations, we employ pure reinforcement learning with group rollout, incorporating in-environment interaction through parallel exploration; (2) completion-driven sparse reward; and (3) Interactive Policy Optimization (IPO) for efficient learning from grouped trajectories. Across two challenging text-based Embodied planning benchmarks, Embodied Planner-R1 achieves impressive completion rates of 97.78% on ALFWorld and 79.92% on ScienceWorld, surpassing prior methods by a large margin, and suffers only a -3.66% drop in previously unseen environments, evidencing strong generalization.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown impressive capabilities across tasks involving both visual and textual modalities. However, growing concerns remain about their potential to encode and amplify gender bias, particularly in socially sensitive applications. Existing benchmarks predominantly evaluate bias in isolated scenarios, overlooking how bias may emerge subtly through interpersonal interactions. We fill this gap by going beyond single-entity evaluation and instead focusing on a deeper examination of relational and contextual gender bias in dual-individual interactions. We introduce Genres, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate gender bias in MLLMs through the lens of social relationships in generated narratives. Genres assesses gender bias through a dual-character profile and narrative generation task that captures rich interpersonal dynamics and supports a fine-grained bias evaluation suite across multiple dimensions. Experiments on both open- and closed-source MLLMs reveal persistent, context-sensitive gender biases that are not evident in single-character settings. Our findings underscore the importance of relationship-aware benchmarks for diagnosing subtle, interaction-driven gender bias in MLLMs and provide actionable insights for future bias mitigation.

  Existing function-calling benchmarks focus on single-turn interactions. However, they overlook the complexity of real-world scenarios. To quantify how existing benchmarks address practical applications, we introduce DICE-SCORE, a metric that evaluates the dispersion of tool-related information such as function name and parameter values throughout the dialogue. Analyzing existing benchmarks through DICE-SCORE reveals notably low scores, highlighting the need for more realistic scenarios. To address this gap, we present DICE-BENCH, a framework that constructs practical function-calling datasets by synthesizing conversations through a tool graph that maintains dependencies across rounds and a multi-agent system with distinct personas to enhance dialogue naturalness. The final dataset comprises 1,607 high-DICE-SCORE instances. Our experiments on 19 LLMs with DICE-BENCH show that significant advances are still required before such models can be deployed effectively in real-world settings.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Graph-based retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enables large language models (LLMs) to ground responses with structured external knowledge from up-to-date knowledge graphs (KGs) and reduce hallucinations. However, LLMs often rely on a weak retriever in graph-based RAG: I) Due to the lack of ground truth, the retriever is often trained on weak supervision, which often introduces spurious signals to the LLMs. II) Due to the abstraction of graph data, the retrieved knowledge is often presented in unorganized forms. To mitigate the issue, we present Refined Graph-based RAG (ReG) to align weak retrievers to LLMs for graph-based RAG. Specifically, ReG incorporates LLM feedback to get rid of spurious signals and improve the quality of the supervision. Meanwhile, ReG introduces a structure-aware reorganization module to refactor the retrieval results into logically coherent evidence chains. Experiments on prominent benchmarks demonstrate that ReG significantly and consistently brings improvements across different LLM backbones by up to 10%. The improved supervision quality enables ReG to match the state-of-the-art performance with 5% training data and to transfer to out-of-distribution KGs. Notably, when adopted to reasoning-based LLMs, ReG reduces the reasoning token cost by up to 30% and improves the performance by up to 4%.

  Foundation models have achieved great success in natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV). Their success largely stems from the ability to integrate multi-domain knowledge in pre-training and transfer it to target domains. Considering graph data, especially graphs without textual features, is ubiquitous in real-world applications such as social networks and recommendation systems, some researchers have attempted to extend this paradigm to the graph field, aiming to construct graph foundation models. However, unlike CV and NLP, there are huge gaps among the semantics and properties of graphs in different domains, while current works still adopt traditional contrastive pre-training strategies designed in the single-domain scenario, which regard contrastive samples from different domains as equivalent. From experimental investigations, we discovered that inherent domain-specific differences prevent these strategies from effectively absorbing knowledge from different domains to generate informative representations. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-domain pre-training and cross-domain transfer framework, namelythis http URLthe pre-training stage, we design a contrastive learning strategy to substantially recognize and capture domain differences, and introduce domain tokens to encode domain-level global information. In the downstream stage, we introduce a domain attention mechanism to enable fine-grained domain knowledge transfer. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets have demonstrated that our method outperforms state-of-the-art significantly, with the maximum improvement of 19.33\% on accuracy and 19.13\% on Macro-F1 score.

  Large language models (LLMs) are regularly evaluated using benchmark datasets. But what justifies making inferences about an LLM's capabilities based on its answers to a curated set of questions? This paper first introduces a formal framework to address this question. The key is to note that the benchmarks used to test LLMs -- such as AP exams -- are also those used to test people. However, this raises an implication: these benchmarks are only valid tests if LLMs misunderstand concepts in ways that mirror human misunderstandings. Otherwise, success on benchmarks only demonstrates potemkin understanding: the illusion of understanding driven by answers irreconcilable with how any human would interpret a concept. We present two procedures for quantifying the existence of potemkins: one using a specially designed benchmark in three domains, the other using a general procedure that provides a lower-bound on their prevalence. We find that potemkins are ubiquitous across models, tasks, and domains. We also find that these failures reflect not just incorrect understanding, but deeper internal incoherence in concept representations.

  The increasing use of large language models (LLMs) in natural language processing (NLP) tasks has sparked significant interest in evaluating their effectiveness across diverse applications. While models like ChatGPT and DeepSeek have shown strong results in many NLP domains, a comprehensive evaluation is needed to understand their strengths, weaknesses, and domain-specific abilities. This is critical as these models are applied to various tasks, from sentiment analysis to more nuanced tasks like textual entailment and translation. This study aims to evaluate ChatGPT and DeepSeek across five key NLP tasks: sentiment analysis, topic classification, text summarization, machine translation, and textual entailment. A structured experimental protocol is used to ensure fairness and minimize variability. Both models are tested with identical, neutral prompts and evaluated on two benchmark datasets per task, covering domains like news, reviews, and formal/informal texts. The results show that DeepSeek excels in classification stability and logical reasoning, while ChatGPT performs better in tasks requiring nuanced understanding and flexibility. These findings provide valuable insights for selecting the appropriate LLM based on task requirements.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Self-correction is a novel method that can stimulate the potential reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). It involves detecting and correcting errors during the inference process when LLMs solve reasoning problems. However, recent works do not regard self-correction as a spontaneous and intrinsic capability of LLMs. Instead, such correction is achieved through post-hoc generation, external knowledge introduction, multi-model collaboration, and similar techniques. In this paper, we propose a series of mathematical LLMs called S$^3$c-Math, which are able to perform Spontaneous Step-level Self-correction for Mathematical reasoning. This capability helps LLMs to recognize whether their ongoing inference tends to contain errors and simultaneously correct these errors to produce a more reliable response. We proposed a method, which employs a step-level sampling approach to construct step-wise self-correction data for achieving such ability. Additionally, we implement a training strategy that uses above constructed data to equip LLMs with spontaneous step-level self-correction capacities. Our data and methods have been demonstrated to be effective across various foundation LLMs, consistently showing significant progress in evaluations on GSM8K, MATH, and other mathematical benchmarks. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to introduce the spontaneous step-level self-correction ability of LLMs in mathematical reasoning.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Identifying parallel passages in biblical Hebrew is foundational in biblical scholarship for uncovering intertextual relationships. Traditional methods rely on manual comparison, which is labor-intensive and prone to human error. This study evaluates the potential of pre-trained transformer-based language models, including E5, AlephBERT, MPNet, and LaBSE, for detecting textual parallels in the Hebrew Bible. Focusing on known parallels between the books of Samuel/Kings and Chronicles, I assessed each model's capability to generate word embeddings that delineate parallel from non-parallel passages. Utilizing cosine similarity and Wasserstein Distance measures, I found that E5 and AlephBERT show significant promise, with E5 excelling in parallel detection and AlephBERT demonstrating stronger non-parallel differentiation. These findings indicate that pre-trained models can enhance the efficiency and accuracy of detecting intertextual parallels in ancient texts, suggesting broader applications for ancient language studies.

  Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have been successfully used to probe Large Language Models (LLMs) and extract interpretable concepts from their internal representations. These concepts are linear combinations of neuron activations that correspond to human-interpretable features. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of SAE-based explainability approaches for sentence classification, a domain where such methods have not been extensively explored. We present a novel SAE-based architecture tailored for text classification, leveraging a specialized classifier head and incorporating an activation rate sparsity loss. We benchmark this architecture against established methods such as ConceptShap, Independent Component Analysis, and other SAE-based concept extraction techniques. Our evaluation covers two classification benchmarks and four fine-tuned LLMs from the Pythia family. We further enrich our analysis with two novel metrics for measuring the precision of concept-based explanations, using an external sentence encoder. Our empirical results show that our architecture improves both the causality and interpretability of the extracted features.

  Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved success across various domains. However, their applicability tends to degrade when confronted with different types of data inputs, especially for MLLMs that have been fine-tuned for specific tasks. Despite its importance, the study of knowledge sharing among domain-specific MLLMs--such as those trained for mathematics or code--remains largely underexplored. To address the fragmentation of knowledge across domain-specialized MLLMs, we propose a unified parameter integration framework that enables modular composition of expert capabilities. Our method is grounded in a novel Compatibility-Aware Parameter Splicing (CAPS) strategy, which leverages both local functional attribution and global information-theoretic signals to guide selective parameter fusion. By extending this mechanism to the low-rank adaptation layer granularity, we ensure efficient integration with minimal inference overhead. Furthermore, we introduce a domain compatibility scoring mechanism that quantifies inter-expert alignment at the activation level and correlates with downstream task utility. This principled fusion protocol allows the final model to synergize heterogeneous expertise while preserving structural modularity. Extensive evaluations across diverse multimodal benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our framework, offering a scalable path toward compositional, domain-adaptive MLLMs.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant progress on various multilingual benchmarks and are increasingly used to generate and evaluate text in non-English languages. However, while they may produce fluent outputs, it remains unclear to what extent these models truly grasp the underlying linguistic complexity of those languages, particularly in morphology. To investigate this, we introduce IMPACT, a synthetically generated evaluation framework focused on inflectional morphology, which we publicly release, designed to evaluate LLM performance across five morphologically rich languages: Arabic, Russian, Finnish, Turkish, and Hebrew. IMPACT includes unit-test-style cases covering both shared and language-specific phenomena, from basic verb inflections (e.g., tense, number, gender) to unique features like Arabic's reverse gender agreement and vowel harmony in Finnish and Turkish. We assess eight multilingual LLMs that, despite strong English performance, struggle with other languages and uncommon morphological patterns, especially when judging ungrammatical examples. We also show that Chain of Thought and Thinking Models can degrade performance. Our work exposes gaps in LLMs' handling of linguistic complexity, pointing to clear room for improvement. To support further research, we publicly release the IMPACT framework.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly improved their problem-solving capabilities. However, these models still struggle when faced with complex multi-step reasoning tasks. In this paper, we propose the Multi-Layered Self-Reflection with Auto-Prompting (MAPS) framework, a novel approach designed to enhance multi-step mathematical reasoning in LLMs by integrating techniques such as Chain of Thought (CoT), Self-Reflection, and Auto-Prompting. Unlike traditional static prompting methods, MAPS employs an iterative refinement process. Initially, the model generates a solution using CoT prompting. When errors are detected, an adaptive self-reflection mechanism identifies and analyzes them, generating tailored prompts to guide corrections. These dynamically adjusted prompts enable the model to iteratively refine its reasoning. Experiments on four well-established benchmarks across multiple LLMs show that MAPS significantly outperforms standard CoT and achieves competitive results with reasoning-optimized models. In addition, MAPS enables general-purpose LLMs to reach performance levels comparable to specialized reasoning models. While deeper reflection layers improve accuracy, they also increase token usage and costs. To balance this trade-off, MAPS strategically limits reflection depth, ensuring an optimal balance between cost and reasoning performance.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We conduct a systematic audit of three widely used reasoning benchmarks, SocialIQa, FauxPas-EAI, and ToMi, and uncover pervasive flaws in both benchmark items and evaluation methodology. Using five LLMs (GPT-{3, 3.5, 4, o1}, and LLaMA 3.1) as diagnostic tools, we identify structural, semantic, and pragmatic issues in benchmark design (e.g., duplicated items, ambiguous wording, and implausible answers), as well as scoring procedures that prioritize output form over reasoning process. Through systematic human annotation and re-evaluation on cleaned benchmark subsets, we find that model scores often improve not due to due to erratic surface wording variations and not to improved reasoning. Infact, further analyses show that model performance is highly sensitive to minor input variations such as context availability and phrasing, revealing that high scores may reflect alignment with format-specific cues rather than consistent inference based on the input. These findings challenge the validity of current benchmark-based claims about reasoning in LLMs, and highlight the need for evaluation protocols that assess reasoning as a process of drawing inference from available information, rather than as static output selection. We release audited data and evaluation tools to support more interpretable and diagnostic assessments of model reasoning.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Positional bias in binary question answering occurs when a model systematically favors one choice over another based solely on the ordering of presented options. In this study, we quantify and analyze positional bias across five large language models under varying degrees of answer uncertainty. We re-adapted the SQuAD-it dataset by adding an extra incorrect answer option and then created multiple versions with progressively less context and more out-of-context answers, yielding datasets that range from low to high uncertainty. Additionally, we evaluate two naturally higher-uncertainty benchmarks: (1) WebGPT - question pairs with unequal human-assigned quality scores, and (2) Winning Arguments - where models predict the more persuasive argument in Reddit's r/ChangeMyView exchanges. Across each dataset, the order of the "correct" (or higher-quality/persuasive) option is systematically flipped (first placed in position 1, then in position 2) to compute both Preference Fairness and Position Consistency. We observe that positional bias is nearly absent under low-uncertainty conditions, but grows exponentially when it becomes doubtful to decide which option is correct.

  Training large language models (LLMs) to act as autonomous agents for multi-turn, long-horizon tasks remains significant challenges in scalability and training efficiency. To address this, we introduce L-Zero (L0), a scalable, end-to-end training pipeline for general-purpose agents. Featuring a low-cost, extensible, and sandboxed concurrent agent worker pool, L0 lowers the barrier for applying reinforcement learning in complex environments. We also introduce NB-Agent, the agent scaffold within L0, which operates in a "code-as-action" fashion via a Read-Eval-Print-Loop (REPL). We evaluate L0 on factuality question-answering benchmarks. Our experiments demonstrate that a base model can develop robust problem-solving skills using solely Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). On the Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct model, our method boosts accuracy on SimpleQA from 30 % to 80 % and on HotpotQA from 22 % to 41 %. We have open-sourced the entire L0 system, including our L0 series models, the NB-Agent, a complete training pipeline, and the corresponding training recipes on (this https URL).

  Existing studies on fairness are largely Western-focused, making them inadequate for culturally diverse countries such as India. To address this gap, we introduce INDIC-BIAS, a comprehensive India-centric benchmark designed to evaluate fairness of LLMs across 85 identity groups encompassing diverse castes, religions, regions, and tribes. We first consult domain experts to curate over 1,800 socio-cultural topics spanning behaviors and situations, where biases and stereotypes are likely to emerge. Grounded in these topics, we generate and manually validate 20,000 real-world scenario templates to probe LLMs for fairness. We structure these templates into three evaluation tasks: plausibility, judgment, and generation. Our evaluation of 14 popular LLMs on these tasks reveals strong negative biases against marginalized identities, with models frequently reinforcing common stereotypes. Additionally, we find that models struggle to mitigate bias even when explicitly asked to rationalize their decision. Our evaluation provides evidence of both allocative and representational harms that current LLMs could cause towards Indian identities, calling for a more cautious usage in practical applications. We release INDIC-BIAS as an open-source benchmark to advance research on benchmarking and mitigating biases and stereotypes in the Indian context.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is widely used to align large language models (LLMs) with information extraction (IE) tasks, such as named entity recognition (NER). However, annotating such fine-grained labels and training domain-specific models is costly. Existing works typically train a unified model across multiple domains, but such approaches lack adaptation and scalability since not all training data benefits target domains and scaling trained models remains challenging. We propose the SaM framework, which dynamically Selects and Merges expert models at inference time. Specifically, for a target domain, we select domain-specific experts pre-trained on existing domains based on (i) domain similarity to the target domain and (ii) performance on sampled instances, respectively. The experts are then merged to create task-specific models optimized for the target domain. By dynamically merging experts beneficial to target domains, we improve generalization across various domains without extra training. Additionally, experts can be added or removed conveniently, leading to great scalability. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate our framework's effectiveness, which outperforms the unified model by an average of 10%. We further provide insights into potential improvements, practical experience, and extensions of our framework.

  In this paper, we introduce a simple training-free technique to improve the performance of drafter-based speculative decoding (SpD) methods that incorporates language modeling head (LM head) during drafting process. A drafter-based speculative decoding leverages one or more smaller language models, a.k.a. drafters or draft models, to sample a draft sequence or tree consisting of multiple tokens, followed by verification by a base LLM, a target model, accepting a subset as its valid generation. As it is usually considered that the speculative decoding requires one-to-one mapping between vocabularies of the target model and the draft model, it has been natural to share the vocabulary between them, or even share the LM head as in EAGLE or Medusa. We first identify that this draft token sampling scheme inherently contains an unnecessary inference overhead in drafting, especially for some target LLMs with very large vocabularies. Then, we propose a simple technique, VocabTrim, to mitigate the drafting overhead to improve the generation speed in memory-bound environment. VocabTrim reconstructs the drafter LM head to contain only a limited set of tokens, selected by the most frequently sampled from the vocabulary of the target model. While limiting the vocabulary in drafting slightly degrades the acceptance rate, it significantly reduces the drafting latency in memory-bound process which is often the case on edge devices, resulting in higher memory-bound speed up (MBSU). We show that our method can boost the memory-bound speed-up for Llama-3 models on Spec-Bench, specifically by 16% for Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Agents based on Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise for performing sophisticated software engineering tasks autonomously. In addition, there has been progress towards developing agents that can perform parts of the research pipeline in machine learning and the natural sciences. We argue that research extension and its implementation is a critical capability for such systems, and introduce RExBench to support the evaluation of this capability. RExBench is a benchmark consisting of 12 realistic research experiment implementation tasks that aim to investigate research hypotheses that have not previously been implemented. Each task is set up as an extension to an existing research paper and codebase, accompanied by domain expert-written instructions. RExBench is robust to data contamination, and supports an automatic evaluation infrastructure that executes agent outputs to determine whether the success criteria are met. We use this benchmark to evaluate nine LLM agents implemented using three different frameworks: aider, Claude Code, and OpenHands. We find that all agents evaluated fail to autonomously implement the majority of the extensions. Although the success rate improves with additional human-written hints, the best performance under this setting remains below 40%. This indicates that current agents are still short of being able to handle realistic research extension tasks without substantial human guidance.

  Connectivity and message propagation are central, yet often underutilized, sources of information in misinformation detection -- especially on poorly moderated platforms such as Telegram, which has become a critical channel for misinformation dissemination, namely in the German electoral context. In this paper, we introduce Misinfo-TeleGraph, the first German-language Telegram-based graph dataset for misinformation detection. It includes over 5 million messages from public channels, enriched with metadata, channel relationships, and both weak and strong labels. These labels are derived via semantic similarity to fact-checks and news articles using M3-embeddings, as well as manual annotation. To establish reproducible baselines, we evaluate both text-only models and graph neural networks (GNNs) that incorporate message forwarding as a network structure. Our results show that GraphSAGE with LSTM aggregation significantly outperforms text-only baselines in terms of Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) and F1-score. We further evaluate the impact of subscribers, view counts, and automatically versus human-created labels on performance, and highlight both the potential and challenges of weak supervision in this domain. This work provides a reproducible benchmark and open dataset for future research on misinformation detection in German-language Telegram networks and other low-moderation social platforms.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate significant potential but face challenges in complex financial reasoning tasks requiring both domain knowledge and sophisticated reasoning. Current evaluation benchmarks often fall short by not decoupling these capabilities indicators from single task performance and lack root cause analysis for task failure. To address this, we introduce FinEval-KR, a novel evaluation framework for decoupling and quantifying LLMs' knowledge and reasoning abilities independently, proposing distinct knowledge score and reasoning score metrics. Inspired by cognitive science, we further propose a cognitive score based on Bloom's taxonomy to analyze capabilities in reasoning tasks across different cognitive levels. We also release a new open-source Chinese financial reasoning dataset covering 22 subfields to support reproducible research and further advancements in financial reasoning. Our experimental results reveal that LLM reasoning ability and higher-order cognitive ability are the core factors influencing reasoning accuracy. We also specifically find that even top models still face a bottleneck with knowledge application. Furthermore, our analysis shows that specialized financial LLMs generally lag behind the top general large models across multiple metrics.

  Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across diverse domains, particularly in mathematical reasoning, amid which geometry problem solving remains a challenging area where auxiliary construction plays a enssential role. Existing approaches either achieve suboptimal performance or rely on massive LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o), incurring massive computational costs. We posit that reinforcement learning with verifiable reward (e.g., GRPO) offers a promising direction for training smaller models that effectively combine auxiliary construction with robust geometric reasoning. However, directly applying GRPO to geometric reasoning presents fundamental limitations due to its dependence on unconditional rewards, which leads to indiscriminate and counterproductive auxiliary constructions. To address these challenges, we propose Group Contrastive Policy Optimization (GCPO), a novel reinforcement learning framework featuring two key innovations: (1) Group Contrastive Masking, which adaptively provides positive or negative reward signals for auxiliary construction based on contextual utility, and a (2) length reward that promotes longer reasoning chains. Building on GCPO, we develop GeometryZero, a family of affordable-size geometric reasoning models that judiciously determine when to employ auxiliary construction. Our extensive empirical evaluation across popular geometric benchmarks (Geometry3K, MathVista) demonstrates that GeometryZero models consistently outperform baselines (e.g. GRPO), achieving an average improvement of 4.29% across all benchmarks.

  Addressing intricate real-world problems necessitates in-depth information seeking and multi-step reasoning. Recent progress in agentic systems, exemplified by Deep Research, underscores the potential for autonomous multi-step research. In this work, we present a cohesive paradigm for building end-to-end agentic information seeking agents from a data-centric and training-stage perspective. Our approach consists of four key stages: (1) browsing data construction, (2) trajectories sampling, (3) supervised fine-tuning for effective cold start, and (4) reinforcement learning for enhanced generalisation. We instantiate this framework in a web agent based on the ReAct, WebDancer. Empirical evaluations on the challenging information seeking benchmarks, GAIA and WebWalkerQA, demonstrate the strong performance of WebDancer, achieving considerable results and highlighting the efficacy of our training paradigm. Further analysis of agent training provides valuable insights and actionable, systematic pathways for developing more capable agentic models. The codes and demo will be released inthis https URL.

  Despite their remarkable success and deployment across diverse workflows, language models sometimes produce untruthful responses. Our limited understanding of how truthfulness is mechanistically encoded within these models jeopardizes their reliability and safety. In this paper, we propose a method for identifying representations of truthfulness at the neuron level. We show that language models contain truth neurons, which encode truthfulness in a subject-agnostic manner. Experiments conducted across models of varying scales validate the existence of truth neurons, confirming that the encoding of truthfulness at the neuron level is a property shared by many language models. The distribution patterns of truth neurons over layers align with prior findings on the geometry of truthfulness. Selectively suppressing the activations of truth neurons found through the TruthfulQA dataset degrades performance both on TruthfulQA and on other benchmarks, showing that the truthfulness mechanisms are not tied to a specific dataset. Our results offer novel insights into the mechanisms underlying truthfulness in language models and highlight potential directions toward improving their trustworthiness and reliability.

  User simulators are crucial for replicating human interactions with dialogue systems, supporting both collaborative training and automatic evaluation, especially for large language models (LLMs). However, current role-playing methods face challenges such as a lack of utterance-level authenticity and user-level diversity, often hindered by role confusion and dependence on predefined profiles of well-known figures. In contrast, direct simulation focuses solely on text, neglecting implicit user traits like personality and conversation-level consistency. To address these issues, we introduce the User Simulator with Implicit Profiles (USP), a framework that infers implicit user profiles from human-machine interactions to simulate personalized and realistic dialogues. We first develop an LLM-driven extractor with a comprehensive profile schema, then refine the simulation using conditional supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning with cycle consistency, optimizing at both the utterance and conversation levels. Finally, a diverse profile sampler captures the distribution of real-world user profiles. Experimental results show that USP outperforms strong baselines in terms of authenticity and diversity while maintaining comparable consistency. Additionally, using USP to evaluate LLM on dynamic multi-turn aligns well with mainstream benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness in real-world applications.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent LLMs have enabled significant advancements for conversational agents. However, they are also well known to hallucinate, producing responses that seem plausible but are factually incorrect. On the other hand, users tend to over-rely on LLM-based AI agents, accepting AI's suggestion even when it is wrong. Adding positive friction, such as explanations or getting user confirmations, has been proposed as a mitigation in AI-supported decision-making systems. In this paper, we propose an accountability model for LLM-based task-oriented dialogue agents to address user overreliance via friction turns in cases of model uncertainty and errors associated with dialogue state tracking (DST). The accountability model is an augmented LLM with an additional accountability head that functions as a binary classifier to predict the relevant slots of the dialogue state mentioned in the conversation. We perform our experiments with multiple backbone LLMs on two established benchmarks (MultiWOZ and Snips). Our empirical findings demonstrate that the proposed approach not only enables reliable estimation of AI agent errors but also guides the decoder in generating more accurate actions. We observe around 3% absolute improvement in joint goal accuracy (JGA) of DST output by incorporating accountability heads into modern LLMs. Self-correcting the detected errors further increases the JGA from 67.13 to 70.51, achieving state-of-the-art DST performance. Finally, we show that error correction through user confirmations (friction turn) achieves a similar performance gain, highlighting its potential to reduce user overreliance.

  Large language models (LLMs) fine-tuned with alignment techniques, such as reinforcement learning from human feedback, have been instrumental in developing some of the most capable AI systems to date. Despite their success, existing methods typically rely on simple binary labels, such as those indicating preferred outputs in pairwise preferences, which fail to capture the subtle differences in relative quality between pairs. To address this limitation, we introduce an approach called Margin Matching Preference Optimization (MMPO), which incorporates relative quality margins into optimization, leading to improved LLM policies and reward models. Specifically, given quality margins in pairwise preferences, we design soft target probabilities based on the Bradley-Terry model, which are then used to train models with the standard cross-entropy objective. Experiments with both human and AI feedback data demonstrate that MMPO consistently outperforms baseline methods, often by a substantial margin, on popular benchmarks including MT-bench and RewardBench. Notably, the 7B model trained with MMPO achieves state-of-the-art performance on RewardBench as of June 2024, outperforming other models of the same scale. Our analysis also shows that MMPO is more robust to overfitting, leading to better-calibrated models.

  Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) summarization involves generating concise and accurate highlights from web intelligence data, which is critical for providing decision-makers with actionable insights to swiftly detect and respond to cyber threats in the cybersecurity domain. Despite that, the development of efficient techniques for summarizing CTI reports, comprising facts, analytical insights, attack processes, and more, has been hindered by the lack of suitable datasets. To address this gap, we introduce CTISum, a new benchmark dataset designed for the CTI summarization task. Recognizing the significance of understanding attack processes, we also propose a novel fine-grained subtask: attack process summarization, which aims to help defenders assess risks, identify security gaps, and uncover vulnerabilities. Specifically, a multi-stage annotation pipeline is designed to collect and annotate CTI data from diverse web sources, alongside a comprehensive benchmarking of CTISum using both extractive, abstractive and LLMs-based summarization methods. Experimental results reveal that current state-of-the-art models face significant challenges when applied to CTISum, highlighting that automatic summarization of CTI reports remains an open research problem.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multimodal emotion recognition in conversation (MERC) has garnered substantial research attention recently. Existing MERC methods face several challenges: (1) they fail to fully harness direct inter-modal cues, possibly leading to less-than-thorough cross-modal modeling; (2) they concurrently extract information from the same and different modalities at each network layer, potentially triggering conflicts from the fusion of multi-source data; (3) they lack the agility required to detect dynamic sentimental changes, perhaps resulting in inaccurate classification of utterances with abrupt sentiment shifts. To address these issues, a novel approach named GraphSmile is proposed for tracking intricate emotional cues in multimodal dialogues. GraphSmile comprises two key components, i.e., GSF and SDP modules. GSF ingeniously leverages graph structures to alternately assimilate inter-modal and intra-modal emotional dependencies layer by layer, adequately capturing cross-modal cues while effectively circumventing fusion conflicts. SDP is an auxiliary task to explicitly delineate the sentiment dynamics between utterances, promoting the model's ability to distinguish sentimental discrepancies. GraphSmile is effortlessly applied to multimodal sentiment analysis in conversation (MSAC), thus enabling simultaneous execution of MERC and MSAC tasks. Empirical results on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that GraphSmile can handle complex emotional and sentimental patterns, significantly outperforming baseline models.

  We introduce TAPAS (Task-based Adaptation and Planning using AgentS), a multi-agent framework that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with symbolic planning to solve complex tasks without the need for manually defined environment models. TAPAS employs specialized LLM-based agents that collaboratively generate and adapt domain models, initial states, and goal specifications as needed using structured tool-calling mechanisms. Through this tool-based interaction, downstream agents can request modifications from upstream agents, enabling adaptation to novel attributes and constraints without manual domain redefinition. A ReAct (Reason+Act)-style execution agent, coupled with natural language plan translation, bridges the gap between dynamically generated plans and real-world robot capabilities. TAPAS demonstrates strong performance in benchmark planning domains and in the VirtualHome simulated real-world environment.

  Nielsen transformation is a standard approach for solving word equations: by repeatedly splitting equations and applying simplification steps, equations are rewritten until a solution is reached. When solving a conjunction of word equations in this way, the performance of the solver will depend considerably on the order in which equations are processed. In this work, the use of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for ranking word equations before and during the solving process is explored. For this, a novel graph-based representation for word equations is presented, preserving global information across conjuncts, enabling the GNN to have a holistic view during ranking. To handle the variable number of conjuncts, three approaches to adapt a multi-classification task to the problem of ranking equations are proposed. The training of the GNN is done with the help of minimum unsatisfiable subsets (MUSes) of word equations. The experimental results show that, compared to state-of-the-art string solvers, the new framework solves more problems in benchmarks where each variable appears at most once in each equation.

  Reasoning plays a crucial role in advancing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) toward Artificial General Intelligence. However, existing MLLM benchmarks often fall short in precisely and comprehensively evaluating long-chain reasoning abilities from three key aspects: (1) lack of difficulty and diversity, (2) susceptibility to guessability and memorization, (3) inadequate assessment of intermediate reasoning steps. To fill this gap, we introduce MMReason, a new benchmark designed to precisely and comprehensively evaluate MLLM long-chain reasoning capability with diverse, open-ended, challenging questions. First, we curate challenging questions requiring multi-step reasoning from various fields (i.e., 6 disciplines) and multiple difficulty levels (i.e., from pre-university to university, and from foundational to competition tiers). Second, these questions are reformulated into an open-ended format and filtered using a multi-model voting technique to eliminate shortcut cases related to guessing and memorization, ensuring robust reasoning evaluations. Third, we annotate the questions with detailed step-by-step solutions, and design a reference-based ternary scoring mechanism to reliably assess intermediate reasoning steps. With MMReason, we benchmark popular leading MLLMs and provide an in-depth analysis of their reasoning capabilities. We hope MMReason will serve as a valuable resource for advancing MLLM reasoning research. Code will be available atthis https URL.

  The ability to process information from multiple modalities and to reason through it step-by-step remains a critical challenge in advancing artificial intelligence. However, existing reasoning benchmarks focus on text-only reasoning, or employ multimodal questions that can be answered by directly retrieving information from a non-text modality. Thus, complex reasoning remains poorly understood in multimodal domains. Here, we present MARBLE, a challenging multimodal reasoning benchmark that is designed to scrutinize multimodal language models (MLLMs) in their ability to carefully reason step-by-step through complex multimodal problems and environments. MARBLE is composed of two highly challenging tasks, M-Portal and M-Cube, that require the crafting and understanding of multistep plans under spatial, visual, and physical constraints. We find that current MLLMs perform poorly on MARBLE -- all the 12 advanced models obtain near-random performance on M-Portal and 0% accuracy on M-Cube. Only in simplified subtasks some models outperform the random baseline, indicating that complex reasoning is still a challenge for existing MLLMs. Moreover, we show that perception remains a bottleneck, where MLLMs occasionally fail to extract information from the visual inputs. By shedding a light on the limitations of MLLMs, we hope that MARBLE will spur the development of the next generation of models with the ability to reason and plan across many, multimodal reasoning steps.

  We introduce CHARTOM, a visual theory-of-mind benchmark designed to evaluate multimodal large language models' capability to understand and reason about misleading data visualizations though charts. CHARTOM consists of carefully designed charts and associated questions that require a language model to not only correctly comprehend the factual content in the chart (the FACT question) but also judge whether the chart will be misleading to a human readers (the MIND question), a dual capability with significant societal benefits. We detail the construction of our benchmark including its calibration on human performance and estimation of MIND ground truth called the Human Misleadingness Index. We evaluated several leading LLMs -- including GPT, Claude, Gemini, Qwen, Llama, and Llava series models -- on the CHARTOM dataset and found that it was challenging to all models both on FACT and MIND questions. This highlights the limitations of current LLMs and presents significant opportunity for future LLMs to improve on understanding misleading charts.

  Theory of Mind (ToM), the ability to understand people's minds based on their behavior, is key to developing socially intelligent agents. Current approaches to ToM reasoning either rely on prompting Large Language Models (LLMs), which are prone to systematic errors, or use handcrafted, rigid agent models for model-based inference, which are more robust but fail to generalize across domains. In this work, we introduce AutoToM, an automated agent modeling method for scalable, robust, and interpretable mental inference. Given a ToM problem, AutoToM first proposes an initial agent model and then performs automated Bayesian inverse planning based on this model, leveraging an LLM backend. Guided by inference uncertainty, it iteratively refines the model by introducing additional mental variables and/or incorporating more timesteps in the context. Across five diverse benchmarks, AutoToM outperforms existing ToM methods and even large reasoning models. Additionally, we show that AutoToM can produce human-like confidence estimates and enable online mental inference for embodied decision-making.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In the domain of algorithmic decision-making, non-Markovian dynamics manifest as a significant impediment, especially for paradigms such as Reinforcement Learning (RL), thereby exerting far-reaching consequences on the advancement and effectiveness of the associated systems. Nevertheless, the existing benchmarks are deficient in comprehensively assessing the capacity of decision algorithms to handle non-Markovian dynamics. To address this deficiency, we have devised a generalized methodology grounded in category theory. Notably, we established the category of Markov Decision Processes (MDP) and the category of non-Markovian Decision Processes (NMDP), and proved the equivalence relationship between them. This theoretical foundation provides a novel perspective for understanding and addressing non-Markovian dynamics. We further introduced non-Markovianity into decision-making problem settings via the History Aggregator for State (HAS). With HAS, we can precisely control the state dependency structure of decision-making problems in the time series. Our analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of our method in representing a broad range of non-Markovian dynamics. This approach facilitates a more rigorous and flexible evaluation of decision algorithms by testing them in problem settings where non-Markovian dynamics are explicitly constructed.

  Document Visual Question Answering (DocVQA) systems are increasingly deployed in real world applications, yet they remain ethically opaque-often producing overconfident answers to ambiguous questions or failing to communicate uncertainty in a trustworthy manner. This misalignment between model confidence and actual knowledge poses significant risks, particularly in domains requiring ethical accountability. Existing approaches such as LayoutLMv3, UDOP, and DONUT have advanced SOTA performance by focusing on architectural sophistication and accuracy; however, they fall short in ethical responsiveness.To address these limitations, we introduce HonestVQA, a self-supervised honesty calibration framework for ethically aligned DocVQA. Our model-agnostic method quantifies uncertainty to identify knowledge gaps, aligns model confidence with actual correctness using weighted loss functions, and enforces ethical response behavior via contrastive learning. We further introduce two principled evaluation metrics--Honesty Score (H-Score) and Ethical Confidence Index (ECI)--to benchmark alignment between confidence, accuracy, and ethical communication. Empirically, HonestVQA improves DocVQA accuracy by up to 4.3% and F1 by 4.3% across SpDocVQA, InfographicsVQA, and SROIE datasets. It reduces overconfidence, lowering H-Score and ECI by 0.072 and 0.078, respectively. In cross domain evaluation, it achieves up to 78.9% accuracy and 76.1% F1-score, demonstrating strong generalization. Ablation shows a 3.8% drop in accuracy without alignment or contrastive loss.

  Semantic context surrounding a triplet $(h, r, t)$ is crucial for Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC), providing vital cues for prediction. However, traditional node-based message passing mechanisms, when applied to knowledge graphs, often introduce noise and suffer from information dilution or over-smoothing by indiscriminately aggregating information from all neighboring edges. To address this challenge, we propose a semantic-aware relational message passing. A core innovation of this framework is the introduction of a \textbf{semantic-aware Top-K neighbor selection strategy}. Specifically, this strategy first evaluates the semantic relevance between a central node and its incident edges within a shared latent space, selecting only the Top-K most pertinent ones. Subsequently, information from these selected edges is effectively fused with the central node's own representation using a \textbf{multi-head attention aggregator} to generate a semantically focused node message. In this manner, our model not only leverages the structure and features of edges within the knowledge graph but also more accurately captures and propagates the contextual information most relevant to the specific link prediction task, thereby effectively mitigating interference from irrelevant information. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance compared to existing approaches on several established benchmarks.

  How far are Large Language Models (LLMs) in performing deep relational reasoning? In this paper, we evaluate and compare the reasoning capabilities of three cutting-edge LLMs, namely, DeepSeek-R1, DeepSeek-V3 and GPT-4o, through a suite of carefully designed benchmark tasks in family tree and general graph reasoning. Our experiments reveal that DeepSeek-R1 consistently achieves the highest F1-scores across multiple tasks and problem sizes, demonstrating strong aptitude in logical deduction and relational inference. However, all evaluated models, including DeepSeek-R1, struggle significantly as problem complexity increases, largely due to token length limitations and incomplete output structures. A detailed analysis of DeepSeek-R1's long Chain-of-Thought responses uncovers its unique planning and verification strategies, but also highlights instances of incoherent or incomplete reasoning, calling attention to the need for deeper scrutiny into LLMs' internal inference dynamics. We further discuss key directions for future work, including the role of multimodal reasoning and the systematic examination of reasoning failures. Our findings provide both empirical insights and theoretical implications for advancing LLMs' reasoning abilities, particularly in tasks that demand structured, multi-step logical inference. Our code repository will be publicly available atthis https URL.

  Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models enable conditional computation by routing inputs to specialized experts, but these experts rely on identical inductive biases, thus limiting representational diversity. This static computation pathway is inefficient for inputs that require different types of reasoning and limits specialization and interpretability. We propose Hecto, a lightweight MoE architecture that leverages architectural heterogeneity by combining a GRU expert for temporal reasoning and an FFNN expert for static abstraction under a sparse Top-1 gating mechanism. Evaluated on three reasoning benchmarks (AG News, SST-2, HotpotQA) and a regression task (STS-B), Hecto matches or closely trails homogeneous baselines in performance despite receiving isolated input representations, while achieving clear expert specialization, with each expert aligning to distinct reasoning types (temporal vs static). At larger batch sizes, Hecto exhibits improved performance, benefiting from relaxed computational constraints that allow its heterogeneous architecture to optimize more effectively. Ablation results isolate architectural diversity as the source of Hecto's stability and interpretability across diverse reasoning tasks. Overall, Hecto establishes itself as a new benchmark for conditional computation, offering a principled framework for specialized reasoning in low-resource regimes with its model strength derived from principled specialization.

  Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have revealed a significant performance gap between closed-source and open-source models, particularly in tasks requiring complex reasoning and precise instruction following. This paper introduces ReasonBridge, a methodology that efficiently transfers reasoning capabilities from powerful closed-source to open-source models through a novel hierarchical knowledge distillation framework. We develop a tailored dataset Reason1K with only 1,000 carefully curated reasoning traces emphasizing difficulty, diversity, and quality. These traces are filtered from across multiple domains using a structured multi-criteria selection algorithm. Our transfer learning approach incorporates: (1) a hierarchical distillation process capturing both strategic abstraction and tactical implementation patterns, (2) a sparse reasoning-focused adapter architecture requiring only 0.3% additional trainable parameters, and (3) a test-time compute scaling mechanism using guided inference interventions. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that ReasonBridge improves reasoning capabilities in open-source models by up to 23% on benchmark tasks, significantly narrowing the gap with closed-source models. Notably, the enhanced Qwen2.5-14B outperforms Claude-Sonnet3.5 on MATH500 and matches its performance on competition-level AIME problems. Our methodology generalizes effectively across diverse reasoning domains and model architectures, establishing a sample-efficient approach to reasoning enhancement for instruction following.

  Games have long been used as benchmarks and testing environments for research in artificial intelligence. A key step in supporting this research was the development of game description languages: frameworks that compile domain-specific code into playable and simulatable game environments, allowing researchers to generalize their algorithms and approaches across multiple games without having to manually implement each one. More recently, progress in reinforcement learning (RL) has been largely driven by advances in hardware acceleration. Libraries like JAX allow practitioners to take full advantage of cutting-edge computing hardware, often speeding up training and testing by orders of magnitude. Here, we present a synthesis of these strands of research: a domain-specific language for board games which automatically compiles into hardware-accelerated code. Our framework, Ludax, combines the generality of game description languages with the speed of modern parallel processing hardware and is designed to fit neatly into existing deep learning pipelines. We envision Ludax as a tool to help accelerate games research generally, from RL to cognitive science, by enabling rapid simulation and providing a flexible representation scheme. We present a detailed breakdown of Ludax's description language and technical notes on the compilation process, along with speed benchmarking and a demonstration of training RL agents. The Ludax framework, along with implementations of existing board games, is open-source and freely available.

  Autonomous UAV operation necessitates reliable mathematical reasoning for tasks such as trajectory planning and power management. While traditional flight control relies on hardcoded equations, recent Large Language Models (LLMs) offer potential for more flexible problem-solving but struggle with reliably selecting and applying correct mathematical formulations and executing precise multi-step arithmetic. We propose RAG-UAV, a retrieval-augmented generation framework designed to improve the mathematical reasoning of several LLMs (including GPT o1/Turbo, Llama-3.2/3.3, Mistral, and DeepSeek R1) in UAV-specific contexts by providing access to relevant domain literature. To conduct an initial assessment, we introduce the UAV-Math-Bench, a 20-question problem set of UAV-centric mathematical problems across four difficulty levels. Our experiments demonstrate that incorporating retrieval substantially increases exact answer accuracy (achieving up to 75% with o1), reduces instances of incorrect formulation selection (from 25% without RAG to 5\% with RAG), and decreases numerical errors, reducing Mean Squared Error (MSE) by orders of magnitude for the best-performing models. This pilot study indicates that RAG can enable general-purpose LLMs to function as more reliable tools for engineering analysis, although direct real-time flight control requires further investigation and validation on a larger scale. All benchmark data, questions, and answers are publicly available.

  The rapid advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly in generative AI and large language models (LLMs), have profoundly impacted the creative industries, enabling more innovative content creation, enhancing workflows, and democratizing access to creative tools. This paper explores these technological shifts, with particular focus on how those that have emerged since our previous review in 2022 have expanded creative opportunities and improved efficiency. These technological advancements have enhanced the capabilities of text-to-image, text-to-video, and multimodal generation technologies. In particular, key breakthroughs in LLMs have established new benchmarks in conversational AI, while advancements in image generators have revolutionized content creation. We also discuss the integration of AI into post-production workflows, which has significantly accelerated and improved traditional processes. Once content has been created, it must be delivered to its audiences; the media industry is now facing the demands of increased communication traffic due to creative content. We therefore include a discussion of how AI is beginning to transform the way we represent and compress media content. We highlight the trend toward unified AI frameworks capable of addressing and integrating multiple creative tasks, and we underscore the importance of human insight to drive the creative process and oversight to mitigate AI-generated inaccuracies. Finally, we explore AI's future potential in the creative sector, stressing the need to navigate emerging challenges and to maximize its benefits while addressing the associated risks.
