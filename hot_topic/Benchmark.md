- **[Debate2Create: Robot Co-design via Large Language Model Debates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25850)**  `arXiv:2510.25850`  `cs.RO` `cs.LG` `cs.MA`  
  _Kevin Qiu, Marek Cygan_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Automating the co-design of a robot's morphology and control is a long-standing challenge due to the vast design space and the tight coupling between body and behavior. We introduce Debate2Create (D2C), a framework in which large language model (LLM) agents engage in a structured dialectical debate to jointly optimize a robot's design and its reward function. In each round, a design agent proposes targeted morphological modifications, and a control agent devises a reward function tailored to exploit the new design. A panel of pluralistic judges then evaluates the design-control pair in simulation and provides feedback that guides the next round of debate. Through iterative debates, the agents progressively refine their proposals, producing increasingly effective robot designs. Notably, D2C yields diverse and specialized morphologies despite no explicit diversity objective. On a quadruped locomotion benchmark, D2C discovers designs that travel 73% farther than the default, demonstrating that structured LLM-based debate can serve as a powerful mechanism for emergent robot co-design. Our results suggest that multi-agent debate, when coupled with physics-grounded feedback, is a promising new paradigm for automated robot design.

- **[Heuristic Adaptation of Potentially Misspecified Domain Support for Likelihood-Free Inference in Stochastic Dynamical Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26656)**  `arXiv:2510.26656`  `cs.RO` `cs.LG`  
  _Georgios Kamaras, Craig Innes, Subramanian Ramamoorthy_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In robotics, likelihood-free inference (LFI) can provide the domain distribution that adapts a learnt agent in a parametric set of deployment conditions. LFI assumes an arbitrary support for sampling, which remains constant as the initial generic prior is iteratively refined to more descriptive posteriors. However, a potentially misspecified support can lead to suboptimal, yet falsely certain, posteriors. To address this issue, we propose three heuristic LFI variants: EDGE, MODE, and CENTRE. Each interprets the posterior mode shift over inference steps in its own way and, when integrated into an LFI step, adapts the support alongside posterior inference. We first expose the support misspecification issue and evaluate our heuristics using stochastic dynamical benchmarks. We then evaluate the impact of heuristic support adaptation on parameter inference and policy learning for a dynamic deformable linear object (DLO) manipulation task. Inference results in a finer length and stiffness classification for a parametric set of DLOs. When the resulting posteriors are used as domain distributions for sim-based policy learning, they lead to more robust object-centric agent performance.

- **[CronusVLA: Towards Efficient and Robust Manipulation via Multi-Frame Vision-Language-Action Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19816)**  `arXiv:2506.19816`  `cs.RO` `cs.CV`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent vision-language-action (VLA) models built on pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong performance in robotic manipulation. However, these models remain constrained by the single-frame image paradigm and fail to fully leverage the temporal information offered by multi-frame histories, as directly feeding multiple frames into VLM backbones incurs substantial computational overhead and inference latency. We propose CronusVLA, a unified framework that extends single-frame VLA models to the multi-frame paradigm. CronusVLA follows a two-stage process: (1) Single-frame pretraining on large-scale embodied datasets with autoregressive prediction of action tokens, establishing an effective embodied vision-language foundation; (2) Multi-frame post-training, which adapts the prediction of the vision-language backbone from discrete tokens to learnable features, and aggregates historical information via feature chunking. CronusVLA effectively addresses the existing challenges of multi-frame modeling while enhancing performance and observational robustness. To evaluate the robustness under temporal and spatial disturbances, we introduce SimplerEnv-OR, a novel benchmark featuring 24 types of observational disturbances and 120 severity levels. Experiments across three embodiments in simulated and real-world environments demonstrate that CronusVLA achieves leading performance and superior robustness, with a 70.9% success rate on SimplerEnv, a 26.8% improvement over OpenVLA on LIBERO, and the highest robustness score on SimplerEnv-OR. These results highlight the potential of efficient multi-frame adaptation in VLA models for more powerful and robust real-world deployment.

- **[Hybrid DQN-TD3 Reinforcement Learning for Autonomous Navigation in Dynamic Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26646)**  `arXiv:2510.26646`  `cs.RO` `cs.AI` `cs.LG`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper presents a hierarchical path-planning and control framework that combines a high-level Deep Q-Network (DQN) for discrete sub-goal selection with a low-level Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) controller for continuous actuation. The high-level module selects behaviors and sub-goals; the low-level module executes smooth velocity commands. We design a practical reward shaping scheme (direction, distance, obstacle avoidance, action smoothness, collision penalty, time penalty, and progress), together with a LiDAR-based safety gate that prevents unsafe motions. The system is implemented in ROS + Gazebo (TurtleBot3) and evaluated with PathBench metrics, including success rate, collision rate, path efficiency, and re-planning efficiency, in dynamic and partially observable environments. Experiments show improved success rate and sample efficiency over single-algorithm baselines (DQN or TD3 alone) and rule-based planners, with better generalization to unseen obstacle configurations and reduced abrupt control changes. Code and evaluation scripts are available at the project repository.

- **[FLYINGTRUST: A Benchmark for Quadrotor Navigation Across Scenarios and Vehicles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26588)**  `arXiv:2510.26588`  `cs.RO`  
  _Gang Li, Chunlei Zhai, Teng Wang, Shaun Li, Shangsong Jiang, Xiangwei Zhu_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Visual navigation algorithms for quadrotors often exhibit a large variation in performance when transferred across different vehicle platforms and scene geometries, which increases the cost and risk of field deployment. To support systematic early-stage evaluation, we introduce FLYINGTRUST, a high-fidelity, configurable benchmarking framework that measures how platform kinodynamics and scenario structure jointly affect navigation robustness. FLYINGTRUST models vehicle capability with two compact, physically interpretable indicators: maximum thrust-to-weight ratio and axis-wise maximum angular acceleration. The benchmark pairs a diverse scenario library with a heterogeneous set of real and virtual platforms and prescribes a standardized evaluation protocol together with a composite scoring method that balances scenario importance, platform importance and performance stability. We use FLYINGTRUST to compare representative optimization-based and learning-based navigation approaches under identical conditions, performing repeated trials per platform-scenario combination and reporting uncertainty-aware metrics. The results reveal systematic patterns: navigation success depends predictably on platform capability and scene geometry, and different algorithms exhibit distinct preferences and failure modes across the evaluated conditions. These observations highlight the practical necessity of incorporating both platform capability and scenario structure into algorithm design, evaluation, and selection, and they motivate future work on methods that remain robust across diverse platforms and scenarios.

- **[C-NAV: Towards Self-Evolving Continual Object Navigation in Open World](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20685)**  `arXiv:2510.20685`  `cs.RO`  
  _Ming-Ming Yu, Fei Zhu, Wenzhuo Liu, Yirong Yang, Qunbo Wang, Wenjun Wu, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Embodied agents are expected to perform object navigation in dynamic, open-world environments. However, existing approaches typically rely on static trajectories and a fixed set of object categories during training, overlooking the real-world requirement for continual adaptation to evolving scenarios. To facilitate related studies, we introduce the continual object navigation benchmark, which requires agents to acquire navigation skills for new object categories while avoiding catastrophic forgetting of previously learned knowledge. To tackle this challenge, we propose C-Nav, a continual visual navigation framework that integrates two key innovations: (1) A dual-path anti-forgetting mechanism, which comprises feature distillation that aligns multi-modal inputs into a consistent representation space to ensure representation consistency, and feature replay that retains temporal features within the action decoder to ensure policy consistency. (2) An adaptive sampling strategy that selects diverse and informative experiences, thereby reducing redundancy and minimizing memory overhead. Extensive experiments across multiple model architectures demonstrate that C-Nav consistently outperforms existing approaches, achieving superior performance even compared to baselines with full trajectory retention, while significantly lowering memory requirements. The code will be publicly available atthis https URL.

- **[Stop Wasting Your Tokens: Towards Efficient Runtime Multi-Agent Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26585)**  `arXiv:2510.26585`  `cs.MA` `cs.AI`  
  _Fulin Lin, Shaowen Chen, Ruishan Fang, Hongwei Wang, Tao Lin_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  While Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) excel at complex tasks, their growing autonomy with operational complexity often leads to critical inefficiencies, such as excessive token consumption and failures arising from misinformation. Existing methods primarily focus on post-hoc failure attribution, lacking proactive, real-time interventions to enhance robustness and efficiency. To this end, we introduce SupervisorAgent, a lightweight and modular framework for runtime, adaptive supervision that operates without altering the base agent's architecture. Triggered by an LLM-free adaptive filter, SupervisorAgent intervenes at critical junctures to proactively correct errors, guide inefficient behaviors, and purify observations. On the challenging GAIA benchmark, SupervisorAgent reduces the token consumption of the Smolagent framework by an average of 29.45% without compromising its success rate. Extensive experiments across five additional benchmarks (math reasoning, code generation, and question answering) and various SoTA foundation models validate the broad applicability and robustness of our approach. The code is available atthis https URL.

  _Alan Arazi, Eilam Shapira, Roi Reichart_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  While deep learning has achieved remarkable success across many domains, it has historically underperformed on tabular learning tasks, which remain dominated by gradient boosting decision trees. However, recent advancements are paving the way for Tabular Foundation Models, which can leverage real-world knowledge and generalize across diverse datasets, particularly when the data contains free-text. Although incorporating language model capabilities into tabular tasks has been explored, most existing methods utilize static, target-agnostic textual representations, limiting their effectiveness. We introduce TabSTAR: a Tabular Foundation Model with Semantically Target-Aware Representations. TabSTAR is designed to enable transfer learning on tabular data with textual features, with an architecture free of dataset-specific parameters. It unfreezes a pretrained text encoder and takes as input target tokens, which provide the model with the context needed to learn task-specific embeddings. TabSTAR achieves state-of-the-art performance for both medium- and large-sized datasets across known benchmarks of classification tasks with text features, and its pretraining phase exhibits scaling laws in the number of datasets, offering a pathway for further performance improvements.

- **[Metis-SPECS: Decoupling Multimodal Learning via Self-distilled Preference-based Cold Start](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25801)**  `arXiv:2510.25801`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI` `cs.CL` `cs.CV`  
  _Kun Chen, Peng Shi, Haibo Qiu, Zhixiong Zeng, Siqi Yang, Wenji Mao, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reinforcement learning (RL) with verifiable rewards has recently catalyzed a wave of "MLLM-r1" approaches that bring RL to vision language models. Most representative paradigms begin with a cold start, typically employing supervised fine-tuning (SFT), to initialize the policy before RL. However, SFT-based cold start adopts the reasoning paradigm intertwined with task solution and output format, which may induce instruction-style overfitting, weakens out-of-distribution generalization, and ultimately affects downstream RL. We revisit the cold start along two views, its training method and data construction, and introduce the Generalization Factor (GF) coefficient to quantify the generalization capability under different methods. Our empirical study finds that preference-based training methods (e.g. DPO) generalizes better than SFT-based methods in cold start. Motivated by this, we propose SPECS-a Self-distilled, Preference-based Cold Start framework that decouples multimodal learning: (1) generates introspective preference data pairs via self-distillation, avoiding reliance on larger teachers or manual annotation; (2) performs preference-based training to learn, focusing on shallow, transferable surface-form criteria (format, structure, style) rather than memorizing content; and (3) hands off to RL with verifiable rewards for deep reasoning results. Experimental results across multiple multimodal benchmarks show that our decoupling learning framework yields consistent performance gains over strong baselines, improving MEGA-Bench by 4.1% and MathVista by 12.2%. Additional experiments indicate that SPECS contributes to reducing in-distribution "stuckness," improving exploration, stabilizing training, and raising the performance ceiling.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  AIs have made rapid progress on research-oriented benchmarks of knowledge and reasoning, but it remains unclear how these gains translate into economic value and automation. To measure this, we introduce the Remote Labor Index (RLI), a broadly multi-sector benchmark comprising real-world, economically valuable projects designed to evaluate end-to-end agent performance in practical settings. AI agents perform near the floor on RLI, with the highest-performing agent achieving an automation rate of 2.5%. These results help ground discussions of AI automation in empirical evidence, setting a common basis for tracking AI impacts and enabling stakeholders to proactively navigate AI-driven labor automation.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The dynamic nature of information necessitates continuously updating large vision-language models (LVLMs). While recent knowledge editing techniques hint at promising directions, they often focus on editing a single modality (vision or language) in isolation. This prevalent practice neglects the inherent multimodality of LVLMs and the continuous nature of knowledge updates, potentially leading to suboptimal editing outcomes when considering the interplay between modalities and the need for ongoing knowledge refinement. To address these limitations, we propose MemEIC, a novel method for Continual and Compositional Knowledge Editing (CCKE) in LVLMs. MemEIC enables compositional editing of both visual and textual knowledge sequentially. Our approach employs a hybrid external-internal editor featuring a dual external memory for cross-modal evidence retrieval and dual LoRA adapters that facilitate disentangled parameter updates for each modality. A key component is a brain-inspired knowledge connector, activated selectively for compositional reasoning, that integrates information across different modalities. Experiments demonstrate that MemEIC significantly improves performance on complex multimodal questions and effectively preserves prior edits, setting a new benchmark for CCKE in LVLMs.

  Reasoning ability, a core component of human intelligence, continues to pose a significant challenge for Large Language Models (LLMs) in the pursuit of AGI. Although model performance has improved under the training scaling law, significant challenges remain, particularly with respect to training algorithms, such as catastrophic forgetting, and the limited availability of novel training data. As an alternative, test-time scaling enhances reasoning performance by increasing test-time computation without parameter updating. Unlike prior methods in this paradigm focused on token space, we propose leveraging latent space for more effective reasoning and better adherence to the test-time scaling law. We introduce LatentSeek, a novel framework that enhances LLM reasoning through Test-Time Instance-level Adaptation (TTIA) within the model's latent space. Specifically, LatentSeek leverages policy gradient to iteratively update latent representations, guided by self-generated reward signals. LatentSeek is evaluated on a range of reasoning benchmarks, including GSM8K, MATH-500, and AIME2024, across multiple LLM architectures. Results show that LatentSeek consistently outperforms strong baselines, such as Chain-of-Thought prompting and fine-tuning-based methods. Furthermore, our analysis demonstrates that LatentSeek is highly efficient, typically converging within a few iterations for problems of average complexity, while also benefiting from additional iterations, thereby highlighting the potential of test-time scaling in the latent space. These findings position LatentSeek as a lightweight, scalable, and effective solution for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of LLMs.

- **[Aeolus: A Multi-structural Flight Delay Dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26616)**  `arXiv:2510.26616`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Lin Xu, Xinyun Yuan, Yuxuan Liang, Suwan Yin, Yuankai Wu_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce Aeolus, a large-scale Multi-modal Flight Delay Dataset designed to advance research on flight delay prediction and support the development of foundation models for tabular data. Existing datasets in this domain are typically limited to flat tabular structures and fail to capture the spatiotemporal dynamics inherent in delay propagation. Aeolus addresses this limitation by providing three aligned modalities: (i) a tabular dataset with rich operational, meteorological, and airportlevel features for over 50 million flights; (ii) a flight chain module that models delay propagation along sequential flight legs, capturing upstream and downstream dependencies; and (iii) a flight network graph that encodes shared aircraft, crew, and airport resource connections, enabling cross-flight relational reasoning. The dataset is carefully constructed with temporal splits, comprehensive features, and strict leakage prevention to support realistic and reproducible machine learning evaluation. Aeolus supports a broad range of tasks, including regression, classification, temporal structure modeling, and graph learning, serving as a unified benchmark across tabular, sequential, and graph modalities. We release baseline experiments and preprocessing tools to facilitate adoption. Aeolus fills a key gap for both domain-specific modeling and general-purpose structured datathis http URLsource code and data can be accessed atthis https URL

- **[Predicting All-Cause Hospital Readmissions from Medical Claims Data of Hospitalised Patients](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26188)**  `arXiv:2510.26188`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Avinash Kadimisetty, Arun Rajagopalan, Vijendra SK_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reducing preventable hospital readmissions is a national priority for payers, providers, and policymakers seeking to improve health care and lower costs. The rate of readmission is being used as a benchmark to determine the quality of healthcare provided by the hospitals. In thisproject, we have used machine learning techniques like Logistic Regression, Random Forest and Support Vector Machines to analyze the health claims data and identify demographic and medical factors that play a crucial role in predicting all-cause readmissions. As the health claims data is high dimensional, we have used Principal Component Analysis as a dimension reduction technique and used the results for building regression models. We compared and evaluated these models based on the Area Under Curve (AUC) metric. Random Forest model gave the highest performance followed by Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine models. These models can be used to identify the crucial factors causing readmissions and help identify patients to focus on to reduce the chances of readmission, ultimately bringing down the cost and increasing the quality of healthcare provided to the patients.

- **[Bridging the Gap Between Molecule and Textual Descriptions via Substructure-aware Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26157)**  `arXiv:2510.26157`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Hyuntae Park, Yeachan Kim, SangKeun Lee_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Molecule and text representation learning has gained increasing interest due to its potential for enhancing the understanding of chemical information. However, existing models often struggle to capture subtle differences between molecules and their descriptions, as they lack the ability to learn fine-grained alignments between molecular substructures and chemical phrases. To address this limitation, we introduce MolBridge, a novel molecule-text learning framework based on substructure-aware alignments. Specifically, we augment the original molecule-description pairs with additional alignment signals derived from molecular substructures and chemical phrases. To effectively learn from these enriched alignments, MolBridge employs substructure-aware contrastive learning, coupled with a self-refinement mechanism that filters out noisy alignment signals. Experimental results show that MolBridge effectively captures fine-grained correspondences and outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on a wide range of molecular benchmarks, highlighting the significance of substructure-aware alignment in molecule-text learning.

  _Nick Masi, Randall Balestriero_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The dominant paradigm in machine learning is to assess model performance based on average loss across all samples in some test set. This amounts to averaging performance geospatially across the Earth in weather and climate settings, failing to account for the non-uniform distribution of human development and geography. We introduce Stratified Assessments of Forecasts over Earth (SAFE), a package for elucidating the stratified performance of a set of predictions made over Earth. SAFE integrates various data domains to stratify by different attributes associated with geospatial gridpoints: territory (usually country), global subregion, income, and landcover (land or water). This allows us to examine the performance of models for each individual stratum of the different attributes (e.g., the accuracy in every individual country). To demonstrate its importance, we utilize SAFE to benchmark a zoo of state-of-the-art AI-based weather prediction models, finding that they all exhibit disparities in forecasting skill across every attribute. We use this to seed a benchmark of model forecast fairness through stratification at different lead times for various climatic variables. By moving beyond globally-averaged metrics, we for the first time ask: where do models perform best or worst, and which models are most fair? To support further work in this direction, the SAFE package is open source and available atthis https URL

- **[Nirvana: A Specialized Generalist Model With Task-Aware Memory Mechanism](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26083)**  `arXiv:2510.26083`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Yuhua Jiang, Shuang Cheng, Yihao Liu, Ermo Hua, Che Jiang, Weigao Sun, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Specialized Generalist Models (SGMs) aim to preserve broad capabilities while achieving expert-level performance in target domains. However, traditional LLM structures including Transformer, Linear Attention, and hybrid models do not employ specialized memory mechanism guided by task information. In this paper, we present Nirvana, an SGM with specialized memory mechanism, linear time complexity, and test-time task information extraction. Besides, we propose the Task-Aware Memory Trigger ($\textit{Trigger}$) that flexibly adjusts memory mechanism based on the current task's requirements. In Trigger, each incoming sample is treated as a self-supervised fine-tuning task, enabling Nirvana to adapt its task-related parameters on the fly to domain shifts. We also design the Specialized Memory Updater ($\textit{Updater}$) that dynamically memorizes the context guided by Trigger. We conduct experiments on both general language tasks and specialized medical tasks. On a variety of natural language modeling benchmarks, Nirvana achieves competitive or superior results compared to the existing LLM structures. To prove the effectiveness of Trigger on specialized tasks, we test Nirvana's performance on a challenging medical task, i.e., Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). We post-train frozen Nirvana backbone with lightweight codecs on paired electromagnetic signals and MRI images. Despite the frozen Nirvana backbone, Trigger guides the model to adapt to the MRI domain with the change of task-related parameters. Nirvana achieves higher-quality MRI reconstruction compared to conventional MRI models as well as the models with traditional LLMs' backbone, and can also generate accurate preliminary clinical reports accordingly.

- **[Incentivizing LLMs to Self-Verify Their Answers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01369)**  `arXiv:2506.01369`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable progress in complex reasoning tasks through both post-training and test-time scaling laws. While prevalent test-time scaling approaches are often realized by using external reward models to guide the model generation process, we find that only marginal gains can be acquired when scaling a model post-trained on specific reasoning tasks. We identify that the limited improvement stems from distribution discrepancies between the specific post-trained generator and the general reward model. To address this, we propose a framework that incentivizes LLMs to self-verify their own answers. By unifying answer generation and verification within a single reinforcement learning (RL) process, we train models that can effectively assess the correctness of their own solutions. The trained model can further scale its performance at inference time by verifying its generations, without the need for external verifiers. We train our self-verification models based on Qwen2.5-Math-7B and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, demonstrating their capabilities across varying reasoning context lengths. Experiments on multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that our models can not only improve post-training performance but also enable effective test-time scaling.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Anomaly detection is a fundamental task for time series analytics with important implications for the downstream performance of many applications. Despite increasing academic interest and the large number of methods proposed in the literature, recent benchmarks and evaluation studies demonstrated that no overall best anomaly detection methods exist when applied to very heterogeneous time series datasets. Therefore, the only scalable and viable solution to solve anomaly detection over very different time series collected from diverse domains is to propose a model selection method that will select, based on time series characteristics, the best anomaly detection methods to run. Existing AutoML solutions are, unfortunately, not directly applicable to time series anomaly detection, and no evaluation of time series-based approaches for model selection exists. Towards that direction, this paper studies the performance of time series classification methods used as model selection for anomaly detection. In total, we evaluate 234 model configurations derived from 16 base classifiers across more than 1980 time series, and we propose the first extensive experimental evaluation of time series classification as model selection for anomaly detection. Our results demonstrate that model selection methods outperform every single anomaly detection method while being in the same order of magnitude regarding execution time. This evaluation is the first step to demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of time series classification algorithms for anomaly detection, and represents a strong baseline that can then be used to guide the model selection step in general AutoML pipelines.

- **[A Three-Stage Bayesian Transfer Learning Framework to Improve Predictions in Data-Scarce Domains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26541)**  `arXiv:2510.26541`  `cs.LG`  
  _Aidan Furlong, Robert Salko, Xingang Zhao, Xu Wu_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The use of ML in engineering has grown steadily to support a wide array of applications. Among these methods, deep neural networks have been widely adopted due to their performance and accessibility, but they require large, high-quality datasets. Experimental data are often sparse, noisy, or insufficient to build resilient data-driven models. Transfer learning, which leverages relevant data-abundant source domains to assist learning in data-scarce target domains, has shown efficacy. Parameter transfer, where pretrained weights are reused, is common but degrades under large domain shifts. Domain-adversarial neural networks (DANNs) help address this issue by learning domain-invariant representations, thereby improving transfer under greater domain shifts in a semi-supervised setting. However, DANNs can be unstable during training and lack a native means for uncertainty quantification. This study introduces a fully-supervised three-stage framework, the staged Bayesian domain-adversarial neural network (staged B-DANN), that combines parameter transfer and shared latent space adaptation. In Stage 1, a deterministic feature extractor is trained on the source domain. This feature extractor is then adversarially refined using a DANN in Stage 2. In Stage 3, a Bayesian neural network is built on the adapted feature extractor for fine-tuning on the target domain to handle conditional shifts and yield calibrated uncertainty estimates. This staged B-DANN approach was first validated on a synthetic benchmark, where it was shown to significantly outperform standard transfer techniques. It was then applied to the task of predicting critical heat flux in rectangular channels, leveraging data from tube experiments as the source domain. The results of this study show that the staged B-DANN method can improve predictive accuracy and generalization, potentially assisting other domains in nuclear engineering.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Existing Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) methods, such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), have achieved remarkable progress in improving the reasoning capabilities of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs). However, they exhibit limited exploration due to reliance on on-policy rollouts where confined to the current policy's distribution, resulting in narrow trajectory diversity. Recent approaches attempt to expand policy coverage by incorporating trajectories generated from stronger expert models, yet this reliance increases computational cost and such advaned models are often inaccessible. To address these issues, we propose In-Context Steered Policy Optimization (ICPO), a unified framework that leverages the inherent in-context learning capability of LRMs to provide expert guidance using existing datasets. ICPO introduces Mixed-Policy GRPO with Implicit Expert Forcing, which expands exploration beyond the current policy distribution without requiring advanced LRM trajectories. To further stabilize optimization, ICPO integrates Expert Region Reject Sampling to filter unreliable off-policy trajectories and Annealed Expert-Bonus Reward Shaping to balance early expert guidance with later autonomous improvement. Results demonstrate that ICPO consistently enhances reinforcement learning performance and training stability on mathematical reasoning benchmarks, revealing a scalable and effective RLVR paradigm for LRMs.

  Continuous electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring via wearables offers significant potential for early cardiovascular disease (CVD) detection. However, deploying deep learning models for automated analysis in resource-constrained environments faces reliability challenges due to inevitable Out-of-Distribution (OOD) data. OOD inputs, such as unseen pathologies or noisecorrupted signals, often cause erroneous, high-confidence predictions by standard classifiers, compromising patient safety. Existing OOD detection methods either neglect computational constraints or address noise and unseen classes separately. This paper explores Unsupervised Anomaly Detection (UAD) as an independent, upstream filtering mechanism to improve robustness. We benchmark six UAD approaches, including Deep SVDD, reconstruction-based models, Masked Anomaly Detection, normalizing flows, and diffusion models, optimized via Neural Architecture Search (NAS) under strict resource constraints (at most 512k parameters). Evaluation on PTB-XL and BUT QDB datasets assessed detection of OOD CVD classes and signals unsuitable for analysis due to noise. Results show Deep SVDD consistently achieves the best trade-off between detection and efficiency. In a realistic deployment simulation, integrating the optimized Deep SVDD filter with a diagnostic classifier improved accuracy by up to 21 percentage points over a classifier-only baseline. This study demonstrates that optimized UAD filters can safeguard automated ECG analysis, enabling safer, more reliable continuous cardiovascular monitoring on wearables.

  Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a key paradigm for collaborative model training across multiple clients without sharing raw data, enabling privacy-preserving applications in areas such as radiology and pathology. However, works on collaborative training across clients with fundamentally different neural architectures and non-identically distributed datasets remain scarce. Existing FL frameworks face several limitations. Despite claiming to support architectural heterogeneity, most recent FL methods only tolerate variants within a single model family (e.g., shallower, deeper, or wider CNNs), still presuming a shared global architecture and failing to accommodate federations where clients deploy fundamentally different network types (e.g., CNNs, GNNs, MLPs). Moreover, existing approaches often address only statistical heterogeneity while overlooking the domain-fracture problem, where each client's data distribution differs markedly from that faced at testing time, undermining model generalizability. When clients use different architectures, have non-identically distributed data, and encounter distinct test domains, current methods perform poorly. To address these challenges, we propose UnifiedFL, a dynamic federated learning framework that represents heterogeneous local networks as nodes and edges in a directed model graph optimized by a shared graph neural network (GNN). UnifiedFL introduces (i) a common GNN to parameterize all architectures, (ii) distance-driven clustering via Euclidean distances between clients' parameters, and (iii) a two-tier aggregation policy balancing convergence and diversity. Experiments on MedMNIST classification and hippocampus segmentation benchmarks demonstrate UnifiedFL's superior performance. Code and data:this https URL

  Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has significantly boosted the reasoning capability of large language models (LLMs) recently. However, existing RLVR approaches merely train LLMs based on their own generated responses and are constrained by the initial capability of LLMs, thus prone to exploration stagnation, in which LLMs fail to solve more training problems and cannot further learn from the training data. Some work tries to address this by leveraging off-policy solutions to training problems but requires external guidance from experts which suffers from limited availability. In this work, we propose LTE (Learning to reason from Trial and Error), an approach hinting LLMs with their previously self-generated incorrect answers and problem of overlong responses, which does not require any external expert guidance. Experiments validate the effectiveness of LTE, which outperforms the normal group relative policy optimization (GRPO) by 6.38 in Pass@1 and 9.00 in Pass@k on average across six mathematics benchmarks for Qwen3-4B-Base. Further analysis confirms that LTE successfully mitigates the problem of exploration stagnation and enhances both exploitation and exploration during training.

  We propose a graph-topological approach to active learning that directly targets the core challenge of exploration versus exploitation under scarce label budgets. To guide exploration, we introduce a coreset construction algorithm based on Balanced Forman Curvature (BFC), which selects representative initial labels that reflect the graph's cluster structure. This method includes a data-driven stopping criterion that signals when the graph has been sufficiently explored. We further use BFC to dynamically trigger the shift from exploration to exploitation within active learning routines, replacing hand-tuned heuristics. To improve exploitation, we introduce a localized graph rewiring strategy that efficiently incorporates multiscale information around labeled nodes, enhancing label propagation while preserving sparsity. Experiments on benchmark classification tasks show that our methods consistently outperform existing graph-based semi-supervised baselines at low label rates.

  Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models enable robots to understand and perform complex tasks from multimodal input. Although recent work explores using reinforcement learning (RL) to automate the laborious data collection process in scaling supervised fine-tuning (SFT), applying large-scale RL to flow-based VLAs (e.g., $\pi_0$, $\pi_{0.5}$) remains challenging due to intractable action log-likelihoods from iterative denoising.We address this challenge with $\pi_{\text{RL}}$, an open-source framework for training flow-based VLAs in parallel simulation. $\pi_{\text{RL}}$ implements two RL algorithms: (1) {Flow-Noise} models the denoising process as a discrete-time MDP with a learnable noise network for exact log-likelihood computation. (2) {Flow-SDE} integrates denoising with agent-environment interaction, formulating a two-layer MDP that employs ODE-to-SDE conversion for efficient RL exploration.We evaluate $\pi_{\text{RL}}$ on LIBERO and ManiSkill benchmarks. On LIBERO, $\pi_{\text{RL}}$ boosts few-shot SFT models $\pi_0$ and $\pi_{0.5}$ from 57.6% to 97.6% and from 77.1% to 98.3%, respectively. In ManiSkill, we train $\pi_{\text{RL}}$ in 320 parallel environments, improving $\pi_0$ from 41.6% to 85.7% and $\pi_{0.5}$ from 40.0% to 84.8% across 4352 pick-and-place tasks, demonstrating scalable multitask RL under heterogeneous simulation.Overall, $\pi_{\text{RL}}$ achieves significant performance gains and stronger generalization over SFT-models, validating the effectiveness of online RL for flow-based VLAs.

  Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) are increasingly capable of answering medical questions that require joint reasoning over images and text, yet training general medical VQA systems is impeded by the lack of large, openly usable, high-quality corpora. We present MedVLSynther, a rubric-guided generator-verifier framework that synthesizes high-quality multiple-choice VQA items directly from open biomedical literature by conditioning on figures, captions, and in-text references. The generator produces self-contained stems and parallel, mutually exclusive options under a machine-checkable JSON schema; a multi-stage verifier enforces essential gates (self-containment, single correct answer, clinical validity, image-text consistency), awards fine-grained positive points, and penalizes common failure modes before acceptance. Applying this pipeline to PubMed Central yields MedSynVQA: 13,087 audited questions over 14,803 images spanning 13 imaging modalities and 28 anatomical regions. Training open-weight LMMs with reinforcement learning using verifiable rewards improves accuracy across six medical VQA benchmarks, achieving averages of 55.85 (3B) and 58.15 (7B), with up to 77.57 on VQA-RAD and 67.76 on PathVQA, outperforming strong medical LMMs. A Ablations verify that both generation and verification are necessary and that more verified data consistently helps, and a targeted contamination analysis detects no leakage from evaluation suites. By operating entirely on open literature and open-weight models, MedVLSynther offers an auditable, reproducible, and privacy-preserving path to scalable medical VQA training data.

  The integration of the Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence offers significant opportunities to enhance our ability to monitor and address ecological changes. As environmental challenges become increasingly pressing, the need for effective remote monitoring solutions is more critical than ever. A major challenge in designing IoT applications for environmental monitoring - particularly those involving image data - is to create energy-efficient IoT devices capable of long-term operation in remote areas with limited power availability. Advancements in the field of Tiny Machine Learning allow the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on resource-constrained, battery-operated microcontrollers. Since data transfer is energy-intensive, performing inference directly on microcontrollers to reduce the message size can extend the operational lifespan of IoT nodes. This work evaluates the use of common Low Power Wide Area Networks and compressed CNNs trained on domain specific datasets on an ESP32-S3. Our experiments demonstrate, among other things, that executing CNN inference on-device and transmitting only the results reduces the overall energy consumption by a factor of up to five compared to sending raw image data. These findings advocate the development of IoT applications with reduced carbon footprint and capable of operating autonomously in environmental monitoring scenarios by incorporating EmbeddedML.

  Non-invasive brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are beginning to benefit from large, public benchmarks. However, current benchmarks target relatively simple, foundational tasks like Speech Detection and Phoneme Classification, while application-ready results on tasks like Brain-to-Text remain elusive. We propose Keyword Spotting (KWS) as a practically applicable, privacy-aware intermediate task. Using the deep 52-hour, within-subject LibriBrain corpus, we provide standardized train/validation/test splits for reproducible benchmarking, and adopt an evaluation protocol tailored to extreme class imbalance. Concretely, we use area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) as a robust evaluation metric, complemented by false alarms per hour (FA/h) at fixed recall to capture user-facing trade-offs. To simplify deployment and further experimentation within the research community, we are releasing an updated version of the pnpl library with word-level dataloaders and Colab-ready tutorials. As an initial reference model, we present a compact 1-D Conv/ResNet baseline with focal loss and top-k pooling that is trainable on a single consumer-class GPU. The reference model achieves approximately 13x the permutation baseline AUPRC on held-out sessions, demonstrating the viability of the task. Exploratory analyses reveal: (i) predictable within-subject scaling - performance improves log-linearly with more training hours - and (ii) the existence of word-level factors (frequency and duration) that systematically modulate detectability.

  Multi-Task Learning (MTL) in Neural Combinatorial Optimization (NCO) is a promising approach to train a unified model capable of solving multiple Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) variants. However, existing Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based multi-task methods can only train light decoder models on small-scale problems, exhibiting limited generalization ability when solving large-scale problems. To overcome this limitation, this work introduces a novel multi-task learning method driven by knowledge distillation (MTL-KD), which enables the efficient training of heavy decoder models with strong generalization ability. The proposed MTL-KD method transfers policy knowledge from multiple distinct RL-based single-task models to a single heavy decoder model, facilitating label-free training and effectively improving the model's generalization ability across diverse tasks. In addition, we introduce a flexible inference strategy termed Random Reordering Re-Construction (R3C), which is specifically adapted for diverse VRP tasks and further boosts the performance of the multi-task model. Experimental results on 6 seen and 10 unseen VRP variants with up to 1000 nodes indicate that our proposed method consistently achieves superior performance on both uniform and real-world benchmarks, demonstrating robust generalization abilities.

  A key challenge in offline multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is achieving effective many-agent multi-step coordination in complex environments. In this work, we propose Oryx, a novel algorithm for offline cooperative MARL to directly address this challenge. Oryx adapts the recently proposed retention-based architecture Sable and combines it with a sequential form of implicit constraint Q-learning (ICQ), to develop a novel offline autoregressive policy update scheme. This allows Oryx to solve complex coordination challenges while maintaining temporal coherence over long trajectories. We evaluate Oryx across a diverse set of benchmarks from prior works -- SMAC, RWARE, and Multi-Agent MuJoCo -- covering tasks of both discrete and continuous control, varying in scale and difficulty. Oryx achieves state-of-the-art performance on more than 80% of the 65 tested datasets, outperforming prior offline MARL methods and demonstrating robust generalisation across domains with many agents and long horizons. Finally, we introduce new datasets to push the limits of many-agent coordination in offline MARL, and demonstrate Oryx's superior ability to scale effectively in such settings.

  Neurosymbolic (NeSy) predictors combine neural perception with symbolic reasoning to solve tasks like visual reasoning. However, standard NeSy predictors assume conditional independence between the symbols they extract, thus limiting their ability to model interactions and uncertainty - often leading to overconfident predictions and poor out-of-distribution generalisation. To overcome the limitations of the independence assumption, we introduce neurosymbolic diffusion models (NeSyDMs), a new class of NeSy predictors that use discrete diffusion to model dependencies between symbols. Our approach reuses the independence assumption from NeSy predictors at each step of the diffusion process, enabling scalable learning while capturing symbol dependencies and uncertainty quantification. Across both synthetic and real-world benchmarks - including high-dimensional visual path planning and rule-based autonomous driving - NeSyDMs achieve state-of-the-art accuracy among NeSy predictors and demonstrate strong calibration.

  Model trees provide an appealing way to perform interpretable machine learning for both classification and regression problems. In contrast to ``classic'' decision trees with constant values in their leaves, model trees can use linear combinations of predictor variables in their leaf nodes to form predictions, which can help achieve higher accuracy and smaller trees. Typical algorithms for learning model trees from training data work in a greedy fashion, growing the tree in a top-down manner by recursively splitting the data into smaller and smaller subsets. Crucially, the selected splits are only locally optimal, potentially rendering the tree overly complex and less accurate than a tree whose structure is globally optimal for the training data. In this paper, we empirically investigate the effect of constructing globally optimal model trees for classification and regression with linear support vector machines at the leaf nodes. To this end, we present mixed-integer linear programming formulations to learn optimal trees, compute such trees for a large collection of benchmark data sets, and compare their performance against greedily grown model trees in terms of interpretability and accuracy. We also compare to classic optimal and greedily grown decision trees, random forests, and support vector machines. Our results show that optimal model trees can achieve competitive accuracy with very small trees. We also investigate the effect on the accuracy of replacing axis-parallel splits with multivariate ones, foregoing interpretability while potentially obtaining greater accuracy.

  Graphs model latent variable relationships in many real-world systems, and Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) are widely used to learn such structures for downstream tasks. While edge-based MPNNs effectively capture local interactions, their expressive power is theoretically bounded, limiting the discovery of higher-order relationships. We introduce the Higher-Order Graph Attention (HoGA) module, which constructs a k-order attention matrix by sampling subgraphs to maximize diversity among feature vectors. Unlike existing higher-order attention methods that greedily resample similar k-order relationships, HoGA targets diverse modalities in higher-order topology, reducing redundancy and expanding the range of captured substructures. Applied to two single-hop attention models, HoGA achieves at least a 5% accuracy gain on all benchmark node classification datasets and outperforms recent baselines on six of eight datasets.

  Neurosymbolic learning enables the integration of symbolic reasoning with deep learning but faces significant challenges in scaling to complex symbolic programs, large datasets, or both. We introduce DOLPHIN, a framework that tackles these challenges by supporting neurosymbolic programs in Python, executing complex symbolic reasoning on the CPU while vectorizing probabilistic computations and gradient propagation on the GPU. Across 13 benchmarks spanning tasks over text, image, and video data, with symbolic reasoning features like recursion and black-box functions, DOLPHIN converges to state-of-the-art accuracies on the more complex benchmarks while existing frameworks such as Scallop, ISED, and IndeCateR+ fail to converge within the time limit. On simpler benchmarks, DOLPHIN matches their performance, while achieving these results 1.71x to 62x faster than the baselines. Overall, DOLPHIN advances the scalability of neurosymbolic frameworks, achieving state-of-the-art efficiency and convergence on difficult benchmarks where existing frameworks struggle.

  This work introduces SteerVLM, a lightweight steering module designed to guide Vision-Language Models (VLMs) towards outputs that better adhere to desired instructions. Our approach learns from the latent embeddings of paired prompts encoding target and converse behaviors to dynamically adjust activations connecting the language modality with image context. This allows for fine-grained, inference-time control over complex output semantics without modifying model weights while preserving performance on off-target tasks. Our steering module requires learning parameters equal to 0.14% of the original VLM's size. Our steering module gains model control through dimension-wise activation modulation and adaptive steering across layers without requiring pre-extracted static vectors or manual tuning of intervention points. Furthermore, we introduce VNIA (Visual Narrative Intent Alignment), a multimodal dataset specifically created to facilitate the development and evaluation of VLM steering techniques. Our method outperforms existing intervention techniques on steering and hallucination mitigation benchmarks for VLMs and proposes a robust solution for multimodal model control through activation engineering.

  Object-context shortcuts remain a persistent challenge in vision-language models, undermining zero-shot reliability when test-time scenes differ from familiar training co-occurrences. We recast this issue as a causal inference problem and ask: Would the prediction remain if the object appeared in a different environment? To answer this at inference time, we estimate object and background expectations within CLIP's representation space, and synthesize counterfactual embeddings by recombining object features with diverse alternative contexts sampled from external datasets, batch neighbors, or text-derived descriptions. By estimating the Total Direct Effect and simulating intervention, we further subtract background-only activation, preserving beneficial object-context interactions while mitigating hallucinated scores. Without retraining or prompt design, our method substantially improves both worst-group and average accuracy on context-sensitive benchmarks, establishing a new zero-shot state of the art. Beyond performance, our framework provides a lightweight representation-level counterfactual approach, offering a practical causal avenue for debiased and reliable multimodal reasoning.

  Current text-to-image generative models are trained on large uncurated datasets to enable diverse generation capabilities. However, this does not align well with user preferences. Recently, reward models have been specifically designed to perform post-hoc selection of generated images and align them to a reward, typically user preference. This discarding of informative data together with the optimizing for a single reward tend to harm diversity, semantic fidelity and efficiency. Instead of this post-processing, we propose to condition the model on multiple reward models during training to let the model learn user preferences directly. We show that this not only dramatically improves the visual quality of the generated images but it also significantly speeds up the training. Our proposed method, called MIRO, achieves state-of-the-art performances on the GenEval compositional benchmark and user-preference scores (PickAScore, ImageReward, HPSv2).

  True intelligence hinges on the ability to uncover and leverage hidden causal relations. Despite significant progress in AI and computer vision (CV), there remains a lack of benchmarks for assessing models' abilities to infer latent causality from complex visual data. In this paper, we introduce \textsc{\textbf{Causal3D}}, a novel and comprehensive benchmark that integrates structured data (tables) with corresponding visual representations (images) to evaluate causal reasoning. Designed within a systematic framework, Causal3D comprises 19 3D-scene datasets capturing diverse causal relations, views, and backgrounds, enabling evaluations across scenes of varying complexity. We assess multiple state-of-the-art methods, including classical causal discovery, causal representation learning, and large/vision-language models (LLMs/VLMs). Our experiments show that as causal structures grow more complex without prior knowledge, performance declines significantly, highlighting the challenges even advanced methods face in complex causal scenarios. Causal3D serves as a vital resource for advancing causal reasoning in CV and fostering trustworthy AI in critical domains.

  Modern vision-language models (VLMs) excel at many multimodal tasks, yet their grasp of temporal information in video remains weak and, crucially, under-evaluated. We probe this gap with a deceptively simple but revealing challenge: judging the arrow of time (AoT)-whether a short clip is played forward or backward. We introduce AoT-PsyPhyBENCH, a psychophysically validated benchmark that tests whether VLMs can infer temporal direction in natural videos using the same stimuli and behavioral baselines established for humans. Our comprehensive evaluation of open-weight and proprietary, reasoning and non-reasoning VLMs reveals that most models perform near chance, and even the best lag far behind human accuracy on physically irreversible processes (e.g., free fall, diffusion/explosion) and causal manual actions (division/addition) that humans recognize almost instantly. These results highlight a fundamental gap in current multimodal systems: while they capture rich visual-semantic correlations, they lack the inductive biases required for temporal continuity and causal understanding. We release the code and data for AoT-PsyPhyBENCH to encourage further progress in the physical and temporal reasoning capabilities of VLMs.

  Humans can naturally identify, reason about, and explain anomalies in their environment. In computer vision, this long-standing challenge remains limited to industrial defects or unrealistic, synthetically generated anomalies, failing to capture the richness and unpredictability of real-world anomalies. In this work, we introduce CAVE, the first benchmark of real-world visual anomalies. CAVE supports three open-ended tasks: anomaly description, explanation, and justification; with fine-grained annotations for visual grounding and categorizing anomalies based on their visual manifestations, their complexity, severity, and commonness. These annotations draw inspiration from cognitive science research on how humans identify and resolve anomalies, providing a comprehensive framework for evaluating Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in detecting and understanding anomalies. We show that state-of-the-art VLMs struggle with visual anomaly perception and commonsense reasoning, even with advanced prompting strategies. By offering a realistic and cognitively grounded benchmark, CAVE serves as a valuable resource for advancing research in anomaly detection and commonsense reasoning in VLMs.

  Dense Video Object Captioning (DVOC) is the task of jointly detecting, tracking, and captioning object trajectories in a video, requiring the ability to understand spatio-temporal details and describe them in natural language. Due to the complexity of the task and the high cost associated with manual annotation, previous approaches resort to disjoint training strategies, potentially leading to suboptimal performance. To circumvent this issue, we propose to generate captions about spatio-temporally localized entities leveraging a state-of-the-art VLM. By extending the LVIS and LV-VIS datasets with our synthetic captions (LVISCap and LV-VISCap), we train MaskCaptioner, an end-to-end model capable of jointly detecting, segmenting, tracking and captioning object trajectories. Moreover, with pretraining on LVISCap and LV-VISCap, MaskCaptioner achieves state-of-the-art DVOC results on three existing benchmarks, VidSTG, VLN and BenSMOT.

  Predicting accurate future trajectories of pedestrians is essential for autonomous systems but remains a challenging task due to the need for adaptability in different environments and domains. A common approach involves collecting scenario-specific data and performing fine-tuning via backpropagation. However, the need to fine-tune for each new scenario is often impractical for deployment on edge devices. To address this challenge, we introduce \paper, an In-Context Learning (ICL) framework for pedestrian trajectory prediction that enables adaptation without fine-tuning on the scenario-specific data at inference time without requiring weight updates. We propose a spatio-temporal similarity-based example selection (STES) method that selects relevant examples from previously observed trajectories within the same scene by identifying similar motion patterns at corresponding locations. To further refine this selection, we introduce prediction-guided example selection (PG-ES), which selects examples based on both the past trajectory and the predicted future trajectory, rather than relying solely on the past trajectory. This approach allows the model to account for long-term dynamics when selecting examples. Finally, instead of relying on small real-world datasets with limited scenario diversity, we train our model on a large-scale synthetic dataset to enhance its prediction ability by leveraging in-context examples. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TrajICL achieves remarkable adaptation across both in-domain and cross-domain scenarios, outperforming even fine-tuned approaches across multiple public benchmarks.

To address this challenge, we introduce the first benchmark and metric suite for poster generation, which pairs recent conference papers with author-designed posters and evaluates outputs on (i)Visual Quality-semantic alignment with human posters, (ii)Textual Coherence-language fluency, (iii)Holistic Assessment-six fine-grained aesthetic and informational criteria scored by a VLM-as-judge, and notably (iv)PaperQuiz-the poster's ability to convey core paper content as measured by VLMs answering generated quizzes. Building on this benchmark, we propose PosterAgent, a top-down, visual-in-the-loop multi-agent pipeline: the (a)Parser distills the paper into a structured asset library; the (b)Planner aligns text-visual pairs into a binary-tree layout that preserves reading order and spatial balance; and the (c)Painter-Commenter loop refines each panel by executing rendering code and using VLM feedback to eliminate overflow and ensure alignment. In our comprehensive evaluation, we find that GPT-4o outputs-though visually appealing at first glance-often exhibit noisy text and poor PaperQuiz scores, and we find that reader engagement is the primary aesthetic bottleneck, as human-designed posters rely largely on visual semantics to convey meaning. Our fully open-source variants (e.g. based on the Qwen-2.5 series) outperform existing 4o-driven multi-agent systems across nearly all metrics, while using 87% fewer tokens. It transforms a 22-page paper into a finalized yet editable .pptx poster - all for just $0.005. These findings chart clear directions for the next generation of fully automated poster-generation models. The code and datasets are available atthis https URL.

  Recent video generation models can produce high-fidelity, temporally coherent videos, indicating that they may encode substantial world knowledge. Beyond realistic synthesis, they also exhibit emerging behaviors indicative of visual perception, modeling, and manipulation. Yet, an important question still remains: Are video models ready to serve as zero-shot reasoners in challenging visual reasoning scenarios? In this work, we conduct an empirical study to comprehensively investigate this question, focusing on the leading and popular Veo-3. We evaluate its reasoning behavior across 12 dimensions, including spatial, geometric, physical, temporal, and embodied logic, systematically characterizing both its strengths and failure modes. To standardize this study, we curate the evaluation data into MME-CoF, a compact benchmark that enables in-depth and thorough assessment of Chain-of-Frame (CoF) reasoning. Our findings reveal that while current video models demonstrate promising reasoning patterns on short-horizon spatial coherence, fine-grained grounding, and locally consistent dynamics, they remain limited in long-horizon causal reasoning, strict geometric constraints, and abstract logic. Overall, they are not yet reliable as standalone zero-shot reasoners, but exhibit encouraging signs as complementary visual engines alongside dedicated reasoning models. Project page:this https URL

  Recent advances in text-to-video (T2V) generation highlight the critical role of high-quality video-text pairs in training models capable of producing coherent and instruction-aligned videos. However, strategies for optimizing video captions specifically for T2V training remain underexplored. In this paper, we introduce VC4VG (Video Captioning for Video Generation), a comprehensive caption optimization framework tailored to the needs of T2V models. We begin by analyzing caption content from a T2V perspective, decomposing the essential elements required for video reconstruction into multiple dimensions, and proposing a principled caption design methodology. To support evaluation, we construct VC4VG-Bench, a new benchmark featuring fine-grained, multi-dimensional, and necessity-graded metrics aligned with T2V-specific requirements. Extensive T2V fine-tuning experiments demonstrate a strong correlation between improved caption quality and video generation performance, validating the effectiveness of our approach. We release all benchmark tools and code atthis https URLto support further research.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large foundation models face challenges in acquiring transferable, structured thinking abilities, especially when supervised with rigid templates or crowd-annotated instruction datasets. Unlike prior approaches, we focus on a thinking-centric data synthesis paradigm that enables models to evolve through self-generated, cognitively guided data. We propose MindGYM, a structured and scalable framework for question synthesis, composed of: (1) Cognitive Thinking Process Injection, which infuses high-level reasoning objectives to shape the model's synthesis behavior; (2) Seed Single-Hop Question Synthesis, generating atomic questions from diverse semantic types to encourage broader thinking; and (3) Challenging Multi-Hop QA Synthesis, composing more complex multi-hop questions based on QA seeds for deeper reasoning. Detailed analysis shows that synthetic data generated by our method achieves 16.7% higher average quality and 67.91% lower quality variance compared to baseline sources, highlighting that both high-quality and self-contained data are essential for effective, thinking-oriented fine-tuning. MindGYM improves performance on six reasoning benchmarks, achieving gains of up to 16% on MathVision using only 400 data samples, and generalizable improvements across different model sizes and architectures. MindGYM underscores the viability of self-challenging mechanisms in refining large model capabilities while minimizing human intervention and resource demands. Code and data are released to promote data-centric research into self-evolving foundation models driven by their internal reasoning capabilities.

  Recently text-to-video generation has made impressive progress in producing short, high-quality clips, but evaluating long-form outputs remains a major challenge especially when processing complex prompts. Existing benchmarks mostly rely on simplified prompts and focus on low-level metrics, overlooking fine-grained alignment with prompts and abstract dimensions such as narrative coherence and thematic expression. To address these gaps, we propose LoCoT2V-Bench, a benchmark specifically designed for long video generation (LVG) under complex input conditions. Based on various real-world videos, LoCoT2V-Bench introduces a suite of realistic and complex prompts incorporating elements like scene transitions and event dynamics. Moreover, it constructs a multi-dimensional evaluation framework that includes our newly proposed metrics such as event-level alignment, fine-grained temporal consistency, content clarity, and the Human Expectation Realization Degree (HERD) that focuses on more abstract attributes like narrative flow, emotional response, and character development. Using this framework, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of nine representative LVG models, finding that while current methods perform well on basic visual and temporal aspects, they struggle with inter-event consistency, fine-grained alignment, and high-level thematic adherence, etc. Overall, LoCoT2V-Bench provides a comprehensive and reliable platform for evaluating long-form complex text-to-video generation and highlights critical directions for future method improvement.

  _Mingyu Sung, Seungjae Ham, Kangwoo Kim, Yeokyoung Yoon, Sangseok Yun, Il-Min Kim, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Image super-resolution(SR) is fundamental to many vision system-from surveillance and autonomy to document analysis and retail analytics-because recovering high-frequency details, especially scene-text, enables reliable downstream perception. Scene-text, i.e., text embedded in natural images such as signs, product labels, and storefronts, often carries the most actionable information; when characters are blurred or hallucinated, optical character recognition(OCR) and subsequent decisions fail even if the rest of the image appears sharp. Yet previous SR research has often been tuned to distortion (PSNR/SSIM) or learned perceptual metrics (LIPIS, MANIQA, CLIP-IQA, MUSIQ) that are largely insensitive to character-level errors. Furthermore, studies that do address text SR often focus on simplified benchmarks with isolated characters, overlooking the challenges of text within complex natural scenes. As a result, scene-text is effectively treated as generic texture. For SR to be effective in practical deployments, it is therefore essential to explicitly optimize for both text legibility and perceptual quality. We present GLYPH-SR, a vision-language-guided diffusion framework that aims to achieve both objectives jointly. GLYPH-SR utilizes a Text-SR Fusion ControlNet(TS-ControlNet) guided by OCR data, and a ping-pong scheduler that alternates between text- and scene-centric guidance. To enable targeted text restoration, we train these components on a synthetic corpus while keeping the main SR branch frozen. Across SVT, SCUT-CTW1500, and CUTE80 at x4, and x8, GLYPH-SR improves OCR F1 by up to +15.18 percentage points over diffusion/GAN baseline (SVT x8, OpenOCR) while maintaining competitive MANIQA, CLIP-IQA, and MUSIQ. GLYPH-SR is designed to satisfy both objectives simultaneously-high readability and high visual realism-delivering SR that looks right and reds right.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision-based end-to-end (E2E) driving has garnered significant interest in the research community due to its scalability and synergy with multimodal large language models (MLLMs). However, current E2E driving benchmarks primarily feature nominal scenarios, failing to adequately test the true potential of these systems. Furthermore, existing open-loop evaluation metrics often fall short in capturing the multi-modal nature of driving or effectively evaluating performance in long-tail scenarios. To address these gaps, we introduce the Waymo Open Dataset for End-to-End Driving (WOD-E2E). WOD-E2E contains 4,021 driving segments (approximately 12 hours), specifically curated for challenging long-tail scenarios that that are rare in daily life with an occurring frequency of less than 0.03%. Concretely, each segment in WOD-E2E includes the high-level routing information, ego states, and 360-degree camera views from 8 surrounding cameras. To evaluate the E2E driving performance on these long-tail situations, we propose a novel open-loop evaluation metric: Rater Feedback Score (RFS). Unlike conventional metrics that measure the distance between predicted way points and the logs, RFS measures how closely the predicted trajectory matches rater-annotated trajectory preference labels. We have released rater preference labels for all WOD-E2E validation set segments, while the held out test set labels have been used for the 2025 WOD-E2E Challenge. Through our work, we aim to foster state of the art research into generalizable, robust, and safe end-to-end autonomous driving agents capable of handling complex real-world situations.

  Can Video-LLMs achieve consistent temporal understanding when videos capture the same event from different viewpoints? To study this, we introduce EgoExo-Con (Consistency), a benchmark of comprehensively synchronized egocentric and exocentric video pairs with human-refined queries in natural language. EgoExo-Con emphasizes two temporal understanding tasks: Temporal Verification and Temporal Grounding. It evaluates not only correctness but consistency across viewpoints. Our analysis reveals two critical limitations of existing Video-LLMs: (1) models often fail to maintain consistency, with results far worse than their single-view performances. (2) When naively finetuned with synchronized videos of both viewpoints, the models show improved consistency but often underperform those trained on a single view. For improvements, we propose View-GRPO, a novel reinforcement learning framework that effectively strengthens view-specific temporal reasoning while encouraging consistent comprehension across viewpoints. Our method demonstrates its superiority over naive SFT and GRPO, especially for improving cross-view consistency. All resources will be made publicly available.

  We propose a novel approach for dynamic negative prompting in diffusion models that leverages Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to adaptively generate negative prompts during the denoising process. Unlike traditional Negative Prompting methods that use fixed negative prompts, our method generates intermediate image predictions at specific denoising steps and queries a VLM to produce contextually appropriate negative prompts. We evaluate our approach on various benchmark datasets and demonstrate the trade-offs between negative guidance strength and text-image alignment.

  With the increasing ubiquity of AR/VR devices, the deployment of deep learning models on edge devices has become a critical challenge. These devices require real-time inference, low power consumption, and minimal latency. Many framework designers face the conundrum of balancing efficiency and performance. We design a light framework that adopts an encoder-decoder architecture and introduces several key contributions aimed at improving both efficiency and accuracy. We apply sparse convolution on a ResNet-18 backbone to exploit the inherent sparsity in hand pose images, achieving a 42% end-to-end efficiency improvement. Moreover, we propose our SPLite decoder. This new architecture significantly boosts the decoding process's frame rate by 3.1x on the Raspberry Pi 5, while maintaining accuracy on par. To further optimize performance, we apply quantization-aware training, reducing memory usage while preserving accuracy (PA-MPJPE increases only marginally from 9.0 mm to 9.1 mm on FreiHAND). Overall, our system achieves a 2.98x speed-up on a Raspberry Pi 5 CPU (BCM2712 quad-core Arm A76 processor). Our method is also evaluated on compound benchmark datasets, demonstrating comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art approaches while significantly enhancing computational efficiency.

  Current models based on deep learning for low-dose CT denoising rely heavily on paired data and generalize poorly. Even the more concerned diffusion models need to learn the distribution of clean data for reconstruction, which is difficult to satisfy in medical clinical applications. At the same time, self-supervised-based methods face the challenge of significant degradation of generalizability of models pre-trained for the current dose to expand to other doses. To address these issues, this work proposes a novel method of TUnable-geneRalizatioN Diffusion (TurnDiff) powered by self-supervised contextual sub-data for low-dose CT reconstruction. Firstly, a contextual subdata self-enhancing similarity strategy is designed for denoising centered on the LDCT projection domain, which provides an initial prior for the subsequent progress. Subsequently, the initial prior is used to combine knowledge distillation with a deep combination of latent diffusion models for optimizing image details. The pre-trained model is used for inference reconstruction, and the pixel-level self-correcting fusion technique is proposed for fine-grained reconstruction of the image domain to enhance the image fidelity, using the initial prior and the LDCT image as a guide. In addition, the technique is flexibly applied to the generalization of upper and lower doses or even unseen doses. Dual-domain strategy cascade for self-supervised LDCT denoising, TurnDiff requires only LDCT projection domain data for training and testing. Comprehensive evaluation on both benchmark datasets and real-world data demonstrates that TurnDiff consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both reconstruction and generalization.

  Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown strong performance on text-to-image retrieval benchmarks. However, bridging this success to real-world applications remains a challenge. In practice, human search behavior is rarely a one-shot action. Instead, it is often a multi-round process guided by clues in mind. That is, a mental image ranging from vague recollections to vivid mental representations of the target image. Motivated by this gap, we study the task of Mental Image Retrieval (MIR), which targets the realistic yet underexplored setting where users refine their search for a mentally envisioned image through multi-round interactions with an image search engine. Central to successful interactive retrieval is the capability of machines to provide users with clear, actionable feedback; however, existing methods rely on indirect or abstract verbal feedback, which can be ambiguous, misleading, or ineffective for users to refine the query. To overcome this, we propose GenIR, a generative multi-round retrieval paradigm leveraging diffusion-based image generation to explicitly reify the AI system's understanding at each round. These synthetic visual representations provide clear, interpretable feedback, enabling users to refine their queries intuitively and effectively. We further introduce a fully automated pipeline to generate a high-quality multi-round MIR dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that GenIR significantly outperforms existing interactive methods in the MIR scenario. This work establishes a new task with a dataset and an effective generative retrieval method, providing a foundation for future research in this direction

  Foundational world models must be both interactive and preserve spatiotemporal coherence for effective future planning with action choices. However, present models for long video generation have limited inherent world modeling capabilities due to two main challenges: compounding errors and insufficient memory mechanisms. We enhance image-to-video models with interactive capabilities through additional action conditioning and autoregressive framework, and reveal that compounding error is inherently irreducible in autoregressive video generation, while insufficient memory mechanism leads to incoherence of world models. We propose video retrieval augmented generation (VRAG) with explicit global state conditioning, which significantly reduces long-term compounding errors and increases spatiotemporal consistency of world models. In contrast, naive autoregressive generation with extended context windows and retrieval-augmented generation prove less effective for video generation, primarily due to the limited in-context learning capabilities of current video models. Our work illuminates the fundamental challenges in video world models and establishes a comprehensive benchmark for improving video generation models with internal world modeling capabilities.

  AI-driven video analytics has become increasingly important across diverse domains. However, existing systems are often constrained to specific, predefined tasks, limiting their adaptability in open-ended analytical scenarios. The recent emergence of Vision Language Models (VLMs) as transformative technologies offers significant potential for enabling open-ended video understanding, reasoning, and analytics. Nevertheless, their limited context windows present challenges when processing ultra-long video content, which is prevalent in real-world applications. To address this, we introduce AVA, a VLM-powered system designed for open-ended, advanced video analytics. AVA incorporates two key innovations: (1) the near real-time construction of Event Knowledge Graphs (EKGs) for efficient indexing of long or continuous video streams, and (2) an agentic retrieval-generation mechanism that leverages EKGs to handle complex and diverse queries. Comprehensive evaluations on public benchmarks, LVBench and VideoMME-Long, demonstrate that AVA achieves state-of-the-art performance, attaining 62.3% and 64.1% accuracy, respectively-significantly surpassing existing VLM and video Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. Furthermore, to evaluate video analytics in ultra-long and open-world video scenarios, we introduce a new benchmark, AVA-100. This benchmark comprises 8 videos, each exceeding 10 hours in duration, along with 120 manually annotated, diverse, and complex question-answer pairs. On AVA-100, AVA achieves top-tier performance with an accuracy of 75.8%. The source code of AVA is available atthis https URL. The AVA-100 benchmark can be accessed atthis https URL.

  Despite recent advances in 3D human motion generation (MoGen) on standard benchmarks, existing models still face a fundamental bottleneck in their generalization capability. In contrast, adjacent generative fields, most notably video generation (ViGen), have demonstrated remarkable generalization in modeling human behaviors, highlighting transferable insights that MoGen can leverage. Motivated by this observation, we present a comprehensive framework that systematically transfers knowledge from ViGen to MoGen across three key pillars: data, modeling, and evaluation. First, we introduce ViMoGen-228K, a large-scale dataset comprising 228,000 high-quality motion samples that integrates high-fidelity optical MoCap data with semantically annotated motions from web videos and synthesized samples generated by state-of-the-art ViGen models. The dataset includes both text-motion pairs and text-video-motion triplets, substantially expanding semantic diversity. Second, we propose ViMoGen, a flow-matching-based diffusion transformer that unifies priors from MoCap data and ViGen models through gated multimodal conditioning. To enhance efficiency, we further develop ViMoGen-light, a distilled variant that eliminates video generation dependencies while preserving strong generalization. Finally, we present MBench, a hierarchical benchmark designed for fine-grained evaluation across motion quality, prompt fidelity, and generalization ability. Extensive experiments show that our framework significantly outperforms existing approaches in both automatic and human evaluations. The code, data, and benchmark will be made publicly available.

  Charts play an important role in visualization, reasoning, data analysis, and the exchange of ideas among humans. However, existing vision-language models (VLMs) still lack accurate perception of details and struggle to extract fine-grained structures from charts. Such limitations in chart grounding also hinder their ability to compare multiple charts and reason over them. In this paper, we introduce a novel "ChartAlign Benchmark (ChartAB)" to provide a comprehensive evaluation of VLMs in chart grounding tasks, i.e., extracting tabular data, localizing visualization elements, and recognizing various attributes from charts of diverse types and complexities. We design a JSON template to facilitate the calculation of evaluation metrics specifically tailored for each grounding task. By incorporating a novel two-stage inference workflow, the benchmark can further evaluate VLMs' capability to align and compare elements/attributes across two charts. Our analysis of evaluations on several recent VLMs reveals new insights into their perception biases, weaknesses, robustness, and hallucinations in chart understanding. These findings highlight the fine-grained discrepancies among VLMs in chart understanding tasks and point to specific skills that need to be strengthened in current models.

  Recent advances in Visual Question Answering (VQA) have demonstrated impressive performance in natural image domains, with models like LLaVA leveraging large language models (LLMs) for open-ended reasoning. However, their generalization degrades significantly when transferred to out-of-domain scenarios such as remote sensing, medical imaging, or math diagrams, due to large distributional shifts and the lack of effective domain adaptation mechanisms. Existing approaches typically rely on per-domain fine-tuning or bespoke pipelines, which are costly, inflexible, and not scalable across diverse tasks. In this paper, we propose CATCH, a plug-and-play framework for cross-domain adaptation that improves the generalization of VQA models while requiring minimal changes to their core architecture. Our key idea is to decouple visual and linguistic adaptation by introducing two lightweight modules: a domain classifier to identify the input image type, and a dual adapter mechanism comprising a Prompt Adapter for language modulation and a Visual Adapter for vision feature adjustment. Both modules are dynamically injected via a unified hook interface, requiring no retraining of the backbone model. Experimental results across four domain-specific VQA benchmarks demonstrate that our framework achieves consistent performance gains without retraining the backbone model, including +2.3 BLEU on MathVQA, +2.6 VQA on MedVQA-RAD, and +3.1 ROUGE on ChartQA. These results highlight that CATCH provides a scalable and extensible approach to multi-domain VQA, enabling practical deployment across diverse application domains.

  In real-world environments, AI systems often face unfamiliar scenarios without labeled data, creating a major challenge for conventional scene understanding models. The inability to generalize across unseen contexts limits the deployment of vision-based applications in dynamic, unstructured settings. This work introduces a Dynamic Context-Aware Scene Reasoning framework that leverages Vision-Language Alignment to address zero-shot real-world scenarios. The goal is to enable intelligent systems to infer and adapt to new environments without prior task-specific training. The proposed approach integrates pre-trained vision transformers and large language models to align visual semantics with natural language descriptions, enhancing contextual comprehension. A dynamic reasoning module refines predictions by combining global scene cues and object-level interactions guided by linguistic priors. Extensive experiments on zero-shot benchmarks such as COCO, Visual Genome, and Open Images demonstrate up to 18% improvement in scene understanding accuracy over baseline models in complex and unseen environments. Results also show robust performance in ambiguous or cluttered scenes due to the synergistic fusion of vision and language. This framework offers a scalable and interpretable approach for context-aware reasoning, advancing zero-shot generalization in dynamic real-world settings.

  Recent advances in foundational 3D reconstruction models, such as DUSt3R and MASt3R, have shown great potential in 2D and 3D correspondence in static scenes. In this paper, we propose to adapt them for the task of point tracking through 3D grounded correspondence. We first demonstrate that these models are competitive point trackers when focusing on static points, present in current point tracking benchmarks ($+33.5\%$ on EgoPoints vs. CoTracker2). We propose to combine the reconstruction loss with training for dynamic correspondence along with a visibility head, and fine-tuning MASt3R for point tracking using a relatively small amount of synthetic data. Importantly, we only train and evaluate on pairs of frames where one contains the query point, effectively removing any temporal context. Using a mix of dynamic and static point correspondences, we achieve competitive or superior point tracking results on four datasets (e.g. competitive on TAP-Vid-DAVIS 73.8 $\delta_{avg}$ / 85.8\% occlusion acc. for PointSt3R compared to 75.7 / 88.3\% for CoTracker2; and significantly outperform CoTracker3 on EgoPoints 61.3 vs 54.2 and RGB-S 87.0 vs 82.8). We also present results on 3D point tracking along with several ablations on training datasets and percentage of dynamic correspondences.

  Agile Earth Observation Satellites (AEOSs) constellations offer unprecedented flexibility for monitoring the Earth's surface, but their scheduling remains challenging under large-scale scenarios, dynamic environments, and stringent constraints. Existing methods often simplify these complexities, limiting their real-world performance. We address this gap with a unified framework integrating a standardized benchmark suite and a novel scheduling model. Our benchmark suite, AEOS-Bench, contains $3,907$ finely tuned satellite assets and $16,410$ scenarios. Each scenario features $1$ to $50$ satellites and $50$ to $300$ imaging tasks. These scenarios are generated via a high-fidelity simulation platform, ensuring realistic satellite behavior such as orbital dynamics and resource constraints. Ground truth scheduling annotations are provided for each scenario. To our knowledge, AEOS-Bench is the first large-scale benchmark suite tailored for realistic constellation scheduling. Building upon this benchmark, we introduce AEOS-Former, a Transformer-based scheduling model that incorporates a constraint-aware attention mechanism. A dedicated internal constraint module explicitly models the physical and operational limits of each satellite. Through simulation-based iterative learning, AEOS-Former adapts to diverse scenarios, offering a robust solution for AEOS constellation scheduling. Experimental results demonstrate that AEOS-Former outperforms baseline models in task completion and energy efficiency, with ablation studies highlighting the contribution of each component.

  Wearable devices such as smart glasses are transforming the way people interact with their surroundings, enabling users to seek information regarding entities in their view. Multi-Modal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MM-RAG) plays a key role in supporting such questions, yet there is still no comprehensive benchmark for this task, especially regarding wearables scenarios. To fill this gap, we present CRAG-MM -- a Comprehensive RAG benchmark for Multi-modal Multi-turn conversations. CRAG-MM contains a diverse set of 6.5K (image, question, answer) triplets and 2K visual-based multi-turn conversations across 13 domains, including 6.2K egocentric images designed to mimic captures from wearable devices. We carefully constructed the questions to reflect real-world scenarios and challenges, including five types of image-quality issues, six question types, varying entity popularity, differing information dynamism, and different conversation turns. We design three tasks: single-source augmentation, multi-source augmentation, and multi-turn conversations -- each paired with an associated retrieval corpus and APIs for both image-KG retrieval and webpage retrieval. Our evaluation shows that straightforward RAG approaches achieve only 32% and 43% truthfulness on CRAG-MM single- and multi-turn QA, respectively, whereas state-of-the-art industry solutions have similar quality (32%/45%), underscoring ample room for improvement. The benchmark has hosted KDD Cup 2025, attracting about 1K participants and 5K submissions, with winning solutions improving baseline performance by 28%, highlighting its early impact on advancing the field.

  Despite significant advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), understanding complex temporal dynamics in videos remains a major challenge. Our experiments show that current Video Large Language Model (Video-LLM) architectures have critical limitations in temporal understanding, struggling with tasks that require detailed comprehension of action sequences and temporal progression. In this work, we propose a Video-LLM architecture that introduces stacked temporal attention modules directly within the vision encoder. This design incorporates a temporal attention in vision encoder, enabling the model to better capture the progression of actions and the relationships between frames before passing visual tokens to the LLM. Our results show that this approach significantly improves temporal reasoning and outperforms existing models in video question answering tasks, specifically in action recognition. We improve on benchmarks including VITATECS, MVBench, and Video-MME by up to +5.5%. By enhancing the vision encoder with temporal structure, we address a critical gap in video understanding for Video-LLMs. Project page and code are available at:this https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We propose an innovative enhancement to the Mamba framework by increasing the Hausdorff dimension of its scanning pattern through a novel Hilbert Selective Scan mechanism. This mechanism explores the feature space more effectively, capturing intricate fine-scale details and improving overall coverage. As a result, it mitigates information inconsistencies while refining spatial locality to better capture subtle local interactions without sacrificing the model's ability to handle long-range dependencies. Extensive experiments on publicly available benchmarks demonstrate that our approach significantly improves both the quantitative metrics and qualitative visual fidelity of existing Mamba-based low-light image enhancement methods, all while reducing computational resource consumption and shortening inference time. We believe that this refined strategy not only advances the state-of-the-art in low-light image enhancement but also holds promise for broader applications in fields that leverage Mamba-based techniques.

  Egocentric AI assistants in real-world settings must process multi-modal inputs (video, audio, text), respond in real time, and retain evolving long-term memory. However, existing benchmarks typically evaluate these abilities in isolation, lack realistic streaming scenarios, or support only short-term tasks. We introduce \textbf{TeleEgo}, a long-duration, streaming, omni-modal benchmark for evaluating egocentric AI assistants in realistic daily contexts. The dataset features over 14 hours per participant of synchronized egocentric video, audio, and text across four domains: work \& study, lifestyle \& routines, social activities, and outings \& culture. All data is aligned on a unified global timeline and includes high-quality visual narrations and speech transcripts, curated through humanthis http URLdefines 12 diagnostic subtasks across three core capabilities: Memory (recalling past events), Understanding (interpreting the current moment), and Cross-Memory Reasoning (linking distant events). It contains 3,291 human-verified QA items spanning multiple question formats (single-choice, binary, multi-choice, and open-ended), evaluated strictly in a streaming setting. We propose two key metrics -- Real-Time Accuracy and Memory Persistence Time -- to jointly assess correctness, temporal responsiveness, and long-term retention. TeleEgo provides a realistic and comprehensive evaluation to advance the development of practical AI assistants.

  The rapid proliferation of AI-generated content, driven by advances in generative adversarial networks, diffusion models, and multimodal large language models, has made the creation and dissemination of synthetic media effortless, heightening the risks of misinformation, particularly political deepfakes that distort truth and undermine trust in political institutions. In turn, governments, research institutions, and industry have strongly promoted deepfake detection initiatives as solutions. Yet, most existing models are trained and validated on synthetic, laboratory-controlled datasets, limiting their generalizability to the kinds of real-world political deepfakes circulating on social platforms that affect the public. In this work, we introduce the first systematic benchmark based on the Political Deepfakes Incident Database, a curated collection of real-world political deepfakes shared on social media since 2018. Our study includes a systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art deepfake detectors across academia, government, and industry. We find that the detectors from academia and government perform relatively poorly. While paid detection tools achieve relatively higher performance than free-access models, all evaluated detectors struggle to generalize effectively to authentic political deepfakes, and are vulnerable to simple manipulations, especially in the video domain. Results urge the need for politically contextualized deepfake detection frameworks to better safeguard the public in real-world settings.

  Dark humor in online memes poses unique challenges due to its reliance on implicit, sensitive, and culturally contextual cues. To address the lack of resources and methods for detecting dark humor in multimodal content, we introduce a novel dataset of 4,379 Reddit memes annotated for dark humor, target category (gender, mental health, violence, race, disability, and other), and a three-level intensity rating (mild, moderate, severe). Building on this resource, we propose a reasoning-augmented framework that first generates structured explanations for each meme using a Large Vision-Language Model (VLM). Through a Role-Reversal Self-Loop, VLM adopts the author's perspective to iteratively refine its explanations, ensuring completeness and alignment. We then extract textual features from both the OCR transcript and the self-refined reasoning via a text encoder, while visual features are obtained using a vision transformer. A Tri-stream Cross-Reasoning Network (TCRNet) fuses these three streams, text, image, and reasoning, via pairwise attention mechanisms, producing a unified representation for classification. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms strong baselines across three tasks: dark humor detection, target identification, and intensity prediction. The dataset, annotations, and code are released to facilitate further research in multimodal humor understanding and content moderation. Code and Dataset are available at:this https URL

  Semantic segmentation of structural defects in civil infrastructure remains challenging due to variable defect appearances, harsh imaging conditions, and significant class imbalance. Current deep learning methods, despite their effectiveness, typically require millions of parameters, rendering them impractical for real-time inspection systems. We introduce KARMA (Kolmogorov-Arnold Representation Mapping Architecture), a highly efficient semantic segmentation framework that models complex defect patterns through compositions of one-dimensional functions rather than conventional convolutions. KARMA features three technical innovations: (1) a parameter-efficient Tiny Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (TiKAN) module leveraging low-rank factorization for KAN-based feature transformation; (2) an optimized feature pyramid structure with separable convolutions for multi-scale defect analysis; and (3) a static-dynamic prototype mechanism that enhances feature representation for imbalanced classes. Extensive experiments on benchmark infrastructure inspection datasets demonstrate that KARMA achieves competitive or superior mean IoU performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches, while using significantly fewer parameters (0.959M vs. 31.04M, a 97% reduction). Operating at 0.264 GFLOPS, KARMA maintains inference speeds suitable for real-time deployment, enabling practical automated infrastructure inspection systems without compromising accuracy.

  Slot Attention (SA) and its variants lie at the heart of mainstream Object-Centric Learning (OCL). Objects in an image can be aggregated into respective slot vectors, by \textit{iteratively} refining cold-start query vectors, typically three times, via SA on image features. For video, such aggregation is \textit{recurrently} shared across frames, with queries cold-started on the first frame while transitioned from the previous frame's slots on non-first frames. However, the cold-start queries lack sample-specific cues thus hinder precise aggregation on the image or video's first frame; Also, non-first frames' queries are already sample-specific thus require transforms different from the first frame's aggregation. We address these issues for the first time with our \textit{SmoothSA}: (1) To smooth SA iterations on the image or video's first frame, we \textit{preheat} the cold-start queries with rich information of input features, via a tiny module self-distilled inside OCL; (2) To smooth SA recurrences across all video frames, we \textit{differentiate} the homogeneous transforms on the first and non-first frames, by using full and single iterations respectively. Comprehensive experiments on object discovery, recognition and downstream benchmarks validate our method's effectiveness. Further analyses intuitively illuminate how our method smooths SA iterations and recurrences. Our source code, model checkpoints and training logs are available onthis https URL.

  Recent advances in AIGC have exacerbated the misuse of malicious deepfake content, making the development of reliable deepfake detection methods an essential means to address this challenge. Although existing deepfake detection models demonstrate outstanding performance in detection metrics, most methods only provide simple binary classification results, lacking interpretability. Recent studies have attempted to enhance the interpretability of classification results by providing spatial manipulation masks or temporal forgery segments. However, due to the limitations of forgery datasets, the practical effectiveness of these methods remains suboptimal. The primary reason lies in the fact that most existing deepfake datasets contain only binary labels, with limited variety in forgery scenarios, insufficient diversity in deepfake types, and relatively small data scales, making them inadequate for complex real-worldthis http URLaddress this predicament, we construct a novel large-scale deepfake detection and localization (\textbf{DDL}) dataset containing over $\textbf{1.4M+}$ forged samples and encompassing up to $\textbf{80}$ distinct deepfake methods. The DDL design incorporates four key innovations: (1) \textbf{Comprehensive Deepfake Methods} (covering 7 different generation architectures and a total of 80 methods), (2) \textbf{Varied Manipulation Modes} (incorporating 7 classic and 3 novel forgery modes), (3) \textbf{Diverse Forgery Scenarios and Modalities} (including 3 scenarios and 3 modalities), and (4) \textbf{Fine-grained Forgery Annotations} (providing 1.18M+ precise spatial masks and 0.23M+ precise temporal segments).Through these improvements, our DDL not only provides a more challenging benchmark for complex real-world forgeries but also offers crucial support for building next-generation deepfake detection, localization, and interpretability methods.

  Infrared small target detection is a challenging task due to its unique characteristics (e.g., small, dim, shapeless and changeable). Recently published CNN-based methods have achieved promising performance with heavy feature extraction and fusion modules. To achieve efficient and effective detection, we propose a recurrent reusable-convolution attention network (RRCA-Net) for infrared small target detection. Specifically, RRCA-Net incorporates reusable-convolution block (RuCB) in a recurrent manner without introducing extra parameters. With the help of the repetitive iteration in RuCB, the high-level information of small targets in the deep layers can be well maintained and further refined. Then, a dual interactive attention aggregation module (DIAAM) is proposed to promote the mutual enhancement and fusion of refined information. In this way, RRCA-Net can both achieve high-level feature refinement and enhance the correlation of contextual information between adjacent layers. Moreover, to achieve steady convergence, we design a target characteristic inspired loss function (DpT-k loss) by integrating physical and mathematical constraints. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets (e.g. NUAA-SIRST, IRSTD-1k, DenseSIRST) demonstrate that our RRCA-Net can achieve comparable performance to the state-of-the-art methods while maintaining a small number of parameters, and act as a plug and play module to introduce consistent performance improvement for several popular IRSTD methods.

  Aerial-Ground Person Re-IDentification (AG-ReID) aims to retrieve specific persons across cameras with different viewpoints. Previous works focus on designing discriminative models to maintain the identity consistency despite drastic changes in camera viewpoints. The core idea behind these methods is quite natural, but designing a view-robust model is a very challenging task. Moreover, they overlook the contribution of view-specific features in enhancing the model's ability to represent persons. To address these issues, we propose a novel generative framework named SD-ReID for AG-ReID, which leverages generative models to mimic the feature distribution of different views while extracting robust identity representations. More specifically, we first train a ViT-based model to extract person representations along with controllable conditions, including identity and view conditions. We then fine-tune the Stable Diffusion (SD) model to enhance person representations guided by these controllable conditions. Furthermore, we introduce the View-Refined Decoder (VRD) to bridge the gap between instance-level and global-level features. Finally, both person representations and all-view features are employed to retrieve target persons. Extensive experiments on five AG-ReID benchmarks (i.e., CARGO, AG-ReIDv1, AG-ReIDv2, LAGPeR and G2APS-ReID) demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. The source code will be available.

  As an important task in intelligent transportation systems, Aerial-Ground person Re-IDentification (AG-ReID) aims to retrieve specific persons across heterogeneous cameras in different viewpoints. Previous methods typically adopt deep learning-based models, focusing on extracting view-invariant features. However, they usually overlook the semantic information in person attributes. In addition, existing training strategies often rely on full fine-tuning large-scale models, which significantly increases training costs. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework named LATex for AG-ReID, which adopts prompt-tuning strategies to leverage attribute-based text knowledge. Specifically, with the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model, we first propose an Attribute-aware Image Encoder (AIE) to extract both global semantic features and attribute-aware features from input images. Then, with these features, we propose a Prompted Attribute Classifier Group (PACG) to predict person attributes and obtain attribute representations. Finally, we design a Coupled Prompt Template (CPT) to transform attribute representations and view information into structured sentences. These sentences are processed by the text encoder of CLIP to generate more discriminative features. As a result, our framework can fully leverage attribute-based text knowledge to improve AG-ReID performance. Extensive experiments on three AG-ReID benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods. The source code is available atthis https URL.

  Spatial reasoning is a fundamental capability of multimodal large language models (MLLMs), yet their performance in open aerial environments remains underexplored. In this work, we present Open3D-VQA, a novel benchmark for evaluating MLLMs' ability to reason about complex spatial relationships from an aerial perspective. The benchmark comprises 73k QA pairs spanning 7 general spatial reasoning tasks, including multiple-choice, true/false, and short-answer formats, and supports both visual and point cloud modalities. The questions are automatically generated from spatial relations extracted from both real-world and simulated aerial scenes. Evaluation on 13 popular MLLMs reveals that: 1) Models are generally better at answering questions about relative spatial relations than absolute distances, 2) 3D LLMs fail to demonstrate significant advantages over 2D LLMs, and 3) Fine-tuning solely on the simulated dataset can significantly improve the model's spatial reasoning performance in real-world scenarios. We release our benchmark, data generation pipeline, and evaluation toolkit to support further research:this https URL.

  Semantic segmentation under domain shift remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision, particularly when labelled training data is scarce. This challenge is particularly exemplified in histopathology image analysis, where the same tissue structures must be segmented across images captured under different imaging conditions (stains), each representing a distinct visual domain. Traditional deep learning methods like UNet require extensive labels, which is both costly and time-consuming, particularly when dealing with multiple domains (or stains). To mitigate this, various unsupervised domain adaptation based methods such as UDAGAN have been proposed, which reduce the need for labels by requiring only one (source) stain to be labelled. Nonetheless, obtaining source stain labels can still be challenging. This article shows that through self-supervised pre-training -- including SimCLR, BYOL, and a novel approach, HR-CS-CO -- the performance of these segmentation methods (UNet, and UDAGAN) can be retained even with 95% fewer labels. Notably, with self-supervised pre-training and using only 5% labels, the performance drops are minimal: 5.9% for UNet and 6.2% for UDAGAN, averaged over all stains, compared to their respective fully supervised counterparts (without pre-training, using 100% labels). Furthermore, these findings are shown to generalise beyond their training distribution to public benchmark datasets. Implementations and pre-trained models are publicly available \href{this https URL}{online}.

  Dynamic facial expression recognition (DFER) infers emotions from the temporal evolution of expressions, unlike static facial expression recognition (SFER), which relies solely on a single snapshot. This temporal analysis provides richer information and promises greater recognition capability. However, current DFER methods often exhibit unsatisfied performance largely due to fewer training samples compared to SFER. Given the inherent correlation between static and dynamic expressions, we hypothesize that leveraging the abundant SFER data can enhance DFER. To this end, we propose Static-for-Dynamic (S4D), a unified dual-modal learning framework that integrates SFER data as a complementary resource for DFER. Specifically, S4D employs dual-modal self-supervised pre-training on facial images and videos using a shared Vision Transformer (ViT) encoder-decoder architecture, yielding improved spatiotemporal representations. The pre-trained encoder is then fine-tuned on static and dynamic expression datasets in a multi-task learning setup to facilitate emotional information interaction. Unfortunately, vanilla multi-task learning in our study results in negative transfer. To address this, we propose an innovative Mixture of Adapter Experts (MoAE) module that facilitates task-specific knowledge acquisition while effectively extracting shared knowledge from both static and dynamic expression data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that S4D achieves a deeper understanding of DFER, setting new state-of-the-art performance on FERV39K, MAFW, and DFEW benchmarks, with weighted average recall (WAR) of 53.65\%, 58.44\%, and 76.68\%, respectively. Additionally, a systematic correlation analysis between SFER and DFER tasks is presented, which further elucidates the potential benefits of leveraging SFER.

  Novel view synthesis is an important problem with many applications, including AR/VR, gaming, and robotic simulations. With the recent rapid development of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) methods, it is becoming difficult to keep track of the current state of the art (SoTA) due to methods using different evaluation protocols, codebases being difficult to install and use, and methods not generalizing well to novel 3D scenes. In our experiments, we show that even tiny differences in the evaluation protocols of various methods can artificially boost the performance of these methods. This raises questions about the validity of quantitative comparisons performed in the literature. To address these questions, we propose NerfBaselines, an evaluation framework which provides consistent benchmarking tools, ensures reproducibility, and simplifies the installation and use of various methods. We validate our implementation experimentally by reproducing the numbers reported in the original papers. For improved accessibility, we release a web platform that compares commonly used methods on standard benchmarks. We strongly believe NerfBaselines is a valuable contribution to the community as it ensures that quantitative results are comparable and thus truly measure progress in the field of novel view synthesis.

  Automated medical report generation has demonstrated the potential to significantly reduce the workload associated with time-consuming medical reporting. Recent generative representation learning methods have shown promise in integrating vision and language modalities for medical report generation. However, when trained end-to-end and applied directly to medical image-to-text generation, they face two significant challenges: i) difficulty in accurately capturing subtle yet crucial pathological details, and ii) reliance on both visual and textual inputs during inference, leading to performance degradation in zero-shot inference when only images are available. To address these challenges, this study proposes a novel multimodal dynamic traceback learning framework (DTrace). Specifically, we introduce a traceback mechanism to supervise the semantic validity of generated content and a dynamic learning strategy to adapt to various proportions of image and text input, enabling text generation without strong reliance on the input from both modalities during inference. The learning of cross-modal knowledge is enhanced by supervising the model to recover masked semantic information from a complementary counterpart. Extensive experiments conducted on two benchmark datasets, IU-Xray and MIMIC-CXR, demonstrate that the proposed DTrace framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods for medical report generation.

  Prototype Memory is a powerful model for face representation learning. It enables training face recognition models on datasets of any size by generating prototypes (classifier weights) on the fly and efficiently utilizing them. Prototype Memory demonstrated strong results in many face recognition benchmarks. However, the algorithm of prototype generation, used in it, is prone to the problems of imperfectly calculated prototypes in case of low-quality or poorly recognizable faces in the images, selected for the prototype creation. All images of the same person presented in the mini-batch are used with equal weights, and the resulting averaged prototype can be contaminated by imperfect embeddings of low-quality face images. This may lead to misleading training signals and degrade the performance of the trained models. In this paper, we propose a simple and effective way to improve Prototype Memory with quality-aware prototype generation. Quality-Aware Prototype Memory uses different weights for images of different quality in the process of prototype generation. With this improvement, prototypes receive more informative signals from high-quality images and are less affected by low-quality ones. We propose and compare several methods of quality estimation and usage, perform extensive experiments on the different face recognition benchmarks and demonstrate the advantages of the proposed model compared to the basic version of Prototype Memory.

  Electronic Health Records (EHR) store clinical documentation as base64 encoded attachments in FHIR DocumentReference resources, which makes semantic question answering difficult. Traditional vector database methods often miss nuanced clinical relationships. The Clinical Entity Augmented Retrieval (CLEAR) method, introduced by Lopez et al. 2025, uses entity aware retrieval and achieved improved performance with an F1 score of 0.90 versus 0.86 for embedding based retrieval, while using over 70 percent fewer tokens. We developed a Clinical Notes QA Evaluation Platform to validate CLEAR against zero shot large context inference and traditional chunk based retrieval augmented generation. The platform was tested on 12 clinical notes ranging from 10,000 to 65,000 tokens representing realistic EHR content. CLEAR achieved a 58.3 percent win rate, an average semantic similarity of 0.878, and used 78 percent fewer tokens than wide context processing. The largest performance gains occurred on long notes, with a 75 percent win rate for documents exceeding 65,000 tokens. These findings confirm that entity aware retrieval improves both efficiency and accuracy in clinical natural language processing. The evaluation framework provides a reusable and transparent benchmark for assessing clinical question answering systems where semantic precision and computational efficiency are critical.

  There is a substantial body of literature examining the mathematical reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), particularly their performance on precise arithmetic operations in autoregressive architectures. However, their ability to perform approximate reasoning in informal, fast-paced mathematical operations has received far less attention, especially among non-autoregressive decoder models. Our work addresses this gap by introducing StreetMath, a benchmark designed to evaluate models' approximation abilities under real-world approximation scenarios. We conduct extensive evaluations across different LLM architectures: Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507, Qwen3-4B-Thinking-2507, Dream-v0-Instruct-7B, Falcon-Mamba-7B-Instruct, and Mamba-GPT-3B. Furthermore, we apply mechanistic interpretability techniques to probe their internal computational states. Our analysis reveals that LLMs generally attempt to compute exact values or invoke external tools even in tasks that call for approximation. Moreover, while models sometimes reach the correct answer in early layers or steps, they still consume more tokens when solving approximation tasks. Additional experiments indicate that exact and approximate arithmetic operations rely on largely separate neural components. Drawing upon research on cognitive psychology, we argue that LLMs do not exhibit cognitive miserliness in the same way humans do in street math settings. We open source our workthis https URL

  Chart understanding presents a unique challenge for large vision-language models (LVLMs), as it requires the integration of sophisticated textual and visual reasoning capabilities. However, current LVLMs exhibit a notable imbalance between these skills, falling short on visual reasoning that is difficult to perform in text. We conduct a case study using a synthetic dataset solvable only through visual reasoning and show that model performance degrades significantly with increasing visual complexity, while human performance remains robust. We then introduce ChartMuseum, a new Chart Question Answering (QA) benchmark containing 1,162 expert-annotated questions spanning multiple reasoning types, curated from real-world charts across 184 sources, specifically built to evaluate complex visual and textual reasoning. Unlike prior chart understanding benchmarks -- where frontier models perform similarly and near saturation -- our benchmark exposes a substantial gap between model and human performance, while effectively differentiating model capabilities: although humans achieve 93% accuracy, the best-performing model Gemini-2.5-Pro attains only 63.0%, and the leading open-source LVLM Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct achieves only 38.5%. Moreover, on questions requiring primarily visual reasoning, all models experience a 35%-55% performance drop from text-reasoning-heavy question performance. Lastly, our qualitative error analysis reveals specific categories of visual reasoning that are challenging for current LVLMs.

  While a multi-agent approach based on large language models (LLMs) represents a promising strategy to surpass the capabilities of single models, its success is critically dependent on synergistic team composition. However, forming optimal teams is a significant challenge, as the inherent opacity of most models obscures the internal characteristics necessary for effective collaboration. In this paper, we propose an interaction-centric framework for automatic team composition that does not require any prior knowledge including their internal architectures, training data, or task performances. Our method constructs a "language model graph" that maps relationships between models from the semantic coherence of pairwise conversations, and then applies community detection to identify synergistic model clusters. Our experiments with diverse LLMs demonstrate that the proposed method discovers functionally coherent groups that reflect their latent specializations. Priming conversations with specific topics identified synergistic teams which outperform random baselines on downstream benchmarks and achieve comparable accuracy to that of manually-curated teams based on known model specializations. Our findings provide a new basis for the automated design of collaborative multi-agent LLM teams.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with problems that require multi-step reasoning. For small-scale open-source models, Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) fails when correct solutions are rarely sampled even after many attempts, while Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) tends to overfit long demonstrations through rigid token-by-token imitation. To address this gap, we propose Supervised Reinforcement Learning (SRL), a framework that reformulates problem solving as generating a sequence of logical "actions". SRL trains the model to generate an internal reasoning monologue before committing to each action. It provides smoother rewards based on the similarity between the model's actions and expert actions extracted from the SFT dataset in a step-wise manner. This supervision offers richer learning signals even when all rollouts are incorrect, while encouraging flexible reasoning guided by expert demonstrations. As a result, SRL enables small models to learn challenging problems previously unlearnable by SFT or RLVR. Moreover, initializing training with SRL before refining with RLVR yields the strongest overall performance. Beyond reasoning benchmarks, SRL generalizes effectively to agentic software engineering tasks, establishing it as a robust and versatile training framework for reasoning-oriented LLMs.

  Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed with task-specific adapters catering to multiple downstream applications. In such a scenario, the additional compute associated with these apparently insignificant number of adapter parameters (typically less than 1% of the base model) turns out to be disproportionately significant during inference time (upto 2.5x times that of the base model). In this paper, we propose a new zero-latency fused low-rank adapter (zFLoRA) that introduces zero or negligible latency overhead on top of the base model. Experimental results on LLMs of size 1B, 3B and 7B show that zFLoRA compares favorably against the popular supervised fine-tuning benchmarks including low-rank adapters (LoRA) as well as full fine-tuning (FFT). Experiments are conducted on 18 different tasks across three different categories namely commonsense reasoning, math reasoning and summary-dialogue. Latency measurements made on NPU (Samsung Galaxy S25+) as well as GPU (NVIDIA H100) platforms show that the proposed zFLoRA adapters introduce zero to negligible latency overhead.

  Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) and Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) are the main RL paradigms used in LLM post-training, each offering distinct advantages. However, RLHF struggles with interpretability and reward hacking because it relies on human judgments that usually lack explicit criteria, whereas RLVR is limited in scope by its focus on correctness-based verifiers. We propose Reinforcement Learning with Binary Flexible Feedback (RLBFF), which combines the versatility of human-driven preferences with the precision of rule-based verification, enabling reward models to capture nuanced aspects of response quality beyond mere correctness. RLBFF extracts principles that can be answered in a binary fashion (e.g. accuracy of information: yes, or code readability: no) from natural language feedback. Such principles can then be used to ground Reward Model training as an entailment task (response satisfies or does not satisfy an arbitrary principle). We show that Reward Models trained in this manner can outperform Bradley-Terry models when matched for data and achieve top performance on RM-Bench (86.2%) and JudgeBench (81.4%, #1 on leaderboard as of September 24, 2025). Additionally, users can specify principles of interest at inference time to customize the focus of our reward models, in contrast to Bradley-Terry models. Finally, we present a fully open source recipe (including data) to align Qwen3-32B using RLBFF and our Reward Model, to match or exceed the performance of o3-mini and DeepSeek R1 on general alignment benchmarks of MT-Bench, WildBench, and Arena Hard v2 (at <5% of the inference cost).

  Despite the remarkable success of Large Language Models (LLMs), evaluating their outputs' quality regarding preference remains a critical challenge. While existing works usually leverage a strong LLM as the judge for comparing LLMs' response pairwisely, such a single-evaluator approach is vulnerable to cyclic preference, i.e., output A is better than B, B than C, but C is better than A, causing contradictory evaluation results. To address this, we introduce PGED (Preference Graph Ensemble and Denoise), a novel approach that leverages multiple model-based evaluators to construct preference graphs, and then ensembles and denoises these graphs for acyclic, non-contradictory evaluation results. We provide theoretical guarantees for our framework, demonstrating its efficacy in recovering the ground truth preference structure. Extensive experiments on ten benchmarks demonstrate PGED 's superiority in three applications: 1) model ranking for evaluation, 2) response selection for test-time scaling, and 3) data selection for model fine-tuning. Notably, PGED combines small LLM evaluators (e.g., Llama3-8B, Mistral-7B, Qwen2-7B) to outperform strong ones (e.g., Qwen2-72B), showcasing its effectiveness in enhancing evaluation reliability and improving model performance.

  We present AMO-Bench, an Advanced Mathematical reasoning benchmark with Olympiad level or even higher difficulty, comprising 50 human-crafted problems. Existing benchmarks have widely leveraged high school math competitions for evaluating mathematical reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, many existing math competitions are becoming less effective for assessing top-tier LLMs due to performance saturation (e.g., AIME24/25). To address this, AMO-Bench introduces more rigorous challenges by ensuring all 50 problems are (1) cross-validated by experts to meet at least the International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) difficulty standards, and (2) entirely original problems to prevent potential performance leakages from data memorization. Moreover, each problem in AMO-Bench requires only a final answer rather than a proof, enabling automatic and robust grading for evaluation. Experimental results across 26 LLMs on AMO-Bench show that even the best-performing model achieves only 52.4% accuracy on AMO-Bench, with most LLMs scoring below 40%. Beyond these poor performances, our further analysis reveals a promising scaling trend with increasing test-time compute on AMO-Bench. These results highlight the significant room for improving the mathematical reasoning in current LLMs. We release AMO-Bench to facilitate further research into advancing the reasoning abilities of language models.this https URL

  The "end-to-end" label for LLMs is a misnomer. In practice, they depend on a non-differentiable decoding process that requires laborious, hand-tuning of hyperparameters like temperature and top-p. This paper introduces AutoDeco, a novel architecture that enables truly "end-to-end" generation by learning to control its own decoding strategy. We augment the standard transformer with lightweight heads that, at each step, dynamically predict context-specific temperature and top-p values alongside the next-token logits. This approach transforms decoding into a parametric, token-level process, allowing the model to self-regulate its sampling strategy within a single forward pass.Through extensive experiments on eight benchmarks, we demonstrate that AutoDeco not only significantly outperforms default decoding strategies but also achieves performance comparable to an oracle-tuned baseline derived from "hacking the test set"-a practical upper bound for any static method. Crucially, we uncover an emergent capability for instruction-based decoding control: the model learns to interpret natural language commands (e.g., "generate with low randomness") and adjusts its predicted temperature and top-p on a token-by-token basis, opening a new paradigm for steerable and interactive LLM decoding.

  Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities across multiple domains by leveraging massive pre-training and curated fine-tuning data. However, in data-sensitive fields such as healthcare, the lack of high-quality, domain-specific training corpus hinders LLMs' adaptation for specialized applications. Meanwhile, domain experts have distilled domain wisdom into ontology rules, which formalize relationships among concepts and ensure the integrity of knowledge management repositories. Viewing LLMs as implicit repositories of human knowledge, we propose Evontree, a novel framework that leverages a small set of high-quality ontology rules to systematically extract, validate, and enhance domain knowledge within LLMs, without requiring extensive external datasets. Specifically, Evontree extracts domain ontology from raw models, detects inconsistencies using two core ontology rules, and reinforces the refined knowledge via self-distilled fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on medical QA benchmarks with Llama3-8B-Instruct and Med42-v2 demonstrate consistent outperformance over both unmodified models and leading supervised baselines, achieving up to a 3.7% improvement in accuracy. These results confirm the effectiveness, efficiency, and robustness of our approach for low-resource domain adaptation of LLMs.

  Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is a promising approach for enhancing agentic deep search. However, its application is often hindered by low \textbf{Reward Density} in deep search scenarios, where agents expend significant exploratory costs for infrequent and often null final rewards. In this paper, we formalize this challenge as the \textbf{Reward Density Optimization} problem, which aims to improve the reward obtained per unit of exploration cost. This paper introduce \textbf{InfoFlow}, a systematic framework that tackles this problem from three aspects. 1) \textbf{Subproblem decomposition}: breaking down long-range tasks to assign process rewards, thereby providing denser learning signals. 2) \textbf{Failure-guided hints}: injecting corrective guidance into stalled trajectories to increase the probability of successful outcomes. 3) \textbf{Dual-agent refinement}: employing a dual-agent architecture to offload the cognitive burden of deep exploration. A refiner agent synthesizes the search history, which effectively compresses the researcher's perceived trajectory, thereby reducing exploration cost and increasing the overall reward density. We evaluate InfoFlow on multiple agentic search benchmarks, where it significantly outperforms strong baselines, enabling lightweight LLMs to achieve performance comparable to advanced proprietary LLMs.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at general tasks but underperform in specialized domains like economics and psychology, which require deep, principled understanding. To address this, we introduce ACER (Automated Curriculum-Enhanced Regimen) that transforms generalist models into domain experts without sacrificing their broad capabilities. ACER first synthesizes a comprehensive, textbook-style curriculum by generating a table of contents for a subject and then creating question-answer (QA) pairs guided by Bloom's taxonomy. This ensures systematic topic coverage and progressively increasing difficulty. The resulting synthetic corpus is used for continual pretraining with an interleaved curriculum schedule, aligning learning across both content and cognitive dimensions.Experiments with Llama 3.2 (1B and 3B) show significant gains in specialized MMLU subsets. In challenging domains like microeconomics, where baselines struggle, ACER boosts accuracy by 5 percentage points. Across all target domains, we observe a consistent macro-average improvement of 3 percentage points. Notably, ACER not only prevents catastrophic forgetting but also facilitates positive cross-domain knowledge transfer, improving performance on non-target domains by 0.7 points. Beyond MMLU, ACER enhances performance on knowledge-intensive benchmarks like ARC and GPQA by over 2 absolute points, while maintaining stable performance on general reasoning tasks. Our results demonstrate that ACER offers a scalable and effective recipe for closing critical domain gaps in LLMs.

  Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as a leading approach to reducing hallucinations in large language models (LLMs). Current RAG evaluation benchmarks primarily focus on what we call local RAG: retrieving relevant chunks from a small subset of documents to answer queries that require only localized understanding within specific text chunks. However, many real-world applications require a fundamentally different capability -- global RAG -- which involves aggregating and analyzing information across entire document collections to derive corpus-level insights (for example, "What are the top 10 most cited papers in 2023?"). In this paper, we introduce GlobalQA -- the first benchmark specifically designed to evaluate global RAG capabilities, covering four core task types: counting, extremum queries, sorting, and top-k extraction. Through systematic evaluation across different models and baselines, we find that existing RAG methods perform poorly on global tasks, with the strongest baseline achieving only 1.51 F1 score. To address these challenges, we propose GlobalRAG, a multi-tool collaborative framework that preserves structural coherence through chunk-level retrieval, incorporates LLM-driven intelligent filters to eliminate noisy documents, and integrates aggregation modules for precise symbolic computation. On the Qwen2.5-14B model, GlobalRAG achieves 6.63 F1 compared to the strongest baseline's 1.51 F1, validating the effectiveness of our method.

  One of the main challenges in mechanistic interpretability is circuit discovery, determining which parts of a model perform a given task. We build on the Mechanistic Interpretability Benchmark (MIB) and propose three key improvements to circuit discovery. First, we use bootstrapping to identify edges with consistent attribution scores. Second, we introduce a simple ratio-based selection strategy to prioritize strong positive-scoring edges, balancing performance and faithfulness. Third, we replace the standard greedy selection with an integer linear programming formulation. Our methods yield more faithful circuits and outperform prior approaches across multiple MIB tasks and models. Our code is available at:this https URL.

  Stance detection has emerged as an area of research in the field of artificial intelligence. However, most research is currently centered on the target-dependent stance detection task, which is based on a person's stance in favor of or against a specific target. Furthermore, most benchmark datasets are based on English, making it difficult to develop models in low-resource languages such as Korean, especially for an emerging field such as stance detection. This study proposes the LArge-Scale Target-Independent STance (LASTIST) dataset to fill this research gap. Collected from the press releases of both parties on Korean political parties, the LASTIST dataset uses 563,299 labeled Korean sentences. We provide a detailed description of how we collected and constructed the dataset and trained state-of-the-art deep learning and stance detection models. Our LASTIST dataset is designed for various tasks in stance detection, including target-independent stance detection and diachronic evolution stance detection. We deploy our dataset onthis https URL.

  The rapid advancement of large language models(LLMs) has intensified the need for domain and culture specific evaluation. Existing benchmarks are largely Anglocentric and domain-agnostic, limiting their applicability to India-centric contexts. To address this gap, we introduce BhashaBench V1, the first domain-specific, multi-task, bilingual benchmark focusing on critical Indic knowledge systems. BhashaBench V1 contains 74,166 meticulously curated question-answer pairs, with 52,494 in English and 21,672 in Hindi, sourced from authentic government and domain-specific exams. It spans four major domains: Agriculture, Legal, Finance, and Ayurveda, comprising 90+ subdomains and covering 500+ topics, enabling fine-grained evaluation. Evaluation of 29+ LLMs reveals significant domain and language specific performance gaps, with especially large disparities in low-resource domains. For instance, GPT-4o achieves 76.49% overall accuracy in Legal but only 59.74% in Ayurveda. Models consistently perform better on English content compared to Hindi across all domains. Subdomain-level analysis shows that areas such as Cyber Law, International Finance perform relatively well, while Panchakarma, Seed Science, and Human Rights remain notably weak. BhashaBench V1 provides a comprehensive dataset for evaluating large language models across India's diverse knowledge domains. It enables assessment of models' ability to integrate domain-specific knowledge with bilingual understanding. All code, benchmarks, and resources are publicly available to support open research.

  Multimodal Large Languages models have been progressing from uni-modal understanding toward unifying visual, audio and language modalities, collectively termed omni models. However, the correlation between uni-modal and omni-modal remains unclear, which requires comprehensive evaluation to drive omni model's intelligence evolution. In this work, we introduce a novel, high-quality, and UNified Omni model benchmark, UNO-Bench. This benchmark is designed to effectively evaluate both UNi-modal and Omni-modal capabilities under a unified ability taxonomy, spanning 44 task types and 5 modality combinations. It includes 1250 human curated samples for omni-modal with 98% cross-modality solvability, and 2480 enhanced uni-modal samples. The human-generated dataset is well-suited to real-world scenarios, particularly within the Chinese context, whereas the automatically compressed dataset offers a 90% increase in speed and maintains 98% consistency across 18 public benchmarks. In addition to traditional multi-choice questions, we propose an innovative multi-step open-ended question format to assess complex reasoning. A general scoring model is incorporated, supporting 6 question types for automated evaluation with 95% accuracy. Experimental result shows the Compositional Law between omni-modal and uni-modal performance and the omni-modal capability manifests as a bottleneck effect on weak models, while exhibiting synergistic promotion on strong models.

  Human cognition is theorized to operate in two modes: fast, intuitive System 1 thinking and slow, deliberate System 2 thinking. While current Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) excel at System 2 thinking, their inability to perform fast thinking leads to high computational overhead and latency. In this work, we enable LRMs to approximate human intelligence through dynamic thinking speed adjustment, optimizing accuracy-efficiency trade-offs. Our approach addresses two key questions: (1) how to control thinking speed in LRMs, and (2) when to adjust it for optimal performance. For the first question, we identify the steering vector that governs slow-fast thinking transitions in LRMs' representation space. Using this vector, we achieve the first representation editing-based test-time scaling effect, outperforming existing prompt-based scaling methods. For the second question, we apply real-time difficulty estimation to signal reasoning segments of varying complexity. Combining these techniques, we propose the first reasoning strategy that enables fast processing of easy steps and deeper analysis for complex reasoning. Without any training or additional cost, our plug-in module delivers an average +1.3% accuracy with -8.6% token usage across leading LRMs and advanced reasoning benchmarks. All of our algorithms are implemented based on vLLM and are expected to support broader applications and inspire future research.

  Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities across tasks such as mathematics, coding, and reasoning, yet their learning ability, which is crucial for adapting to dynamic environments and acquiring new knowledge, remains underexplored. In this work, we address this gap by introducing a framework inspired by cognitive psychology and education. Specifically, we decompose general learning ability into three distinct, complementary dimensions: Learning from Instructor (acquiring knowledge via explicit guidance), Learning from Concept (internalizing abstract structures and generalizing to new contexts), and Learning from Experience (adapting through accumulated exploration and feedback). We conduct a comprehensive empirical study across the three learning dimensions and identify several insightful findings, such as (i) interaction improves learning; (ii) conceptual understanding is scale-emergent and benefits larger models; and (iii) LLMs are effective few-shot learners but not many-shot learners. Based on our framework and empirical findings, we introduce a benchmark that provides a unified and realistic evaluation of LLMs' general learning abilities across three learning cognition dimensions. It enables diagnostic insights and supports evaluation and development of more adaptive and human-like models.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Sarcasm is a challenge to sentiment analysis because of the incongruity between stated and implied sentiment. The challenge is exacerbated when the implication may be relevant to a specific country or geographical region. Pragmatic metacognitive prompting (PMP) is a cognition-inspired technique that has been used for pragmatic reasoning. In this paper, we harness PMP for explainable sarcasm detection for Australian and Indian English, alongside a benchmark dataset for standard English. We manually add sarcasm explanations to an existing sarcasm-labeled dataset for Australian and Indian English called BESSTIE, and compare the performance for explainable sarcasm detection for them with FLUTE, a standard English dataset containing sarcasm explanations. Our approach utilising PMP when evaluated on two open-weight LLMs (GEMMA and LLAMA) achieves statistically significant performance improvement across all tasks and datasets when compared with four alternative prompting strategies. We also find that alternative techniques such as agentic prompting mitigate context-related failures by enabling external knowledge retrieval. The focused contribution of our work is utilising PMP in generating sarcasm explanations for varieties of English.

  Large reasoning models (LRMs), such as OpenAI o1 and DeepSeek-R1, have significantly enhanced their reasoning capabilities by generating longer chains of thought, demonstrating outstanding performance across a variety of tasks. However, this performance gain comes at the cost of a substantial increase in redundant reasoning during the generation process, leading to high computational overhead and exacerbating the issue of overthinking. Although numerous existing approaches aim to address the problem of overthinking, they often rely on external interventions. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, Self-Braking Tuning (SBT), which tackles overthinking from the perspective of allowing the model to regulate its own reasoning process, thus eliminating the reliance on external control mechanisms. We construct a set of overthinking identification metrics based on standard answers and design a systematic method to detect redundant reasoning. This method accurately identifies unnecessary steps within the reasoning trajectory and generates training signals for learning self-regulation behaviors. Building on this foundation, we develop a complete strategy for constructing data with adaptive reasoning lengths and introduce an innovative braking prompt mechanism that enables the model to naturally learn when to terminate reasoning at an appropriate point. Experiments across mathematical benchmarks (AIME, AMC, MATH500, GSM8K) demonstrate that our method reduces token consumption by up to 60% while maintaining comparable accuracy to unconstrained models.

  The use of language models for automatically evaluating long-form text (LLM-as-a-judge) is becoming increasingly common, yet most LLM judges are optimized exclusively for English, with strategies for enhancing their multilingual evaluation capabilities remaining largely unexplored in the current literature. This has created a disparity in the quality of automatic evaluation methods for non-English languages, ultimately hindering the development of models with better multilingual capabilities. To bridge this gap, we introduce M-Prometheus, a suite of open-weight LLM judges ranging from 3B to 14B parameters that can provide both direct assessment and pairwise comparison feedback on multilingual outputs. M-Prometheus models outperform state-of-the-art open LLM judges on multilingual reward benchmarks spanning more than 20 languages, as well as on literary machine translation (MT) evaluation covering 4 language pairs. Furthermore, M-Prometheus models can be leveraged at decoding time to significantly improve generated outputs across all 3 tested languages, showcasing their utility for the development of better multilingual models. Lastly, through extensive ablations, we identify the key factors for obtaining an effective multilingual judge, including backbone model selection and training on synthetic multilingual feedback data instead of translated data. We release our models, training dataset, and code.

  As language models improve and become capable of performing more complex tasks across modalities, evaluating them automatically becomes increasingly challenging. Developing strong and robust task-specific automatic metrics gets harder, and human-annotated test sets -- which are expensive to create -- saturate more quickly. A compelling alternative is to design reliable strategies to automate the creation of test data and evaluation, but previous attempts either rely on pre-existing data, or focus solely on individual tasks. We present Zero-shot Benchmarking (ZSB), a framework for creating high-quality benchmarks for any task by leveraging language models for both synthetic test data creation and evaluation. ZSB is simple and flexible: it requires only the creation of a prompt for data generation and one for evaluation; it is scalable to tasks and languages where collecting real-world data is costly or impractical; it is model-agnostic, allowing the creation of increasingly challenging benchmarks as models improve. To assess the effectiveness of our framework, we create benchmarks for five text-only tasks and a multi-modal one: general capabilities in four languages (English, Chinese, French, and Korean), translation, and general vision-language capabilities in English. We then rank a broad range of open and closed systems on our benchmarks. ZSB rankings consistently correlate strongly with human rankings, outperforming widely-adopted standard benchmarks. Through ablations, we find that strong benchmarks can be created with open models, and that judge model size and dataset variety are crucial drivers of performance. We release all our benchmarks, and code to reproduce our experiments and to produce new benchmarks.

  With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs), various LLM-based works have been widely applied in educational fields. However, most existing LLMs and their benchmarks focus primarily on the knowledge dimension, largely neglecting the evaluation of cultivation capabilities that are essential for real-world educational scenarios. Additionally, current benchmarks are often limited to a single subject or question type, lacking sufficient diversity. This issue is particularly prominent within the Chinese context. To address this gap, we introduce OmniEduBench, a comprehensive Chinese educational benchmark. OmniEduBench consists of 24.602K high-quality question-answer pairs. The data is meticulously divided into two core dimensions: the knowledge dimension and the cultivation dimension, which contain 18.121K and 6.481K entries, respectively. Each dimension is further subdivided into 6 fine-grained categories, covering a total of 61 different subjects (41 in the knowledge and 20 in the cultivation). Furthermore, the dataset features a rich variety of question formats, including 11 common exam question types, providing a solid foundation for comprehensively evaluating LLMs' capabilities in education. Extensive experiments on 11 mainstream open-source and closed-source LLMs reveal a clear performance gap. In the knowledge dimension, only Gemini-2.5 Pro surpassed 60\% accuracy, while in the cultivation dimension, the best-performing model, QWQ, still trailed human intelligence by nearly 30\%. These results highlight the substantial room for improvement and underscore the challenges of applying LLMs in education.

  Large language models (LLMs) commonly boost reasoning via sample-evaluate-ensemble decoders, achieving label free gains without ground truth. However, prevailing strategies score candidates using only external outputs such as token probabilities, entropies, or self evaluations, and these signals can be poorly calibrated after post training. We instead analyze internal behavior based on neuron activations and uncover three findings: (1) external signals are low dimensional projections of richer internal dynamics; (2) correct responses activate substantially fewer unique neurons than incorrect ones throughout generation; and (3) activations from correct responses exhibit stronger cross sample agreement, whereas incorrect ones diverge. Motivated by these observations, we propose Neuron Agreement Decoding (NAD), an unsupervised best-of-N method that selects candidates using activation sparsity and cross sample neuron agreement, operating solely on internal signals and without requiring comparable textual outputs. NAD enables early correctness prediction within the first 32 generated tokens and supports aggressive early stopping. Across math and science benchmarks with verifiable answers, NAD matches majority voting; on open ended coding benchmarks where majority voting is inapplicable, NAD consistently outperforms Avg@64. By pruning unpromising trajectories early, NAD reduces token usage by 99% with minimal loss in generation quality, showing that internal signals provide reliable, scalable, and efficient guidance for label free ensemble decoding.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Current LLM evaluations often rely on a single instruction template, overlooking models' sensitivity to instruction style-a critical aspect for real-world deployments. We present RCScore, a multi-dimensional framework quantifying how instruction formulation affects model responses. By systematically transforming benchmark problems into multiple instruction styles, RCScore reveals performance variations undetected by conventional metrics. Our experiments across ten LLMs on four reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that instruction style can shift accuracy by up to 16.7% points. We introduce Cross-Response Similarity (CRS), a method applying RCScore metrics to measure stylistic self-consistency, and establish its strong correlation with task accuracy, suggesting consistency as a valuable proxy for model reliability. Additional findings show that deterministic decoding produces more stylistically stable outputs, and model scale correlates positively with cross-style consistency. RCScore offers a principled approach to assess instruction robustness.

  If we cannot inspect the training data of a large language model (LLM), how can we ever know what it has seen? We believe the most compelling evidence arises when the model itself freely reproduces the target content. As such, we propose RECAP, an agentic pipeline designed to elicit and verify memorized training data from LLM outputs. At the heart of RECAP is a feedback-driven loop, where an initial extraction attempt is evaluated by a secondary language model, which compares the output against a reference passage and identifies discrepancies. These are then translated into minimal correction hints, which are fed back into the target model to guide subsequent generations. In addition, to address alignment-induced refusals, RECAP includes a jailbreaking module that detects and overcomes such barriers. We evaluate RECAP on EchoTrace, a new benchmark spanning over 30 full books, and the results show that RECAP leads to substantial gains over single-iteration approaches. For instance, with GPT-4.1, the average ROUGE-L score for the copyrighted text extraction improved from 0.38 to 0.47 - a nearly 24% increase.

  Long-context language models unlock advanced capabilities in reasoning, code generation, and document summarization by leveraging dependencies across extended spans of text. However, a significant portion of readily available long-text data lacks meaningful long-distance dependencies; most spans can be predicted using only local context. Training on such data is inefficient, making careful data selection crucial. Therefore, we introduce LongFilter, a framework for curating training data tailored to long-context pretraining. LongFilter measures the information gain provided by extended context by contrasting model predictions under long-context versus short-context settings, thereby identifying samples where long-range dependencies are essential. Experiments with LLaMA-3-8B, extending its context length from 8K to 64K, show that LongFilter efficiently selects high-quality data and yields substantial improvements on benchmarks such as HELMET, LongBench, and RULER.

  Test-time scaling (TTS) techniques can improve the performance of large language models (LLMs) at the expense of additional computation and latency. While TTS has proven effective in formal domains such as mathematics and programming, its value in argumentative domains such as law remains underexplored. We present an empirical study of verifier-based TTS methods for legal multiple-choice QA (MCQA) across five benchmarks. Using a family of 7 reward models, we evaluate both outcome-level (Best-of-$N$) and process-level (tree search) verification under realistic low-$N$ budgets. Our analysis systematically investigates how verifier utility is affected by key properties such as domain specialization, model size, and supervision type (process-supervised PRMs vs. outcome-only ORMs), even when applied across different roles.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) are exhibiting emergent human-like abilities and are increasingly envisioned as the foundation for simulating an individual's communication style, behavioral tendencies, and personality traits. However, current evaluations of LLM-based persona simulation remain limited: most rely on synthetic dialogues, lack systematic frameworks, and lack analysis of the capability requirement. To address these limitations, we introduce TwinVoice, a comprehensive benchmark for assessing persona simulation across diverse real-world contexts. TwinVoice encompasses three dimensions: Social Persona (public social interactions), Interpersonal Persona (private dialogues), and Narrative Persona (role-based expression). It further decomposes the evaluation of LLM performance into six fundamental capabilities, including opinion consistency, memory recall, logical reasoning, lexical fidelity, persona tone, and syntactic style. Experimental results reveal that while advanced models achieve moderate accuracy in persona simulation, they still fall short of capabilities such as syntactic style and memory recall. Consequently, the average performance achieved by LLMs remains considerably below the human baseline.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Autoformalization, which translates natural language mathematics into machine-verifiable formal statements, is critical for using formal mathematical reasoning to solve math problems stated in natural language. While Large Language Models can generate syntactically correct formal statements, they often fail to preserve the original problem's semantic intent. This limitation arises from the LLM approaches' treating autoformalization as a simplistic translation task which lacks mechanisms for self-reflection and iterative refinement that human experts naturally employ. To address these issues, we propose ReForm, a Reflective Autoformalization method that tightly integrates semantic consistency evaluation into the autoformalization process. This enables the model to iteratively generate formal statements, assess its semantic fidelity, and self-correct identified errors through progressive refinement. To effectively train this reflective model, we introduce Prospective Bounded Sequence Optimization (PBSO), which employs different rewards at different sequence positions to ensure that the model develops both accurate autoformalization and correct semantic validations, preventing superficial critiques that would undermine the purpose of reflection. Extensive experiments across four autoformalization benchmarks demonstrate that ReForm achieves an average improvement of 22.6 percentage points over the strongest baselines. To further ensure evaluation reliability, we introduce ConsistencyCheck, a benchmark of 859 expert-annotated items that not only validates LLMs as judges but also reveals that autoformalization is inherently difficult: even human experts produce semantic errors in up to 38.5% of cases.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The task of information extraction (IE) is to extract structured knowledge from text. However, it is often not straightforward to utilize IE output due to the mismatch between the IE ontology and the downstream application needs. We propose a new formulation of IE TEXT2DB that emphasizes the integration of IE output and the target database (or knowledge base). Given a user instruction, a document set, and a database, our task requires the model to update the database with values from the document set to satisfy the user instruction. This task requires understanding user instructions for what to extract and adapting to the given DB/KB schema for how to extract on the fly. To evaluate this new task, we introduce a new benchmark featuring common demands such as data infilling, row population, and column addition. In addition, we propose an LLM agent framework OPAL (Observe-PlanAnalyze LLM) which includes an Observer component that interacts with the database, the Planner component that generates a code-based plan with calls to IE models, and the Analyzer component that provides feedback regarding code quality before execution. Experiments show that OPAL can successfully adapt to diverse database schemas by generating different code plans and calling the required IE models. We also highlight difficult cases such as dealing with large databases with complex dependencies and extraction hallucination, which we believe deserve further investigation.

  Diffusion language models (DLMs) have emerged as a promising alternative to the long-dominant autoregressive (AR) paradigm, offering a parallelable decoding process that could yield greater efficiency. Yet, in practice, current open-source DLMs often underperform their AR counterparts in speed, limiting their real-world utility. This work presents a systematic study of DLM efficiency, identifying key issues in prior evaluation methods. Through empirical benchmarking and a roofline-based theoretical analysis, we demonstrate that AR models generally achieve higher throughput, while DLMs consistently lag. We also investigate acceleration strategies, finding that techniques like dual cache and parallel decoding mainly offer gains at small batch sizes, with their benefits diminishing upon scaling. Our findings underscore the necessity of robust evaluation methods and improved acceleration strategies to advance research on DLMs.

  Although Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents are increasingly used in financial trading, it remains unclear whether they can reason and adapt in live markets, as most studies test models instead of agents, cover limited periods and assets, and rely on unverified data. To address these gaps, we introduce Agent Market Arena (AMA), the first lifelong, real-time benchmark for evaluating LLM-based trading agents across multiple markets. AMA integrates verified trading data, expert-checked news, and diverse agent architectures within a unified trading framework, enabling fair and continuous comparison under real conditions. It implements four agents, including InvestorAgent as a single-agent baseline, TradeAgent and HedgeFundAgent with different risk styles, and DeepFundAgent with memory-based reasoning, and evaluates them across GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, Claude-3.5-haiku, Claude-sonnet-4, and Gemini-2.0-flash. Live experiments on both cryptocurrency and stock markets demonstrate that agent frameworks display markedly distinct behavioral patterns, spanning from aggressive risk-taking to conservative decision-making, whereas model backbones contribute less to outcome variation. AMA thus establishes a foundation for rigorous, reproducible, and continuously evolving evaluation of financial reasoning and trading intelligence in LLM-based agents.

  In the search for artificial general intelligence, model development and training has focused primarily on vast datasets of known problems and their accepted solutions. This process necessarily produces convergent systems which are fundamentally incapable of the conceptual reframing that is required for genuine creative breakthroughs. Inspired by the divergent cognitive processes that allow humans to make such creative leaps, our work introduces a family of language models, TinyTim, to serve as sources of divergent generation within broader systems. These models have been created by fine-tuning on the anti-parsimonious text of James Joyce's `Finnegans Wake'. Quantitative analysis of both an unsupervised fine-tuned model (TinyTim-V1) and a new instruction-tuned variant (TinyTim-V2) demonstrates a profound capacity for lexical invention; the foundational V1 model exhibits a Yule's K score for lexical richness over twenty times greater than that of convergent baselines. This trait is a stable property of the family, as the instruction-tuned V2 maintains a statistically distinct profile and resists factual convergence, sacrificing benchmark performance to preserve its core generative style. This work establishes a methodology for engineering specialized divergent models that, when paired with convergent systems, can reframe problems and force breakthroughs beyond the reach of statistical optimization alone.

  With the emergence of large language models (LLMs), there is an expectation that LLMs can effectively extract explicit information from complex real-world documents (e.g., papers, reports). However, most LLMs generate paragraph-style answers that are chaotic, disorganized, and untraceable. To bridge this gap, we introduce the Arranged and Organized Extraction Benchmark (AOE), a new bilingual benchmark with data and documents of varying lengths designed to systematically evaluate the ability of LLMs to comprehend fragmented documents and reconstruct isolated information into one organized table. Unlike conventional text-to-table tasks, which rely on fixed schema and narrow task domains, AOE includes 11 carefully crafted tasks across three diverse domains, requiring models to generate context-specific schema tailored to varied input queries. In the experiment, we evaluated both open-source and closed-source state-of-the-art LLMs. The results show that even the most advanced models struggled significantly.

  Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is a critical step in aligning large language models (LLMs) with human instructions and values, yet many aspects of SFT remain poorly understood. We trained a wide range of base models on a variety of datasets including code generation, mathematical reasoning, and general-domain tasks, resulting in 1,000+ SFT models under controlled conditions. We then identified the dataset properties that matter most and examined the layer-wise modifications introduced by SFT. Our findings reveal that some training-task synergies persist across all models while others vary substantially, emphasizing the importance of model-specific strategies. Moreover, we demonstrate that perplexity consistently predicts SFT effectiveness, often surpassing superficial similarity between the training data and the benchmark, and that mid-layer weight changes correlate most strongly with performance gains. We release these 1,000+ SFT models and benchmark results to accelerate further research. All resources are available atthis https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong potential for recommendation by framing item prediction as a token-by-token language generation task. However, existing methods treat all item tokens equally, simply pursuing likelihood maximization during both optimization and decoding. This overlooks crucial token-level differences in decisiveness-many tokens contribute little to item discrimination yet can dominate optimization or decoding. To quantify token decisiveness, we propose a novel perspective that models item generation as a decision process, measuring token decisiveness by the Information Gain (IG) each token provides in reducing uncertainty about the generated item. Our empirical analysis reveals that most tokens have low IG but often correspond to high logits, disproportionately influencing training loss and decoding, which may impair model performance. Building on these insights, we introduce an Information Gain-based Decisiveness-aware Token handling (IGD) strategy that integrates token decisiveness into both tuning and decoding. Specifically, IGD downweights low-IG tokens during tuning and rebalances decoding to emphasize tokens with high IG. In this way, IGD moves beyond pure likelihood maximization, effectively prioritizing high-decisiveness tokens. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets with two LLM backbones demonstrate that IGD consistently improves recommendation accuracy, achieving significant gains on widely used ranking metrics compared to strong baselines.

  Previous research has primarily focused on the cognitive error detection capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), often prompting them to analyze mistakes in reasoning chains. However, few studies have examined the meta-cognitive abilities of LLMs (e.g., their self-awareness of step errors), which are crucial for their reliability. While studies on LLM self-evaluation present some measures, such as perplexity, which can reflect the answer correctness and be viewed as the lens of meta-cognition, they lack step-level analysis and adaptation. This paper studies the evaluation of LLM meta-cognition using the current lenses and how to improve these lenses. Specifically, we propose AutoMeco, an Automated Meta-cognition Evaluation framework for benchmarking the existing lenses. Furthermore, a training-free Markovian Intrinsic Reward Adjustment strategy, MIRA, is proposed to boost current meta-cognition lenses. Experimental results on three mathematical reasoning datasets and three LLMs show the reasonableness of AutoMeco by comparing it with Best-of-N verification. Moreover, the meta-cognition ability of LLMs can be better evaluated using MIRA.

  Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have dominated much of the artificial intelligence scene with their ability to process and generate natural languages. However, the majority of LLM research and development remains English-centric, leaving low-resource languages such as those in the Southeast Asian (SEA) region under-represented. To address this representation gap, we introduce Llama-SEA-LION-v3-8B-IT and Gemma-SEA-LION-v3-9B-IT, two cutting-edge multilingual LLMs designed for SEA languages. The SEA-LION family of LLMs supports 11 SEA languages, namely English, Chinese, Indonesian, Vietnamese, Malay, Thai, Burmese, Lao, Filipino, Tamil, and Khmer. Our work leverages large-scale multilingual continued pre-training with a comprehensive post-training regime involving multiple stages of instruction fine-tuning, alignment, and model merging. Evaluation results on multilingual benchmarks indicate that our models achieve state-of-the-art performance across LLMs supporting SEA languages. We open-source the models to benefit the wider SEA community.

  Lexical Semantic Change Detection (LSCD) is a complex, lemma-level task, which is usually operationalized based on two subsequently applied usage-level tasks: First, Word-in-Context (WiC) labels are derived for pairs of usages. Then, these labels are represented in a graph on which Word Sense Induction (WSI) is applied to derive sense clusters. Finally, LSCD labels are derived by comparing sense clusters over time. This modularity is reflected in most LSCD datasets and models. It also leads to a large heterogeneity in modeling options and task definitions, which is exacerbated by a variety of dataset versions, preprocessing options and evaluation metrics. This heterogeneity makes it difficult to evaluate models under comparable conditions, to choose optimal model combinations or to reproduce results. Hence, we provide a benchmark repository standardizing LSCD evaluation. Through transparent implementation results become easily reproducible and by standardization different components can be freely combined. The repository reflects the task's modularity by allowing model evaluation for WiC, WSI and LSCD. This allows for careful evaluation of increasingly complex model components providing new ways of model optimization. We use the implemented benchmark to conduct a number of experiments with recent models and systematically improve the state-of-the-art.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Despite significant advancements in recent decades, autonomous vehicles (AVs) continue to face challenges in navigating certain traffic scenarios where human drivers excel. In such situations, AVs often become immobilized, disrupting overall traffic flow. Current recovery solutions, such as remote intervention (which is costly and inefficient) and manual takeover (which excludes non-drivers and limits AV accessibility), are inadequate. This paper introduces StuckSolver, a novel Large Language Model (LLM) driven recovery framework that enables AVs to resolve immobilization scenarios through self-reasoning and/or passenger-guided decision-making. StuckSolver is designed as a plug-in add-on module that operates on top of the AV's existing perception-planning-control stack, requiring no modification to its internal architecture. Instead, it interfaces with standard sensor data streams to detect immobilization states, interpret environmental context, and generate high-level recovery commands that can be executed by the AV's native planner. We evaluate StuckSolver on the Bench2Drive benchmark and in custom-designed uncertainty scenarios. Results show that StuckSolver achieves near-state-of-the-art performance through autonomous self-reasoning alone and exhibits further improvements when passenger guidance is incorporated.

  The prohibitive cost of evaluating large language models (LLMs) on comprehensive benchmarks necessitates the creation of small yet representative data subsets (i.e., tiny benchmarks) that enable efficient assessment while retaining predictive fidelity. Current methods for this task operate under a model-centric paradigm, selecting benchmarking items based on the collective performance of existing models. Such approaches are limited by large upfront costs, an inability to immediately handle new benchmarks (`cold-start'), and the fragile assumption that future models will share the failure patterns of their predecessors. In this work, we challenge this paradigm and propose a item-centric approach to benchmark subset selection, arguing that selection should be based on the intrinsic properties of the task items themselves, rather than on model-specific failure patterns. We instantiate this item-centric efficient benchmarking approach via a novel method, Scales++, where data selection is based on the cognitive demands of the benchmark samples. Empirically, we show Scales++ reduces the upfront selection cost by over 18x while achieving competitive predictive fidelity. On the Open LLM Leaderboard, using just a 0.5\% data subset, we predict full benchmark scores with a 2.9% mean absolute error. We demonstrate that this item-centric approach enables more efficient model evaluation without significant fidelity degradation, while also providing better cold-start performance and more interpretable benchmarking.

We also conduct a detailed analysis showing that our *PhysLib* can achieve an average improvement of 11.75% in model performance. This demonstrates the challenging nature of our *LeanPhysBench* and the effectiveness of *PhysLib*. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to provide a physics benchmark in Lean4.

  There is a growing interest in Universal Multimodal Embeddings (UME), where models are required to generate task-specific representations. While recent studies show that Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) perform well on such tasks, they treat MLLMs solely as encoders, overlooking their generative capacity. However, such an encoding paradigm becomes less effective as instructions become more complex and require compositional reasoning. Inspired by the proven effectiveness of chain-of-thought reasoning, we propose a general Think-Then-Embed (TTE) framework for UME, composed of a reasoner and an embedder. The reasoner MLLM first generates reasoning traces that explain complex queries, followed by an embedder that produces representations conditioned on both the original query and the intermediate reasoning. This explicit reasoning step enables more nuanced understanding of complex multimodal instructions. Our contributions are threefold. First, by leveraging a powerful MLLM reasoner, we achieve state-of-the-art performance on the MMEB-V2 benchmark, surpassing proprietary models trained on massive in-house datasets. Second, to reduce the dependency on large MLLM reasoners, we finetune a smaller MLLM reasoner using high-quality embedding-centric reasoning traces, achieving the best performance among open-source models with a 7% absolute gain over recently proposed models. Third, we investigate strategies for integrating the reasoner and embedder into a unified model for improved efficiency without sacrificing performance.

  The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has stimulated interest in multi-agent collaboration for addressing complex medical tasks. However, the practical advantages of multi-agent collaboration approaches remain insufficiently understood. Existing evaluations often lack generalizability, failing to cover diverse tasks reflective of real-world clinical practice, and frequently omit rigorous comparisons against both single-LLM-based and established conventional methods. To address this critical gap, we introduce MedAgentBoard, a comprehensive benchmark for the systematic evaluation of multi-agent collaboration, single-LLM, and conventional approaches. MedAgentBoard encompasses four diverse medical task categories: (1) medical (visual) question answering, (2) lay summary generation, (3) structured Electronic Health Record (EHR) predictive modeling, and (4) clinical workflow automation, across text, medical images, and structured EHR data. Our extensive experiments reveal a nuanced landscape: while multi-agent collaboration demonstrates benefits in specific scenarios, such as enhancing task completeness in clinical workflow automation, it does not consistently outperform advanced single LLMs (e.g., in textual medical QA) or, critically, specialized conventional methods that generally maintain better performance in tasks like medical VQA and EHR-based prediction. MedAgentBoard offers a vital resource and actionable insights, emphasizing the necessity of a task-specific, evidence-based approach to selecting and developing AI solutions in medicine. It underscores that the inherent complexity and overhead of multi-agent collaboration must be carefully weighed against tangible performance gains.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Agents are predominantly evaluated and optimized via task success metrics, which are coarse, rely on manual design from experts, and fail to reward intermediate emergent behaviors. We propose **AutoLibra**, a framework for agent evaluation, that transforms open-ended human feedback *e.g.* "If you find that the button is disabled, don't click it again", or "This agent has too much autonomy to decide what to do on its own" into metrics for evaluating fine-grained behaviors in agent trajectories. AutoLibra accomplishes this by grounding feedback to an agent's behavior, clustering similar positive and negative behaviors, and creating concrete metrics with clear definitions and concrete examples, which can be used for prompting LLM-as-a-Judge as evaluators. We further propose two meta metrics to evaluate the alignment of a set of (induced) metrics with open feedback: "coverage" and "redundancy". Through optimizing these meta-metrics, we experimentally demonstrate AutoLibra's ability to induce more concrete agent evaluation metrics than the ones proposed in previous agent evaluation benchmarks and discover new metrics to analyze agents. We also present two applications of AutoLibra in agent improvement: First, we show that AutoLibra serve human prompt engineers for diagonalize agent failures and improve prompts iterative. Moreover, we find that AutoLibra can induce metrics for automatic optimization for agents, which makes agents improve through self-regulation. Our results suggest that AutoLibra is a powerful task-agnostic tool for evaluating and improving language agents.

  This paper presents a comprehensive cross-platform evaluation of reasoning capabilities in contemporary foundation models, establishing an infrastructure-agnostic benchmark across three computational paradigms: HPC supercomputing (MareNostrum 5), cloud platforms (Nebius AI Studio), and university clusters (a node with eight H200 GPUs).We evaluate 15 foundation models across 79 problems spanning eight academic domains (Physics, Mathematics, Chemistry, Economics, Biology, Statistics, Calculus, and Optimization) through three experimental phases: (1) Baseline establishment: Six models (Mixtral-8x7B, Phi-3, LLaMA 3.1-8B, Gemma-2-9b, Mistral-7B, OLMo-7B) evaluated on 19 problems using MareNostrum 5, establishing methodology and reference performance; (2) Infrastructure validation: The 19-problem benchmark repeated on university cluster (seven models including Falcon-Mamba state-space architecture) and Nebius AI Studio (nine state-of-the-art models: Hermes-4 70B/405B, LLaMA 3.1-405B/3.3-70B, Qwen3 30B/235B, DeepSeek-R1, GPT-OSS 20B/120B) to confirm infrastructure-agnostic reproducibility; (3) Extended evaluation: Full 79-problem assessment on both university cluster and Nebius platforms, probing generalization at scale across architectural diversity.The findings challenge conventional scaling assumptions, establish training data quality as more critical than model size, and provide actionable guidelines for model selection across educational, production, and research contexts. The tri-infrastructure methodology and 79-problem benchmark enable longitudinal tracking of reasoning capabilities as foundation models evolve.

  Normative reasoning is a type of reasoning that involves normative or deontic modality, such as obligation and permission. While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across various reasoning tasks, their ability to handle normative reasoning remains underexplored. In this paper, we systematically evaluate LLMs' reasoning capabilities in the normative domain from both logical and modal perspectives. Specifically, to assess how well LLMs reason with normative modals, we make a comparison between their reasoning with normative modals and their reasoning with epistemic modals, which share a common formal structure. To this end, we introduce a new dataset covering a wide range of formal patterns of reasoning in both normative and epistemic domains, while also incorporating non-formal cognitive factors that influence human reasoning. Our results indicate that, although LLMs generally adhere to valid reasoning patterns, they exhibit notable inconsistencies in specific types of normative reasoning and display cognitive biases similar to those observed in psychological studies of human reasoning. These findings highlight challenges in achieving logical consistency in LLMs' normative reasoning and provide insights for enhancing their reliability.

  Reward models (RMs) play a critical role in aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. Yet in the domain of tool learning, the lack of RMs specifically designed for function-calling tasks has limited progress toward more capable agentic AI. We introduce ToolRM, a family of lightweight generative RMs tailored for general tool-use scenarios. To build these models, we propose a novel pipeline that constructs pairwise preference data using rule-based scoring and multidimensional sampling. This yields ToolPref-Pairwise-30K, a diverse, balanced, and challenging dataset of critique tasks that supports reinforcement learning with verifiable feedback. To evaluate tool-use RMs, we also introduce TRBench$_{BFCL}$, a benchmark built on the agentic evaluation suite BFCL. Trained on our constructed data, models from the Qwen3-4B/8B series achieve up to 14.28% higher accuracy, substantially outperforming frontier models such as Claude 4 and OpenAI o3 in pairwise reward judgments. Beyond training objectives, ToolRM generalizes to broader critique tasks, including Best-of-N sampling and self-correction. Experiments on ACEBench highlight its effectiveness and efficiency, enabling inference-time scaling and reducing output token usage by over 66%. We release data and model checkpoints to facilitate future research.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning is critical for improving the interpretability and reliability of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). However, existing training algorithms such as SFT, PPO, and GRPO may not generalize well across unseen reasoning tasks and heavily rely on a biased reward model. To address this challenge, we reformulate reasoning in LVLMs as posterior inference and propose a scalable training algorithm based on amortized variational inference. By leveraging diversity-seeking reinforcement learning algorithms, we introduce a novel sparse reward function for token-level learning signals that encourage diverse, high-likelihood latent CoT, overcoming deterministic sampling limitations and avoiding reward hacking. Additionally, we implement a Bayesian inference-scaling strategy that replaces costly Best-of-N and Beam Search with a marginal likelihood to efficiently rank optimal rationales and answers. We empirically demonstrate that the proposed method enhances the state-of-the-art LVLMs on seven reasoning benchmarks, in terms of effectiveness, generalization, and interpretability.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Language interpretation is a compositional process, in which the meaning of more complex linguistic structures is inferred from the meaning of their parts. Large language models possess remarkable language interpretation capabilities and have been successfully applied to interpret questions by mapping them to SPARQL queries. An open question is how systematic this interpretation process is. Toward this question, in this paper, we propose a benchmark for investigating to what extent the abilities of LLMs to interpret questions are actually compositional. For this, we generate three datasets of varying difficulty based on graph patterns in DBpedia, relying on Lemon lexica for verbalization. Our datasets are created in a very controlled fashion in order to test the ability of LLMs to interpret structurally complex questions, given that they have seen the atomic building blocks. This allows us to evaluate to what degree LLMs are able to interpret complex questions for which they "understand" the atomic parts. We conduct experiments with models of different sizes using both various prompt and few-shot optimization techniques as well as fine-tuning. Our results show that performance in terms of macro $F_1$ degrades from $0.45$ over $0.26$ down to $0.09$ with increasing deviation from the samples optimized on. Even when all necessary information was provided to the model in the input, the $F_1$ scores do not exceed $0.57$ for the dataset of lowest complexity. We thus conclude that LLMs struggle to systematically and compositionally interpret questions and map them into SPARQL queries.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Authorizing Large Language Model driven agents to dynamically invoke tools and access protected resources introduces significant risks, since current methods for delegating authorization grant overly broad permissions and give access to tools allowing agents to operate beyond the intended task scope. We introduce and assess a delegated authorization model enabling authorization servers to semantically inspect access requests to protected resources, and issue access tokens constrained to the minimal set of scopes necessary for the agents' assigned tasks. Given the unavailability of datasets centered on delegated authorization flows, particularly including both semantically appropriate and inappropriate scope requests for a given task, we introduce ASTRA, a dataset and data generation pipeline for benchmarking semantic matching between tasks and scopes. Our experiments show both the potential and current limitations of model-based matching, particularly as the number of scopes needed for task completion increases. Our results highlight the need for further research into semantic matching techniques enabling intent-aware authorization for multi-agent and tool-augmented applications, including fine-grained control, such as Task-Based Access Control (TBAC).

  We present EdgeRunner 20B, a fine-tuned version of gpt-oss-20b optimized for military tasks. EdgeRunner 20B was trained on 1.6M high-quality records curated from military documentation and websites. We also present four new tests sets: (a) combat arms, (b) combat medic, (c) cyber operations, and (d) mil-bench-5k (general military knowledge). On these military test sets, EdgeRunner 20B matches or exceeds GPT-5 task performance with 95%+ statistical significance, except for the high reasoning setting on the combat medic test set and the low reasoning setting on the mil-bench-5k test set. Versus gpt-oss-20b, there is no statistically-significant regression on general-purpose benchmarks like ARC-C, GPQA Diamond, GSM8k, IFEval, MMLU Pro, or TruthfulQA, except for GSM8k in the low reasoning setting. We also present analyses on hyperparameter settings, cost, and throughput. These findings show that small, locally-hosted models are ideal solutions for data-sensitive operations such as in the military domain, allowing for deployment in air-gapped edge devices.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large reasoning models (LRMs) achieve higher task performance by allocating more inference-time compute, and prior works suggest this scaled reasoning may also strengthen safety by improving refusal. Yet we find the opposite: the same reasoning can be used to bypass safeguards. We introduce Chain-of-Thought Hijacking, a jailbreak attack on reasoning models. The attack pads harmful requests with long sequences of harmless puzzle reasoning. Across HarmBench, CoT Hijacking reaches a 99%, 94%, 100%, and 94% attack success rate (ASR) on Gemini 2.5 Pro, GPT o4 mini, Grok 3 mini, and Claude 4 Sonnet, respectively - far exceeding prior jailbreak methods for LRMs. To understand the effectiveness of our attack, we turn to a mechanistic analysis, which shows that mid layers encode the strength of safety checking, while late layers encode the verification outcome. Long benign CoT dilutes both signals by shifting attention away from harmful tokens. Targeted ablations of attention heads identified by this analysis causally decrease refusal, confirming their role in a safety subnetwork. These results show that the most interpretable form of reasoning - explicit CoT - can itself become a jailbreak vector when combined with final-answer cues. We release prompts, outputs, and judge decisions to facilitate replication.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Group based reinforcement learning (RL) has shown impressive results on complex reasoning and mathematical tasks. Yet, when applied to train multi-turn, interactive LLM agents, these methods often suffer from structural blindness-the inability to exploit the underlying connectivity of the environment. This manifests in three critical challenges: (1) inefficient, unguided exploration, (2) imprecise credit assignment due to overlooking pivotal states, and (3) myopic planning caused by static reward discounting. We address these issues with Graph-Enhanced Policy Optimization (GEPO), which dynamically constructs a state-transition graph from agent experience and employs graph-theoretic centrality to provide three synergistic learning signals: (1)structured intrinsic rewards that guide exploration toward high-impact states, (2) a graph-enhanced advantage function for topology-aware credit assignment, and (3) a dynamic discount factor adapted to each state's strategic value. On the ALFWorld, WebShop, and a proprietary Workbench benchmarks, GEPO demonstrates strong performance, achieving absolute success rate gains of +4.1%, +5.3%, and +10.9% over competitive baselines. These results highlight that explicitly modeling environmental structure is a robust, generalizable strategy for advancing LLM agent training.

  Millions of people take surveys every day, from market polls and academic studies to medical questionnaires and customer feedback forms. These datasets capture valuable insights, but their scale and structure present a unique challenge for large language models (LLMs), which otherwise excel at few-shot reasoning over open-ended text. Yet, their ability to process questionnaire data or lists of questions crossed with hundreds of respondent rows remains underexplored. Current retrieval and survey analysis tools (e.g., Qualtrics, SPSS, REDCap) are typically designed for humans in the workflow, limiting such data integration with LLM and AI-empowered automation. This gap leaves scientists, surveyors, and everyday users without evidence-based guidance on how to best represent questionnaires for LLM consumption. We address this by introducing QASU (Questionnaire Analysis and Structural Understanding), a benchmark that probes six structural skills, including answer lookup, respondent count, and multi-hop inference, across six serialization formats and multiple prompt strategies. Experiments on contemporary LLMs show that choosing an effective format and prompt combination can improve accuracy by up to 8.8% points compared to suboptimal formats. For specific tasks, carefully adding a lightweight structural hint through self-augmented prompting can yield further improvements of 3-4% points on average. By systematically isolating format and prompting effects, our open source benchmark offers a simple yet versatile foundation for advancing both research and real-world practice in LLM-based questionnaire analysis.

  Large language models (LLMs) are catalyzing the development of autonomous AI research agents for scientific and engineering discovery. We present FM Agent, a novel and general-purpose multi-agent framework that leverages a synergistic combination of LLM-based reasoning and large-scale evolutionary search to address complex real-world challenges. The core of FM Agent integrates several key innovations: 1) a cold-start initialization phase incorporating expert guidance, 2) a novel evolutionary sampling strategy for iterative optimization, 3) domain-specific evaluators that combine correctness, effectiveness, and LLM-supervised feedback, and 4) a distributed, asynchronous execution infrastructure built on Ray. Demonstrating broad applicability, our system has been evaluated across diverse domains, including operations research, machine learning, GPU kernel optimization, and classical mathematical problems. FM Agent reaches state-of-the-art results autonomously, without human interpretation or tuning -- 1976.3 on ALE-Bench (+5.2\%), 43.56\% on MLE-Bench (+4.0pp), up to 20x speedups on KernelBench, and establishes new state-of-the-art(SOTA) results on several classical mathematical problems. Beyond academic benchmarks, FM Agent shows considerable promise for both large-scale enterprise R\&D workflows and fundamental scientific research, where it can accelerate innovation, automate complex discovery processes, and deliver substantial engineering and scientific advances with broader societal impact.

  The inference cost of Large Language Models (LLMs) has become a critical factor in determining their commercial viability and widespread adoption. This paper introduces a quantitative ``economics of inference'' framework, treating the LLM inference process as a compute-driven intelligent production activity. We analyze its marginal cost, economies of scale, and quality of output under various performance configurations. Based on empirical data from WiNEval-3.0, we construct the first ``LLM Inference Production Frontier,'' revealing three principles: diminishing marginal cost, diminishing returns to scale, and an optimal cost-effectiveness zone. This paper not only provides an economic basis for model deployment decisions but also lays an empirical foundation for the future market-based pricing and optimization of AI inference resources.

  Large vision language models (VLMs) have advanced graphical user interface (GUI) task automation but still lag behind humans. We hypothesize this gap stems from missing core GUI knowledge, which existing training schemes (such as supervised fine tuning and reinforcement learning) alone cannot fully address. By analyzing common failure patterns in GUI task execution, we distill GUI knowledge into three dimensions: (1) interface perception, knowledge about recognizing widgets and system states; (2) interaction prediction, knowledge about reasoning action state transitions; and (3) instruction understanding, knowledge about planning, verifying, and assessing task completion progress. We further introduce GUI Knowledge Bench, a benchmark with multiple choice and yes/no questions across six platforms (Web, Android, MacOS, Windows, Linux, IOS) and 292 applications. Our evaluation shows that current VLMs identify widget functions but struggle with perceiving system states, predicting actions, and verifying task completion. Experiments on real world GUI tasks further validate the close link between GUI knowledge and task success. By providing a structured framework for assessing GUI knowledge, our work supports the selection of VLMs with greater potential prior to downstream training and provides insights for building more capable GUI agents.

  Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated transformative potential in scientific research, yet their deployment in high-stakes contexts raises significant trustworthiness concerns. Here, we introduce SciTrust 2.0, a comprehensive framework for evaluating LLM trustworthiness in scientific applications across four dimensions: truthfulness, adversarial robustness, scientific safety, and scientific ethics. Our framework incorporates novel, open-ended truthfulness benchmarks developed through a verified reflection-tuning pipeline and expert validation, alongside a novel ethics benchmark for scientific research contexts covering eight subcategories including dual-use research and bias. We evaluated seven prominent LLMs, including four science-specialized models and three general-purpose industry models, using multiple evaluation metrics including accuracy, semantic similarity measures, and LLM-based scoring. General-purpose industry models overall outperformed science-specialized models across each trustworthiness dimension, with GPT-o4-mini demonstrating superior performance in truthfulness assessments and adversarial robustness. Science-specialized models showed significant deficiencies in logical and ethical reasoning capabilities, along with concerning vulnerabilities in safety evaluations, particularly in high-risk domains such as biosecurity and chemical weapons. By open-sourcing our framework, we provide a foundation for developing more trustworthy AI systems and advancing research on model safety and ethics in scientific contexts.

  Reinforcement Learning (RL) has demonstrated significant potential in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, the success of RL for LLMs heavily relies on human-curated datasets and verifiable rewards, which limit their scalability and generality. Recent Self-Play RL methods, inspired by the success of the paradigm in games and Go, aim to enhance LLM reasoning capabilities without human-annotated data. However, their methods primarily depend on a grounded environment for feedback (e.g., a Python interpreter or a game engine); extending them to general domains remains challenging. To address these challenges, we propose Multi-Agent Evolve (MAE), a framework that enables LLMs to self-evolve in solving diverse tasks, including mathematics, reasoning, and general knowledge Q&A. The core design of MAE is based on a triplet of interacting agents (Proposer, Solver, Judge) that are instantiated from a single LLM, and applies reinforcement learning to optimize their behaviors. The Proposer generates questions, the Solver attempts solutions, and the Judge evaluates both while co-evolving. Experiments on Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct demonstrate that MAE achieves an average improvement of 4.54% on multiple benchmarks. These results highlight MAE as a scalable, data-efficient method for enhancing the general reasoning abilities of LLMs with minimal reliance on human-curated supervision.

  LLM-based agents are increasingly moving towards proactivity: rather than awaiting instruction, they exercise agency to anticipate user needs and solve them autonomously. However, evaluating proactivity is challenging; current benchmarks are constrained to localized context, limiting their ability to test reasoning across sources and longer time horizons. To address this gap, we present PROBE (Proactive Resolution Of BottlEnecks). PROBE decomposes proactivity as a pipeline of three core capabilities: (1) searching for unspecified issues, (2) identifying specific bottlenecks, and (3) executing appropriate resolutions. We apply PROBE to evaluate leading LLMs and popular agentic frameworks, showing that even state-of-the-art models struggle to solve this benchmark. Computing our consistent measurements across frontier LLMs and agents, we find that the best end-to-end performance of 40% is achieved by both GPT-5 and Claude Opus-4.1. Additionally, we demonstrate the relative capabilities of each model and analyze mutual failure modes. Our results highlight the current limitations of autonomous action in agentic systems, and expose promising future research directions.

  Geospatial data offers immense potential for understanding our planet. However, the sheer volume and diversity of this data along with its varied resolutions, timescales, and sparsity pose significant challenges for thorough analysis and interpretation. This paper introduces Earth AI, a family of geospatial AI models and agentic reasoning that enables significant advances in our ability to unlock novel and profound insights into our planet. This approach is built upon foundation models across three key domains--Planet-scale Imagery, Population, and Environment--and an intelligent Gemini-powered reasoning engine. We present rigorous benchmarks showcasing the power and novel capabilities of our foundation models and validate that when used together, they provide complementary value for geospatial inference and their synergies unlock superior predictive capabilities. To handle complex, multi-step queries, we developed a Gemini-powered agent that jointly reasons over our multiple foundation models along with large geospatial data sources and tools. On a new benchmark of real-world crisis scenarios, our agent demonstrates the ability to deliver critical and timely insights, effectively bridging the gap between raw geospatial data and actionable understanding.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable progress through preference-based fine-tuning, which critically depends on the quality of the underlying training data. While human feedback is essential for improving data quality, it is costly and does not scale well. In this paper, we introduce Refine-n-Judge, an automated iterative approach that leverages a single LLM as both a refiner and a judge to enhance dataset quality. Unlike existing iterative refinement methods, Refine-n-Judge employs an LLM to both generate refinements and explicitly evaluate each improvement, ensuring that every iteration meaningfully enhances the dataset without requiring additional human annotation or a separate reward model. At each step, the LLM refines a response and judges whether the refinement is an improvement over the previous answer. This process continues until the LLM prefers the initial answer over the refinement, indicating no further improvements. This produces sequences of increasing quality, preference-labeled responses ideal for fine-tuning.We demonstrate the effectiveness of Refine-n-Judge across a range of public datasets spanning five corpora, targeting tasks such as coding, math, and conversation. Models (Llama 3.1-8B and Llama 3.3-70B) fine-tuned on Refine-n-Judge-enhanced datasets were preferred by LLM judges in over 74% of comparisons against models tuned on the original dataset by GPT-4. Additionally, we report performance gains: +5% on AlpacaEval and AlpacaEval 2.0, and +19% on MT-Bench. Our results indicate that Refine-n-Judge produces high-quality datasets and scalable model improvements.

To realize this novel paradigm, we introduce a comprehensive framework for constructing verifier-driven mobile agents: the discretized action space construction coupled with the prefilling-only workflow to accelerate the verification process, the pair-wise progress preference training to significantly enhance the verifier's decision-making capabilities, and the scalable human-agent joint annotation scheme to efficiently collect the necessary data at scale. V-Droid obtains a substantial task success rate across several public mobile task automation benchmarks: 59.5% on AndroidWorld, 38.3% on AndroidLab, and 49% on MobileAgentBench, surpassing existing agents by 5.2%, 2.1%, and 9%, respectively. Furthermore, V-Droid achieves a remarkably low latency of 4.3s per step, which is 6.1x faster compared with existing mobile agents. The source code is available atthis https URL.
