- **[Time Reversal Symmetry for Efficient Robotic Manipulations in Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13925)**  `arXiv:2505.13925`  `cs.RO` `cs.LG`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Symmetry is pervasive in robotics and has been widely exploited to improve sample efficiency in deep reinforcement learning (DRL). However, existing approaches primarily focus on spatial symmetries, such as reflection, rotation, and translation, while largely neglecting temporal symmetries. To address this gap, we explore time reversal symmetry, a form of temporal symmetry commonly found in robotics tasks such as door opening and closing. We propose Time Reversal symmetry enhanced Deep Reinforcement Learning (TR-DRL), a framework that combines trajectory reversal augmentation and time reversal guided reward shaping to efficiently solve temporally symmetric tasks. Our method generates reversed transitions from fully reversible transitions, identified by a proposed dynamics-consistent filter, to augment the training data. For partially reversible transitions, we apply reward shaping to guide learning, according to successful trajectories from the reversed task. Extensive experiments on the Robosuite and MetaWorld benchmarks demonstrate that TR-DRL is effective in both single-task and multi-task settings, achieving higher sample efficiency and stronger final performance compared to baseline methods.

  Recent vision-language-action (VLA) models for multi-task robotic manipulation commonly rely on static viewpoints and shared visual encoders, which limit 3D perception and cause task interference, hindering robustness and generalization. In this work, we propose Task-Aware View Planning (TAVP), a framework designed to overcome these challenges by integrating active view planning with task-specific representation learning. TAVP employs an efficient exploration policy, accelerated by a novel pseudo-environment, to actively acquire informative views. Furthermore, we introduce a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) visual encoder to disentangle features across different tasks, boosting both representation fidelity and task generalization. By learning to see the world in a task-aware way, TAVP generates more complete and discriminative visual representations, demonstrating significantly enhanced action prediction across a wide array of manipulation challenges. Extensive experiments on RLBench tasks show that our proposed TAVP model achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art fixed-view approaches.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Robot learning of manipulation skills is hindered by the scarcity of diverse, unbiased datasets. While curated datasets can help, challenges remain in generalizability and real-world transfer. Meanwhile, large-scale "in-the-wild" video datasets have driven progress in computer vision through self-supervised techniques. Translating this to robotics, recent works have explored learning manipulation skills by passively watching abundant videos sourced online. Showing promising results, such video-based learning paradigms provide scalable supervision while reducing dataset bias. This survey reviews foundations such as video feature representation learning techniques, object affordance understanding, 3D hand/body modeling, and large-scale robot resources, as well as emerging techniques for acquiring robot manipulation skills from uncontrolled video demonstrations. We discuss how learning only from observing large-scale human videos can enhance generalization and sample efficiency for robotic manipulation. The survey summarizes video-based learning approaches, analyses their benefits over standard datasets, survey metrics, and benchmarks, and discusses open challenges and future directions in this nascent domain at the intersection of computer vision, natural language processing, and robot learning.

- **[EfficientNav: Towards On-Device Object-Goal Navigation with Navigation Map Caching and Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18546)**  `arXiv:2510.18546`  `cs.RO` `cs.AI`  
  _Zebin Yang, Sunjian Zheng, Tong Xie, Tianshi Xu, Bo Yu, Fan Wang, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Object-goal navigation (ObjNav) tasks an agent with navigating to the location of a specific object in an unseen environment. Embodied agents equipped with large language models (LLMs) and online constructed navigation maps can perform ObjNav in a zero-shot manner. However, existing agents heavily rely on giant LLMs on the cloud, e.g., GPT-4, while directly switching to small LLMs, e.g., LLaMA3.2-11b, suffer from significant success rate drops due to limited model capacity for understanding complex navigation maps, which prevents deploying ObjNav on local devices. At the same time, the long prompt introduced by the navigation map description will cause high planning latency on local devices. In this paper, we propose EfficientNav to enable on-device efficient LLM-based zero-shot ObjNav. To help the smaller LLMs better understand the environment, we propose semantics-aware memory retrieval to prune redundant information in navigation maps. To reduce planning latency, we propose discrete memory caching and attention-based memory clustering to efficiently save and re-use the KV cache. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that EfficientNav achieves 11.1% improvement in success rate on HM3D benchmark over GPT-4-based baselines, and demonstrates 6.7x real-time latency reduction and 4.7x end-to-end latency reduction over GPT-4 planner. Our code will be released soon.

  Integrating visual-language instructions into visuomotor policies is gaining momentum in robot learning for enhancing open-world generalization. Despite promising advances, existing approaches face two challenges: limited language steerability when no generated reasoning is used as a condition, or significant inference latency when reasoning isthis http URLthis work, we introduce MoTVLA, a mixture-of-transformers (MoT)-based vision-language-action (VLA) model that integrates fast-slow unified reasoning with behavior policy learning. MoTVLA preserves the general intelligence of pre-trained VLMs (serving as the generalist) for tasks such as perception, scene understanding, and semantic planning, while incorporating a domain expert, a second transformer that shares knowledge with the pretrained VLM, to generate domain-specific fast reasoning (e.g., robot motion decomposition), thereby improving policy execution efficiency. By conditioning the action expert on decomposed motion instructions, MoTVLA can learn diverse behaviors and substantially improve language steerability. Extensive evaluations across natural language processing benchmarks, robotic simulation environments, and real-world experiments confirm the superiority of MoTVLA in both fast-slow reasoning and manipulation task performance.

  Testing on real machines is indispensable for robotic control algorithms. In the context of learning-based algorithms, especially VLA models, demand for large-scale evaluation, i.e. testing a large number of models on a large number of tasks, is becoming increasingly urgent. However, doing this right is highly non-trivial, especially when scalability and reproducibility is taken into account. In this report, we describe our methodology for constructing RoboChallenge, an online evaluation system to test robotic control algorithms, and our survey of recent state-of-the-art VLA models using our initial benchmark Table30.

- **[DDBot: Differentiable Physics-based Digging Robot for Unknown Granular Materials](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17335)**  `arXiv:2510.17335`  `cs.RO`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Automating the manipulation of granular materials poses significant challenges due to complex contact dynamics, unpredictable material properties, and intricate system states. Existing approaches often fail to achieve efficiency and accuracy in such tasks. To fill the research gap, this paper studies the small-scale and high-precision granular material digging task with unknown physical properties. A new framework, named differentiable digging robot (DDBot), is proposed to manipulate granular materials, including sand and soil.Specifically, we equip DDBot with a differentiable physics-based simulator, tailored for granular material manipulation, powered by GPU-accelerated parallel computing and automatic differentiation. DDBot can perform efficient differentiable system identification and high-precision digging skill optimisation for unknown granular materials, which is enabled by a differentiable skill-to-action mapping, a task-oriented demonstration method, gradient clipping and line search-based gradient descent.Experimental results show that DDBot can efficiently (converge within 5 to 20 minutes) identify unknown granular material dynamics and optimise digging skills, with high-precision results in zero-shot real-world deployments, highlighting its practicality. Benchmark results against state-of-the-art baselines also confirm the robustness and efficiency of DDBot in such digging tasks.

- **[Learn2Decompose: Learning Problem Decomposition for Efficient Sequential Multi-object Manipulation Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06843)**  `arXiv:2408.06843`  `cs.RO`  
  _Yan Zhang, Teng Xue, Amirreza Razmjoo, Sylvain Calinon_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present an efficient task and motion replanning approach for sequential multi-object manipulation in dynamic environments. Conventional Task And Motion Planning (TAMP) solvers experience an exponential increase in planning time as the planning horizon and number of objects grow, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios. To address this, we propose learning problem decompositions from demonstrations to accelerate TAMP solvers. Our approach consists of three key components: goal decomposition learning, computational distance learning, and object reduction. Goal decomposition identifies the necessary sequences of states that the system must pass through before reaching the final goal, treating them as subgoal sequences. Computational distance learning predicts the computational complexity between two states, enabling the system to identify the temporally closest subgoal from a disturbed state. Object reduction minimizes the set of active objects considered during replanning, further improving efficiency. We evaluate our approach on three benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness in improving replanning efficiency for sequential multi-object manipulation tasks in dynamic environments.

- **[Static Sandboxes Are Inadequate: Modeling Societal Complexity Requires Open-Ended Co-Evolution in LLM-Based Multi-Agent Simulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13982)**  `arXiv:2510.13982`  `cs.MA` `cs.AI`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  What if artificial agents could not just communicate, but also evolve, adapt, and reshape their worlds in ways we cannot fully predict? With llm now powering multi-agent systems and social simulations, we are witnessing new possibilities for modeling open-ended, ever-changing environments. Yet, most current simulations remain constrained within static sandboxes, characterized by predefined tasks, limited dynamics, and rigid evaluation criteria. These limitations prevent them from capturing the complexity of real-world societies. In this paper, we argue that static, task-specific benchmarks are fundamentally inadequate and must be rethought. We critically review emerging architectures that blend llm with multi-agent dynamics, highlight key hurdles such as balancing stability and diversity, evaluating unexpected behaviors, and scaling to greater complexity, and introduce a fresh taxonomy for this rapidly evolving field. Finally, we present a research roadmap centered on open-endedness, continuous co-evolution, and the development of resilient, socially aligned AI ecosystems. We call on the community to move beyond static paradigms and help shape the next generation of adaptive, socially-aware multi-agent simulations.

- **[Adaptive Coopetition: Leveraging Coarse Verifier Signals for Resilient Multi-Agent LLM Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18179)**  `arXiv:2510.18179`  `cs.MA`  
  _Rui Jerry Huang, Wendy Liu, Anastasia Miin_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Inference-time computation is a critical yet challenging paradigm for enhancing the reasoning performance of large language models (LLMs). While existing strategies improve reasoning stability and consistency, they suffer from notable limitations: self-correction often reinforces the model's initial biases, and Multi-Agent Collaboration (MAC) often fails due to the lack of efficient coordination mechanisms, leading to collective errors. Although high-performing verifiers can detect reasoning errors, making them reliable requires substantial training. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel inference-time framework, Adaptive Coopetition (AdCo), in which LLM agents utilize an adaptive, UCB-based "coopetition" mechanism. At each round, agents leverage coarse verifier signals to determine whether to collaborate or compete, and iteratively refine their reasoning based on peer feedback. Without relying on high-performance verifiers, our adaptive strategy achieves significant performance gains on mathematical reasoning benchmarks, yielding a 20% relative improvement over baselines on the more challenging dataset. Our approach remains robust and consistent in terms of accuracy under different sample sizes and configurations. This adaptive, signal-guided "coopetition" framework enhances reasoning robustness by leveraging both model knowledge diversity and reasoning trace measures, while also promoting uncertainty-driven exploration, especially when participants have comparable capabilities. From this perspective, our work offers a fresh lens on inference-time computation and paves the way for more resilient multi-agent LLM systems. Our code is available at:this https URL.

- **[Wonder Wins Ways: Curiosity-Driven Exploration through Multi-Agent Contextual Calibration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20648)**  `arXiv:2509.20648`  `cs.LG` `cs.RO`  
  _Yiyuan Pan, Zhe Liu, Hesheng Wang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Autonomous exploration in complex multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) with sparse rewards critically depends on providing agents with effective intrinsic motivation. While artificial curiosity offers a powerful self-supervised signal, it often confuses environmental stochasticity with meaningful novelty. Moreover, existing curiosity mechanisms exhibit a uniform novelty bias, treating all unexpected observations equally. However, peer behavior novelty, which encode latent task dynamics, are often overlooked, resulting in suboptimal exploration in decentralized, communication-free MARL settings. To this end, inspired by how human children adaptively calibrate their own exploratory behaviors via observing peers, we propose a novel approach to enhance multi-agent exploration. We introduce CERMIC, a principled framework that empowers agents to robustly filter noisy surprise signals and guide exploration by dynamically calibrating their intrinsic curiosity with inferred multi-agent context. Additionally, CERMIC generates theoretically-grounded intrinsic rewards, encouraging agents to explore state transitions with high information gain. We evaluate CERMIC on benchmark suites including VMAS, Meltingpot, and SMACv2. Empirical results demonstrate that exploration with CERMIC significantly outperforms SoTA algorithms in sparse-reward environments.

- **[The Impact of Coreset Selection on Spurious Correlations and Group Robustness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11690)**  `arXiv:2507.11690`  `cs.LG` `cs.CV`  
  _Amaya Dharmasiri, William Yang, Polina Kirichenko, Lydia Liu, Olga Russakovsky_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Coreset selection methods have shown promise in reducing the training data size while maintaining model performance for data-efficient machine learning. However, as many datasets suffer from biases that cause models to learn spurious correlations instead of causal features, it is important to understand whether and how dataset reduction methods may perpetuate, amplify, or mitigate these biases. In this work, we conduct the first comprehensive analysis of the implications of data selection on the spurious bias levels of the selected coresets and the robustness of downstream models trained on them. We use an extensive experimental setting spanning ten different spurious correlations benchmarks, five score metrics to characterize sample importance/ difficulty, and five data selection policies across a broad range of coreset sizes. Thereby, we unravel a series of nontrivial nuances in interactions between sample difficulty and bias alignment, as well as dataset bias and resultant model robustness. For example, we find that selecting coresets using embedding-based sample characterization scores runs a comparatively lower risk of inadvertently exacerbating bias than selecting using characterizations based on learning dynamics. Most importantly, our analysis reveals that although some coreset selection methods could achieve lower bias levels by prioritizing difficult samples, they do not reliably guarantee downstream robustness.

  _Rikard Vinge, Isabelle Wittmann, Jannik Schneider, Michael Marszalek, Luis Gilch, Thomas Brunschwiler, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce NeuCo-Bench, a novel benchmark framework for evaluating (lossy) neural compression and representation learning in the context of Earth Observation (EO). Our approach builds on fixed-size embeddings that act as compact, task-agnostic representations applicable to a broad range of downstream tasks. NeuCo-Bench comprises three core components: (i) an evaluation pipeline built around reusable embeddings, (ii) a new challenge mode with a hidden-task leaderboard designed to mitigate pretraining bias, and (iii) a scoring system that balances accuracy and stability. To support reproducibility, we release SSL4EO-S12-downstream, a curated multispectral, multitemporal EO dataset. We present initial results from a public challenge at the 2025 CVPR EARTHVISION workshop and conduct ablations with state-of-the-art foundation models. NeuCo-Bench provides a first step towards community-driven, standardized evaluation of neural embeddings for EO and beyond.

- **[Hierarchical Federated Unlearning for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17895)**  `arXiv:2510.17895`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI` `cs.CL`  
  _Yisheng Zhong, Zhengbang Yang, Zhuangdi Zhu_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into real-world applications, raising concerns about privacy, security and the need to remove undesirable knowledge. Machine Unlearning has emerged as a promising solution, yet faces two key challenges: (1) practical unlearning needs are often continuous and heterogeneous, and (2) they involve decentralized, sensitive data with asymmetric access. These factors result in inter-domain and intra-domain interference, which further amplifies the dilemma of unbalanced forgetting and retaining performance. In response, we propose a federated unlearning approach for LLMs that is scalable and privacy preserving. Our method decouples unlearning and retention via task-specific adapter learning and employs a hierarchical merging strategy to mitigate conflicting objectives and enables robust, adaptable unlearning updates. Comprehensive experiments on benchmarks of WMDP, MUSE, and TOFU showed that our approach effectively handles heterogeneous unlearning requests while maintaining strong LLM utility compared with baseline methods.

- **[Benchmarking Fairness-aware Graph Neural Networks in Knowledge Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18473)**  `arXiv:2510.18473`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Yuya Sasaki_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Graph neural networks (GNNs) are powerful tools for learning from graph-structured data but often produce biased predictions with respect to sensitive attributes. Fairness-aware GNNs have been actively studied for mitigating biased predictions. However, no prior studies have evaluated fairness-aware GNNs on knowledge graphs, which are one of the most important graphs in many applications, such as recommender systems. Therefore, we introduce a benchmarking study on knowledge graphs. We generate new graphs from three knowledge graphs, YAGO, DBpedia, and Wikidata, that are significantly larger than the existing graph datasets used in fairness studies. We benchmark inprocessing and preprocessing methods in different GNN backbones and early stopping conditions. We find several key insights: (i) knowledge graphs show different trends from existing datasets; clearer trade-offs between prediction accuracy and fairness metrics than other graphs in fairness-aware GNNs, (ii) the performance is largely affected by not only fairness-aware GNN methods but also GNN backbones and early stopping conditions, and (iii) preprocessing methods often improve fairness metrics, while inprocessing methods improve prediction accuracy.

- **[Learning from N-Tuple Data with M Positive Instances: Unbiased Risk Estimation and Theoretical Guarantees](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18406)**  `arXiv:2510.18406`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Miao Zhang, Junpeng Li, ChangChun HUa, Yana Yang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Weakly supervised learning often operates with coarse aggregate signals rather than instance labels. We study a setting where each training example is an $n$-tuple containing exactly m positives, while only the count m per tuple is observed. This NTMP (N-tuple with M positives) supervision arises in, e.g., image classification with region proposals and multi-instance measurements. We show that tuple counts admit a trainable unbiased risk estimator (URE) by linking the tuple-generation process to latent instance marginals. Starting from fixed (n,m), we derive a closed-form URE and extend it to variable tuple sizes, variable counts, and their combination. Identification holds whenever the effective mixing rate is separated from the class prior. We establish generalization bounds via Rademacher complexity and prove statistical consistency with standard rates under mild regularity assumptions. To improve finite-sample stability, we introduce simple ReLU corrections to the URE that preserve asymptotic correctness. Across benchmarks converted to NTMP tasks, the approach consistently outperforms representative weak-supervision baselines and yields favorable precision-recall and F1 trade-offs. It remains robust under class-prior imbalance and across diverse tuple configurations, demonstrating that count-only supervision can be exploited effectively through a theoretically grounded and practically stable objective.

- **[Scalable, Explainable and Provably Robust Anomaly Detection with One-Step Flow Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18328)**  `arXiv:2510.18328`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Zhong Li, Qi Huang, Yuxuan Zhu, Lincen Yang, Mohammad Mohammadi Amiri, Niki van Stein, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce Time-Conditioned Contraction Matching (TCCM), a novel method for semi-supervised anomaly detection in tabular data. TCCM is inspired by flow matching, a recent generative modeling framework that learns velocity fields between probability distributions and has shown strong performance compared to diffusion models and generative adversarial networks. Instead of directly applying flow matching as originally formulated, TCCM builds on its core idea -- learning velocity fields between distributions -- but simplifies the framework by predicting a time-conditioned contraction vector toward a fixed target (the origin) at each sampled time step. This design offers three key advantages: (1) a lightweight and scalable training objective that removes the need for solving ordinary differential equations during training and inference; (2) an efficient scoring strategy called one time-step deviation, which quantifies deviation from expected contraction behavior in a single forward pass, addressing the inference bottleneck of existing continuous-time models such as DTE (a diffusion-based model with leading anomaly detection accuracy but heavy inference cost); and (3) explainability and provable robustness, as the learned velocity field operates directly in input space, making the anomaly score inherently feature-wise attributable; moreover, the score function is Lipschitz-continuous with respect to the input, providing theoretical guarantees under small perturbations. Extensive experiments on the ADBench benchmark show that TCCM strikes a favorable balance between detection accuracy and inference cost, outperforming state-of-the-art methods -- especially on high-dimensional and large-scale datasets.

- **[NTKMTL: Mitigating Task Imbalance in Multi-Task Learning from Neural Tangent Kernel Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18258)**  `arXiv:2510.18258`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Xiaohan Qin, Xiaoxing Wang, Ning Liao, Junchi Yan_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multi-Task Learning (MTL) enables a single model to learn multiple tasks simultaneously, leveraging knowledge transfer among tasks for enhanced generalization, and has been widely applied across various domains. However, task imbalance remains a major challenge in MTL. Although balancing the convergence speeds of different tasks is an effective approach to address this issue, it is highly challenging to accurately characterize the training dynamics and convergence speeds of multiple tasks within the complex MTL system. To this end, we attempt to analyze the training dynamics in MTL by leveraging Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) theory and propose a new MTL method, NTKMTL. Specifically, we introduce an extended NTK matrix for MTL and adopt spectral analysis to balance the convergence speeds of multiple tasks, thereby mitigating task imbalance. Based on the approximation via shared representation, we further propose NTKMTL-SR, achieving training efficiency while maintaining competitive performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our methods achieve state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of benchmarks, including both multi-task supervised learning and multi-task reinforcement learning.

- **[Long-Context Attention Benchmark: From Kernel Efficiency to Distributed Context Parallelism](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17896)**  `arXiv:2510.17896`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Tao Bu, Qiangang Wang, Bowen Zeng, Hanwen Sun, Yunpeng Huang, Chun Cao, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success, yet their standard attention mechanism incurs quadratic computation and memory costs with respect to sequence length, posing a major bottleneck for long-context training. Prior work tackles this challenge along two directions: (1) kernel-level optimizations, which accelerate dense and sparse attention operators; and (2) module-level strategies, often referred to as distributed attention or context parallel training, which scale attention across multiple devices. However, systematic evaluation still remains limited: operator-level comparisons are often incomplete, while context parallel strategies are typically framework-specific, with unclear performance analysis across contexts. To address these gaps, we propose a unified benchmark that integrates representative attention kernels and context parallel mechanisms with a modular and extensible interface for evaluation. The benchmark evaluates methods along two critical dimensions: (1) attention mask patterns, which strongly affect efficiency, scalability, and usability, and (2) sequence length and distributed scale, which determine performance under extreme long-context training. Through comprehensive experiments on the cluster of up to 96 GPUs, our benchmark enables reproducible comparisons, highlights method-specific trade-offs, and provides practical guidance for designing and deploying attention mechanisms in long-context LLM training.

- **[MIN-Merging: Merge the Important Neurons for Model Merging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17890)**  `arXiv:2510.17890`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Yunfei Liang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in deep learning have led to a surge of open-source models across diverse domains. While model merging offers a promising way to combine their strengths, existing approaches often suffer from parameter conflicts that degrade performance on domain-specific tasks. We propose MIN-Merging, a router-based framework that selectively merges the most important neurons to reduce such conflicts. Extensive experiments on Computer Vision(CV) and Natural Language Processing(NLP) benchmarks show that MIN-Merging achieves consistent gains on in-domain tasks while retaining the generalization ability of pretrained models on out-of-domain tasks. These results highlight its effectiveness as a practical solution to the parameter conflict problem in model merging.

- **[Shuffle-R1: Efficient RL framework for Multimodal Large Language Models via Data-centric Dynamic Shuffle](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05612)**  `arXiv:2508.05612`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Linghao Zhu, Yiran Guan, Dingkang Liang, Jianzhong Ju, Zhenbo Luo, Bin Qin, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as an effective post-training paradigm for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language model (MLLM). However, current RL pipelines often suffer from training inefficiencies caused by two underexplored issues: Advantage Collapsing, where most advantages in a batch concentrate near zero, and Rollout Silencing, where the proportion of rollouts contributing non-zero gradients diminishes over time. These issues lead to suboptimal gradient updates and hinder long-term learning efficiency. To address these issues, we propose Shuffle-R1, a simple yet principled framework that improves RL fine-tuning efficiency by dynamically restructuring trajectory sampling and batch composition. It introduces (1) Pairwise Trajectory Sampling, which selects high-contrast trajectories with large advantages to improve gradient signal quality, and (2) Advantage-based Trajectory Shuffle, which increases exposure of valuable rollouts through informed batch reshuffling. Experiments across multiple reasoning benchmarks show that our framework consistently outperforms strong RL baselines with minimal overhead. These results highlight the importance of data-centric adaptations for more efficient RL training in MLLM.

- **[Task Priors: Enhancing Model Evaluation by Considering the Entire Space of Downstream Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09871)**  `arXiv:2507.09871`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Niket Patel, Randall Balestriero_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The grand goal of AI research, and particularly Self Supervised Learning (SSL), is to produce systems that can successfully solve any possible task. In contrast, current evaluation methods available to AI researchers typically rely on a fixed collection of hand-picked downstream benchmarks. Hence, a large amount of effort is put into designing and searching for large collection of evaluation tasks that can serve as a proxy of our grand goal. We argue that such a rigid evaluation protocol creates a silent bottleneck in AI research. To remedy that, we define a probabilistic space of downstream tasks obtained by adopting a distribution of tasks and by defining Task Priors. Under this view, one can evaluate a model's performance over the set of all possible downstream tasks. Our framework is the first to provide answers to key questions such as (i) what is the average performance of my model over all possible downstream tasks weighted by the probability to encounter each task? or (ii) what is the variance of my model's performance across all downstream tasks under the defined Task Priors? Beyond establishing a new standard for evaluation, we believe that Task Priors will accelerate the pace of research in SSL - where downstream task evaluation is the sole qualitative signal that researchers have access to.

- **[BO4Mob: Bayesian Optimization Benchmarks for High-Dimensional Urban Mobility Problem](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18824)**  `arXiv:2510.18824`  `cs.LG`  
  _Seunghee Ryu, Donghoon Kwon, Seongjin Choi, Aryan Deshwal, Seungmo Kang, Carolina Osorio_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce \textbf{BO4Mob}, a new benchmark framework for high-dimensional Bayesian Optimization (BO), driven by the challenge of origin-destination (OD) travel demand estimation in large urban road networks. Estimating OD travel demand from limited traffic sensor data is a difficult inverse optimization problem, particularly in real-world, large-scale transportation networks. This problem involves optimizing over high-dimensional continuous spaces where each objective evaluation is computationally expensive, stochastic, and non-differentiable. BO4Mob comprises five scenarios based on real-world San Jose, CA road networks, with input dimensions scaling up to 10,100. These scenarios utilize high-resolution, open-source traffic simulations that incorporate realistic nonlinear and stochastic dynamics.

  Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has become the mainstream technique for training LLM agents. However, RLVR highly depends on well-crafted task queries and corresponding ground-truth answers to provide accurate rewards, which requires massive human efforts and hinders the RL scaling processes, especially under agentic scenarios. Although a few recent works explore task synthesis methods, the difficulty of generated agentic tasks can hardly be controlled to provide effective RL training advantages. To achieve agentic RLVR with higher scalability, we explore self-play training for deep search agents, in which the learning LLM utilizes multi-turn search engine calling and acts simultaneously as both a task proposer and a problem solver. The task proposer aims to generate deep search queries with well-defined ground-truth answers and increasing task difficulty. The problem solver tries to handle the generated search queries and output the correct answer predictions. To ensure that each generated search query has accurate ground truth, we collect all the searching results from the proposer's trajectory as external knowledge, then conduct retrieval-augmentation generation (RAG) to test whether the proposed query can be correctly answered with all necessary search documents provided. In this search self-play (SSP) game, the proposer and the solver co-evolve their agent capabilities through both competition and cooperation. With substantial experimental results, we find that SSP can significantly improve search agents' performance uniformly on various benchmarks without any supervision under both from-scratch and continuous RL training setups.

  Reliable navigation in safety-critical environments requires both accurate hazard perception and principled uncertainty handling to strengthen downstream safety handling. Despite the effectiveness of existing approaches, they assume perfect hazard detection capabilities, while uncertainty-aware perception approaches lack finite-sample guarantees. We present COPPOL, a conformal-driven perception-to-policy learning approach that integrates distribution-free, finite-sample safety guarantees into semantic segmentation, yielding calibrated hazard maps with rigorous bounds for missed detections. These maps induce risk-aware cost fields for downstream RL planning. Across two satellite-derived benchmarks, COPPOL increases hazard coverage (up to 6x) compared to comparative baselines, achieving near-complete detection of unsafe regions while reducing hazardous violations during navigation (up to approx 50%). More importantly, our approach remains robust to distributional shift, preserving both safety and efficiency.

  Efficient sampling from high-dimensional and multimodal unnormalized probability distributions is a central challenge in many areas of science and machine learning. We focus on Boltzmann generators (BGs) that aim to sample the Boltzmann distribution of physical systems, such as molecules, at a given temperature. Classical variational approaches that minimize the reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence are prone to mode collapse, while annealing-based methods, commonly using geometric schedules, can suffer from mass teleportation and rely heavily on schedule tuning. We introduce Constrained Mass Transport (CMT), a variational framework that generates intermediate distributions under constraints on both the KL divergence and the entropy decay between successive steps. These constraints enhance distributional overlap, mitigate mass teleportation, and counteract premature convergence. Across standard BG benchmarks and the here introduced ELIL tetrapeptide, the largest system studied to date without access to samples from molecular dynamics, CMT consistently surpasses state-of-the-art variational methods, achieving more than 2.5x higher effective sample size while avoiding mode collapse.

  Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become essential tools for learning on relational data, yet the performance of a single GNN is often limited by the heterogeneity present in real-world graphs. Recent advances in Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) frameworks demonstrate that assembling multiple, explicitly diverse GNNs with distinct generalization patterns can significantly improve performance. In this work, we present the first systematic empirical study of expert-level diversification techniques for GNN ensembles. Evaluating 20 diversification strategies -- including random re-initialization, hyperparameter tuning, architectural variation, directionality modeling, and training data partitioning -- across 14 node classification benchmarks, we construct and analyze over 200 ensemble variants. Our comprehensive evaluation examines each technique in terms of expert diversity, complementarity, and ensemble performance. We also uncovers mechanistic insights into training maximally diverse experts. These findings provide actionable guidance for expert training and the design of effective MoE frameworks on graph data.

  This paper is concerned with online time series forecasting, where unknown distribution shifts occur over time, i.e., latent variables influence the mapping from historical to future observations. To develop an automated way of online time series forecasting, we propose a Theoretical framework for Online Time-series forecasting (TOT in short) with theoretical guarantees. Specifically, we prove that supplying a forecaster with latent variables tightens the Bayes risk, the benefit endures under estimation uncertainty of latent variables and grows as the latent variables achieve a more precise identifiability. To better introduce latent variables into online forecasting algorithms, we further propose to identify latent variables with minimal adjacent observations. Based on these results, we devise a model-agnostic blueprint by employing a temporal decoder to match the distribution of observed variables and two independent noise estimators to model the causal inference of latent variables and mixing procedures of observed variables, respectively. Experiment results on synthetic data support our theoretical claims. Moreover, plug-in implementations built on several baselines yield general improvement across multiple benchmarks, highlighting the effectiveness in real-world applications.

  Multi-modal entity alignment (MMEA) aims to identify equivalent entities across heterogeneous multi-modal knowledge graphs (MMKGs), where each entity is described by attributes from various modalities. Existing methods typically assume that both intra-entity and inter-graph correspondences are faultless, which is often violated in real-world MMKGs due to the reliance on expert annotations. In this paper, we reveal and study a highly practical yet under-explored problem in MMEA, termed Dual-level Noisy Correspondence (DNC). DNC refers to misalignments in both intra-entity (entity-attribute) and inter-graph (entity-entity and attribute-attribute) correspondences. To address the DNC problem, we propose a robust MMEA framework termed RULE. RULE first estimates the reliability of both intra-entity and inter-graph correspondences via a dedicated two-fold principle. Leveraging the estimated reliabilities, RULE mitigates the negative impact of intra-entity noise during attribute fusion and prevents overfitting to noisy inter-graph correspondences during inter-graph discrepancy elimination. Beyond the training-time designs, RULE further incorporates a correspondence reasoning module that uncovers the underlying attribute-attribute connection across graphs, guaranteeing more accurate equivalent entity identification. Extensive experiments on five benchmarks verify the effectiveness of our method against the DNC compared with seven state-of-the-artthis http URLcode is available at \href{this https URL}{XLearning-SCU/RULE}

  Machine learning (ML) holds great potential to advance anomaly detection (AD) in chemical processes. However, the development of ML-based methods is hindered by the lack of openly available experimental data. To address this gap, we have set up a laboratory-scale batch distillation plant and operated it to generate an extensive experimental database, covering fault-free experiments and experiments in which anomalies were intentionally induced, for training advanced ML-based AD methods. In total, 119 experiments were conducted across a wide range of operating conditions and mixtures. Most experiments containing anomalies were paired with a corresponding fault-free one. The database that we provide here includes time-series data from numerous sensors and actuators, along with estimates of measurement uncertainty. In addition, unconventional data sources -- such as concentration profiles obtained via online benchtop NMR spectroscopy and video and audio recordings -- are provided. Extensive metadata and expert annotations of all experiments are included. The anomaly annotations are based on an ontology developed in this work. The data are organized in a structured database and made freely available viathis http URL. This new database paves the way for the development of advanced ML-based AD methods. As it includes information on the causes of anomalies, it further enables the development of interpretable and explainable ML approaches, as well as methods for anomaly mitigation.

  Long-horizon multivariate time-series forecasting is challenging because realistic predictions must (i) denoise heterogeneous signals, (ii) track time-varying cross-series dependencies, and (iii) remain stable and physically plausible over long rollout horizons. We present PRISM, which couples a score-based diffusion preconditioner with a dynamic, correlation-thresholded graph encoder and a forecast head regularized by generic physics penalties. We prove contraction of the induced horizon dynamics under mild conditions and derive Lipschitz bounds for graph blocks, explaining the model's robustness. On six standard benchmarks , PRISM achieves consistent SOTA with strong MSE and MAE gains.

  Black-box Large Language Models (LLMs) provide practical and accessible alternatives to other machine learning methods, as they require minimal labeled data and machine learning expertise to develop solutions for various decision making problems. However, for applications that need operating with constraints on specific metrics (e.g., precision $\geq$ 95%), decision making with black-box LLMs remains unfavorable, due to their low numerical output cardinalities. This results in limited control over their operating points, preventing fine-grained adjustment of their decision making behavior. In this paper, we study using black-box LLMs as classifiers, focusing on efficiently improving their operational granularity without performance loss. Specifically, we first investigate the reasons behind their low-cardinality numerical outputs and show that they are biased towards generating rounded but informative verbalized probabilities. Then, we experiment with standard prompt engineering, uncertainty estimation and confidence elicitation techniques, and observe that they do not effectively improve operational granularity without sacrificing performance or increasing inference cost. Finally, we propose efficient approaches to significantly increase the number and diversity of available operating points. Our proposed approaches provide finer-grained operating points and achieve comparable to or better performance than the benchmark methods across 11 datasets and 3 LLMs.

  While deep learning has achieved impressive performance in time series forecasting, it becomes increasingly crucial to understand its decision-making process for building trust in high-stakes scenarios. Existing interpretable models often provide only local and partial explanations, lacking the capability to reveal how heterogeneous and interacting input variables jointly shape the overall temporal patterns in the forecast curve. We propose ProtoTS, a novel interpretable forecasting framework that achieves both high accuracy and transparent decision-making through modeling prototypical temporal patterns. ProtoTS computes instance-prototype similarity based on a denoised representation that preserves abundant heterogeneous information. The prototypes are organized hierarchically to capture global temporal patterns with coarse prototypes while capturing finer-grained local variations with detailed prototypes, enabling expert steering and multi-level interpretability. Experiments on multiple realistic benchmarks, including a newly released LOF dataset, show that ProtoTS not only exceeds existing methods in forecast accuracy but also delivers expert-steerable interpretations for better model understanding and decision support.

  _Qi Cao, Pengtao Xie_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Training multimodal process reward models (PRMs) is hard due to (i) distribution shift between training set and test set and (ii) quality imbalance across training data samples. While domain-level reweighting (e.g., DreamPRM) aligns training with test-time objectives, it leaves a clear gap to an oracle upper bound (pass@N), even under a "sanity check" that uses test set data to probe headroom -- pointing to meta-level under-parameterization. We introduce DreamPRM-1.5, an instance-level reweighting framework that assigns an adaptive weight to every training example via bi-level optimization. To realize instance reweighting across scales, we develop two complementary regimes: Instance Table, which learns explicit per-sample weights and excels on small/medium data, and Instance Net, a lightweight neural network that generalizes better and scales to large corpora. A practical, stable training recipe -- time-scale matching between upper/lower updates, cold-start initialization, and bounded-range weights -- prevents divergence. Integrated with test-time scaling, DreamPRM-1.5 attains 84.6 accuracy on the MMMU validation set, 31.3 accuracy on R-Bench-V and, when paired with a leading backbone (e.g., GPT-5-mini), achieves first-place results on public multimodal reasoning leaderboards. Moreover, extensive experiments, including benchmark evaluations, baseline comparisons, and a sanity check, demonstrate that DreamPRM-1.5 closes the gap toward the oracle, achieves leading performance, and trains stably.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Simulation-based inference (SBI) is a statistical inference approach for estimating latent parameters of a physical system when the likelihood is intractable but simulations are available. In practice, SBI is often hindered by model misspecification--the mismatch between simulated and real-world observations caused by inherent modeling simplifications. RoPE, a recent SBI approach, addresses this challenge through a two-stage domain transfer process that combines semi-supervised calibration with optimal transport (OT)-based distribution alignment. However, RoPE operates in a fully transductive setting, requiring access to a batch of test samples at inference time, which limits scalability and generalization. We propose here a fully inductive and amortized SBI framework that integrates calibration and distributional alignment into a single, end-to-end trainable model. Our method leverages mini-batch OT with a closed-form coupling to align real and simulated observations that correspond to the same latent parameters, using both paired calibration data and unpaired samples. A conditional normalizing flow is then trained to approximate the OT-induced posterior, enabling efficient inference without simulation access at test time. Across a range of synthetic and real-world benchmarks--including complex medical biomarker estimation--our approach matches or surpasses the performance of RoPE, as well as other standard SBI and non-SBI estimators, while offering improved scalability and applicability in challenging, misspecified environments.

  LLM serving systems typically treat user prompts as monolithic inputs, optimizing inference through decoding tricks or inter-query batching. However, many real-world prompts contain latent semantic parallelism--decomposable structures where subtasks can be executed independently to reduce latency while preserving meaning. We introduce PARALLELPROMPT, the first benchmark for measuring intra-query parallelism in natural user prompts. Our dataset comprises over 37,000 real-world prompts from public LLM chat logs, each annotated with a structured schema capturing task templates, shared context, and iteration inputs. These schemas are extracted using LLM-assisted prompting with rule-based multilingual validation. To evaluate the benefits of decomposition, we provide an execution suite that benchmarks serial vs. parallel strategies, measuring latency, structural adherence, and semantic fidelity. Our results show that intra-query parallelism can be successfully parsed in over 75% of curated datasets, unlocking up to 5x speedups on tasks like translation, comprehension, and comparative analysis, with minimal quality degradation. By releasing this benchmark, curation pipeline, and evaluation suite, we provide the first standardized testbed for studying structure-aware execution in LLM serving pipelines.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We study the problem of offline imitation learning in Markov decision processes (MDPs), where the goal is to learn a well-performing policy given a dataset of state-action pairs generated by an expert policy. Complementing a recent line of work on this topic that assumes the expert belongs to a tractable class of known policies, we approach this problem from a new angle and leverage a different type of structural assumption about the environment. Specifically, for the class of linear $Q^\pi$-realizable MDPs, we introduce a new algorithm called saddle-point offline imitation learning (\SPOIL), which is guaranteed to match the performance of any expert up to an additive error $\varepsilon$ with access to $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-2})$ samples. Moreover, we extend this result to possibly non-linear $Q^\pi$-realizable MDPs at the cost of a worse sample complexity of order $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-4})$. Finally, our analysis suggests a new loss function for training critic networks from expert data in deep imitation learning. Empirical evaluations on standard benchmarks demonstrate that the neural net implementation of \SPOIL is superior to behavior cloning and competitive with state-of-the-art algorithms.

  Differential Transformer has recently gained significant attention for its impressive empirical performance, often attributed to its ability to perform noise canceled attention. However, precisely how differential attention achieves its empirical benefits remains poorly understood. Moreover, Differential Transformer architecture demands large-scale training from scratch, hindering utilization of open pretrained weights. In this work, we conduct an in-depth investigation of Differential Transformer, uncovering three key factors behind its success: (1) enhanced expressivity via negative attention, (2) reduced redundancy among attention heads, and (3) improved learning dynamics. Based on these findings, we propose DEX, a novel method to efficiently integrate the advantages of differential attention into pretrained language models. By reusing the softmax attention scores and adding a lightweight differential operation on the output value matrix, DEX effectively incorporates the key advantages of differential attention while remaining lightweight in both training and inference. Evaluations confirm that DEX substantially improves the pretrained LLMs across diverse benchmarks, achieving significant performance gains with minimal adaptation data (< 0.01%).

  After deployment, machine learning models often experience performance degradation due to shifts in data distribution. It is challenging to assess post-deployment performance accurately when labels are missing or delayed. Existing proxy methods, such as data drift detection, fail to measure the effects of these shifts adequately. To address this, we introduce a new method for evaluating binary classification models on unlabeled tabular data that accurately estimates model performance under covariate shift and call it Probabilistic Adaptive Performance Estimation (PAPE). It can be applied to any performance metric defined with elements of the confusion matrix. Crucially, PAPE operates independently of the original model, relying only on its predictions and probability estimates, and does not need any assumptions about the nature of covariate shift, learning directly from data instead. We tested PAPE using over 900 dataset-model combinations from US census data, assessing its performance against several benchmarks through various metrics. Our findings show that PAPE outperforms other methodologies, making it a superior choice for estimating the performance of binary classification models.

  Existing end-to-end autonomous driving (AD) algorithms typically follow the Imitation Learning (IL) paradigm, which faces challenges such as causal confusion and an open-loop gap. In this work, we propose RAD, a 3DGS-based closed-loop Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework for end-to-end Autonomous Driving. By leveraging 3DGS techniques, we construct a photorealistic digital replica of the real physical world, enabling the AD policy to extensively explore the state space and learn to handle out-of-distribution scenarios through large-scale trial and error. To enhance safety, we design specialized rewards to guide the policy in effectively responding to safety-critical events and understanding real-world causal relationships. To better align with human driving behavior, we incorporate IL into RL training as a regularization term. We introduce a closed-loop evaluation benchmark consisting of diverse, previously unseen 3DGS environments. Compared to IL-based methods, RAD achieves stronger performance in most closed-loop metrics, particularly exhibiting a 3x lower collision rate. Abundant closed-loop results are presented in the supplementary material. Code is available atthis https URLfor facilitating future research.

  The real world is messy and unstructured. Uncovering critical information often requires active, goal-driven exploration. It remains to be seen whether Vision-Language Models (VLMs), which recently emerged as a popular zero-shot tool in many difficult tasks, can operate effectively in such conditions. In this paper, we answer this question by introducing FlySearch, a 3D, outdoor, photorealistic environment for searching and navigating to objects in complex scenes. We define three sets of scenarios with varying difficulty and observe that state-of-the-art VLMs cannot reliably solve even the simplest exploration tasks, with the gap to human performance increasing as the tasks get harder. We identify a set of central causes, ranging from vision hallucination, through context misunderstanding, to task planning failures, and we show that some of them can be addressed by finetuning. We publicly release the benchmark, scenarios, and the underlying codebase.

  Engagement detection in online learning environments is vital for improving student outcomes and personalizing instruction. We present ViBED-Net (Video-Based Engagement Detection Network), a novel deep learning framework designed to assess student engagement from video data using a dual-stream architecture. ViBED-Net captures both facial expressions and full-scene context by processing facial crops and entire video frames through EfficientNetV2 for spatial feature extraction. These features are then analyzed over time using two temporal modeling strategies: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and Transformer encoders. Our model is evaluated on the DAiSEE dataset, a large-scale benchmark for affective state recognition in e-learning. To enhance performance on underrepresented engagement classes, we apply targeted data augmentation techniques. Among the tested variants, ViBED-Net with LSTM achieves 73.43\% accuracy, outperforming existing state-of-the-art approaches. ViBED-Net demonstrates that combining face-aware and scene-aware spatiotemporal cues significantly improves engagement detection accuracy. Its modular design allows flexibility for application across education, user experience research, and content personalization. This work advances video-based affective computing by offering a scalable, high-performing solution for real-world engagement analysis. The source code for this project is available onthis https URL.

  Large language models (LLMs) increasingly rely on long-context modeling for tasks such as document understanding, code analysis, and multi-step reasoning. However, scaling context windows to the million-token level brings prohibitive computational and memory costs, limiting the practicality of long-context LLMs. In this work, we take a different perspective-visual context scaling-to tackle this challenge. Instead of extending token-based sequences, we propose Glyph, a framework that renders long texts into images and processes them with vision-language models (VLMs). This approach substantially compresses textual input while preserving semantic information, and we further design an LLM-driven genetic search to identify optimal visual rendering configurations for balancing accuracy and compression. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our method achieves 3-4x token compression while maintaining accuracy comparable to leading LLMs such as Qwen3-8B on various long-context benchmarks. This compression also leads to around 4x faster prefilling and decoding, and approximately 2x faster SFT training. Furthermore, under extreme compression, a 128K-context VLM could scale to handle 1M-token-level text tasks. In addition, the rendered text data benefits real-world multimodal tasks, such as document understanding. Our code and model are released atthis https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Referential grounding in outdoor driving scenes is challenging due to large scene variability, many visually similar objects, and dynamic elements that complicate resolving natural-language references (e.g., "the black car on the right"). We propose LLM-RG, a hybrid pipeline that combines off-the-shelf vision-language models for fine-grained attribute extraction with large language models for symbolic reasoning. LLM-RG processes an image and a free-form referring expression by using an LLM to extract relevant object types and attributes, detecting candidate regions, generating rich visual descriptors with a VLM, and then combining these descriptors with spatial metadata into natural-language prompts that are input to an LLM for chain-of-thought reasoning to identify the referent's bounding box. Evaluated on the Talk2Car benchmark, LLM-RG yields substantial gains over both LLM and VLM-based baselines. Additionally, our ablations show that adding 3D spatial cues further improves grounding. Our results demonstrate the complementary strengths of VLMs and LLMs, applied in a zero-shot manner, for robust outdoor referential grounding.

  Trustworthy AI is mandatory for the broad deployment of autonomous vehicles. Although end-to-end approaches derive control commands directly from raw data, interpreting these decisions remains challenging, especially in complex urban scenarios. This is mainly attributed to very deep neural networks with non-linear decision boundaries, making it challenging to grasp the logic behind AI-driven decisions. This paper presents a method to enhance interpretability while optimizing control commands in autonomous driving. To address this, we propose loss functions that promote the interpretability of our model by generating sparse and localized feature maps. The feature activations allow us to explain which image regions contribute to the predicted control command. We conduct comprehensive ablation studies on the feature extraction step and validate our method on the CARLA benchmarks. We also demonstrate that our approach improves interpretability, which correlates with reducing infractions, yielding a safer, high-performance driving model. Notably, our monocular, non-ensemble model surpasses the top-performing approaches from the CARLA Leaderboard by achieving lower infraction scores and the highest route completion rate, all while ensuring interpretability.

  Safety evaluation of multimodal foundation models often treats vision and language inputs separately, missing risks from joint interpretation where benign content becomes harmful in combination. Existing approaches also fail to distinguish clearly unsafe content from borderline cases, leading to problematic over-blocking or under-refusal of genuinely harmful content. We present Vision Language Safety Understanding (VLSU), a comprehensive framework to systematically evaluate multimodal safety through fine-grained severity classification and combinatorial analysis across 17 distinct safety patterns. Using a multi-stage pipeline with real-world images and human annotation, we construct a large-scale benchmark of 8,187 samples spanning 15 harm categories. Our evaluation of eleven state-of-the-art models reveals systematic joint understanding failures: while models achieve 90%-plus accuracy on clear unimodal safety signals, performance degrades substantially to 20-55% when joint image-text reasoning is required to determine the safety label. Most critically, 34% of errors in joint image-text safety classification occur despite correct classification of the individual modalities, further demonstrating absent compositional reasoning capabilities. Additionally, we find that models struggle to balance refusing unsafe content while still responding to borderline cases that deserve engagement. For example, we find that instruction framing can reduce the over-blocking rate on borderline content from 62.4% to 10.4% in Gemini-1.5, but only at the cost of under-refusing on unsafe content with refusal rate dropping from 90.8% to 53.9%. Overall, our framework exposes weaknesses in joint image-text understanding and alignment gaps in current models, and provides a critical test bed to enable the next milestones in research on robust vision-language safety.

  Automated parsing of scanned documents into richly structured, machine-readable formats remains a critical bottleneck in Document AI, as traditional multi-stage pipelines suffer from error propagation and limited adaptability to diverse layouts. We introduce layoutRL, an end-to-end reinforcement learning framework that trains models to be explicitly layout-aware by optimizing a composite reward of normalized edit distance, paragraph count accuracy, and reading order preservation. Leveraging our newly released dataset, Infinity-Doc-55K, which combines 55K high-fidelity synthetic scanned document parsing data with expert-filtered real-world documents, we instantiate layoutRL in a vision-language-model-based parser called Infinity-Parser. Evaluated on English and Chinese benchmarks for OCR, table and formula extraction, and reading order detection, Infinity-Parser achieves new state-of-the-art performance in both accuracy and structural fidelity, outpacing specialist pipelines and general-purpose vision-language models. We will publicly release our code and dataset to accelerate progress in robust document understanding.

  While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at holistic understanding, they struggle in capturing the dense world with complex scenes, requiring fine-grained analysis of intricate details and object inter-relationships. Region-level MLLMs have been a promising step. However, previous attempts are generally optimized to understand given regions in isolation, neglecting crucial global contexts. To address this, we introduce Grasp Any Region (GAR) for comprehen- sive region-level visual understanding. Empowered by an effective RoI-aligned feature replay technique, GAR supports (1) precise perception by leveraging necessary global contexts, and (2) modeling interactions between multiple prompts. Together, it then naturally achieves (3) advanced compositional reasoning to answer specific free-form questions about any region, shifting the paradigm from passive description to active dialogue. Moreover, we construct GAR-Bench, which not only provides a more accurate evaluation of single-region comprehension, but also, more importantly, measures interactions and complex reasoning across multiple regions. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that GAR-1B not only maintains the state-of-the-art captioning capabilities, e.g., outperforming DAM-3B +4.5 on DLC-Bench, but also excels at modeling relationships between multiple prompts with advanced comprehension capabilities, even surpassing InternVL3-78B on GAR-Bench-VQA. More importantly, our zero-shot GAR-8B even outperforms in-domain VideoRefer-7B on VideoRefer-BenchQ, indicating its strong capabilities can be easily transferred to videos.

  Vision language models (VLMs) are increasingly deployed as controllers with access to external tools for complex reasoning and decision-making, yet their effectiveness remains limited by the scarcity of high-quality multimodal trajectories and the cost of manual annotation. We address this challenge with a vision-centric agent tuning framework that automatically synthesizes multimodal trajectories, generates step-wise preference pairs, and trains a VLM controller for robust tool-use reasoning. Our pipeline first constructs M-TRACE, a large-scale dataset of 28.5K multimodal tasks with 177K verified trajectories, enabling imitation-based trajectory tuning. Building on this, we develop MATRIX Agent, a controller finetuned on M-TRACE for step-wise tool reasoning. To achieve finer alignment, we further introduce Pref-X, a set of 11K automatically generated preference pairs, and optimize MATRIX on it via step-wise preference learning. Across three benchmarks, Agent-X, GTA, and GAIA, MATRIX consistently surpasses both open- and closed-source VLMs, demonstrating scalable and effective multimodal tool use.

  Long-video understanding~(LVU) is a challenging problem in computer vision. Existing methods either downsample frames for single-pass reasoning, sacrificing fine-grained details, or depend on textual reasoning over task-agnostic representations, hindering task-specific perception and exploration. In this paper, we propose VideoExplorer, a framework grounded in the principle of ``thinking with video'', which naturally intertwines planning, temporal grounding, and scalable perception into a coherent reasoning process. Rather than reasoning over a static context, VideoExplorer iteratively formulates sub-questions, locates relevant moments, and performs task-oriented, temporally scalable video understanding until reaching the final answer, enabling faithful, efficient, and interpretable reasoning. To address the lack of LVU training resources, we construct a long-video reasoning dataset using difficulty-adaptive sampling to ensure high-quality trajectories on complex tasks. Building on this dataset, we design a two-stage training pipeline: supervised trajectory initialization followed by trajectory-level preference optimization, encouraging adaptive temporal grounding and iterative information integration guided by downstream rewards. Extensive evaluations on popular long-video understanding and reasoning benchmarks demonstrate VideoExplorer's significant advantage over existing baselines, highlighting its robustness, adaptability, and efficiency. Our code is made publicly available in this repository(this https URL).

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Benefiting from pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models, real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR) methods can synthesize rich and realistic details. However, due to the inherent stochasticity of T2I models, different noise inputs often lead to outputs with varying perceptual quality. Although this randomness is sometimes seen as a limitation, it also introduces a wider perceptual quality range, which can be exploited to improve Real-ISR performance. To this end, we introduce Direct Perceptual Preference Optimization for Real-ISR (DP$^2$O-SR), a framework that aligns generative models with perceptual preferences without requiring costly human annotations. We construct a hybrid reward signal by combining full-reference and no-reference image quality assessment (IQA) models trained on large-scale human preference datasets. This reward encourages both structural fidelity and natural appearance. To better utilize perceptual diversity, we move beyond the standard best-vs-worst selection and construct multiple preference pairs from outputs of the same model. Our analysis reveals that the optimal selection ratio depends on model capacity: smaller models benefit from broader coverage, while larger models respond better to stronger contrast in supervision. Furthermore, we propose hierarchical preference optimization, which adaptively weights training pairs based on intra-group reward gaps and inter-group diversity, enabling more efficient and stable learning. Extensive experiments across both diffusion- and flow-based T2I backbones demonstrate that DP$^2$O-SR significantly improves perceptual quality and generalizes well to real-world benchmarks.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Though recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable progress across a wide range of multimodal tasks, understanding 3D spatial relationships from limited views remains a significant challenge. Previous reasoning methods typically rely on pure text (e.g., topological cognitive maps) or on 2D visual cues. However, their limited representational capacity hinders performance in specific tasks that require 3D spatial imagination. To address this limitation, we propose 3DThinker, a framework that can effectively exploits the rich geometric information embedded within images while reasoning, like humans do. Our framework is the first to enable 3D mentaling during reasoning without any 3D prior input, and it does not rely on explicitly labeled 3D data for training. Specifically, our training consists of two stages. First, we perform supervised training to align the 3D latent generated by VLM while reasoning with that of a 3D foundation model (e.g., VGGT). Then, we optimize the entire reasoning trajectory solely based on outcome signals, thereby refining the underlying 3D mentaling. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks show that 3DThinker consistently outperforms strong baselines and offers a new perspective toward unifying 3D representations into multimodal reasoning. Our code will be available atthis https URL.

  We present Kaleido, a subject-to-video~(S2V) generation framework, which aims to synthesize subject-consistent videos conditioned on multiple reference images of target subjects. Despite recent progress in S2V generation models, existing approaches remain inadequate at maintaining multi-subject consistency and at handling background disentanglement, often resulting in lower reference fidelity and semantic drift under multi-image conditioning. These shortcomings can be attributed to several factors. Primarily, the training dataset suffers from a lack of diversity and high-quality samples, as well as cross-paired data, i.e., paired samples whose components originate from different instances. In addition, the current mechanism for integrating multiple reference images is suboptimal, potentially resulting in the confusion of multiple subjects. To overcome these limitations, we propose a dedicated data construction pipeline, incorporating low-quality sample filtering and diverse data synthesis, to produce consistency-preserving training data. Moreover, we introduce Reference Rotary Positional Encoding (R-RoPE) to process reference images, enabling stable and precise multi-image integration. Extensive experiments across numerous benchmarks demonstrate that Kaleido significantly outperforms previous methods in consistency, fidelity, and generalization, marking an advance in S2V generation.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Unlike offline processing, streaming video vision-language models face two fundamental constraints: causality and accumulation. Causality prevents access to future frames that offline methods exploit, while accumulation causes tokens to grow unbounded, creating efficiency bottlenecks. However, existing approaches only regulate post-LLM kv-cache, leaving costly pre-LLM prefill unchanged. We introduce StreamingTOM, a training-free, plug-and-play two-stage framework that addresses both pre-LLM and post-LLM bottlenecks with predictable latency. Causal Temporal Reduction imposes a fixed per-frame budget and selects tokens based on adjacent-frame changes and token saliency, drastically reducing per-frame prefill cost by processing only a compact subset of visual tokens per frame instead of all visual tokens. Online Quantized Memory stores tokens in 4-bit format, retrieves relevant groups on demand, and dequantizes them, keeping the active kv-cache bounded regardless of stream length. Experiments demonstrate our method achieves $15.7\times$ kv-cache compression, $1.2\times$ lower peak memory and $2\times$ faster TTFT compared to prior SOTA. StreamingTOM maintains state-of-the-art accuracy among training-free methods with an average of $63.8\%$ on offline benchmarks and $55.8\%/3.7$ on RVS. These results highlight the practical benefits of our two-stage approach for efficient streaming video understanding with bounded growth.

  Most current medical vision language models struggle to jointly generate diagnostic text and pixel-level segmentation masks in response to complex visual questions. This represents a major limitation towards clinical application, as assistive systems that fail to provide both modalities simultaneously offer limited value to medical practitioners. To alleviate this limitation, we first introduce RadDiagSeg-D, a dataset combining abnormality detection, diagnosis, and multi-target segmentation into a unified and hierarchical task. RadDiagSeg-D covers multiple imaging modalities and is precisely designed to support the development of models that produce descriptive text and corresponding segmentation masks in tandem. Subsequently, we leverage the dataset to propose a novel vision-language model, RadDiagSeg-M, capable of joint abnormality detection, diagnosis, and flexible segmentation. RadDiagSeg-M provides highly informative and clinically useful outputs, effectively addressing the need to enrich contextual information for assistive diagnosis. Finally, we benchmark RadDiagSeg-M and showcase its strong performance across all components involved in the task of multi-target text-and-mask generation, establishing a robust and competitive baseline.

  3D weakly supervised semantic segmentation (3D WSSS) aims to achieve semantic segmentation by leveraging sparse or low-cost annotated data, significantly reducing reliance on dense point-wise annotations. Previous works mainly employ class activation maps or pre-trained vision-language models to address this challenge. However, the low quality of pseudo-labels and the insufficient exploitation of 3D geometric priors jointly create significant technical bottlenecks in developing high-performance 3D WSSS models. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective 3D weakly supervised semantic segmentation method that integrates 3D geometric priors into a class-aware guidance mechanism to generate high-fidelity pseudo labels. Concretely, our designed methodology first employs Class-Aware Label Refinement module to generate more balanced and accurate pseudo labels for semantic categrories. This initial refinement stage focuses on enhancing label quality through category-specific optimization. Subsequently, the Geometry-Aware Label Refinement component is developed, which strategically integrates implicit 3D geometric constraints to effectively filter out low-confidence pseudo labels that fail to comply with geometric plausibility. Moreover, to address the challenge of extensive unlabeled regions, we propose a Label Update strategy that integrates Self-Training to propagate labels into these areas. This iterative process continuously enhances pseudo-label quality while expanding label coverage, ultimately fostering the development of high-performance 3D WSSS models. Comprehensive experimental validation reveals that our proposed methodology achieves state-of-the-art performance on both ScanNet and S3DIS benchmarks while demonstrating remarkable generalization capability in unsupervised settings, maintaining competitive accuracy through its robust design.

  Image editing has achieved remarkable progress recently. Modern editing models could already follow complex instructions to manipulate the original content. However, beyond completing the editing instructions, the accompanying physical effects are the key to the generation realism. For example, removing an object should also remove its shadow, reflections, and interactions with nearby objects. Unfortunately, existing models and benchmarks mainly focus on instruction completion but overlook these physical effects. So, at this moment, how far are we from physically realistic image editing? To answer this, we introduce PICABench, which systematically evaluates physical realism across eight sub-dimension (spanning optics, mechanics, and state transitions) for most of the common editing operations (add, remove, attribute change, etc.). We further propose the PICAEval, a reliable evaluation protocol that uses VLM-as-a-judge with per-case, region-level human annotations and questions. Beyond benchmarking, we also explore effective solutions by learning physics from videos and construct a training dataset PICA-100K. After evaluating most of the mainstream models, we observe that physical realism remains a challenging problem with large rooms to explore. We hope that our benchmark and proposed solutions can serve as a foundation for future work moving from naive content editing toward physically consistent realism.

  AI systems must adapt to evolving visual environments, especially in domains where object appearances change over time. We introduce Car Models in Time (CaMiT), a fine-grained dataset capturing the temporal evolution of car models, a representative class of technological artifacts. CaMiT includes 787K labeled samples of 190 car models (2007-2023) and 5.1M unlabeled samples (2005-2023), supporting both supervised and self-supervised learning. Static pretraining on in-domain data achieves competitive performance with large-scale generalist models while being more resource-efficient, yet accuracy declines when models are tested across years. To address this, we propose a time-incremental classification setting, a realistic continual learning scenario with emerging, evolving, and disappearing classes. We evaluate two strategies: time-incremental pretraining, which updates the backbone, and time-incremental classifier learning, which updates only the final layer, both improving temporal robustness. Finally, we explore time-aware image generation that leverages temporal metadata during training, yielding more realistic outputs. CaMiT offers a rich benchmark for studying temporal adaptation in fine-grained visual recognition and generation.

  Existing research on 3D Large Language Models (LLMs) still struggles to achieve grounded question-answering, primarily due to the under-exploration of the mech- anism of human-like scene-object grounded reasoning. This paper bridges the gap by presenting a novel framework. We first introduce a grounded Chain-of- Thought reasoning method in 3D scenes (SCENECOT), decoupling a complex reasoning task into simpler and manageable problems, and building corresponding visual clues based on multimodal expert modules. To enable such a method, we develop SCENECOT-185K, the first large-scale grounded CoT reasoning dataset, consisting of 185K high-quality instances. Extensive experiments across various complex 3D scene reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our new framework achieves strong performance with high grounding-QA coherence. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first successful application of CoT reasoning to 3D scene understanding, enabling step-by-step human-like reasoning and showing potential for extension to broader 3D scene understanding scenarios.

  Recent advances in Large Multi-modal Models (LMMs) have demonstrated their remarkable success as general-purpose multi-modal assistants, with particular focuses on holistic image- and video-language understanding. Conversely, less attention has been given to scaling fine-grained pixel-level understanding capabilities, where the models are expected to realize pixel-level alignment between visual signals and language semantics. Some previous studies have applied LMMs to related tasks such as region-level captioning and referring expression segmentation. However, these models are limited to performing either referring or segmentation tasks independently and fail to integrate these fine-grained perception capabilities into visual reasoning. To bridge this gap, we propose UniPixel, a large multi-modal model capable of flexibly comprehending visual prompt inputs and generating mask-grounded responses. Our model distinguishes itself by seamlessly integrating pixel-level perception with general visual understanding capabilities. Specifically, UniPixel processes visual prompts and generates relevant masks on demand, and performs subsequent reasoning conditioning on these intermediate pointers during inference, thereby enabling fine-grained pixel-level reasoning. The effectiveness of our approach has been verified on 10 benchmarks across a diverse set of tasks, including pixel-level referring/segmentation and object-centric understanding in images/videos. A novel PixelQA task that jointly requires referring, segmentation, and question answering is also designed to verify the flexibility of our method.

  Writing is a universal cultural technology that reuses vision for symbolic communication. Humans display striking resilience: we readily recognize words even when characters are fragmented, fused, or partially occluded. This paper investigates whether advanced vision language models (VLMs) share this resilience. We construct two psychophysics inspired benchmarks across distinct writing systems, Chinese logographs and English alphabetic words, by splicing, recombining, and overlaying glyphs to yield ''visible but unreadable'' stimuli for models while remaining legible to humans. Despite strong performance on clean text, contemporary VLMs show a severe drop under these perturbations, frequently producing unrelated or incoherent outputs. The pattern suggests a structural limitation: models heavily leverage generic visual invariances but under rely on compositional priors needed for robust literacy. We release stimuli generation code, prompts, and evaluation protocols to facilitate transparent replication and follow up work. Our findings motivate architectures and training strategies that encode symbol segmentation, composition, and binding across scripts, and they delineate concrete challenges for deploying multimodal systems in education, accessibility, cultural heritage, and security.

  Bed-related falls remain a major source of injury in hospitals and long-term care facilities, yet many commercial alarms trigger only after a patient has already left the bed. We show that early bed-exit intent can be predicted using only one low-cost load cell mounted under a bed leg. The resulting load signals are first converted into a compact set of complementary images: an RGB line plot that preserves raw waveforms and three texture maps-recurrence plot, Markov transition field, and Gramian angular field-that expose higher-order dynamics. We introduce ViFusionTST, a dual-stream Swin Transformer that processes the line plot and texture maps in parallel and fuses them through cross-attention to learn data-driven modality weights. To provide a realistic benchmark, we collected six months of continuous data from 95 beds in a long-term-care facility. On this real-world dataset ViFusionTST reaches an accuracy of 0.885 and an F1 score of 0.794, surpassing recent 1D and 2D time-series baselines across F1, recall, accuracy, and AUPRC. The results demonstrate that image-based fusion of load-sensor signals for time series classification is a practical and effective solution for real-time, privacy-preserving fall prevention.

  Recent strides in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have significantly advanced their performance in many reasoning tasks. However, Abstract Visual Reasoning (AVR) remains a critical challenge, primarily due to limitations in perceiving abstract graphics. To tackle this issue, we investigate the bottlenecks in current MLLMs and synthesize training data to improve their abstract visual perception. First, we propose VisuRiddles, a benchmark for AVR, featuring tasks meticulously constructed to assess models' reasoning capacities across five core dimensions and two high-level reasoning categories. Second, we introduce the Perceptual Riddle Synthesizer (PRS), an automated framework for generating riddles with fine-grained perceptual descriptions. PRS not only generates valuable training data for abstract graphics but also provides fine-grained perceptual description, crucially allowing for supervision over intermediate reasoning stages and thereby improving both training efficacy and model interpretability. Our extensive experimental results on VisuRiddles empirically validate that fine-grained visual perception is the principal bottleneck and our synthesis framework markedly enhances the performance of contemporary MLLMs on these challenging tasks.

  Reasoning about dynamic spatial relationships is essential, as both observers and objects often move simultaneously. Although vision-language models (VLMs) and visual expertise models excel in 2D tasks and static scenarios, their ability to fully understand dynamic 3D scenarios remains limited. We introduce Dynamic Spatial Intelligence and propose DSI-Bench, a benchmark with nearly 1,000 dynamic videos and over 1,700 manually annotated questions covering nine decoupled motion patterns of observers and objects. Spatially and temporally symmetric designs reduce biases and enable systematic evaluation of models' reasoning about self-motion and object motion. Our evaluation of 14 VLMs and expert models reveals key limitations: models often conflate observer and object motion, exhibit semantic biases, and fail to accurately infer relative relationships in dynamic scenarios. Our DSI-Bench provides valuable findings and insights about the future development of general and expertise models with dynamic spatial intelligence.

  Graph Transformers (GTs) have emerged as a powerful paradigm for graph representation learning due to their ability to model diverse node interactions. However, existing GTs often rely on intricate architectural designs tailored to specific interactions, limiting their flexibility. To address this, we propose a unified hierarchical mask framework that reveals an underlying equivalence between model architecture and attention mask construction. This framework enables a consistent modeling paradigm by capturing diverse interactions through carefully designed attention masks. Theoretical analysis under this framework demonstrates that the probability of correct classification positively correlates with the receptive field size and label consistency, leading to a fundamental design principle: an effective attention mask should ensure both a sufficiently large receptive field and a high level of label consistency. While no single existing mask satisfies this principle across all scenarios, our analysis reveals that hierarchical masks offer complementary strengths, motivating their effective integration. Then, we introduce M3Dphormer, a Mixture-of-Experts-based Graph Transformer with Multi-Level Masking and Dual Attention Computation. M3Dphormer incorporates three theoretically grounded hierarchical masks and employs a bi-level expert routing mechanism to adaptively integrate multi-level interaction information. To ensure scalability, we further introduce a dual attention computation scheme that dynamically switches between dense and sparse modes based on local mask sparsity. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that M3Dphormer achieves state-of-the-art performance, validating the effectiveness of our unified framework and model design.

  Video tracking aims at finding the specific target in subsequent frames given its initial state. Due to the varying granularity of target states across different tasks, most existing trackers are tailored to a single task and heavily rely on custom-designed modules within the individual task, which limits their generalization and leads to redundancy in both model design and parameters. To unify video tracking tasks, we present SAM 2++, a unified model towards tracking at any granularity, including masks, boxes, and points. First, to extend target granularity, we design task-specific prompts to encode various task inputs into general prompt embeddings, and a unified decoder to unify diverse task results into a unified form pre-output. Next, to satisfy memory matching, the core operation of tracking, we introduce a task-adaptive memory mechanism that unifies memory across different granularities. Finally, we introduce a customized data engine to support tracking training at any granularity, producing a large and diverse video tracking dataset with rich annotations at three granularities, termed Tracking-Any-Granularity, which represents a comprehensive resource for training and benchmarking on unified tracking. Comprehensive experiments on multiple benchmarks confirm that SAM 2++ sets a new state of the art across diverse tracking tasks at different granularities, establishing a unified and robust tracking framework.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  A recent class of hyperspectral anomaly detection methods that can be trained once on background datasets and then universally deployed -- without per-scene retraining or parameter tuning -- has demonstrated remarkable efficiency and robustness. Building upon this paradigm, we focus on the integration of spectral and spatial cues and introduce a novel "Rebellious Student" framework for complementary feature learning. Unlike conventional teacher-student paradigms driven by imitation, our method intentionally trains the spatial branch to diverge from the spectral teacher, thereby learning complementary spatial patterns that the teacher fails to capture. A two-stage learning strategy is adopted: (1) a spectral enhancement network is first trained via reverse distillation to obtain robust background spectral representations; and (2) a spatial network -- the rebellious student -- is subsequently optimized using decorrelation losses that enforce feature orthogonality while maintaining reconstruction fidelity to avoid irrelevant noise. Once trained, the framework enhances both spectral and spatial background features, enabling parameter-free and training-free anomaly detection when paired with conventional detectors. Extensive experiments on the HAD100 benchmark show substantial improvements over several established baselines with minimal computational overhead, confirming the effectiveness and generality of the proposed complementary learning paradigm.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As urbanization and climate change progress, urban heat island effects are becoming more frequent and severe. To formulate effective mitigation plans, cities require detailed air temperature data, yet conventional machine learning models with limited data often produce inaccurate predictions, particularly in underserved areas. Geospatial foundation models trained on global unstructured data offer a promising alternative by demonstrating strong generalization and requiring only minimal fine-tuning. In this study, an empirical ground truth of urban heat patterns is established by quantifying cooling effects from green spaces and benchmarking them against model predictions to evaluate the model's accuracy. The foundation model is subsequently fine-tuned to predict land surface temperatures under future climate scenarios, and its practical value is demonstrated through a simulated inpainting that highlights its role for mitigation support. The results indicate that foundation models offer a powerful way for evaluating urban heat island mitigation strategies in data-scarce regions to support more climate-resilient cities.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper investigates the problem of Generalized Category Discovery (GCD). Given a partially labelled dataset, GCD aims to categorize all unlabelled images, regardless of whether they belong to known or unknown classes. Existing approaches typically depend on either single-level semantics or manually designed abstract hierarchies, which limit their generalizability and scalability. To address these limitations, we introduce a SEmantic-aware hierArchical Learning framework (SEAL), guided by naturally occurring and easily accessible hierarchical structures. Within SEAL, we propose a Hierarchical Semantic-Guided Soft Contrastive Learning approach that exploits hierarchical similarity to generate informative soft negatives, addressing the limitations of conventional contrastive losses that treat all negatives equally. Furthermore, a Cross-Granularity Consistency (CGC) module is designed to align the predictions from different levels of granularity. SEAL consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance on fine-grained benchmarks, including the SSB benchmark, Oxford-Pet, and the Herbarium19 dataset, and further demonstrates generalization on coarse-grained datasets.

  _Hao Wang, Ying Zhou, Haoyu Zhao, Rui Wang, Qiang Hu, Xing Zhang, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a pivotal technique for real-time view synthesis in colonoscopy, enabling critical applications such as virtual colonoscopy and lesion tracking. However, the vanilla 3DGS assumes static illumination and that observed appearance depends solely on viewing angle, which causes incompatibility with the photometric variations in colonoscopic scenes induced by dynamic light source/camera. This mismatch forces most 3DGS methods to introduce structure-violating vaporous Gaussian blobs between the camera and tissues to compensate for illumination attenuation, ultimately degrading the quality of 3D reconstructions. Previous works only consider the illumination attenuation caused by light distance, ignoring the physical characters of light source and camera. In this paper, we propose ColIAGS, an improved 3DGS framework tailored for colonoscopy. To mimic realistic appearance under varying illumination, we introduce an Improved Appearance Modeling with two types of illumination attenuation factors, which enables Gaussians to adapt to photometric variations while preserving geometry accuracy. To ensure the geometry approximation condition of appearance modeling, we propose an Improved Geometry Modeling using high-dimensional view embedding to enhance Gaussian geometry attribute prediction. Furthermore, another cosine embedding input is leveraged to generate illumination attenuation solutions in an implicit manner. Comprehensive experimental results on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our proposed ColIAGS achieves the dual capabilities of novel view synthesis and accurate geometric reconstruction. It notably outperforms other state-of-the-art methods by achieving superior rendering fidelity while significantly reducing Depth MSE. Code will be available.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Although Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated proficiency in video captioning, practical applications require captions that follow specific user instructions rather than generating exhaustive, unconstrained descriptions. Current benchmarks, however, primarily assess descriptive comprehensiveness while largely overlooking instruction-following capabilities. To address this gap, we introduce IF-VidCap, a new benchmark for evaluating controllable video captioning, which contains 1,400 high-quality samples. Distinct from existing video captioning or general instruction-following benchmarks, IF-VidCap incorporates a systematic framework that assesses captions on two dimensions: format correctness and content correctness. Our comprehensive evaluation of over 20 prominent models reveals a nuanced landscape: despite the continued dominance of proprietary models, the performance gap is closing, with top-tier open-source solutions now achieving near-parity. Furthermore, we find that models specialized for dense captioning underperform general-purpose MLLMs on complex instructions, indicating that future work should simultaneously advance both descriptive richness and instruction-following fidelity.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Contrastive vision-language models such as CLIP have demonstrated strong performance across a wide range of multimodal tasks by learning from aligned image-text pairs. However, their ability to handle complex, real-world web documents remains limited, particularly in scenarios where text and images are interleaved, loosely aligned, or embedded in visual form. To address these challenges, we propose Vision-Centric Contrastive Learning (VC2L), a unified framework that models text, images, and their combinations using a single vision transformer. VC2L operates entirely in pixel space by rendering all inputs, whether textual, visual, or combined, as images, thus eliminating the need for OCR, text tokenization, or modality fusion strategy. To capture complex cross-modal relationships in multimodal web documents, VC2L employs a snippet-level contrastive learning objective that aligns consecutive multimodal segments, leveraging the inherent coherence of documents without requiring explicitly paired image-text data. To assess the effectiveness of this approach, we introduce three retrieval benchmarks, AnyCIR, SeqCIR, and CSR, designed to evaluate cross-modal retrieval, fine-grained sequential understanding, and generalization to unseen data, respectively. Empirical results show that VC2L achieves competitive or superior performance compared to CLIP-style models on both the proposed benchmarks and established datasets such as M-BEIR and MTEB. These findings underscore the potential of multimodal web data as a valuable training resource for contrastive learning and illustrate the scalability of a unified, vision-centric approach for multimodal representation learning.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent progress in text-to-image (T2I) generation underscores the importance of reliable benchmarks in evaluating how accurately generated images reflect the semantics of their textual prompt. However, (1) existing benchmarks lack the diversity of prompt scenarios and multilingual support, both essential for real-world applicability; (2) they offer only coarse evaluations across primary dimensions, covering a narrow range of sub-dimensions, and fall short in fine-grained sub-dimension assessment. To address these limitations, we introduce UniGenBench++, a unified semantic assessment benchmark for T2I generation. Specifically, it comprises 600 prompts organized hierarchically to ensure both coverage and efficiency: (1) spans across diverse real-world scenarios, i.e., 5 main prompt themes and 20 subthemes; (2) comprehensively probes T2I models' semantic consistency over 10 primary and 27 sub evaluation criteria, with each prompt assessing multiple testpoints. To rigorously assess model robustness to variations in language and prompt length, we provide both English and Chinese versions of each prompt in short and long forms. Leveraging the general world knowledge and fine-grained image understanding capabilities of a closed-source Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM), i.e., Gemini-2.5-Pro, an effective pipeline is developed for reliable benchmark construction and streamlined model assessment. Moreover, to further facilitate community use, we train a robust evaluation model that enables offline assessment of T2I model outputs. Through comprehensive benchmarking of both open- and closed-sourced T2I models, we systematically reveal their strengths and weaknesses across various aspects.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Robust perception in automated driving requires reliable performance under adverse conditions, where sensors may be affected by partial failures or environmental occlusions. Although existing autonomous driving datasets inherently contain sensor noise and environmental variability, very few enable controlled, parameterised, and reproducible degradations across multiple sensing modalities. This gap limits the ability to systematically evaluate how perception and fusion architectures perform under well-defined adverse conditions. To address this limitation, we introduce the Occluded nuScenes Dataset, a novel extension of the widely used nuScenes benchmark. For the camera modality, we release both the full and mini versions with four types of occlusions, two adapted from public implementations and two newly designed. For radar and LiDAR, we provide parameterised occlusion scripts that implement three types of degradations each, enabling flexible and repeatable generation of occluded data. This resource supports consistent, reproducible evaluation of perception models under partial sensor failures and environmental interference. By releasing the first multi-sensor occlusion dataset with controlled and reproducible degradations, we aim to advance research on robust sensor fusion, resilience analysis, and safety-critical perception in automated driving.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Typical template-based object pose pipelines estimate the pose by retrieving the closest matching template and aligning it with the observed image. However, failure to retrieve the correct template often leads to inaccurate pose predictions. To address this, we reformulate template-based object pose estimation as a ray alignment problem, where the viewing directions from multiple posed template images are learned to align with a non-posed query image. Inspired by recent progress in diffusion-based camera pose estimation, we embed this formulation into a diffusion transformer architecture that aligns a query image with a set of posed templates. We reparameterize object rotation using object-centered camera rays and model object translation by extending scale-invariant translation estimation to dense translation offsets. Our model leverages geometric priors from the templates to guide accurate query pose inference. A coarse-to-fine training strategy based on narrowed template sampling improves performance without modifying the network architecture. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets show competitive results of our method compared to state-of-the-art approaches in unseen object pose estimation.

  The rise of convenience packaging has led to generation of enormous waste, making efficient waste sorting crucial for sustainable waste management. To address this, we developed DWaste, a computer vision-powered platform designed for real-time waste sorting on resource-constrained smartphones and edge devices, including offline functionality. We benchmarked various image classification models (EfficientNetV2S/M, ResNet50/101, MobileNet) and object detection (YOLOv8n, YOLOv11n) using a subset of our own waste data set and annotated it using the custom tool Annotated Lab. We found a clear trade-off between accuracy and resource consumption: the best classifier, EfficientNetV2S, achieved high accuracy (~ 96%) but suffered from high latency (~ 0.22s) and elevated carbon emissions. In contrast, lightweight object detection models delivered strong performance (up to 77% mAP) with ultra-fast inference (~ 0.03s) and significantly smaller model sizes (< 7MB), making them ideal for real-time, low-power use. Model quantization further maximized efficiency, substantially reducing model size and VRAM usage by up to 75%. Our work demonstrates the successful implementation of "Greener AI" models to support real-time, sustainable waste sorting on edge devices.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce Mono4DGS-HDR, the first system for reconstructing renderable 4D high dynamic range (HDR) scenes from unposed monocular low dynamic range (LDR) videos captured with alternating exposures. To tackle such a challenging problem, we present a unified framework with two-stage optimization approach based on Gaussian Splatting. The first stage learns a video HDR Gaussian representation in orthographic camera coordinate space, eliminating the need for camera poses and enabling robust initial HDR video reconstruction. The second stage transforms video Gaussians into world space and jointly refines the world Gaussians with camera poses. Furthermore, we propose a temporal luminance regularization strategy to enhance the temporal consistency of the HDR appearance. Since our task has not been studied before, we construct a new evaluation benchmark using publicly available datasets for HDR video reconstruction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Mono4DGS-HDR significantly outperforms alternative solutions adapted from state-of-the-art methods in both rendering quality and speed.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Human-Object Interaction Detection (HOI-DET) aims to localize human-object pairs and identify their interactive relationships. To aggregate contextual cues, existing methods typically propagate information across all detected entities via self-attention mechanisms, or establish message passing between humans and objects with bipartite graphs. However, they primarily focus on pairwise relationships, overlooking that interactions in real-world scenarios often emerge from collective behaviors (multiple humans and objects engaging in joint activities). In light of this, we revisit relation modeling from a group view and propose GroupHOI, a framework that propagates contextual information in terms of geometric proximity and semantic similarity. To exploit the geometric proximity, humans and objects are grouped into distinct clusters using a learnable proximity estimator based on spatial features derived from bounding boxes. In each group, a soft correspondence is computed via self-attention to aggregate and dispatch contextual cues. To incorporate the semantic similarity, we enhance the vanilla transformer-based interaction decoder with local contextual cues from HO-pair features. Extensive experiments on HICO-DET and V-COCO benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of GroupHOI over the state-of-the-art methods. It also exhibits leading performance on the more challenging Nonverbal Interaction Detection (NVI-DET) task, which involves varied forms of higher-order interactions within groups.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Audio-Visual Question Answering (AVQA) requires models to effectively utilize both visual and auditory modalities to answer complex and diverse questions about audio-visual scenes. However, existing methods lack sufficient flexibility and dynamic adaptability in temporal sampling and modality preference awareness, making it difficult to focus on key information based on the question. This limits their reasoning capability in complex scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework named AV-Master. It enhances the model's ability to extract key information from complex audio-visual scenes with substantial redundant content by dynamically modeling both temporal and modality dimensions. In the temporal dimension, we introduce a dynamic adaptive focus sampling mechanism that progressively focuses on audio-visual segments most relevant to the question, effectively mitigating redundancy and segment fragmentation in traditional sampling methods. In the modality dimension, we propose a preference-aware strategy that models each modality's contribution independently, enabling selective activation of critical features. Furthermore, we introduce a dual-path contrastive loss to reinforce consistency and complementarity across temporal and modality dimensions, guiding the model to learn question-specific cross-modal collaborative representations. Experiments on four large-scale benchmarks show that AV-Master significantly outperforms existing methods, especially in complex reasoning tasks.

  Realistic view extrapolation is critical for closed-loop simulation in autonomous driving, yet it remains a significant challenge for current Novel View Synthesis (NVS) methods, which often produce distorted and inconsistent images beyond the original trajectory. This report presents our winning solution which ctook first place in the RealADSim Workshop NVS track at ICCV 2025. To address the core challenges of street view extrapolation, we introduce a comprehensive four-stage pipeline. First, we employ a data-driven initialization strategy to generate a robust pseudo-LiDAR point cloud, avoiding local minima. Second, we inject strong geometric priors by modeling the road surface with a novel dimension-reduced SDF termed 2D-SDF. Third, we leverage a generative prior to create pseudo ground truth for extrapolated viewpoints, providing auxilary supervision. Finally, a data-driven adaptation network removes time-specific artifacts. On the RealADSim-NVS benchmark, our method achieves a final score of 0.441, ranking first among all participants.

  The increasing frequency of natural and human-induced disasters necessitates advanced visual recognition techniques capable of analyzing critical photographic data. With progress in artificial intelligence and resilient computational systems, rapid and accurate disaster classification has become crucial for efficient rescue operations. However, visual recognition in disaster contexts faces significant challenges due to limited and diverse data from the difficulties in collecting and curating comprehensive, high-quality disaster imagery. Few-Shot Learning (FSL) provides a promising approach to data scarcity, yet current FSL research mainly relies on generic benchmark datasets lacking remote-sensing disaster imagery, limiting its practical effectiveness. Moreover, disaster images exhibit high intra-class variation and inter-class similarity, hindering the performance of conventional metric-based FSL methods. To address these issues, this paper introduces the Attention-based Bhattacharyya-Hellinger Feature Aggregation Network (ATTBHFA-Net), which linearly combines the Bhattacharyya coefficient and Hellinger distances to compare and aggregate feature probability distributions for robust prototype formation. The Bhattacharyya coefficient serves as a contrastive margin that enhances inter-class separability, while the Hellinger distance regularizes same-class alignment. This framework parallels contrastive learning but operates over probability distributions rather than embedded feature points. Furthermore, a Bhattacharyya-Hellinger distance-based contrastive loss is proposed as a distributional counterpart to cosine similarity loss, used jointly with categorical cross-entropy to significantly improve FSL performance. Experiments on four FSL benchmarks and two disaster image datasets demonstrate the superior effectiveness and generalization of ATTBHFA-Net compared to existing approaches.

  Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have recently achieved impressive results in multimodal tasks such as image captioning and visual question answering. However, they remain prone to object hallucination -- generating descriptions of nonexistent or misidentified objects. Prior work has partially mitigated this via auxiliary training objectives or external modules, but challenges remain in terms of scalability, adaptability, and model independence. To address these limitations, we propose Adaptive Token Ensemble Decoding (ATED), a training-free, token-level ensemble framework that mitigates hallucination by aggregating predictions from multiple LVLMs during inference. ATED dynamically computes uncertainty-based weights for each model, reflecting their reliability at each decoding step. It also integrates diverse decoding paths to improve contextual grounding and semantic consistency. Experiments on standard hallucination detection benchmarks demonstrate that ATED significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, reducing hallucination without compromising fluency or relevance. Our findings highlight the benefits of adaptive ensembling and point to a promising direction for improving LVLM robustness in high-stakes applications. The code is available atthis https URL.

  Incentivizing the reasoning ability of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) is essential for medical applications to transparently analyze medical scans and provide reliable diagnosis. However, existing medical MLLMs rely solely on internal knowledge during reasoning, leading to hallucinated reasoning and factual inaccuracies when encountering cases beyond their training scope. Although recent Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods elicit the medical model's proactive retrieval ability during reasoning, they are confined to unimodal LLMs, neglecting the crucial visual information during reasoning and retrieval. Consequently, we propose the first Multimodal Medical Reasoning-with-Retrieval framework, Med-RwR, which actively retrieves external knowledge by querying observed symptoms or domain-specific medical concepts during reasoning. Specifically, we design a two-stage reinforcement learning strategy with tailored rewards that stimulate the model to leverage both visual diagnostic findings and textual clinical information for effective retrieval. Building on this foundation, we further propose a Confidence-Driven Image Re-retrieval (CDIR) method for test-time scaling when low prediction confidence is detected. Evaluation on various public medical benchmarks demonstrates Med-RwR's significant improvements over baseline models, proving the effectiveness of enhancing reasoning capabilities with external knowledge integration. Furthermore, Med-RwR demonstrates remarkable generalizability to unfamiliar domains, evidenced by 8.8% performance gain on our proposed EchoCardiography Benchmark (ECBench), despite the scarcity of echocardiography data in the training corpus.

  Large vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable success in natural scene understanding, yet their application to underwater environments remains largely unexplored. Underwater imagery presents unique challenges including severe light attenuation, color distortion, and suspended particle scattering, while requiring specialized knowledge of marine ecosystems and organism taxonomy. To bridge this gap, we introduce UWBench, a comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for underwater vision-language understanding. UWBench comprises 15,003 high-resolution underwater images captured across diverse aquatic environments, encompassing oceans, coral reefs, and deep-sea habitats. Each image is enriched with human-verified annotations including 15,281 object referring expressions that precisely describe marine organisms and underwater structures, and 124,983 question-answer pairs covering diverse reasoning capabilities from object recognition to ecological relationship understanding. The dataset captures rich variations in visibility, lighting conditions, and water turbidity, providing a realistic testbed for model evaluation. Based on UWBench, we establish three comprehensive benchmarks: detailed image captioning for generating ecologically informed scene descriptions, visual grounding for precise localization of marine organisms, and visual question answering for multimodal reasoning about underwater environments. Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art VLMs demonstrate that underwater understanding remains challenging, with substantial room for improvement. Our benchmark provides essential resources for advancing vision-language research in underwater contexts and supporting applications in marine science, ecological monitoring, and autonomous underwater exploration. Our code and benchmark will be available.

  Understanding 3D scenes is pivotal for autonomous driving, robotics, and augmented reality. Recent semantic Gaussian Splatting approaches leverage large-scale 2D vision models to project 2D semantic features onto 3D scenes. However, they suffer from two major limitations: (1) insufficient contextual cues for individual masks during preprocessing and (2) inconsistencies and missing details when fusing multi-view features from these 2D models. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{OpenInsGaussian}, an \textbf{Open}-vocabulary \textbf{Ins}tance \textbf{Gaussian} segmentation framework with Context-aware Cross-view Fusion. Our method consists of two modules: Context-Aware Feature Extraction, which augments each mask with rich semantic context, and Attention-Driven Feature Aggregation, which selectively fuses multi-view features to mitigate alignment errors and incompleteness. Through extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, OpenInsGaussian achieves state-of-the-art results in open-vocabulary 3D Gaussian segmentation, outperforming existing baselines by a large margin. These findings underscore the robustness and generality of our proposed approach, marking a significant step forward in 3D scene understanding and its practical deployment across diverse real-world scenarios.

  Zero-shot 3D object classification is crucial for real-world applications like autonomous driving, however it is often hindered by a significant domain gap between the synthetic data used for training and the sparse, noisy LiDAR scans encountered in the real-world. Current methods trained solely on synthetic data fail to generalize to outdoor scenes, while those trained only on real data lack the semantic diversity to recognize rare or unseen objects.We introduce BlendCLIP, a multimodal pretraining framework that bridges this synthetic-to-real gap by strategically combining the strengths of both domains. We first propose a pipeline to generate a large-scale dataset of object-level triplets -- consisting of a point cloud, image, and text description -- mined directly from real-world driving data and human annotated 3D boxes. Our core contribution is a curriculum-based data mixing strategy that first grounds the model in the semantically rich synthetic CAD data before progressively adapting it to the specific characteristics of real-world scans.Our experiments show that our approach is highly label-efficient: introducing as few as 1.5\% real-world samples per batch into training boosts zero-shot accuracy on the nuScenes benchmark by 27\%. Consequently, our final model achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging outdoor datasets like nuScenes and TruckScenes, improving over the best prior method by 19.3\% on nuScenes, while maintaining strong generalization on diverse synthetic benchmarks. Our findings demonstrate that effective domain adaptation, not full-scale real-world annotation, is the key to unlocking robust open-vocabulary 3D perception.

  _Haoran Wei, Yaofeng Sun, Yukun Li_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present DeepSeek-OCR as an initial investigation into the feasibility of compressing long contexts via optical 2D mapping. DeepSeek-OCR consists of two components: DeepEncoder and DeepSeek3B-MoE-A570M as the decoder. Specifically, DeepEncoder serves as the core engine, designed to maintain low activations under high-resolution input while achieving high compression ratios to ensure an optimal and manageable number of vision tokens. Experiments show that when the number of text tokens is within 10 times that of vision tokens (i.e., a compression ratio < 10x), the model can achieve decoding (OCR) precision of 97%. Even at a compression ratio of 20x, the OCR accuracy still remains at about 60%. This shows considerable promise for research areas such as historical long-context compression and memory forgetting mechanisms in LLMs. Beyond this, DeepSeek-OCR also demonstrates high practical value. On OmniDocBench, it surpasses GOT-OCR2.0 (256 tokens/page) using only 100 vision tokens, and outperforms MinerU2.0 (6000+ tokens per page on average) while utilizing fewer than 800 vision tokens. In production, DeepSeek-OCR can generate training data for LLMs/VLMs at a scale of 200k+ pages per day (a single A100-40G). Codes and model weights are publicly accessible atthis http URL.

  Papillary thyroid microcarcinoma (PTMC) is increasingly managed with radio-frequency ablation (RFA), yet accurate lesion segmentation in ultrasound videos remains difficult due to low contrast, probe-induced motion, and heat-related artifacts. The recent Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM-2) generalizes well to static images, but its frame-independent design yields unstable predictions and temporal drift in interventional ultrasound. We introduce \textbf{EMA-SAM}, a lightweight extension of SAM-2 that incorporates a confidence-weighted exponential moving average pointer into the memory bank, providing a stable latent prototype of the tumour across frames. This design preserves temporal coherence through probe pressure and bubble occlusion while rapidly adapting once clear evidence reappears. On our curated PTMC-RFA dataset (124 minutes, 13 patients), EMA-SAM improves \emph{maxDice} from 0.82 (SAM-2) to 0.86 and \emph{maxIoU} from 0.72 to 0.76, while reducing false positives by 29\%. On external benchmarks, including VTUS and colonoscopy video polyp datasets, EMA-SAM achieves consistent gains of 2--5 Dice points over SAM-2. Importantly, the EMA pointer adds \textless0.1\% FLOPs, preserving real-time throughput of $\sim$30\,FPS on a single A100 GPU. These results establish EMA-SAM as a robust and efficient framework for stable tumour tracking, bridging the gap between foundation models and the stringent demands of interventional ultrasound.

  Generative world models (WMs) can now simulate worlds with striking visual realism, which naturally raises the question of whether they can endow embodied agents with predictive perception for decision making. Progress on this question has been limited by fragmented evaluation: most existing benchmarks adopt open-loop protocols that emphasize visual quality in isolation, leaving the core issue of embodied utility unresolved, i.e., do WMs actually help agents succeed at embodied tasks? To address this gap, we introduce World-in-World, the first open platform that benchmarks WMs in a closed-loop world that mirrors real agent-environment interactions. World-in-World provides a unified online planning strategy and a standardized action API, enabling heterogeneous WMs for decision making. We curate four closed-loop environments that rigorously evaluate diverse WMs, prioritize task success as the primary metric, and move beyond the common focus on visual quality; we also present the first data scaling law for world models in embodied settings. Our study uncovers three surprises: (1) visual quality alone does not guarantee task success, controllability matters more; (2) scaling post-training with action-observation data is more effective than upgrading the pretrained video generators; and (3) allocating more inference-time compute allows WMs to substantially improve closed-loop performance.

  Instruction-based image editing has achieved remarkable progress; however, models solely trained via supervised fine-tuning often overfit to annotated patterns, hindering their ability to explore and generalize beyond training distributions. To this end, we introduce Edit-R1, a novel post-training framework for instruction-based image editing based on policy optimization. Specifically, we utilize Diffusion Negative-aware Finetuning (DiffusionNFT), a likelihood-free policy optimization method consistent with the flow matching forward process, thereby enabling the use of higher-order samplers and more efficient training. Another key challenge here is the absence of a universal reward model, resulting from the diverse nature of editing instructions and tasks. To bridge this gap, we employ a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) as a unified, training-free reward model, leveraging its output logits to provide fine-grained feedback. Furthermore, we carefully design a low-variance group filtering mechanism to reduce MLLM scoring noise and stabilize optimization. UniWorld-V2, trained with this framework, achieves \textbf{state-of-the-art} results on the ImgEdit and GEdit-Bench benchmarks, scoring 4.49 and 7.83, respectively. Crucially, our framework is model-agnostic, delivering substantial performance gains when applied to diverse base models like Qwen-Image-Edit and FLUX-Kontext, demonstrating its wide applicability.

  Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) are increasingly applied to scientific research, yet it remains unclear whether they can reliably understand and reason over the multimodal complexity of papers. A central challenge lies in detecting and resolving inconsistencies across text, figures, tables, and equations, issues that are often subtle, domain-specific, and ultimately undermine clarity, reproducibility, and trust. Existing benchmarks overlook this issue, either isolating single modalities or relying on synthetic errors that fail to capture real-world complexity. We introduce PRISMM-Bench (Peer-Review-sourced Inconsistency Set for Multimodal Models), the first benchmark grounded in real reviewer-flagged inconsistencies in scientific papers. Through a multi-stage pipeline of review mining, LLM-assisted filtering and human verification, we curate 262 inconsistencies from 242 papers. Based on this set, we design three tasks, namely inconsistency identification, remedy and pair matching, which assess a model's capacity to detect, correct, and reason over inconsistencies across different modalities. Furthermore, to address the notorious problem of choice-only shortcuts in multiple-choice evaluation, where models exploit answer patterns without truly understanding the question, we further introduce structured JSON-based answer representations that minimize linguistic biases by reducing reliance on superficial stylistic cues. We benchmark 21 leading LMMs, including large open-weight models (GLM-4.5V 106B, InternVL3 78B) and proprietary models (Gemini 2.5 Pro, GPT-5 with high reasoning). Results reveal strikingly low performance (26.1-54.2%), underscoring the challenge of multimodal scientific reasoning and motivating progress towards trustworthy scientific assistants.

  The sparse cross-modality detector offers more advantages than its counterpart, the Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) detector, particularly in terms of adaptability for downstream tasks and computational cost savings. However, existing sparse detectors overlook the quality of token representation, leaving it with a sub-optimal foreground quality and limited performance. In this paper, we identify that the geometric structure preserved and the class distribution are the key to improving the performance of the sparse detector, and propose a Sparse Selector (SS). The core module of SS is Ray-Aware Supervision (RAS), which preserves rich geometric information during the training stage, and Class-Balanced Supervision, which adaptively reweights the salience of class semantics, ensuring that tokens associated with small objects are retained during token sampling. Thereby, outperforming other sparse multi-modal detectors in the representation of tokens. Additionally, we design Ray Positional Encoding (Ray PE) to address the distribution differences between the LiDAR modality and the image. Finally, we integrate the aforementioned module into an end-to-end sparse multi-modality detector, dubbed CrossRay3D. Experiments show that, on the challenging nuScenes benchmark, CrossRay3D achieves state-of-the-art performance with 72.4 mAP and 74.7 NDS, while running 1.84 faster than other leading methods. Moreover, CrossRay3D demonstrates strong robustness even in scenarios where LiDAR or camera data are partially or entirely missing.

  Aligning features from different modalities, is one of the most fundamental challenges for cross-modal tasks. Although pre-trained vision-language models can achieve a general alignment between image and text, they often require parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) for further adjustment. Today's PEFT methods (e.g., prompt tuning, LoRA-based, or adapter-based) always selectively fine-tune a subset of parameters, which can slightly adjust either visual or textual features, and avoid overfitting. In this paper, we are the first to highlight that all existing PEFT methods perform one-step adjustment. It is insufficient for complex (or difficult) datasets, where features of different modalities are highly entangled. To this end, we propose the first model-agnostic multi-step adjustment approach by learning a cross-modal velocity field: Flow Matching Alignment (FMA). Specifically, to ensure the correspondence between categories during training, we first utilize a fixed coupling strategy. Then, we propose a noise augmentation strategy to alleviate the data scarcity issue. Finally, we design an early-stopping solver, which terminates the transformation process earlier, improving both efficiency and accuracy. Compared with one-step PEFT methods, FMA has the multi-step rectification ability to achieve more precise and robust alignment. Extensive results have demonstrated that FMA can consistently yield significant performance gains across various benchmarks and backbones, particularly on challenging datasets.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The recent rapid advancement of Text-to-Video (T2V) generation technologies, which are critical to build ``world models'', makes the existing benchmarks increasingly insufficient to evaluate state-of-the-art T2V models. First, current evaluation dimensions, such as per-frame aesthetic quality and temporal consistency, are no longer able to differentiate state-of-the-art T2V models. Second, event-level temporal causality, which not only distinguishes video from other modalities but also constitutes a crucial component of world models, is severely underexplored in existing benchmarks. Third, existing benchmarks lack a systematic assessment of world knowledge, which are essential capabilities for building world models. To address these issues, we introduce VideoVerse, a comprehensive benchmark that focuses on evaluating whether a T2V model could understand complex temporal causality and world knowledge in the real world. We collect representative videos across diverse domains (e.g., natural landscapes, sports, indoor scenes, science fiction, chemical and physical experiments) and extract their event-level descriptions with inherent temporal causality, which are then rewritten into text-to-video prompts by independent annotators. For each prompt, we design a suite of binary evaluation questions from the perspective of dynamic and static properties, with a total of ten carefully defined evaluation dimensions. In total, our VideoVerse comprises 300 carefully curated prompts, involving 815 events and 793 binary evaluation questions. Consequently, a human preference aligned QA-based evaluation pipeline is developed by using modern vision-language models. Finally, we perform a systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art open-source and closed-source T2V models on VideoVerse, providing in-depth analysis on how far the current T2V generators are from world models.

  Panorama has a full FoV (360$^\circ\times$180$^\circ$), offering a more complete visual description than perspective images. Thanks to this characteristic, panoramic depth estimation is gaining increasing traction in 3D vision. However, due to the scarcity of panoramic data, previous methods are often restricted to in-domain settings, leading to poor zero-shot generalization. Furthermore, due to the spherical distortions inherent in panoramas, many approaches rely on perspective splitting (e.g., cubemaps), which leads to suboptimal efficiency. To address these challenges, we propose $\textbf{DA}$$^{\textbf{2}}$: $\textbf{D}$epth $\textbf{A}$nything in $\textbf{A}$ny $\textbf{D}$irection, an accurate, zero-shot generalizable, and fully end-to-end panoramic depth estimator. Specifically, for scaling up panoramic data, we introduce a data curation engine for generating high-quality panoramic depth data from perspective, and create $\sim$543K panoramic RGB-depth pairs, bringing the total to $\sim$607K. To further mitigate the spherical distortions, we present SphereViT, which explicitly leverages spherical coordinates to enforce the spherical geometric consistency in panoramic image features, yielding improved performance. A comprehensive benchmark on multiple datasets clearly demonstrates DA$^{2}$'s SoTA performance, with an average 38% improvement on AbsRel over the strongest zero-shot baseline. Surprisingly, DA$^{2}$ even outperforms prior in-domain methods, highlighting its superior zero-shot generalization. Moreover, as an end-to-end solution, DA$^{2}$ exhibits much higher efficiency over fusion-based approaches. Both the code and the curated panoramic data has be released. Project page:this https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Federated Prompt Learning (FPL) enables communication-efficient adaptation by tuning lightweight prompts on top of frozen pre-trained models. Existing FPL methods typically rely on global information, which is only available after the second training round, to facilitate collaboration among client models. Therefore, they are inherently dependent on multi-round communication to fully exhibit their strengths. Moreover, existing one-shot federated learning methods typically focus on fitting seen tasks, but lack cross-task generalization. To bridge this gap, we propose the Global Prompt Refinement with Non-Interfering Attention Masking (GPR-NIAM) method for one-shot FPL. The core idea is to design a masking mechanism that restricts excessive interaction between the original text embeddings and the learnable prompt embeddings. GPR-NIAM achieves this through the collaboration of two key modules. Firstly, the attention isolation module suppresses attention from the learnable prompt tokens to the original text tokens, and reweights the reverse attention which preserves generalization across tasks. Secondly, the cross-silo collaborative refinement module integrates decentralized visual knowledge into a unified base and calibrates the global prompt through multi-source cross-modal knowledge alignment, further mitigating the inconsistency caused by data heterogeneity. Extensive experiments conducted on ten benchmark datasets under two tasks show that GPR-NIAM outperforms eight state-of-the-art methods in both class-level and domain-level generalization.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Common computer vision systems typically assume ideal pinhole cameras but fail when facing real-world camera effects such as fisheye distortion and rolling shutter, mainly due to the lack of learning from training data with camera effects. Existing data generation approaches suffer from either high costs, sim-to-real gaps or fail to accurately model camera effects. To address this bottleneck, we propose 4D Gaussian Ray Tracing (4D-GRT), a novel two-stage pipeline that combines 4D Gaussian Splatting with physically-based ray tracing for camera effect simulation. Given multi-view videos, 4D-GRT first reconstructs dynamic scenes, then applies ray tracing to generate videos with controllable, physically accurate camera effects. 4D-GRT achieves the fastest rendering speed while performing better or comparable rendering quality compared to existing baselines. Additionally, we construct eight synthetic dynamic scenes in indoor environments across four camera effects as a benchmark to evaluate generated videos with camera effects.

  Image geolocalization aims to predict the geographic location of images captured anywhere on Earth, but its global nature presents significant challenges. Current evaluation methodologies suffer from two major limitations. First, data leakage: advanced approaches often rely on large vision-language models (LVLMs) to predict image locations, yet these models are frequently pretrained on the test datasets, compromising the accuracy of evaluating a model's actual geolocalization capability. Second, existing metrics primarily rely on exact geographic coordinates to assess predictions, which not only neglects the reasoning process but also raises privacy concerns when user-level location data is required. To address these issues, we propose GeoArena, a first open platform for evaluating LVLMs on worldwide image geolocalization tasks, offering true in-the-wild and human-centered benchmarking. GeoArena enables users to upload in-the-wild images for a more diverse evaluation corpus, and it leverages pairwise human judgments to determine which model output better aligns with human expectations. Our platform has been deployed online for two months, during which we collected over thousands voting records. Based on this data, we conduct a detailed analysis and establish a leaderboard of different LVLMs on the image geolocalization task. GeoArena has been open-sourced to support future research.

  Conditional image generative models hold considerable promise to produce infinite amounts of synthetic training data. Yet, recent progress in generation quality has come at the expense of generation diversity, limiting the utility of these models as a source of synthetic training data. Although guidance-based approaches have been introduced to improve the utility of generated data by focusing on quality or diversity, the (implicit or explicit) utility functions oftentimes disregard the potential distribution shift between synthetic and real data. In this work, we introduce Chamfer Guidance: a training-free guidance approach which leverages a handful of real exemplar images to characterize the quality and diversity of synthetic data. We show that by leveraging the proposed Chamfer Guidance, we can boost the diversity of the generations w.r.t. a dataset of real images while maintaining or improving the generation quality on ImageNet-1k and standard geo-diversity benchmarks. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art few-shot performance with as little as 2 exemplar real images, obtaining 96.4% in terms of precision, and 86.4% in terms of distributional coverage, which increase to 97.5% and 92.7%, respectively, when using 32 real images. We showcase the benefits of the Chamfer Guidance generation by training downstream image classifiers on synthetic data, achieving accuracy boost of up to 15% for in-distribution over the baselines, and up to 16% in out-of-distribution. Furthermore, our approach does not require using the unconditional model, and thus obtains a 31% reduction in FLOPs w.r.t. classifier-free-guidance-based approaches at sampling time.

  Global dependency modeling and spatial position modeling are two core issues of the foundational architecture design in current deep learning frameworks. Recently, Vision Transformers (ViTs) have achieved remarkable success in computer vision, leveraging the powerful global dependency modeling capability of the self-attention mechanism. Furthermore, Mamba2 has demonstrated its significant potential in natural language processing tasks by explicitly modeling the spatial adjacency prior through the structured mask. In this paper, we propose Polyline Path Masked Attention (PPMA) that integrates the self-attention mechanism of ViTs with an enhanced structured mask of Mamba2, harnessing the complementary strengths of both architectures. Specifically, we first ameliorate the traditional structured mask of Mamba2 by introducing a 2D polyline path scanning strategy and derive its corresponding structured mask, polyline path mask, which better preserves the adjacency relationships among image tokens. Notably, we conduct a thorough theoretical analysis on the structural characteristics of the proposed polyline path mask and design an efficient algorithm for the computation of the polyline path mask. Next, we embed the polyline path mask into the self-attention mechanism of ViTs, enabling explicit modeling of spatial adjacency prior. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks, including image classification, object detection, and segmentation, demonstrate that our model outperforms previous state-of-the-art approaches based on both state-space models and Transformers. For example, our proposed PPMA-T/S/B models achieve 48.7%/51.1%/52.3% mIoU on the ADE20K semantic segmentation task, surpassing RMT-T/S/B by 0.7%/1.3%/0.3%, respectively.

  In real-word scenarios, person re-identification (ReID) expects to identify a person-of-interest via the descriptive query, regardless of whether the query is a single modality or a combination of multiple modalities. However, existing methods and datasets remain constrained to limited modalities, failing to meet this requirement. Therefore, we investigate a new challenging problem called Omni Multi-modal Person Re-identification (OM-ReID), which aims to achieve effective retrieval with varying multi-modal queries. To address dataset scarcity, we construct ORBench, the first high-quality multi-modal dataset comprising 1,000 unique identities across five modalities: RGB, infrared, color pencil, sketch, and textual description. This dataset also has significant superiority in terms of diversity, such as the painting perspectives and textual information. It could serve as an ideal platform for follow-up investigations in OM-ReID. Moreover, we propose ReID5o, a novel multi-modal learning framework for person ReID. It enables synergistic fusion and cross-modal alignment of arbitrary modality combinations in a single model, with a unified encoding and multi-expert routing mechanism proposed. Extensive experiments verify the advancement and practicality of our ORBench. A wide range of possible models have been evaluated and compared on it, and our proposed ReID5o model gives the best performance.

  3D visual grounding has made notable progress in localizing objects within complex 3D scenes. However, grounding referring expressions beyond objects in 3D scenes remains unexplored. In this paper, we introduce Anywhere3D-Bench, a holistic 3D visual grounding benchmark consisting of 2,886 referring expression-3D bounding box pairs spanning four different grounding levels: human-activity areas, unoccupied space beyond objects, individual objects in the scene, and fine-grained object parts. We assess a range of state-of-the-art 3D visual grounding methods alongside large language models (LLMs) and multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) on Anywhere3D-Bench. Experimental results reveal that space-level and part-level visual grounding pose the greatest challenges: space-level tasks require a more comprehensive spatial reasoning ability, for example, modeling distances and spatial relations within 3D space, while part-level tasks demand fine-grained perception of object composition. Even the best performance model, OpenAI o4-mini, achieves only 23.00% accuracy on space-level tasks and 31.46% on part-level tasks, significantly lower than its performance on area-level and object-level tasks. These findings underscore a critical gap in current models' capacity to understand and reason about 3D scenes beyond object-level semantics.

  Large vision-language models (VLMs) have made great achievements in Earth vision. However, complex disaster scenes with diverse disaster types, geographic regions, and satellite sensors have posed new challenges for VLM applications. To fill this gap, we curate a remote sensing vision-language dataset (DisasterM3) for global-scale disaster assessment and response. DisasterM3 includes 26,988 bi-temporal satellite images and 123k instruction pairs across 5 continents, with three characteristics: 1) Multi-hazard: DisasterM3 involves 36 historical disaster events with significant impacts, which are categorized into 10 common natural and man-made disasters. 2)Multi-sensor: Extreme weather during disasters often hinders optical sensor imaging, making it necessary to combine Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery for post-disaster scenes. 3) Multi-task: Based on real-world scenarios, DisasterM3 includes 9 disaster-related visual perception and reasoning tasks, harnessing the full potential of VLM's reasoning ability with progressing from disaster-bearing body recognition to structural damage assessment and object relational reasoning, culminating in the generation of long-form disaster reports. We extensively evaluated 14 generic and remote sensing VLMs on our benchmark, revealing that state-of-the-art models struggle with the disaster tasks, largely due to the lack of a disaster-specific corpus, cross-sensor gap, and damage object counting insensitivity. Focusing on these issues, we fine-tune four VLMs using our dataset and achieve stable improvements across all tasks, with robust cross-sensor and cross-disaster generalization capabilities.

  The real world is dynamic, yet most image fusion methods process static frames independently, ignoring temporal correlations in videos and leading to flickering and temporal inconsistency. To address this, we propose Unified Video Fusion (UniVF), a novel and unified framework for video fusion that leverages multi-frame learning and optical flow-based feature warping for informative, temporally coherent video fusion. To support its development, we also introduce Video Fusion Benchmark (VF-Bench), the first comprehensive benchmark covering four video fusion tasks: multi-exposure, multi-focus, infrared-visible, and medical fusion. VF-Bench provides high-quality, well-aligned video pairs obtained through synthetic data generation and rigorous curation from existing datasets, with a unified evaluation protocol that jointly assesses the spatial quality and temporal consistency of video fusion. Extensive experiments show that UniVF achieves state-of-the-art results across all tasks on VF-Bench. Project page:this https URL.

  Learning general-purpose reasoning capabilities has long been a challenging problem in AI. Recent research in large language models (LLMs), such as DeepSeek-R1, has shown that reinforcement learning techniques like GRPO can enable pre-trained LLMs to develop reasoning capabilities using simple question-answer pairs. In this paper, we aim to train visual language models (VLMs) to perform reasoning on image data through reinforcement learning and visual question-answer pairs, without any explicit chain-of-thought (CoT) supervision. Our findings indicate that simply applying reinforcement learning to a VLM -- by prompting the model to produce a reasoning chain before providing an answer -- can lead the model to develop shortcuts from easy questions, thereby reducing its ability to generalize across unseen data distributions. We argue that the key to mitigating shortcut learning is to encourage the model to interpret images prior to reasoning. Therefore, we train the model to adhere to a caption-reason-answer output format: initially generating a detailed caption for an image, followed by constructing an extensive reasoning chain. When trained on 273K CoT-free visual question-answer pairs and using only reinforcement learning, our model, named Visionary-R1, outperforms strong multimodal models, such as GPT-4o, Claude3.5-Sonnet, and Gemini-1.5-Pro, on multiple visual reasoning benchmarks.

  Colonoscopic Polyp Re-Identification aims to match the same polyp from a large gallery with images from different views taken using different cameras, which plays an important role in the prevention and treatment of colorectal cancer in computer-aided diagnosis. However, traditional methods for object ReID directly adopting CNN models trained on the ImageNet dataset usually produce unsatisfactory retrieval performance on colonoscopic datasets due to the large domain gap. Worsely, these solutions typically learn unimodal modal representations on the basis of visual samples, which fails to explore complementary information from other different modalities. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Deep Multimodal Collaborative Learning framework named DMCL for polyp re-identification, which can effectively encourage multimodal knowledge collaboration and reinforce generalization capability in medical scenarios. On the basis of it, a dynamic multimodal feature fusion strategy is introduced to leverage the optimized visual-text representations for multimodal fusion via end-to-end training. Experiments on the standard benchmarks show the benefits of the multimodal setting over state-of-the-art unimodal ReID models, especially when combined with the collaborative multimodal fusion strategy.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce DanmakuTPPBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to advance multi-modal Temporal Point Process (TPP) modeling in the era of Large Language Models (LLMs). While TPPs have been widely studied for modeling temporal event sequences, existing datasets are predominantly unimodal, hindering progress in models that require joint reasoning over temporal, textual, and visual information. To address this gap, DanmakuTPPBench comprises two complementary components: (1) DanmakuTPP-Events, a novel dataset derived from the Bilibili video platform, where user-generated bullet comments (Danmaku) naturally form multi-modal events annotated with precise timestamps, rich textual content, and corresponding video frames; (2) DanmakuTPP-QA, a challenging question-answering dataset constructed via a novel multi-agent pipeline powered by state-of-the-art LLMs and multi-modal LLMs (MLLMs), targeting complex temporal-textual-visual reasoning. We conduct extensive evaluations using both classical TPP models and recent MLLMs, revealing significant performance gaps and limitations in current methods' ability to model multi-modal event dynamics. Our benchmark establishes strong baselines and calls for further integration of TPP modeling into the multi-modal language modeling landscape. Project page:this https URL

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models demonstrate strong capabilities in single-turn instruction following but suffer from Lost-in-Conversation (LiC), a degradation in performance as information is revealed progressively in multi-turn settings. Motivated by the current progress on Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), we propose Curriculum Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Accuracy and Abstention Rewards (RLAAR), a framework that encourages models not only to generate correct answers, but also to judge the solvability of questions in the multi-turn conversation setting. Our approach employs a competence-gated curriculum that incrementally increases dialogue difficulty (in terms of instruction shards), stabilizing training while promoting reliability. Using multi-turn, on-policy rollouts and a mixed-reward system, RLAAR teaches models to balance problem-solving with informed abstention, reducing premature answering behaviors that cause LiC. Evaluated on LiC benchmarks, RLAAR significantly mitigates LiC performance decay (62.6% to 75.1%) and improves calibrated abstention rates (33.5% to 73.4%). Together, these results provide a practical recipe for building multi-turn reliable and trustworthy LLMs.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Modern language models are evaluated on large benchmarks, which are difficult to make sense of, especially for model selection. Looking at the raw evaluation numbers themselves using a model-centric lens, we propose SimBA, a three phase framework to Simplify Benchmark Analysis. The three phases of SimBA are: stalk, where we conduct dataset & model comparisons, prowl, where we discover a representative subset, and pounce, where we use the representative subset to predict performance on a held-out set of models. Applying SimBA to three popular LM benchmarks: HELM, MMLU, and BigBenchLite reveals that across all three benchmarks, datasets and models relate strongly to one another (stalk). We develop an representative set discovery algorithm which covers a benchmark using raw evaluation scores alone. Using our algorithm, we find that with 6.25% (1/16), 1.7% (1/58), and 28.4% (21/74) of the datasets for HELM, MMLU, and BigBenchLite respectively, we achieve coverage levels of at least 95% (prowl). Additionally, using just these representative subsets, we can both preserve model ranks and predict performance on a held-out set of models with near zero mean-squared error (pounce). Taken together, SimBA can help model developers improve efficiency during model training and dataset creators validate whether their newly created dataset differs from existing datasets in a benchmark.

  We present Ring-1T, the first open-source, state-of-the-art thinking model with a trillion-scale parameter. It features 1 trillion total parameters and activates approximately 50 billion per token. Training such models at a trillion-parameter scale introduces unprecedented challenges, including train-inference misalignment, inefficiencies in rollout processing, and bottlenecks in the RL system. To address these, we pioneer three interconnected innovations: (1) IcePop stabilizes RL training via token-level discrepancy masking and clipping, resolving instability from training-inference mismatches; (2) C3PO++ improves resource utilization for long rollouts under a token budget by dynamically partitioning them, thereby obtaining high time efficiency; and (3) ASystem, a high-performance RL framework designed to overcome the systemic bottlenecks that impede trillion-parameter model training. Ring-1T delivers breakthrough results across critical benchmarks: 93.4 on AIME-2025, 86.72 on HMMT-2025, 2088 on CodeForces, and 55.94 on ARC-AGI-v1. Notably, it attains a silver medal-level result on the IMO-2025, underscoring its exceptional reasoning capabilities. By releasing the complete 1T parameter MoE model to the community, we provide the research community with direct access to cutting-edge reasoning capabilities. This contribution marks a significant milestone in democratizing large-scale reasoning intelligence and establishes a new baseline for open-source model performance.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Faithfully personalizing large language models (LLMs) to align with individual user preferences is a critical but challenging task. While supervised fine-tuning (SFT) quickly reaches a performance plateau, standard reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) also struggles with the nuances of personalization. Scalar-based reward models are prone to reward hacking which leads to verbose and superficially personalized responses. To address these limitations, we propose Critique-Post-Edit, a robust reinforcement learning framework that enables more faithful and controllable personalization. Our framework integrates two key components: (1) a Personalized Generative Reward Model (GRM) that provides multi-dimensional scores and textual critiques to resist reward hacking, and (2) a Critique-Post-Edit mechanism where the policy model revises its own outputs based on these critiques for more targeted and efficient learning. Under a rigorous length-controlled evaluation, our method substantially outperforms standard PPO on personalization benchmarks. Personalized Qwen2.5-7B achieves an average 11\% win-rate improvement, and personalized Qwen2.5-14B model surpasses the performance of GPT-4.1. These results demonstrate a practical path to faithful, efficient, and controllable personalization.

  Small Language Models (SLMs) are becoming increasingly popular in specialized fields, such as industrial applications, due to their efficiency, lower computational requirements, and ability to be fine-tuned for domain-specific tasks, enabling accurate and cost-effective solutions. However, performing complex reasoning using SLMs in specialized fields such as Industry 4.0 remains challenging. In this paper, we propose a knowledge distillation framework for industrial asset health, which transfers reasoning capabilities via Chain-of-Thought (CoT) distillation from Large Language Models (LLMs) to smaller, more efficient models (SLMs). We discuss the advantages and the process of distilling LLMs using multi-choice question answering (MCQA) prompts to enhance reasoning and refine decision-making. We also perform in-context learning to verify the quality of the generated knowledge and benchmark the performance of fine-tuned SLMs with generated knowledge against widely used LLMs. The results show that the fine-tuned SLMs with CoT reasoning outperform the base models by a significant margin, narrowing the gap to their LLM counterparts.

  _Lei Li, Xiao Zhou, Yingying Zhang, Xian Wu_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Medical question answering (QA) requires extensive access to domain-specific knowledge. A promising direction is to enhance large language models (LLMs) with external knowledge retrieved from medical corpora or parametric knowledge stored in model parameters. Existing approaches typically fall into two categories: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which grounds model reasoning on externally retrieved evidence, and Generation-Augmented Generation (GAG), which depends solely on the models internal knowledge to generate contextual documents. However, RAG often suffers from noisy or incomplete retrieval, while GAG is vulnerable to hallucinated or inaccurate information due to unconstrained generation. Both issues can mislead reasoning and undermine answer reliability. To address these challenges, we propose MedRGAG, a unified retrieval-generation augmented framework that seamlessly integrates external and parametric knowledge for medical QA. MedRGAG comprises two key modules: Knowledge-Guided Context Completion (KGCC), which directs the generator to produce background documents that complement the missing knowledge revealed by retrieval; and Knowledge-Aware Document Selection (KADS), which adaptively selects an optimal combination of retrieved and generated documents to form concise yet comprehensive evidence for answer generation. Extensive experiments on five medical QA benchmarks demonstrate that MedRGAG achieves a 12.5% improvement over MedRAG and a 4.5% gain over MedGENIE, highlighting the effectiveness of unifying retrieval and generation for knowledge-intensive reasoning.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) and their multimodal variants can now process visual inputs, including images of text. This raises an intriguing question: can we compress textual inputs by feeding them as images to reduce token usage while preserving performance? In this paper, we show that visual text representations are a practical and surprisingly effective form of input compression for decoder LLMs. We exploit the idea of rendering long text inputs as a single image and provide it directly to the model. This leads to dramatically reduced number of decoder tokens required, offering a new form of input compression. Through experiments on two distinct benchmarks RULER (long-context retrieval) and CNN/DailyMail (document summarization) we demonstrate that this text-as-image method yields substantial token savings (often nearly half) without degrading task performance.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Prompt engineering is crucial for achieving reliable and effective outputs from large language models (LLMs), but its design requires specialized knowledge of prompting techniques and a deep understanding of target tasks. To address this challenge, we propose a novel method that adaptively selects task-appropriate prompting techniques based on users' abstract task descriptions and automatically generates high-quality prompts without relying on pre-existing templates or frameworks. The proposed method constructs a knowledge base that associates task clusters, characterized by semantic similarity across diverse tasks, with their corresponding prompting techniques. When users input task descriptions, the system assigns them to the most relevant task cluster and dynamically generates prompts by integrating techniques drawn from the knowledge base. An experimental evaluation of the proposed method on 23 tasks from BIG-Bench Extra Hard (BBEH) demonstrates superior performance compared with standard prompts and existing automatic prompt-generation tools, as measured by both arithmetic and harmonic mean scores. This research establishes a foundation for streamlining and standardizing prompt creation, enabling non-experts to effectively leverage LLMs.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at capturing latent semantics and contextual relationships across diverse modalities. However, in modeling user behavior from sequential interaction data, performance often suffers when such semantic context is limited or absent. We introduce LaMAR, a LLM-driven semantic enrichment framework designed to enrich such sequences automatically. LaMAR leverages LLMs in a few-shot setting to generate auxiliary contextual signals by inferring latent semantic aspects of a user's intent and item relationships from existing metadata. These generated signals, such as inferred usage scenarios, item intents, or thematic summaries, augment the original sequences with greater contextual depth. We demonstrate the utility of this generated resource by integrating it into benchmark sequential modeling tasks, where it consistently improves performance. Further analysis shows that LLM-generated signals exhibit high semantic novelty and diversity, enhancing the representational capacity of the downstream models. This work represents a new data-centric paradigm where LLMs serve as intelligent context generators, contributing a new method for the semi-automatic creation of training data and language resources.

  Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning and planning capabilities, driving extensive research into task decomposition. Existing task decomposition methods focus primarily on memory, tool usage, and feedback mechanisms, achieving notable success in specific domains, but they often overlook the trade-off between performance and cost. In this study, we first conduct a comprehensive investigation on task decomposition, identifying six categorization schemes. Then, we perform an empirical analysis of three factors that influence the performance and cost of task decomposition: categories of approaches, characteristics of tasks, and configuration of decomposition and execution models, uncovering three critical insights and summarizing a set of practical principles. Building on this analysis, we propose the Select-Then-Decompose strategy, which establishes a closed-loop problem-solving process composed of three stages: selection, execution, and verification. This strategy dynamically selects the most suitable decomposition approach based on task characteristics and enhances the reliability of the results through a verification module. Comprehensive evaluations across multiple benchmarks show that the Select-Then-Decompose consistently lies on the Pareto frontier, demonstrating an optimal balance between performance and cost.

  The hallucination and credibility concerns of large language models (LLMs) are global challenges that the industry is collectively addressing. Recently, a significant amount of advances have been made on post-training and inference techniques to mitigate these challenges. However, it is widely agreed that unsafe and hallucinations of LLMs intrinsically originate from pre-training, involving pre-training data and the next-token prediction learning mechanism. In this paper, we focus on enhancing pre-training data to improve the trustworthiness and safety of LLMs. Since the data is vast, it's almost impossible to entirely purge the data of factual errors, logical inconsistencies, or distributional biases. Moreover, the pre-training data lack grounding in real-world knowledge. Each piece of data is treated as a sequence of tokens rather than as a representation of a part of the world. To overcome these issues, we propose approaches to enhancing our pre-training data with its context in the world and increasing a substantial amount of data reflecting industrial scenarios. We argue that most source data are created by the authors for specific purposes in a certain spatial-temporal context. They have played a role in the real world. By incorporating related world context information, we aim to better anchor pre-training data within real-world scenarios, thereby reducing uncertainty in model training and enhancing the model's safety and trustworthiness. We refer to our Data with World Context as DWC. We continue pre-training an earlier checkpoint of JT-35B-Base with 1.5 trillion of DWC tokens. We introduce our post-training procedures to activate the potentials of DWC. Compared with the Qwen model of a similar scale, JT-Safe-35B achieves an average performance improvement of 1.79% on the Safety and Trustworthy evaluation benchmarks, while being pretrained with only 6.2 trillion tokens.

  _Yizhuo Chen, Xin Liu, Ruijie Wang, Zheng Li, Pei Chen, Changlong Yu, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) achieve strong benchmark performance, yet user experiences remain inconsistent due to diverse preferences in style, tone, and reasoning mode. Nevertheless, existing alignment techniques such as reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) or Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) largely optimize toward population-level averages and overlook individual variation. Naive personalization strategies like per-user fine-tuning are computationally prohibitive, and in-context approaches that prepend raw user signals often suffer from inefficiency and noise. To address these challenges, we propose POPI, a general framework that introduces a preference inference model to distill heterogeneous user signals into concise natural language summaries. These summaries act as transparent, compact, and transferable personalization representations that condition a shared generation model to produce personalized responses. POPI jointly optimizes both preference inference and personalized generation under a unified objective using reinforcement learning, ensuring summaries maximally encode useful preference information. Extensive experiments across four personalization benchmarks demonstrate that POPI consistently improves personalization accuracy while reducing context overhead by a large margin. Moreover, optimized summaries seamlessly transfer to frozen off-the-shelf LLMs, enabling plug-and-play personalization without weight updates.

  Large language models split into two families: reasoning-centric LLMs, which strengthen internal chain-of-thought reasoning but cannot invoke external tools, and agentic LLMs, which learn to interact with environments and leverage tools but often lag in deep reasoning. This divide arises from fundamentally different training objectives, leading to mismatched strengths and inefficiency on simple queries, where both families tend to overthink or over-call tools. In this work, we present Adaptive Agent Foundation Model (A$^2$FM), a unified framework that follows a route-then-align principle: the model first learns task-aware routing and then aligns mode-specific trajectories under a shared backbone. To address the inefficiency gap, we introduce a third mode-instant-that handles simple queries directly, preventing unnecessary reasoning or tool calls while complementing the agentic and reasoning modes. To jointly enhance accuracy and efficiency, we propose Adaptive Policy Optimization (APO), which enforces adaptive sampling across modes and applies a cost-regularized reward. On the 32B scale, A$^2$FM achieves 13.4% on BrowseComp, 70.4% on AIME25, and 16.7% on HLE, setting new SOTA among comparable models and performing competitively with frontier LLMs across agentic, reasoning, and general benchmarks. Notably, the adaptive execution achieves a cost of pass of only $0.00487 per correct answer-cutting cost by 45.2% relative to reasoning and 33.5% relative to agentic, thus delivering substantially higher cost efficiency while maintaining comparable accuracy.

  Although Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit advanced reasoning ability, conventional alignment remains largely dominated by outcome reward models (ORMs) that judge only final answers. Process Reward Models(PRMs) address this gap by evaluating and guiding reasoning at the step or trajectory level. This survey provides a systematic overview of PRMs through the full loop: how to generate process data, build PRMs, and use PRMs for test-time scaling and reinforcement learning. We summarize applications across math, code, text, multimodal reasoning, robotics, and agents, and review emerging benchmarks. Our goal is to clarify design spaces, reveal open challenges, and guide future research toward fine-grained, robust reasoning alignment.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We investigate whether synthetic question-answer (QA) data generated by large language models (LLMs) can serve as an effective proxy for human-labeled benchmarks when the latter is unavailable. We assess the reliability of synthetic benchmarks across two experiments: one varying retriever parameters while keeping the generator fixed, and another varying the generator with fixed retriever parameters. Across four datasets, of which two open-domain and two proprietary, we find that synthetic benchmarks reliably rank the RAGs varying in terms of retriever configuration, aligning well with human-labeled benchmark baselines. However, they do not consistently produce reliable RAG rankings when comparing generator architectures. The breakdown possibly arises from a combination of task mismatch between the synthetic and human benchmarks, and stylistic bias favoring certain generators.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have been extensively adopted in Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC), showcasing significant research advancements. However, as black-box models driven by deep neural architectures, current LLM-based KGC methods rely on implicit knowledge representation with parallel propagation of erroneous knowledge, thereby hindering their ability to produce conclusive and decisive reasoning outcomes. We aim to integrate neural-perceptual structural information with ontological knowledge, leveraging the powerful capabilities of LLMs to achieve a deeper understanding of the intrinsic logic of the knowledge. We propose an ontology enhanced KGC method using LLMs -- OL-KGC. It first leverages neural perceptual mechanisms to effectively embed structural information into the textual space, and then uses an automated extraction algorithm to retrieve ontological knowledge from the knowledge graphs (KGs) that needs to be completed, which is further transformed into a textual format comprehensible to LLMs for providing logic guidance. We conducted extensive experiments on three widely-used benchmarks -- FB15K-237, UMLS and WN18RR. The experimental results demonstrate that OL-KGC significantly outperforms existing mainstream KGC methods across multiple evaluation metrics, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

  We introduce EvaLearn, a pioneering benchmark designed to evaluate large language models (LLMs) on their learning capability and efficiency in challenging tasks, a critical, yet underexplored aspect of model potential. EvaLearn contains 648 challenging problems across six task types, grouped into 182 sequences, each sequence dedicated to one task type. Diverging from most existing benchmarks that evaluate models in parallel, EvaLearn requires models to solve problems sequentially, allowing them to leverage the experience gained from previous solutions. EvaLearn provides five comprehensive automated metrics to evaluate models and quantify their learning capability and efficiency. We extensively benchmark nine frontier models and observe varied performance profiles: some models, such as Claude-3.7-sonnet, start with moderate initial performance but exhibit strong learning ability, while some models struggle to benefit from experience and may even show negative transfer. Moreover, we investigate model performance under two learning settings and find that instance-level rubrics and teacher-model feedback further facilitate model learning. Importantly, we observe that current LLMs with stronger static abilities do not show a clear advantage in learning capability across all tasks, highlighting that EvaLearn evaluates a new dimension of model performance. We hope EvaLearn provides a novel evaluation perspective for assessing LLM potential and understanding the gap between models and human capabilities, promoting the development of deeper and more dynamic evaluation approaches. All datasets, the automatic evaluation framework, and the results studied in this paper are available at the GitHub repository.

  Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning capabilities through test-time scaling approaches, particularly when fine-tuned with chain-of-thought (CoT) data distilled from more powerful large reasoning models (LRMs). However, these reasoning chains often contain verbose elements that mirror human problem-solving, categorized as progressive reasoning (the essential solution development path) and functional elements (verification processes, alternative solution approaches, and error corrections). While progressive reasoning is crucial, the functional elements significantly increase computational demands during test-time inference. We introduce PIR (Perplexity-based Importance Refinement), a principled framework that quantitatively evaluates the importance of each reasoning step based on its impact on answer prediction confidence. PIR systematically identifies and selectively prunes only low-importance functional steps while preserving progressive reasoning components, creating optimized training data that maintains the integrity of the core solution path while reducing verbosity. Models fine-tuned on PIR-optimized data exhibit superior test-time scaling properties, generating more concise reasoning chains while achieving improved accuracy (+0.9\% to +6.6\%) with significantly reduced token usage (-3\% to -41\%) across challenging reasoning benchmarks (AIME, AMC, and GPQA Diamond). Our approach demonstrates strong generalizability across different model sizes, data sources, and token budgets, offering a practical solution for deploying reasoning-capable LLMs in scenarios where efficient test-time scaling, response time, and computational efficiency are valuable constraints.

  Continued pretraining and instruction tuning on large-scale multilingual data have proven to be effective in scaling large language models (LLMs) to low-resource languages. However, the unaligned nature of such data limits its ability to effectively capture cross-lingual semantics. In contrast, multi-way parallel data, where identical content is aligned across multiple languages, provides stronger cross-lingual consistency and offers greater potential for improving multilingual performance. In this paper, we introduce a large-scale, high-quality multi-way parallel corpus, TED2025, based on TED Talks. The corpus spans 113 languages, with up to 50 languages aligned in parallel, ensuring extensive multilingual coverage. Using this dataset, we investigate best practices for leveraging multi-way parallel data to enhance LLMs, including strategies for continued pretraining, instruction tuning, and the analysis of key influencing factors. Experiments on six multilingual benchmarks show that models trained on multiway parallel data consistently outperform those trained on unaligned multilingual data.

  With the growing requirement for natural human-computer interaction, speech-based systems receive increasing attention as speech is one of the most common forms of daily communication. However, the existing speech models still experience high latency when generating the first audio token during streaming, which poses a significant bottleneck for deployment. To address this issue, we propose VITA-Audio, an end-to-end large speech model with fast audio-text token generation. Specifically, we introduce a lightweight Multiple Cross-modal Token Prediction (MCTP) module that efficiently generates multiple audio tokens within a single model forward pass, which not only accelerates the inference but also significantly reduces the latency for generating the first audio in streaming scenarios. In addition, a four-stage progressive training strategy is explored to achieve model acceleration with minimal loss of speech quality. To our knowledge, VITA-Audio is the first multi-modal large language model capable of generating audio output during the first forward pass, enabling real-time conversational capabilities with minimal latency. VITA-Audio is fully reproducible and is trained on open-source data only. Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves an inference speedup of 3~5x at the 7B parameter scale, but also significantly outperforms open-source models of similar model size on multiple benchmarks for automatic speech recognition (ASR), text-to-speech (TTS), and spoken question answering (SQA) tasks.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) suffer from temporal misalignment issues especially across long span of time. The issue arises from knowing that LLMs are trained on large amounts of data where temporal information is rather sparse over long times, such as thousands of years, resulting in insufficient learning or catastrophic forgetting by the LLMs. This paper proposes a methodology named "Ticktack" for addressing the LLM's long-time span misalignment in a yearly setting. Specifically, we first propose to utilize the sexagenary year expression instead of the Gregorian year expression employed by LLMs, achieving a more uniform distribution in yearly granularity. Then, we employ polar coordinates to model the sexagenary cycle of 60 terms and the year order within each term, with additional temporal encoding to ensure LLMs understand them. Finally, we present a temporal representational alignment approach for post-training LLMs that effectively distinguishes time points with relevant knowledge, hence improving performance on time-related tasks, particularly over a long period. We also create a long time span benchmark for evaluation. Experimental results prove the effectiveness of our proposal.

  The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has brought a pressing challenge: how to reliably assess hallucinations to guarantee model trustworthiness. Although Automatic Hallucination Evaluation (AHE) has become an indispensable component of this effort, the field remains fragmented in its methodologies, limiting both conceptual clarity and practical progress. This survey addresses this critical gap through a systematic analysis of 105 evaluation methods, revealing that 77.1% specifically target LLMs, a paradigm shift that demands new evaluation frameworks. We formulate a structured framework to organize the field, based on a survey of foundational datasets and benchmarks and a taxonomy of evaluation methodologies, which together systematically document the evolution from pre-LLM to post-LLM approaches. Beyond taxonomical organization, we identify fundamental limitations in current approaches and their implications for real-world deployment. To guide future research, we delineate key challenges and propose strategic directions, including enhanced interpretability mechanisms and integration of application-specific evaluation criteria, ultimately providing a roadmap for developing more robust and practical hallucination evaluation systems.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Spatial functional organization is a hallmark of biological brains: neurons are arranged topographically according to their response properties, at multiple scales. In contrast, representations within most machine learning models lack spatial biases, instead manifesting as disorganized vector spaces that are difficult to visualize and interpret. Here, we propose a novel form of self-attention that turns Transformers into "Topoformers" with topographic organization. We introduce spatial querying - where keys and queries are arranged on 2D grids, and local pools of queries are associated with a given key - and spatial reweighting, where we convert the standard fully connected layer of self-attention into a locally connected layer. We first demonstrate the feasibility of our approach by training a 1-layer Topoformer on a sentiment classification task. Training with spatial querying encourages topographic organization in the queries and keys, and spatial reweighting separately encourages topographic organization in the values and self-attention outputs. We then apply the Topoformer motifs at scale, training a BERT architecture with a masked language modeling objective. We find that the topographic variant performs on par with a non-topographic control model on NLP benchmarks, yet produces interpretable topographic organization as evaluated via eight linguistic test suites. Finally, analyzing an fMRI dataset of human brain responses to a large set of naturalistic sentences, we demonstrate alignment between low-dimensional topographic variability in the Topoformer model and human brain language network. Scaling up Topoformers further holds promise for greater interpretability in NLP research, and for more accurate models of the organization of linguistic information in the human brain.

  Digital dehumanization, although a critical issue, remains largely overlooked within the field of computational linguistics and Natural Language Processing. The prevailing approach in current research concentrating primarily on a single aspect of dehumanization that identifies overtly negative statements as its core marker. This focus, while crucial for understanding harmful online communications, inadequately addresses the broader spectrum of dehumanization. Specifically, it overlooks the subtler forms of dehumanization that, despite not being overtly offensive, still perpetuate harmful biases against marginalized groups in online interactions. These subtler forms can insidiously reinforce negative stereotypes and biases without explicit offensiveness, making them harder to detect yet equally damaging. Recognizing this gap, we use different sampling methods to collect a theory-informed bilingual dataset from Twitter and Reddit. Using crowdworkers and experts to annotate 16,000 instances on a document- and span-level, we show that our dataset covers the different dimensions of dehumanization. This dataset serves as both a training resource for machine learning models and a benchmark for evaluating future dehumanization detection techniques. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we fine-tune ML models on this dataset, achieving performance that surpasses state-of-the-art models in zero and few-shot in-context settings.

  Large language models offer transformative potential for healthcare, yet their responsible and equitable development depends critically on a deeper understanding of how training data characteristics influence model behavior, including the potential for bias. Current practices in dataset curation and bias assessment often lack the necessary transparency, creating an urgent need for comprehensive evaluation frameworks to foster trust and guide improvements. In this study, we present an in-depth analysis of potential downstream biases in clinical language models, with a focus on differential opioid prescription tendencies across diverse demographic groups, such as ethnicity, gender, and age. As part of this investigation, we introduce HC4: Healthcare Comprehensive Commons Corpus, a novel and extensively curated pretraining dataset exceeding 89 billion tokens. Our evaluation leverages both established general benchmarks and a novel, healthcare-specific methodology, offering crucial insights to support fairness and safety in clinical AI applications.

  Diffusion language models (DLMs) have emerged as a promising alternative to the long-dominant autoregressive (AR) paradigm, offering a parallelable decoding process that could yield greater efficiency. Yet, in practice, current open-source DLMs often underperform their AR counterparts in speed, limiting their real-world utility. This work presents a systematic study of DLM efficiency, identifying key issues in prior evaluation methods. Through empirical benchmarking and a roofline-based theoretical analysis, we demonstrate that AR models generally achieve higher throughput, while DLMs consistently lag. We also investigate acceleration strategies, finding that techniques like dual cache and parallel decoding mainly offer gains at small batch sizes, with their benefits diminishing upon scaling. Our findings underscore the necessity of robust evaluation methods and improved acceleration strategies to advance research on DLMs.

  Online medical forums have long served as vital platforms where patients seek professional healthcare advice, generating vast amounts of valuable knowledge. However, the informal nature and linguistic complexity of forum interactions pose significant challenges for automated question answering systems, especially when dealing with non-English languages. We present two comprehensive Italian medical benchmarks: \textbf{IMB-QA}, containing 782,644 patient-doctor conversations from 77 medical categories, and \textbf{IMB-MCQA}, comprising 25,862 multiple-choice questions from medical specialty examinations. We demonstrate how Large Language Models (LLMs) can be leveraged to improve the clarity and consistency of medical forum data while retaining their original meaning and conversational style, and compare a variety of LLM architectures on both open and multiple-choice question answering tasks. Our experiments with Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and domain-specific fine-tuning reveal that specialized adaptation strategies can outperform larger, general-purpose models in medical question answering tasks. These findings suggest that effective medical AI systems may benefit more from domain expertise and efficient information retrieval than from increased model scale. We release both datasets and evaluation frameworks in our GitHub repository to support further research on multilingual medical question answering:this https URL.

  Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems are increasingly vital in dynamic domains like online gaming, yet the lack of a dedicated benchmark has impeded standardized evaluation in this area. The core difficulty lies in Dual Dynamics: the constant interplay between game content updates and the shifting focus of the player community. Furthermore, the necessity of automating such a benchmark introduces a critical requirement for player-centric authenticity to ensure generated questions are realistic. To address this integrated challenge, we introduce ChronoPlay, a novel framework for the automated and continuous generation of game RAG benchmarks. ChronoPlay utilizes a dual-dynamic update mechanism to track both forms of change, and a dual-source synthesis engine that draws from official sources and player community to ensure both factual correctness and authentic query patterns. We instantiate our framework on three distinct games to create the first dynamic RAG benchmark for the gaming domain, offering new insights into model performance under these complex and realistic conditions.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Hallucination, where models generate fluent text unsupported by visual evidence, remains a major flaw in vision-language models and is particularly critical in sign language translation (SLT). In SLT, meaning depends on precise grounding in video, and gloss-free models are especially vulnerable because they map continuous signer movements directly into natural language without intermediate gloss supervision that serves as alignment. We argue that hallucinations arise when models rely on language priors rather than visual input. To capture this, we propose a token-level reliability measure that quantifies how much the decoder uses visual information. Our method combines feature-based sensitivity, which measures internal changes when video is masked, with counterfactual signals, which capture probability differences between clean and altered video inputs. These signals are aggregated into a sentence-level reliability score, providing a compact and interpretable measure of visual grounding. We evaluate the proposed measure on two SLT benchmarks (PHOENIX-2014T and CSL-Daily) with both gloss-based and gloss-free models. Our results show that reliability predicts hallucination rates, generalizes across datasets and architectures, and decreases under visual degradations. Beyond these quantitative trends, we also find that reliability distinguishes grounded tokens from guessed ones, allowing risk estimation without references; when combined with text-based signals (confidence, perplexity, or entropy), it further improves hallucination risk estimation. Qualitative analysis highlights why gloss-free models are more susceptible to hallucinations. Taken together, our findings establish reliability as a practical and reusable tool for diagnosing hallucinations in SLT, and lay the groundwork for more robust hallucination detection in multimodal generation.

  We present $\textbf{Korean SimpleQA (KoSimpleQA)}$, a benchmark for evaluating factuality in large language models (LLMs) with a focus on Korean cultural knowledge. KoSimpleQA is designed to be challenging yet easy to grade, consisting of 1,000 short, fact-seeking questions with unambiguous answers. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation across a diverse set of open-source LLMs of varying sizes that support Korean, and find that even the strongest model generates correct answer only 33.7% of the time, underscoring the challenging nature of KoSimpleQA. Notably, performance rankings on KoSimpleQA differ substantially from those on the English SimpleQA, highlighting the unique value of our dataset. Furthermore, our analysis of reasoning LLMs shows that engaging reasoning capabilities in the factual QA task can both help models better elicit their latent knowledge and improve their ability to abstain when uncertain.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Distantly Supervised Relation Extraction (DSRE) remains a long-standing challenge in NLP, where models must learn from noisy bag-level annotations while making sentence-level predictions. While existing state-of-the-art (SoTA) DSRE models rely on task-specific training, their integration with in-context learning (ICL) using large language models (LLMs) remains underexplored. A key challenge is that the LLM may not learn relation semantics correctly, due to noisy annotation.In response, we propose HYDRE -- HYbrid Distantly Supervised Relation Extraction framework. It first uses a trained DSRE model to identify the top-k candidate relations for a given test sentence, then uses a novel dynamic exemplar retrieval strategy that extracts reliable, sentence-level exemplars from training data, which are then provided in LLM prompt for outputting the final relation(s).We further extend HYDRE to cross-lingual settings for RE in low-resource languages. Using available English DSRE training data, we evaluate all methods on English as well as a newly curated benchmark covering four diverse low-resource Indic languages -- Oriya, Santali, Manipuri, and Tulu. HYDRE achieves up to 20 F1 point gains in English and, on average, 17 F1 points on Indic languages over prior SoTA DSRE models. Detailed ablations exhibit HYDRE's efficacy compared to other prompting strategies.

  LLM Driven text-to-table (T2T) systems often rely on extensive prompt-engineering or iterative event extraction in code-parsable formats, which boosts scores but are computationally expensive and obscure how models actually reason over temporal evolving narratives to summarise key information. We present CMT-Bench, a diagnostic benchmark built from live cricket commentary that requires dynamic table generation across two evolving schemas under a dense, rule-governed policy. CMT-Bench is designed to probe robustness via three semantics-preserving dimensions: (i) extractive-cue ablation to separate extractive shortcuts from state tracking, (ii) temporal prefixing to test long-context stability, and (iii) entity-form perturbations (anonymization, outof-distribution substitutions, role-entangling paraphrases) to assess sensitivity to surface variation. Across diverse long-context stateof-the-art LLMs, we find large drops without extractive summaries, monotonic degradation with input length, and consistent accuracy drop under entity-form changes. Complementary distributional tests confirm significant shifts in numeric error patterns, indicating drift in reasoning rather than mere noise. Our results show that current LLMs are brittle in dynamic Textto-table generation, motivating robustness-first evaluation as a prerequisite for developing efficient and scalable approaches for this task.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models exhibit a puzzling inconsistency: they solve complex problems yet frequently fail on seemingly simpler ones. We investigate whether LLMs internally encode problem difficulty in a way that aligns with human judgment, and whether this representation tracks generalization during reinforcement learning post-training. We train linear probes across layers and token positions on 60 models, evaluating on mathematical and coding subsets of Easy2HardBench. We find that human-labeled difficulty is strongly linearly decodable (AMC: $\rho \approx 0.88$) and exhibits clear model-size scaling, whereas LLM-derived difficulty is substantially weaker and scales poorly. Steering along the difficulty direction reveals that pushing models toward "easier" representations reduces hallucination and improves accuracy. During GRPO training on Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B, the human-difficulty probe strengthens and positively correlates with test accuracy across training steps, while the LLM-difficulty probe degrades and negatively correlates with performance. These results suggest that human annotations provide a stable difficulty signal that RL amplifies, while automated difficulty estimates derived from model performance become misaligned precisely as models improve. We release probe code and evaluation scripts to facilitate replication.

  This paper assesses the capacity of large language models (LLMs) to translate texts that include inter-sentential dependencies. We use the English-French DiscEvalMT benchmark (Bawden et al., 2018) with pairs of sentences containing translation challenges either for pronominal anaphora or for lexical cohesion. We evaluate 12 LLMs from the DeepSeek-R1, GPT, Llama, Mistral and Phi families on two tasks: (1) distinguishing a correct translation from a wrong but plausible one; (2) generating a correct translation. We compare prompts that encourage chain-of-thought reasoning with those that do not. The best models take advantage of reasoning and reach about 90% accuracy on the first task, and COMET scores of about 92% on the second task, with GPT-4, GPT-4o and Phi standing out. Moreover, we observe a "wise get wiser" effect: the improvements through reasoning are positively correlated with the scores of the models without reasoning.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly rely on Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning to improve accuracy on complex tasks. However, always generating lengthy reasoning traces is inefficient, leading to excessive token usage and higher inference costs. This paper introduces the Hybrid Policy Optimization (i.e., HiPO), a framework for adaptive reasoning control that enables LLMs to selectively decide when to engage in detailed reasoning (Think-on) and when to respond directly (Think-off). Specifically, HiPO combines a hybrid data pipelineproviding paired Think-on and Think-off responseswith a hybrid reinforcement learning reward system that balances accuracy and efficiency while avoiding over-reliance on detailed reasoning. Experiments across mathematics and coding benchmarks demonstrate that HiPO can substantially reduce token length while maintaining or improving accuracy. Finally, we hope HiPO a can be a principled approach for efficient adaptive reasoning, advancing the deployment of reasoning-oriented LLMs in real-world, resource-sensitive settings.

  In this paper, we introduce Spotlight, a novel paradigm for information extraction that produces concise, engaging narratives by highlighting the most compelling aspects of a document. Unlike traditional summaries, which prioritize comprehensive coverage, spotlights selectively emphasize intriguing content to foster deeper reader engagement with the source material. We formally differentiate spotlights from related constructs and support our analysis with a detailed benchmarking study using new datasets curated for this work. To generate high-quality spotlights, we propose a two-stage approach: fine-tuning a large language model on our benchmark data, followed by alignment via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Our comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that the resulting model not only identifies key elements with precision but also enhances readability and boosts the engagement value of the original document.

  Complex games have long been an important benchmark for testing the progress of artificial intelligence algorithms. AlphaGo, AlphaZero, and MuZero have defeated top human players in Go and Chess, garnering widespread societal attention towards artificial intelligence. Concurrently, large language models (LLMs) have exhibited remarkable capabilities across various tasks, raising the question of whether LLMs can achieve similar success in complex games. In this paper, we explore the potential of LLMs in mastering complex card games. We systematically assess the learning capabilities of LLMs across eight diverse card games, evaluating the impact of fine-tuning on high-quality gameplay data, and examining the models' ability to retain general capabilities while mastering these games. Our findings indicate that: (1) LLMs can approach the performance of strong game AIs through supervised fine-tuning on high-quality data, (2) LLMs can achieve a certain level of proficiency in multiple complex card games simultaneously, with performance augmentation for games with similar rules and conflicts for dissimilar ones, and (3) LLMs experience a decline in general capabilities when mastering complex games, but this decline can be mitigated by integrating a certain amount of general instruction data. The evaluation results demonstrate strong learning ability and versatility of LLMs. The code is available atthis https URL

  The rapid development of multilingual large language models (LLMs) highlights the need for high-quality, diverse, and well-curated multilingual datasets. In this paper, we introduce DCAD-2000 (Data Cleaning as Anomaly Detection), a large-scale multilingual corpus constructed from newly extracted Common Crawl data and existing multilingual sources. DCAD-2000 covers 2,282 languages, 46.72TB of text, and 8.63 billion documents, spanning 155 high- and medium-resource languages and 159 writing scripts. To overcome the limitations of existing data cleaning approaches, which rely on manually designed heuristic thresholds, we reframe data cleaning as an anomaly detection problem. This dynamic filtering paradigm substantially improves data quality by automatically identifying and removing noisy or anomalous content. By fine-tuning LLMs on DCAD-2000, we demonstrate notable improvements in data quality, robustness of the cleaning pipeline, and downstream performance, particularly for low-resource languages across multiple multilingual benchmarks.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Offline reinforcement learning (RL) aims to learn a policy from a static dataset without further interactions with the environment. Collecting sufficiently large datasets for offline RL is exhausting since this data collection requires colossus interactions with environments and becomes tricky when the interaction with the environment is restricted. Hence, how an agent learns the best policy with a minimal static dataset is a crucial issue in offline RL, similar to the sample efficiency problem in online RL. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective plug-and-play pretraining method to initialize a feature of a Q-network to enhance data efficiency in offline RL. Specifically, we introduce a shared Q-network structure that outputs predictions of the next state and Q-value. We pretrain the shared Q-network through a supervised regression task that predicts a next state and trains the shared Q-network using diverse offline RL methods. Through extensive experiments, we empirically demonstrate that our method enhances the performance of existing popular offline RL methods on the D4RL, Robomimic and V-D4RL benchmarks. Furthermore, we show that our method significantly boosts data-efficient offline RL across various data qualities and data distributions trough D4RL and ExoRL benchmarks. Notably, our method adapted with only 10% of the dataset outperforms standard algorithms even with full datasets.

  Coordinating multiple embodied agents in dynamic environments remains a core challenge in artificial intelligence, requiring both perception-driven reasoning and scalable cooperation strategies. While recent works have leveraged large language models (LLMs) for multi-agent planning, a few have begun to explore vision-language models (VLMs) for visual reasoning. However, these VLM-based approaches remain limited in their support for diverse embodiment types. In this work, we introduce VIKI-Bench, the first hierarchical benchmark tailored for embodied multi-agent cooperation, featuring three structured levels: agent activation, task planning, and trajectory perception. VIKI-Bench includes diverse robot embodiments, multi-view visual observations, and structured supervision signals to evaluate reasoning grounded in visual inputs. To demonstrate the utility of VIKI-Bench, we propose VIKI-R, a two-stage framework that fine-tunes a pretrained vision-language model (VLM) using Chain-of-Thought annotated demonstrations, followed by reinforcement learning under multi-level reward signals. Our extensive experiments show that VIKI-R significantly outperforms baselines method across all task levels. Furthermore, we show that reinforcement learning enables the emergence of compositional cooperation patterns among heterogeneous agents. Together, VIKI-Bench and VIKI-R offer a unified testbed and method for advancing multi-agent, visual-driven cooperation in embodied AI systems.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have redefined complex task automation with exceptional generalization capabilities. Despite these advancements, state-of-the-art methods rely on single-strategy prompting, missing the synergy of diverse reasoning approaches. No single strategy excels universally, highlighting the need for frameworks that fuse strategies to maximize performance and ensure robustness. We introduce the Select, Mix, and ReinvenT (SMaRT) framework, an innovative strategy fusion approach designed to overcome this constraint by creating balanced and efficient solutions through the seamless integration of diverse reasoning strategies. Unlike existing methods, which employ LLMs merely as evaluators, SMaRT uses them as intelligent integrators, unlocking the "best of all worlds" across tasks. Extensive empirical evaluations across benchmarks in reasoning, planning, and sequential decision-making highlight the robustness and adaptability of SMaRT. The framework consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in solution quality, constraint adherence, and performance metrics. This work redefines LLM-driven decision-making by pioneering a new paradigm in cross-strategy calibration, unlocking superior outcomes for reasoning systems and advancing the boundaries of self-refining methodologies.

  Recent trends in test-time scaling for reasoning models (e.g., OpenAI o1, DeepSeek-R1) have led to remarkable improvements through long Chain-of-Thought (CoT). However, existing benchmarks mainly focus on immediate, single-horizon tasks, failing to adequately evaluate models' ability to understand and respond to complex, long-horizon scenarios. To address this incomplete evaluation of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), we propose R-HORIZON, a method designed to stimulate long-horizon reasoning behaviors in LRMs through query composition. Based on R-HORIZON, we construct a long-horizon reasoning benchmark, comprising complex multi-step reasoning tasks with interdependent problems that span long reasoning horizons. Through comprehensive evaluation of LRMs using the R-HORIZON benchmark, we find that even the most advanced LRMs suffer significant performance degradation. Our analysis reveals that LRMs exhibit limited effective reasoning length and struggle to allocate thinking budget across multiple problems appropriately. Recognizing these limitations, we use R-HORIZON to construct long-horizon reasoning data for reinforcement learning with verified rewards (RLVR). Compared to training with single-horizon data, RLVR with R-HORIZON not only substantially improves performance on the multi-horizon reasoning tasks, but also promotes accuracy on standard reasoning tasks, with an increase of 7.5 on AIME2024. These results position R-HORIZON as a scalable, controllable, and low-cost paradigm for enhancing and evaluating the long-horizon reasoning capabilities of LRMs.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce transductive program synthesis, a new formulation of the program synthesis task that explicitly leverages test inputs during synthesis. While prior approaches to program synthesis--whether based on natural language descriptions or input-output examples--typically aim to generalize from training examples, they often struggle with robustness, especially in real-world settings where training examples are limited and test inputs involve various edge cases. To address this, we propose a novel framework that improves robustness by treating synthesis as an active learning over a finite hypothesis class defined by programs' outputs. We use an LLM to predict outputs for selected test inputs and eliminate inconsistent hypotheses, where the inputs are chosen via a greedy maximin algorithm to minimize the number of LLM queries required. We evaluate our approach on four benchmarks: Playgol, MBPP+, 1D-ARC, and programmatic world modeling on MiniGrid. We demonstrate that our method significantly improves program synthesis in both accuracy and efficiency. We release our code atthis https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  While activation steering in large language models (LLMs) is a growing area of research, methods can often incur broader effects than desired. This motivates isolation of purer concept vectors to enable targeted interventions and understand LLM behavior at a more granular level. We present RepIt, a simple and data-efficient framework for isolating concept-specific representations. Across five frontier LLMs, RepIt enables precise interventions: it selectively suppresses refusal on targeted concepts while preserving refusal elsewhere, producing models that answer WMD-related questions while still scoring as safe on standard benchmarks. We further show that the corrective signal localizes to just 100-200 neurons and that robust target representations can be extracted from as few as a dozen examples on a single A6000. This efficiency raises a dual concern: manipulations can be performed with modest compute and data to extend to underrepresented data-scarce topics while evading existing benchmarks. By disentangling refusal vectors with RepIt, this work demonstrates that targeted interventions can counteract overgeneralization, laying the foundation for more granular control of model behavior.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  User queries in information retrieval are often ambiguous, making it challenging for systems to identify a user's target from a single query. While recent dialogue-based interactive retrieval systems can clarify user intent, they are inefficient as they often lack an explicit strategy to ask the most informative questions. To address this limitation, we propose SherlockLLM, a dialogue-driven retrieval framework that learns an optimal questioning strategy via Reinforcement Learning (RL) and avoids the need for large-scale annotated dialogue data. In our framework, an agent is trained to generate a sequence of binary questions to efficiently narrow down the search space. To validate our approach, we introduce a benchmark with both structured and unstructured tasks. Experimental results show that SherlockLLM is a robust and efficient solution. On the structured tasks, its performance matches strong baselines and approaches the theoretical optimal defined by binary search. On the challenging unstructured task, our agent significantly outperforms these baselines, showcasing its ability to learn a highly effective information-seeking dialogue policy.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), despite their advances, are hindered by their high hallucination tendency and heavy reliance on brittle, linear reasoning processes, leading to failures in complex tasks. To address these limitations, we introduce Visual Attention Reasoning (VAR), a novel framework that recasts grounded reasoning as a structured search over a reasoning trajectory space. VAR decomposes the reasoning process into two key stages: traceable evidence grounding and search-based chain-of-thought (CoT) generation, which incorporates a backtracking mechanism for self-correction. The search is guided by a multi-faceted reward function with semantic and geometric self-verification components, which penalize outputs that are not faithfully grounded in the visual input. We provide a theoretical analysis for our search strategy, validating its capability to find the correct solution with high probability. Experimental results show that our 7B model, VAR-7B, sets a new state-of-the-art on a comprehensive suite of hallucination and safety benchmarks, significantly outperforming existing open-source models and demonstrating competitive performance against leading proprietary systems.

  Human players do more than press buttons: they ground what they see on screen into precise keyboard-mouse actions and, when stuck, they seek information before trying again. We ask whether current vision-language models (VLMs) can do the same. Despite encouraging results under simplified control or tool scaffolds, human-like play in a real client - mapping raw screenshots to temporally coherent low-level actions while deciding when to ask for guidance - remains an open challenge. We introduce StarBench, a turn-based RPG benchmark derived from Honkai: Star Rail that targets these two human-like competencies: multimodal decision-making from pixels to actions and agentic information seeking. StarBench standardizes evaluation across eight combat tasks and two regimes with shared tasks and metrics: (i) direct control, where agents receive only screenshots and must emit low-level primitives (click and keypress) with no semantic hints; and (ii) tool-assisted control, where higher-level intents can be mapped to primitives by detectors and OCR outputs provide optional textualized observations to ease UI grounding. To mirror human practice, StarBench also includes an ask-or-act diagnostic that measures whether and when agents choose to request brief guidance before proceeding, and how that choice affects subsequent performance. We report reference baselines for contemporary VLMs and a human reference. Results expose sizable gaps in perception-to-control fidelity in the direct regime, while showing that judicious information seeking correlates with improved success, establishing StarBench as a reproducible yardstick for agentic information seeking and multimodal decision-making in real-client play.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Optimization modeling enables critical decisions across industries but remains difficult to automate: informal language must be mapped to precise mathematical formulations and executable solver code. Prior LLM approaches either rely on brittle prompting or costly retraining with limited generalization. We present AlphaOPT, a self-improving experience library that enables an LLM to learn from limited demonstrations (even answers alone, without gold-standard programs) and solver feedback - without annotated reasoning traces or parameter updates. AlphaOPT operates in a continual two-phase cycle: (i) a Library Learning phase that reflects on failed attempts, extracting solver-verified, structured insights as {taxonomy, condition, explanation, example}; and (ii) a Library Evolution phase that diagnoses retrieval misalignments and refines the applicability conditions of stored insights, improving transfer across tasks. This design (1) learns efficiently from limited demonstrations without curated rationales, (2) expands continually without costly retraining by updating the library rather than model weights, and (3) makes knowledge explicit and interpretable for human inspection and intervention. Experiments show that AlphaOPT steadily improves with more data (65% to 72% from 100 to 300 training items) and surpasses the strongest baseline by 7.7% on the out-of-distribution OptiBench dataset when trained only on answers.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  With climate change intensifying, urban waterlogging poses an increasingly severe threat to global public safety and infrastructure. However, existing monitoring approaches rely heavily on manual reporting and fail to provide timely and comprehensive assessments. In this study, we present Urban Waterlogging Assessment (UWAssess), a foundation model-driven framework that automatically identifies waterlogged areas in surveillance images and generates structured assessment reports. To address the scarcity of labeled data, we design a semi-supervised fine-tuning strategy and a chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting strategy to unleash the potential of the foundation model for data-scarce downstream tasks. Evaluations on challenging visual benchmarks demonstrate substantial improvements in perception performance. GPT-based evaluations confirm the ability of UWAssess to generate reliable textual reports that accurately describe waterlogging extent, depth, risk and impact. This dual capability enables a shift of waterlogging monitoring from perception to generation, while the collaborative framework of multiple foundation models lays the groundwork for intelligent and scalable systems, supporting urban management, disaster response and climate resilience.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Visual Language Models (VLMs) achieve promising results in medical reasoning but struggle with hallucinations, vague descriptions, inconsistent logic and poor localization. To address this, we propose a agent framework named Medical Visual Reasoning Agent (\textbf{Med-VRAgent}). The approach is based on Visual Guidance and Self-Reward paradigms and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). By combining the Visual Guidance with tree search, Med-VRAgent improves the medical visual reasoning capabilities of VLMs. We use the trajectories collected by Med-VRAgent as feedback to further improve the performance by fine-tuning the VLMs with the proximal policy optimization (PPO) objective. Experiments on multiple medical VQA benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multi-class unsupervised anomaly detection (MUAD) has garnered growing research interest, as it seeks to develop a unified model for anomaly detection across multiple classes, i.e., eliminating the need to train separate models for distinct objects and thereby saving substantial computational resources. Under the MUAD setting, while advanced Transformer-based architectures have brought significant performance improvements, identity shortcuts persist: they directly copy inputs to outputs, narrowing the gap in reconstruction errors between normal and abnormal cases, and thereby making the two harder to distinguish. Therefore, we propose ShortcutBreaker, a novel unified feature-reconstruction framework for MUAD tasks, featuring two key innovations to address the issue of shortcuts. First, drawing on matrix rank inequality, we design a low-rank noisy bottleneck (LRNB) to project highdimensional features into a low-rank latent space, and theoretically demonstrate its capacity to prevent trivial identity reproduction. Second, leveraging ViTs global modeling capability instead of merely focusing on local features, we incorporate a global perturbation attention to prevent information shortcuts in the decoders. Extensive experiments are performed on four widely used anomaly detection benchmarks, including three industrial datasets (MVTec-AD, ViSA, and Real-IAD) and one medical dataset (Universal Medical). The proposed method achieves a remarkable image-level AUROC of 99.8%, 98.9%, 90.6%, and 87.8% on these four datasets, respectively, consistently outperforming previous MUAD methods across different scenarios.

  Geospatial data offers immense potential for understanding our planet. However, the sheer volume and diversity of this data along with its varied resolutions, timescales, and sparsity pose significant challenges for thorough analysis and interpretation. This paper introduces Earth AI, a family of geospatial AI models and agentic reasoning that enables significant advances in our ability to unlock novel and profound insights into our planet. This approach is built upon foundation models across three key domains--Planet-scale Imagery, Population, and Environment--and an intelligent Gemini-powered reasoning engine. We present rigorous benchmarks showcasing the power and novel capabilities of our foundation models and validate that when used together, they provide complementary value for geospatial inference and their synergies unlock superior predictive capabilities. To handle complex, multi-step queries, we developed a Gemini-powered agent that jointly reasons over our multiple foundation models along with large geospatial data sources and tools. On a new benchmark of real-world crisis scenarios, our agent demonstrates the ability to deliver critical and timely insights, effectively bridging the gap between raw geospatial data and actionable understanding.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  What does it truly mean for a language model to "reason"? Most current evaluations and benchmarks reward models' correct standalone answers--but correctness alone reveals little about the process that produced them. In this work, we explore a different perspective: reasoning is not a static chain of steps, but a dynamic trajectory where ideas interact, clash, and evolve into deeper insights. To capture this dynamic, we draw on a well-established philosophical tradition: \textit{dialectics}, where reasoning unfolds through thesis, antithesis, and synthesis. Building on this, we present SIEV, a structured framework that evaluates reasoning of LLMs through dialectics. Unlike conventional evaluations, SIEV assesses not only the conclusion a model reaches, but how it gets there: its ability to resolve tension, integrate distinct ideas, and synthesize higher-order reasoning. This lens uncovers significant reasoning gaps in state-of-the-art models even under saturated benchmarks like GSM and MMLU. For instance, GPT-5-chat, a recent model, loses over 40 points (out of 100) when evaluated with SIEV on GSM. Our findings highlight that adopting a process-oriented, philosophically grounded approach enables a deeper, more rigorous, and more discriminative assessment of LLM reasoning.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) deliver powerful reasoning and generation capabilities but incur substantial run-time costs when operating in agentic workflows that chain together lengthy prompts and process rich data streams. We introduce CompactPrompt, an end-to-end pipeline that merges hard prompt compression with lightweight file-level data compression. CompactPrompt first prunes low-information tokens from prompts using self-information scoring and dependency-based phrase grouping. In parallel, it applies n-gram abbreviation to recurrent textual patterns in attached documents and uniform quantization to numerical columns, yielding compact yet semantically faithful representations. Integrated into standard LLM agents, CompactPrompt reduces total token usage and inference cost by up to 60% on benchmark dataset like TAT-QA and FinQA, while preserving output quality (Results in less than 5% accuracy drop for Claude-3.5-Sonnet, and GPT-4.1-Mini) CompactPrompt helps visualize real-time compression decisions and quantify cost-performance trade-offs, laying the groundwork for leaner generative AI pipelines.

  Tool-augmented large language models (LLMs) are emerging as deep research agents, systems that decompose complex queries, retrieve external evidence, and synthesize grounded responses. Yet current agents remain limited by shallow retrieval, weak alignment metrics, and brittle tool-use behavior. We introduce PokeeResearch-7B, a 7B-parameter deep research agent built under a unified reinforcement learning framework for robustness, alignment, and scalability. PokeeResearch-7B is trained by an annotation-free Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF) framework to optimize policies using LLM-based reward signals that capture factual accuracy, citation faithfulness, and instruction adherence. A chain-of-thought-driven multi-call reasoning scaffold further enhances robustness through self-verification and adaptive recovery from tool failures. Among 10 popular deep research benchmarks, PokeeResearch-7B achieves state-of-the-art performance among 7B-scale deep research agents. This highlights that careful reinforcement learning and reasoning design can produce efficient, resilient, and research-grade AI agents.

  Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has advanced the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, prevailing RLVR methods exhibit a systematic bias toward exploitation over exploration, as evidenced by improved pass@1 but reduced pass@K (K>1) performance. To understand this issue, we analyze training dynamics of RLVR methods by tracking the token-level probability distributions over vocabulary candidates. Our analysis reveals a consistent probability concentration effect where the top-1 candidate increasingly accumulates probability mass and suppresses that of other candidates. More importantly, stronger over-concentration correlates with worse pass@K performance. Inspired by this finding, we propose Simple Pass@K Optimization (SimKO), a method designed to mitigate the over-concentration issue, thereby encouraging exploration. SimKO operates in an asymmetrical manner. For verified-correct responses, it boosts the probabilities of the top-K candidates. For verified-incorrect responses, it applies stronger penalties to the top-1 candidate. We observe that this asymmetric design is particularly effective at mitigating over-concentration when applied at tokens with high entropy. Across various math and logical-reasoning benchmarks, SimKO consistently yields higher pass@K for a wide range of K, providing a simple way to improve RLVR's exploration.

  Large Language Model (LLM) agents are powering a growing share of interactive web applications, yet remain vulnerable to misuse and harm. Prior jailbreak research has largely focused on single-turn prompts, whereas real harassment often unfolds over multi-turn interactions. In this work, we present the Online Harassment Agentic Benchmark consisting of: (i) a synthetic multi-turn harassment conversation dataset, (ii) a multi-agent (e.g., harasser, victim) simulation informed by repeated game theory, (iii) three jailbreak methods attacking agents across memory, planning, and fine-tuning, and (iv) a mixed-methods evaluation framework. We utilize two prominent LLMs, LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct (open-source) and Gemini-2.0-flash (closed-source). Our results show that jailbreak tuning makes harassment nearly guaranteed with an attack success rate of 95.78--96.89% vs. 57.25--64.19% without tuning in Llama, and 99.33% vs. 98.46% without tuning in Gemini, while sharply reducing refusal rate to 1-2% in both models. The most prevalent toxic behaviors are Insult with 84.9--87.8% vs. 44.2--50.8% without tuning, and Flaming with 81.2--85.1% vs. 31.5--38.8% without tuning, indicating weaker guardrails compared to sensitive categories such as sexual or racial harassment. Qualitative evaluation further reveals that attacked agents reproduce human-like aggression profiles, such as Machiavellian/psychopathic patterns under planning, and narcissistic tendencies with memory. Counterintuitively, closed-source and open-source models exhibit distinct escalation trajectories across turns, with closed-source models showing significant vulnerability. Overall, our findings show that multi-turn and theory-grounded attacks not only succeed at high rates but also mimic human-like harassment dynamics, motivating the development of robust safety guardrails to ultimately keep online platforms safe and responsible.

  Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in various domains, showing impressive potential on different tasks. Recently, reasoning LLMs have been proposed to improve the \textit{reasoning} or \textit{thinking} capabilities of LLMs to solve complex problems. Despite the promising results of reasoning LLMs, enhancing the multi-step reasoning capabilities of LLMs still remains a significant challenge. While existing optimization methods have advanced the LLM reasoning capabilities, they often treat reasoning trajectories as a whole, without considering the underlying critical steps within the trajectory. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{G}uided \textbf{P}ivotal \textbf{O}ptimization (GPO), a novel fine-tuning strategy that dives into the reasoning process to enable more effective improvements. GPO first identifies the `critical step' within a reasoning trajectory - a point that the model must carefully proceed to succeed at the problem. We locate the critical step by estimating the advantage function. GPO then resets the policy to the critical step, samples the new rollout and prioritizes the learning process on those rollouts. This focus allows the model to learn more effectively from pivotal moments within the reasoning process to improve the reasoning performance. We demonstrate that GPO is a general strategy that can be integrated with various optimization methods to improve reasoning performance. Besides theoretical analysis, our experiments across challenging reasoning benchmarks show that GPO can consistently and significantly enhance the performance of existing optimization methods, showcasing its effectiveness and generalizability in improving LLM reasoning by concentrating on pivotal moments within the generation process.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in automated code generation but frequently produce code that fails formal verification, an essential requirement for hardware and safety-critical domains. To overcome this fundamental limitation, we previously proposed PREFACE, a model-agnostic framework based on reinforcement learning (RL) that iteratively repairs the prompts provided to frozen LLMs, systematically steering them toward generating formally verifiable Dafny code without costly fine-tuning. This work presents Proof2Silicon, a novel end-to-end synthesis framework that embeds the previously proposed PREFACE flow to enable the generation of correctness-by-construction hardware directly from natural language specifications. Proof2Silicon operates by: (1) leveraging PREFACE's verifier-driven RL agent to optimize prompt generation iteratively, ensuring Dafny code correctness; (2) automatically translating verified Dafny programs into synthesizable high-level C using Dafny's Python backend and PyLog; and (3) employing Vivado HLS to produce RTL implementations. Evaluated rigorously on a challenging 100-task benchmark, PREFACE's RL-guided prompt optimization consistently improved Dafny verification success rates across diverse LLMs by up to 21%. Crucially, Proof2Silicon achieved an end-to-end hardware synthesis success rate of up to 72%, generating RTL designs through Vivado HLS synthesis flows. These results demonstrate a robust, scalable, and automated pipeline for LLM-driven, formally verified hardware synthesis, bridging natural-language specification and silicon realization.

  We introduce ComputerRL, a framework for autonomous desktop intelligence that enables agents to operate complex digital workspaces skillfully. ComputerRL features the API-GUI paradigm, which unifies programmatic API calls and direct GUI interaction to address the inherent mismatch between machine agents and human-centric desktop environments. Scaling end-to-end RL training is crucial for improvement and generalization across diverse desktop tasks; however, it remains challenging due to environmental inefficiency and instability during extended training. To support scalable and robust training, we develop a distributed RL infrastructure capable of orchestrating thousands of parallel virtual desktop environments to accelerate large-scale online RL. Furthermore, we propose Entropulse, a training strategy that alternates reinforcement learning with supervised fine-tuning, effectively mitigating entropy collapse during extended training runs. We employ ComputerRL on open models GLM-4-9B-0414 and GLM-4.1V-9B-Thinking, and evaluate them on the OSWorld benchmark. The AutoGLM-OS-9B achieves a new state-of-the-art accuracy of 48.9%, demonstrating significant improvements for general agents in desktop automation. Our code and the new OfficeWorld benchmark are available atthis https URL. The algorithm and framework are adopted in building AutoGLM (Liu et al., 2024b).

  Uncovering hidden symbolic laws from time series data, as an aspiration dating back to Kepler's discovery of planetary motion, remains a core challenge in scientific discovery and artificial intelligence. While Large Language Models show promise in structured reasoning tasks, their ability to infer interpretable, context-aligned symbolic structures from time series data is still underexplored. To systematically evaluate this capability, we introduce SymbolBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to assess symbolic reasoning over real-world time series across three tasks: multivariate symbolic regression, Boolean network inference, and causal discovery. Unlike prior efforts limited to simple algebraic equations, SymbolBench spans a diverse set of symbolic forms with varying complexity. We further propose a unified framework that integrates LLMs with genetic programming to form a closed-loop symbolic reasoning system, where LLMs act both as predictors and evaluators. Our empirical results reveal key strengths and limitations of current models, highlighting the importance of combining domain knowledge, context alignment, and reasoning structure to improve LLMs in automated scientific discovery.

  Being able to cooperate with diverse humans is an important component of many economically valuable AI tasks, from household robotics to autonomous driving. However, generalizing to novel humans requires training on data that captures the diversity of human behaviors. Adversarial training is a promising method that allows dynamic data generation and ensures that agents are robust. It creates a feedback loop where the agent's performance influences the generation of new adversarial data, which can be used immediately to train the agent. However, adversarial training is difficult to apply in a cooperative task; how can we train an adversarial cooperator? We propose a novel strategy that combines a pretrained generative model to simulate valid cooperative agent policies with adversarial training to maximize regret. We call our method GOAT: Generative Online Adversarial Training. In this framework, the GOAT dynamically searches the latent space of the generative model for coordination strategies where the learning policy, the Cooperator agent, underperforms. GOAT enables better generalization by exposing the Cooperator to various challenging interaction scenarios. We maintain realistic coordination strategies by keeping the generative model frozen, thus avoiding adversarial exploitation. We evaluate GOAT with real human partners, and the results demonstrate state of the art performance on the Overcooked benchmark, highlighting its effectiveness in generalizing to diverse human behaviors.

  The decisions of individuals and organizations are often suboptimal because fully rational decision-making is too demanding in the real world. Recent work suggests that some errors can be prevented by leveraging artificial intelligence to discover and teach clever heuristics. So far, this line of research has been limited to simplified, artificial decision-making tasks. This article is the first to extend this approach to a real-world decision problem, namely, executives deciding which project their organization should launch next. We develop a computational method (MGPS) that automatically discovers project selection strategies that are optimized for real people, and we develop an intelligent tutor that teaches the discovered project selection procedures. We evaluated MGPS on a computational benchmark and tested the intelligent tutor in a training experiment with two control conditions. MGPS outperformed a state-of-the-art method and was more computationally efficient. Moreover, people who practiced with our intelligent tutor learned significantly better project selection strategies than the control groups. These findings suggest that AI could be used to automate the process of discovering and formalizing the cognitive strategies taught by intelligent tutoring systems.
